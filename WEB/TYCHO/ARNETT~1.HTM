      I have written a number of WWW documents on various topics, mostly having to
      do with astronomy.
      Brief descriptions of each can be found on my

       This "home page" has been copied around the Net quite a bit.

  <dt><strong>Feedback</strong>:<dd>
       I would like to hear from you, especially if you have discovered a mistake
       in one of my pages.  To send me email just click

<p>
  <dt><strong>Kudos</strong>:<dd>
      My pages have elicited a lot of nice comments and "awards".
      I've collected them together in a sort of
      <a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/tbp/vanity.html">virtual trophy case</a>.

      You won't find anything even remotely indecent or objectionable
      in any of my pages
      (I've even been blessed by one of the WWW rating services).
      Nevertheless, I feel that the recent legislation passed by the US Congress which 
      imposes severe penalties for posting some kinds of material on the Net
      is seriously flawed.
      Further information on this topic is available from

      (D-Vt) has introduced a bill (S. 1567) to repeal that legislation.
      I urge you to read and consider these carefully
      and remember Thomas Jefferson's words:
      <blockquote>
      "A society that will trade a little liberty for a little order will lose both,
      and deserve neither."

  <dt><strong>Background</strong>:<dd>
      By training and profession, I'm a software engineer.
      But I've tried over the years to learn a little about a lot of things.
      I sometimes envy the great men of the Renaissance and the
      Enlightenment who had a very real possibility of learning a large
      fraction of all human knowledge.  But then I think of all we have
      achieved since then and I know I have the better deal.
<p>      
  <dt><strong>Motto</strong>:<dd> "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
<p>      
  <dt><strong>Interests</strong>:<dd>
       Astronomy,
       the History and Philosophy of Science,
       Classical Music,
       the Internet, and
       all things Macintosh.

  <dt><strong>Favorite quotes</strong>:<dd>
      "I know that I am mortal and the creature of a day; but when I search
      out the massed wheeling circles of the stars, my feet no longer touch
      the earth, but, side by side with Zeus himself, I take my fill of
      ambrosia, the food of the gods." -- Claudius Ptolemaeus
