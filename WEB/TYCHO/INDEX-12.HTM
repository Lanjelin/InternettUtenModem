<h2> What I do:</h2>
 Currently most of my time is spent on university courses BUT whenever I find the time
I work on a recently started project on the determination of
rotation periods of asteroides. The project which I do together with <A HREF="index-6.html" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~cmik/index.html">Christian Mikkelsen</A>
and <A HREF="index-7.html" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~pontop/index.html">Klaus Pontoppidan</A> is planned to last one year under the supervision of
Hans-Jørn Fogh Olsen (<A HREF="INDEX-2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/">CUO</A>). We intend to obtain lighcurves of 
several asteroides which together with the rotationsperiodes might provide
us with some usefull information about the form and structure of these heavenly bodies.
It would be especially interesting to know wether asteroides generally are
big well defined pieces of solid rock or if there are rather loosely bound piles
of rubble. Using a CCD (Charged Coupled Device) as a detector we will be
able to observe very faint asteroides (~18 mag.). Right now (winter 96) we are in the
phase of obtaining observations. This is done with <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~michael/telescope/schmidt.html">The Brorfelde Schmidt Telescope </A>. In December 95 we made some observations of the asteroide
(122) Gerda. It turned out that this asteroide had a very nice and well defined
 <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tgreve/Lightcurve.html">lightcurve</A> - allthough we didn't observe a complete periode we were able to estimate a
lower value of about 12 hours. For further details see our first project report:

af lyskurve for asteroiden (122)Gerda"</A> or the <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tgreve/status.html">current status of the project.</A>

<br>
   The project also involves a further developement of a simple astronomical
datareduction program <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tgreve/ADADIPS.html"> ADADIPS </A> which <A HREF="index-7.html" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~pontop/index.html"> Klaus </A> and I initially made for our first year
project. The program is made in <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS19.HTM#1935" tppabs="http://www.rsinc.com/">IDL (Interactive Data Language)</A> which is very
powerfull in visualizing data. We intend to do an overall improvement of the program and especially
we would like to automize the callibration of frames and the collection of data. This
would not only shorten the 'trivial' data reduction time considerably but also 
increase accuracy and reproducibillity. Of course it should still be possible to
do the reductions manually. We also plan to implement an astrometry package
which will make a perfect allignment of frames possible. This is necessary
for identification of faint moving objects i.e faint asteroides. And finally
we will ad a number of more powerfull and sophisticated reduction tools - but
this is still rather schetchy... but here is <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tgreve/ADADIPS.html">the current state of ADADIPS </A>
