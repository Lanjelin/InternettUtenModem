The Livng Sea celebrates the world ocean - its beauty, diversity and importance to life on earth. Filmed in locations around the world, The Livng Sea also explores our relationship with the complex an fragile environment. 
The ocean covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface, with an average depth of two miles.<p>
The audience feel the power of the ocean as they surf thundering waves in Hawaii and ride a Coast Guard Rescue boat with cadets training to save lives at Cape Disappointment, home to some of the roughest surfs in the world. We come face-to-face with whales, and swim among thousands of golden jellyfish.
Featuring music by Sting.
