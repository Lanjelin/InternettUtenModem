<h2>History of the Observatory</h2>
<h3>&Oslash;stervold department</h3>

&Oslash;stervold. 
<dt>
<p> <font size="3">The Copenhagen University Observatory on
&Oslash;stervold was erected in the years 1859-1861 to accomodate the
need for new buildings in which to place the University Observatory.
Round Tower (Rundet&aring;rn) which had hosted the old University
Observatory from 1642 to 1861, had become too small and partly also too
unstable due to heavy traffic in K&oslash;bmagergade below.  <p>

<dt>
<p>
The Observatory had several astronomical instruments:<p>
<dd><img src="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/ticks/orangeball.gif%20alt=" * "> A meridian circle in the west wing.
<dd><img src="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/ticks/orangeball.gif%20alt=" * "> A passage instrument in the east wing.
<dd><img src="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/ticks/orangeball.gif%20alt=" * "> Several pendulum clocks in the basement.
<dd><img src="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/ticks/orangeball.gif%20alt=" * "> A dome with a 0.28m refractor for visual observations and a 0.2m photographic refractor.
<dd><img src="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/ticks/orangeball.gif%20alt=" * "> A small magnetic observatory in the Garden House with earthmagnetic instruments.
<p>
The westmost part of the building was the Professor's Residence and the 
eastmost part was home to the Observer.
<p> 
Today the 0.25m refractor is the only remaining part of the old instruments.
A new instrument has been purchased in order to serve as a tool for student exercises - the <a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~michael/nest.html"> NeST</a> telescope, a 0.25m reflector of modern design and a small CCD detector.
<dt>
The different rooms in the building now serve as offices to the astronomers
and the students and as library, lecture rooms and computer rooms.

<h3>Brorfelde department</h3>
<img align=middle src="BRO.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/bro.gif"><p>
The department in Brorfelde was inaugurated in 1953 and consists of the
main building with offices and electro-optical workshops, a large
mechanical workshop and five guesthouses + several astronomical
instruments.
<p>
The  astronomical instruments here are:

<h3>The joint future</h3>
The life of the University Observatory is now at a dividing line. The
Observatory departments will merge and move to the
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/rockefeller.html">Rockefeller Building</a>
together with some of the other departments. This is done in order to
create a more cooperative and effective environment between the
different parts of physics and astronomy in Denmark.

<dt>

It is the first time in the history of the Observatory that it will be housed in buildings without the possibility for observations.
<p>
The future of <a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~michael/nest.html">NeST</a> is uncertain.
