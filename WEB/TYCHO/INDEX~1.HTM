<h3>Chasing the Partial Solar Eclipse</h3>

<p>On Saturday October 12th a quite rare phenomenon will occur; a
partial solar eclipse. This eclipse will be visible from Northern
Canada, all Europe and Northern Africa.</p> <img
src="S-COLL~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/images/s-coll-solecl.gif" align="left"
     width="115" height="159" alt="" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5">

<p>A solar eclipse takes place when the Moon, during its revolution
around the Earth, happens to be positioned between the Earth and the
Sun. When seen from certain regions on the Earth, it covers (part of)
the solar disc. Such events occur at New Moon, but not at every New
Moon - most often the Moon passes too far above or below the
(imaginary) line that connects the Sun with Earth.</p>

<p>A solar eclipse is <b>total</b> if there are regions where the
Moon's shadow hits the Earth's surface. There, the Moon's disc is seen
to cover completely that of the Sun and for some minutes the sky
becomes dark during daytime. At a site outside this region, the Moon
will not cover the Sun entirely and the daylight will only dim a
little.</p>

<p>A solar eclipse is said to be <b>partial</b>, when the Moon's
shadow just misses the Earth. In this case, there are no regions from
where the Sun will be completely covered.</p>

<p>A third possibility is an <b>annular</b> (ring-shaped)
eclipse. This happens when the Moon is comparatively far from the
Earth (the Moon's orbit is elliptical) and the Moon's shadow does not
reach all the way to the surface of the Earth. In those regions that
are situated beyond the end of the shadow cone, the edge of the Sun's
disc can be seen around that of the Moon; hence the name of this type
of eclipse.</p>

<p>The solar eclipse on October 12, 1996, belongs to the second
category and is <b>partial.</b> Thus, there will be no places on Earth
where the sunlight will disappear entirely. Nevertheless, this event
is a very impressive spectacle, as the Moon's disc is seen to move
gradually across that of the Sun.</p>

<p>We suggest that interested <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> participants
should observe this phenomenon and, in particular, try to perform some
simple measurements indicated below. When combined, <b>these
measurements may allow us to give a reliable determination of the
distance and the size of the Moon</b>. This would probably be the
first time such a measurement is done by a concerted programme with so
many young participants!</p>

activities around this solar eclipse is now also available in <a

<h4>When will it happen?</h4>

<p>This partial solar eclipse will take place <b>2 - 4 hours after

<p>In Europe, 30 to 70 percent of the Sun will become eclipsed. This
means that the Moon's disc covers 30 to 70 percent of the total area of
the Sun's disc. You may find the percentage at your location from map
markings above. For instance, in Southern Germany and Northern France,
about 0.6 or 60 percent of the Sun will be covered, while it will be
somewhat less, about 40 percent, in Southern Spain. The further north
you are, the more of Sun will be eclipsed.</p>

<p>Occasionally, our Moon passes in front of our planet (Click on
image to get a larger version (GIF, 43k) and gives rise to a shadow.
On October 12, 1996, this shadow will rush across Northern Canada and
the European continent.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this eclipse is a forerunner of the <b>total
eclipse</b> that will take place on <A
HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#339" tppabs="http://www.skypub.com/eclipses/s990811a.html">August 11,
1999</A>. On this day, Europe will experience its first total eclipse
for 38 years. The Moon's shadow will rush across the southernmost part
of the United Kingdom and cross France, Germany, Austria, Hungary,
Romania, the Black Sea, Turkey, and onwards into Asia.</p>

<p>The European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE) is planning
to set up a comprehensive programme for observation of the 1999
eclipse. The present observations, three years earlier, will help to
do this in the best possible way.</p>

<h4>At what time will the 1996 partial eclipse occur?</h4>

<p>In Europe, the eclipse on October 12 will reach its maximum around
1600 - 1700 hours Central European Summer Time (CEST), depending on
where you live. More detailed information about when the maximum
occurs may be found in a <a
href="TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#340" tppabs="http://www.skypub.com/eclipses/s961012a.html">Sky & Telescope
Eclipse Article</a>. Note, however, that the times in this article are
given in Universal Time (UT). Since CEST = UT + 2 hours, most European
observers must add 2 hours to obtain the timing in CEST. (In earlier
years, the summer time period in Europe ended in late September; this
year, the period has been prolonged by one month.)</p>

Homepage: <a

Eclipse paths: 1995-2005"</a>.</p>

<h3>How do we observe such an eclipse?</h3>

<p>All observers, whether teachers, students, amateur or professional
astronomers, must remember <b>NEVER EVER TO LOOK THROUGH AN UNSHIELDED
TELESCOPE AIMED AT THE SUN!</b> The famous Italian scientist Galileo
unfortunately did so and became blind. With our present
high-transmission telescopes, eye damage will occur within less than a
second. The tremendous heating power of sunlight is easily
demonstrated using a magnifying lens (a burning glass).</p>

<p>There are however quite a few, easy and safe methods available by
which you can observe a solar eclipse without any risk.</p>

<h3>A simple and safe way to view the Sun</h3>

<p>Some of the very first cameras contained no lenses but were only
equipped with a pinhole.</p>

<center><img src="SOLECL4.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl4.gif"></center>

<p>Strictly speaking, this camera is nothing more than a black box
with one hole in the front.</p>

<a href="SOLECL~5.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl5-large.gif"><img src="SOLECL~3.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl5-small.gif" align="left"
     width="180" height="92" alt="" border="0" vspace="5"
hspace="5"></a>

<p>Light travels in straight lines and therefore rays from the Sun
will hit the back of the box and create a perfect image of the Sun's
disc. Click on the drawing above to get a larger image (GIF, 37k).</p>

<p>It is possible to use this black box as a general camera, not only
for photographing the Sun but also for taking ordinary
photographs. These black box cameras are easy to construct, but often
require long exposure times due to the small aperture.</p>

<p>This method was even used by French artists painting miniatures
during the 18th century. Could you imagine spending a whole day
painting miniature copies inside a warm black box like this?</p>

<a href="SOLECL~4.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl6-large.gif" ><img src="SOLECL~2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl6-small.gif" align="left"
     width="113" height="125" alt="" border="0" vspace="5"
hspace="5"></a>

<p>Originally the Pin Hole Camera was invented by an English monk,
<i>Roger Bacon (1220-1292)</i>; click on the image for a larger one
(GIF, 44k).  Roger Bacon's research was considered by his
contemporaries as being witchcraft and he spent half his life in
prison.</p>

<p>For our project, however, this camera is safe, legal and simple!</p>

<p>The Sun's image inside our box will undergo all the phases of the
eclipse, just like the real Sun. This method is safe and may even be
carried out by rather young children in groups.</p>

<p>Here are a few hints: <i>1. The light hole needs to be small in
order to get a sharp image - diameters around 1 mm are
sufficient. 2. The box must be about 0.6-1 metres long in order to get
a reasonably large image.</i><p>

<p>During the EAAE Conference at ESO in November 1994, the Spanish
Teachers presented nice results which were obtained with this Black
Box Method.  As a dark box, they had used huge cardboard tubes. Such 4
metre long tubes may be picked up, often for free, at storehouses
selling carpets.</p>

<p>The size of the Sun's image will be around 1 percent of the box
length. A 4 metre tube may thus give a very reasonable solar disc size
of about 4 cm.</p>

<a href="SOLECL~2.JPG" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl7-large.jpg" ><img src="SOLECL~1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl7-small.jpg" align="left"
     width="202" height="232" alt="" border="0" vspace="5"
hspace="5"></a>

<p>Do you know that this pinhole effect may also be seen in nature? A
leafy forest may absorb almost all the sunlight, only leaving a few
rays to pass through occasional holes.  The effect visible on the
ground will be like this:</p>

<p>If you want to see more details, click on the image, but beware
that it is quite large (JPG, 136 k) and the transfer may take some
time.</p>

<p>So during the October 12 eclipse you may observe <i>eclipsed solar
discs</i> scattered all around the forest floor.</p>

<p>During the month of October, these mini-Suns will have an
elliptical shape.  The Sun's disc is of course still circular, and the
elliptical shape is only an effect of the projection.  If sunlight
came from straight above ('Zenith'), the solar images projected on the
ground would all look perfectly circular. But in October, the Sun
never reaches Zenith in Europe, only in countries south of the Earth's
equator.</p>

<h3>How to observe the eclipse</h2>

There are several methods which may be used to observe the eclipse, in
addition to the one described above.</p>

<h4>Method 1.  The "Grinning Cat - Mirror Method"</H4>

A scientist at NASA Ames Research Centre (California, USA), <i>Joe
Jordan</i>, once wrote these comments : <i>`Hi -- One of the best ways
to observe a partial solar eclipse is nice and simple: just take a
mirror (like a standard square pocket mirror) and reflect the sun's
image onto a wall at least several meters away.  No poking holes or
cutting and pasting cardboard, etc.!  ..You'll notice that the
reflection looks inverted relative to the appearance of the eclipsed
sun in the sky.'</i></p>

<p>The mirror method is actually a very interesting variation of
Francis Bacon's 700-year old Pin Hole Camera.  Instead of letting the
sunlight pass through a small hole, this method reflects the light
back into, for example, a northern, shady classroom.</p>

<p>Besides being totally safe, this method works well when long
distances are used.</p>

<p>A small dentist's mirror, placed about 10 metres away, results in a
solar image which is approximately 10 cm in diameter.  A larger mirror
may still be used, if you cover unused parts with tape or paper.</p>

<h4>Method 2 :  Using Binoculars like a slide projector</h4>

<center><img src="SOLECL8.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl8.gif"></center>

<p>This binocular method will also give remarkable results. You can see on the figure how it works.</p>

<p>Once again: Do remember and explain to your friends that they
<b>MUST NEVER AIM AN UNSHIELDED SCOPE DIRECTLY AT THE SUN ! AND DON'T
LEAVE THE TELESCOPE UNATTENDED!</b></p>

<h4>Method 3.  Watching the Sun through Negative Film, Welding Glasses
and Filters</h4>

<p>This method is often described in books and magazines, but is still
dangerous for several reasons. Read this carefully:</p>

<p>Many years ago, film plates used silver nitrate. An over-exposed
film plate would thus provide an effective metallic shield, similar to
the shields used by astronauts in space in front of their helmets.</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, most plastic films are made of other materials
and do not give any protection against solar infrared rays.  The same
problem occurs with unauthorised welding glasses.</p>

<P>In Sky & Telescope (July 1991, page 80), you will find these
comments: <i>One filter entirely safe for direct solar viewing is a
shade 14 rectangular welder's glass.  It transmits only 1 part in
370,000 of the incident light and meets strict tolerances on
transmission of invisible infrared and ultraviolet as well. This costs
only a few dollars, but be sure you get the right item.</i>

<p>If you have a good school telescope, be sure to buy a proper
optical solar filter. Mounted correctly in front of a telescope this
will give a most impressive picture.  Several brands are available and
prices vary from about 8 ECU's and upwards.</p>

<p>Plastic Mylar filters are cheapest, but seem to be extremely
fragile and some only transmit a strange, blue colour. Glass filters
are available too, with prices around 30 ECU. These transmit nice
colours and beautiful photographs are possible.</p>

<p>For details of where to buy, take a look and compare prices in
astronomical magazines such as Astronomy or Sky & Telescope.</p>

<P>Warning : <b>Never use ordinary sun glasses</b> in front of your
telescope. Some of these cheap filter glasses have 100% transmission
in the invisible infrared, again exposing your eye to lifelong
damage.</p>

<p>Some companies sell solar filters designed to be mounted as an
eyepiece.  Avoid these products! One of our students once mounted such
an eyepiece solar filter in his telescope. He aimed his instrument
directly at the Sun. 40 seconds of sunlight were enough and this
eyepiece cracked into pieces! A bad investment!</p>

<h3>What To Report</h3>

<p>If you decide to participate in this collaborative project within
the <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> programme, you will want to know how to
perform the observations in such a way that they become useful for the
project.</p>

<p>You may choose between two different methods. One is the
2-dimensional method described below and for which the <a
href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl-2d.html"><b>mathematical concepts</b></a> are available
on a separate page. The other is the <a
href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl-3d.html"><b>3-dimensional method</b></a>, which is
somewhat more demanding.</p>

<p>Both methods have their positive and negative sides - which model
you choose is up to you. However, by evaluating these different
working methods, we may achieve valuable experience for the best
possible planning of the student observations which will take place in
connection with the 1999 total eclipse in Europe.</p>

<h4>The 2-dimensional method</h4>

<p><b>If you choose to use the 2-dimensional method for the partial
eclipse on October 12, 1996, you should follow the eclipse as long as
practically feasible. Make continuous measurements of both the Width
<i>W</i> and the Height <i>H</i>, as these are indicated in the figure
below:</b><p>

<center><img src="SOLECL9.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl9.gif"></center>

<p><b>Write these values as well as the time down, say every 5
minutes. While doing so, calculate the fraction of <I>H/W</I> and make
a graph of <I>H/W</I> (y-axis) versus time (x-axis).</b></p>

<p>On this graph, <b>estimate the lowest possible
<I>H/W</I>-value.</b> It occurs at the time of the eclipse
maximum. Then determine the time of the maximum as accurately, as you
can.</p>

paper before you start.</i></p>
