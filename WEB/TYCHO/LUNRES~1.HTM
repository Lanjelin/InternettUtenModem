<h3>After the eclipse</h3>

<p>This text incorporates the results from observations of the Lunar
Eclipse on September 27, 1996, by <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> Groups.

and navigation on the seas. Before you start reading, it is strongly
recommended that you read the <a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/luneclipse/luneclipse.html"></b>general
text about lunar eclipses</b></a>, which was prepared before the
eclipse took place.</p>

<P>This collaborative project within the <b>Astronomy On-Line</b>
Programme is concerned with the observation of a <b>Total Lunar
Eclipse</b>, which took place when the Moon entered the Earth's shadow
on that date.  During this event, less sunlight reached the Moon and
its appearance changed. During a <b>Total Lunar Eclipse</b>, the Moon
is entirely inside the Earth's shadow; during a <b>Partial Lunar
Eclipse</b>, only part of the Moon is inside.</p>

<p>A Lunar Eclipse always happens at the time of full moon, when the
Sun, Earth and Moon are (nearly) aligned.</p>

<p>The following text contains a review of the Astronomy On Line
observations reported by <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> Groups.  In
addition, it tells you how you may determine the longitude difference
between Europe and America by means of these observations!</p>

<H3>The eclipse</H3>

<p>This is a diagram that shows how the Moon passed through the
Earth's shadow on September 27.</p>

<p>Here, the time is indicated in Universal Time (UT), which is equal
to British Winter Time. If you were located in another timezone, you
must correct for the time difference in order to know the local time
of the eclipse. For instance, for observers in Central Europe which
still used Central European Summer (Daylight Saving) Time (UT + 2
hours), the Moon left totality at 05 hours 29.4 minutes CEST.</p>

<p>Many observers commented on the beautiful sight of the planet
Saturn which was located near the eclipsed Moon.</p>

<h3>Where was the eclipse visible?</h3>

<p> <B>Lunar Eclipses are global events</B> which can be observed from
many geographical regions on the Earth. Unfortunately, quite a few
European countries did suffer from clouded sky, but here is a review
of some of the reports from those who were not clouded out:</p>

<p><i>The Copper-red Moon looked like a Billiard Sphere made of Ivory
- lit by natural fire from one side.</i> (Gabor S.-Nagy, Budapest,
Hungary).</p>

<center><IMG SRC="LUNECLAC.JPG" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/luneclipse/luneclac.jpg"><br><br><i>The Sept.1997 Lunar Eclipse, as
registered by Antonio Cidadao, AOL Portugal.</i></br></p></center>

<p><i>Our students expressed having had an experience for lifetime</i>
(Henry Noergaard, Noerre Gymnasium, Copenhagen, Denmark).</p>

<p><i>The Eclipse was sensational over Santiago, with clear sky and a
perfect sight</i> (Astronomy On-Line Chile, Jorge and Rodrigo).</p>

<p><i>A wonderful quiet night, the grashoppers were singing, while the
dark-red moon was hanging slightly above the planet Saturn.</i> (Bent
Klarmark, Kettinge Youth School, Denmark).</p>

<p><i>The night was wonderful, the sky was clear and the
constellations were finely visible. This eclipse has both intrigued
and fascinated us.</i> (Apollo Group, Bellinzona, Switzerland.).</p>


<p>While observers in Europe had to stay up into the late night in
order to observe this eclipse, Stig Linander from Seattle, as well as
the California Lower Lake High School had a most comfortable evening
view. Stig writes to <b>Astronomy On-Line</b>:</p>

<p><i>The Moon was already totally eclipsed during sunset - 19 hours
19 min local time.  While rising, it gave a strange ghostlike light
above the impressive Cascade Mountains.  Followed it until the end -
Earth atmosphere absorption seemed to be low - this was the brightest
eclipse I have ever seen</i>.</p>

<p>The accurate eclipse data from Lower Lake High School are given
together with other European data at the end of this text.</p>

<p>More student images may be found, for instance at the</p>

<p>Norwegian <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> site. These are marvellous
eclipse photos, taken by the the students at the Norwegian Highschool
`Tromsdalen Gymnasium'. <a

<p>You may also like to inspect the fine results by a Danish student,
now available the Danish Astronomy On-Line site. She was able to
determine the distance to the Moon by means of the method described in
an article by Dennis di Cicco (Sky and Telescope, Dec. 1992, p.704). <a

<p> Below, we take a closer look at some of the obtained <b>Astronomy
On-Line</b> data. In particular, we will apply these data in order to
estimate the longitude difference between Europe and the American
continent.</p>

<h3>A Math Exercise related to data obtained during this Lunar Eclipse.</h3>

<p>A number of <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> Groups had good sky conditions
which allowed both a determination of the time at the start of
totality and also for <a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/luneclipse/locnoon.html"><b>`Local Noon'</b></a>,
that is when the Sun is seen in the direction of South).

<p>Here follow some of the reported observations, sorted by
geographical longitude.  A few of these timings may suffer from minor
time offsets (if the watch was not entirely correct). However, if they
were measured with the same watch, <b>the time DIFFERENCE between
eclipse and local noon </b>will be correct.

<p></p>

<p><a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/information/participants/se/se-0009.html"><b>Quiet

<p>-----------</p>

<p>The timings indicated above tell the time, when the last spot on
the Moon that was directly illuminated by the Sun, suddenly
disappeared.</p>

<h3>Comparing data obtained within Europe</h3>

<p>Two groups made particular careful measurements of both eclipse
timings, and the local noon:

<p>The Danish Soroe Group observed at longitude 11 Deg, 33' East, and
their measured time interval between local noon and begin of total
eclipse was : <b>15 hours 12 minutes.</b></p>

<p>Club Astro in France observed at longitude 6 Deg 28' East:
 - and measured a time difference of <b>14 hours 50 minutes.</b></p>

<p>So, the interval between local noon and the eclipse was <b>22
minutes</b> longer for the group in Denmark than for the group in
France.</p>

<p>Remember that 24 hours timing difference correspond to a longitude
difference of 360 Deg.</p>

<p><i>Try this exercise: Show that this Danish-French Time difference
corresponds to 5,5 Deg.  Compare with actual geographical
position. Show that the observed East-West error is about half a
degree.</p>

<p>Close to Equator, half a degree in longitude would correspond to an
error of approximately 60 km only! Verify this!  At the 
latitude of the Danish and French observers, the error is even
less!</i></p>

<h3>Combining measurements from America and Europe</h3>

<p>In Stockholm, the data obtained by the Swedish group, indicated
above, show the total lunar eclipse begins 15 hours 40 minutes after
Local Noon.</p>

<p>In California, the total eclipse begins approximately 6 hours 17
minutes after Local Noon.</p>

<p>Thus there is a clear timing difference of <b>15h 40m - 6h 17 m = 9h
23m</b>.

<p><i>Here is another exercise: When 24 hours correspond to a longitude
difference of 360 degrees, show that this timing difference equals
about 140 Deg in geographical longitude.  Compare the longitudes
indicated for the sites of the observers above and also with your map.
Discuss, how you could estimate the size of our Globe.</i></p>


<h3>Navigation and the longitude problem</h3>

<p> You have of course noted that, in the data above, there is a clear
relation between longitude position and eclipse timings.  In addition,
the involved <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> Groups have actually repeated
the Columbus/Plinius experiment, see the <a
href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/luneclipse/luneclipse.html"></b>general text about lunar eclipses</b></a>,
enabling rather precise estimates of longitude differences.</p>

<p>You are probably also aware that today all longitudes are compared
not to Sweden, not to Denmark or France, but to the longitude of the
old Greenwich Observatory, near London.</p>

<p> This September's lunar eclipse gave us the possibility of timing
our watches, of comparing time differences by means of the same
astronomical event.</p>

<p>However, these eclipses are relatively rare. There are typically
only about 50 lunar eclipses during a life-time.  Thus, lunar eclipses
were not frequent enough to provide large-scale mapping of the Earth
in old days. Another well-timed astronomical phenomenon, that could
also be observed at the same time (simultaneously) from many sites the
Earth, was needed for this.</p>

<p>For this reason, Galileo once suggested sailors should observe the
Moons of Jupiter, since these actually eclipse each other quite often
(this is referred to as <b>mutual events</b> by astronomers).  This
would be a quite useful method for the measurement of longitudes,
provided you had accurate tables of the times these moons were
eclipsed.</p>

<p>It was during the preparation of such tables for sailors that Ole
Roemer made his most significant discovery in 1676: the finite speed
of light. If you want to know more about this, try to read the article
in the <a
href="tppmsgs/msgs3.htm#345" tppabs="http://www.algonet.se/~sirius/eaae/newsl3/l3.htm"><b>EAAE
Newsletter #3</b></a>.</p>

<p>However, this particular method required a lot of skill, and was
practically useless on a ship rolling on a stormy ocean. So, sailors
needed another method of timing.  A most useful instrument was
invented by a British Watch Maker, James Harrison, in 1735.</p>

<center> <p><a href="HARRIS~2.JPG" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/luneclipse/harris-large.jpg"><IMG
SRC="HARRIS~1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/luneclipse/harris-small.jpg"></a><br><br> <i><p>Stamp celebrating the first
test of the Harrison Chronometer. Click to obtain larger version
(JPG,36k).</i></center>

<p> Harrisons invention, a <b>chronometer</b>, was a most precise
watch, which kept the time irrespective of the ship's movements and it
also worked in stormy conditions.</p>

<p> During a very stormy month-long voyage to Jamaica and back again
to London (it was reported that "even the Captain became seasick"), a
watch of this type was found to keep its original time to within an
error of only +/- 30 seconds!</p>

<p><i>Try this Math Exercise: 24 hours corresponds to the
circumference of the Earth, that is 40 000 km.  What distance error
would a timing error of +/- 30 seconds correspond to?</i></p>

<p>Now the British sailors had a most precise timing method, and they
 no longer needed any eclipses. In fact, Harrison's invention gave the
British Admiralty the best chances of determining local noons and
accurate longitudes.  The longitudes thus measured by Sir James Coook
in the second half of the 18th century resulted in the most precise
World Maps ever made.</p>

<p>This is the main reason why - still today - the longitude starts at
0 Deg in Greenwich, the observatory of the British Admiralty, outside
London.</p>

<h3>A Note about the Moon's colour</h3>

<p>As observed by many <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> participants, the
eclipsed Moon was not completely dark. They were able to see it all
the time during the eclipse.</p>

<p>Its colour was dark red like it is shown on the figure above. This
strange colour was the result of sunlight being refracted when it
passed through the Earth's upper atmosphere. Some of this light
reached the Moon. This was why the Moon was not completely dark, even
when it was completely inside the Earth's geometric shadow.</p>

<p>Before the 1960s, Lunar Eclipses were therefore also a valuable
means to investigate the conditions in the upper atmosphere of the
Earth. For instance, due to the injected high-altitude dust in the
Earth's atmopshere, the eclipsed Moon has a different colour during
years of heavy volcanic eruptions (Krakatau, Mount St. Helens, etc.),
when compared to years with less volcanic activity.</p>

<p>This year, the Moon was comparatively bright red, indicating that
there was comparatively little dust in the high layers of the Earth's
atmosphere. This may have changed later, however, due to the extensive
volcanic activity on Iceland in early October.</p>

unlucky to be clouded out!</b>. We hope that you also participate in
