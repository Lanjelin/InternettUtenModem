<H2>General Information </H2>

<P><BR>
The Journal club is a bunch of people (staff and students) from the Astronomical
Observatory who gets together every second friday to discuss a recently
published article or two. We speak danish, unless there are non-danish-speaking
persons present. Usually someone brings a cake. At the first meeting we
plan who are to speak on which dates. The speaker then finds an article
to discuss. The articles to be discussed at a given meeting can hopefully
be found here at least a week before the meeting is held. <BR>
