<center><h1>The history of 
Tycho Brahe Planetarium</center></h1>
The Planetarium was inaugurated on October 31, 1989, and opened on November 1, 1989.<p>
The financial basis for the Planetarium was founded in November 1983 when Bodil and Helge Pedersen made a donation of D.kr. 50 million for the construction of a planetarium in Copenhagen.<p>
The old saltstore building area in the center of Copenhagen and by the lake of Sct. J¢rgen was chosen as an ideal place for the Planetarium.
The saltstore building had earlier served as a music place, but the building was demolished and the foundation removed. Architect MAA Knud Munk's project was chosen, and the construction of the building was started in the autumn of 1987.<p>

The laying of the foundation stone took place on February 22, 1988. This date was not chosen by coincidence. Exactly on this day two planets, Mars and Uranus, were in a rare close conjunction, i.e. observed from the Earth they were very close to each other in the sky. The name of the planet Uranus
originates from "Uranos" - the Greek word for God of the sky. Therefore the foundation behind the Tycho Brahe Planetarium & Omnimaxtater is called the Urania Foundation.
The planet Mars played a major part in the astronomer Tycho Brahe's work with determination of positions - a work which became of great importance to the astronomy for many centuries.<p>.<center><img src="TBPHIST2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/tbp/gif/tbphist2.gif"></center><p>

The foundation stone, which was placed in the floor in the middle of the big cylinder building, bears the inscription:

22. February 1988. Tycho Brahe Planetarium. 2447214,37. Non Haberi Sed Esse.
This building has been founded by Bodil & Helge Pedersen for the purpose of encouraging the knowledge of and the understanding of the surrounding universe.
The long series of numbers is the so called Julian calender, which is used within astronomy because it is universal. The latin inscription means:
"Not to think, but to be" - The motto of Tycho Brahe.<p><center><img src="TBPHIST3.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/tbp/gif/tbphist3.gif"></center><p>
The ceremony of raising the rooftree was held on Friday, October 14, 1988. The highest point of the building - the oblique cylinder (with the space theater itself) had been reached.<p>
The highest point is about 38 metres above street level, similar to a 12 storied building.<p>
