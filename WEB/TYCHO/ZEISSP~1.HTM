Thanks to a totally new developed computer-controlled star projector, developed by Carl Zeiss Co. in Germany, you are able to lean back in comfortable seats and experience nebulae, shooting stars, supernovas, comets, eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, northern light, meteors and a lot of other phenomena. Usually all this is reserved for astronomers, working in isolated observatories on mountain tops - away from the city light.<p>
The construction of the starprojector had its world-premiere when Tycho Brahe Planetarium opened on October 31, 1989.<p>
The centre part of the projector is a "globe" consisting of 32 single projectors. It is possible to project all the stars which can be observed by the naked eye.<p>
The advanced computer technology gives you the optimal experience of light, film, pictures and sound. You wont be able to feel that you are indoors, but it will seem as if you were observing the real sky. You can also experience the night sky as it looked at the time of the dinosaures or how the sky is going to look like in a million years from now. The possibilities are unlimited, thanks to the advanced technology.<p>
To make the planetarium show more realistic it is also possible to show clouds, which gives the show a 3-dimensional effect when they drift across the starry sky. It is also possible to show different cloud formations to demonstrate weather phenomena.<p>

Besides from this cloudprojector we have a series of special projectors as for instance 20 image projectors, which can show 40 different images, Earth projector, satellite projector, digital showing of the year, etc.
<p>
You will be able to go on a journey out in space and for instance experience what the Earth looks like from the outermost known planet - Pluto - in the solar system.<p>
It is also possible to show the Moon's passing shadow on Earth during an eclipse of the Sun as well as man's "light polution" of the night sky. Of course all this requires an extremely complicated computer programme, which is very time-consuming to establish, but when the programmes have been input and stored, you can bring them out for use any time when needed. The possibilities are endless - like the Universe.
