    BAO Software Division </h2>

  BAO Software Division (abbreviated <i> BSD </i>), headed
by <a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~soeren">S&oslash;ren Larsen</a>, 
is responsible
for all software developments at BAO. One very important part of
the division's work is to maintain <i> OPERATE </i>, the user
interface of the BTCS (BAO Telesope Control System). Also, the division
is responsible for keeping the image reduction software up to date - 
quite a large task since we make practically all software ourselves.
The very first program developed by the division was <i> BAOphot </i>,
designed for the reduction of photoelectric photometry data from
the Brorfelde 25 cm telescope. 
The main programmes beeing maintained by BAO Software Division right now
are:

     <i> OPERATE </i> 
     <dd> As mentioned above, <i> OPERATE </i> is the
 interface to the telescope control system. The system is actually
 based on two personal computers but one of them, running a
 program called <i> BTCS </i>, is merely a "black
 box" from the user's point of view. For a long time it did not even
 have a screen, and only half of the keys on the keyboard worked.
 This didn't matter, however, because all you have to do from this
 PC is to start up the control software, using a script we called 'bb'
 (because 'b' happened to be one of the keys that worked!)
<p>
   The other PC is the one that actually runs <i> OPERATE </i>. From
 this PC you can control the motion of the telescope (i.e. pointing
 and tracking), the Lynxx CCD camera and the autoguider camera. All
 this can be done at the same time, and you can even do some simple
 image reductions too. We recommend that you see the

BAO Telescope control system</a> page.

<i> CCDIM </i> 
<dd> This was the first piece of image reduction
software from BSD. The development of it actually started before
we got our first CCD camera, but we wanted to be sure that
we could process the images right from the start, and commercially
avaliable software did not fullfill our critical requirements. 
<i> CCDIM </i> is a very specialized program in that it can only
handle images of the special format from the Lynxx camera (192 x 165
pixels). This is, admittedly, rather disadvantageous, but it means
at the same time that the program is very efficient for handling
that particular image format.
<p>

<dt> <img src="REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/Icons/redball.gif">
Other MS-DOS stuff 
<dd>  <i>CCDIM</i> is capable of doing rather
simple reductions only, so we have developed a number of utility programs
for cross-correlation of images, deconvolution, convertion between
different formats etc.
<p>

<dt> <img src="REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/Icons/redball.gif">
<i> <a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~soeren/baolab">BAOLab</a> </i> 
<dd> One of the future goals of BAO is to interchange the Lynxx PC
camera with a more efficient one. This requires, in turn, more
efficient image reduction facilities, running under a more
powerfull platform than MS-DOS. We have chosen 
<a href="tppmsgs/msgs19.htm#1950" tppabs="http://www.linux.org/"> Linux </a> for
this purpose, and right now BAO Software Division is working on
a program called <i> BAOLab </i> which is designed to run in the
Linux / X-Windows environment. <i> BAOLab </i> is pretty much inspired by
the IRAF package, but it is much simpler and it is completely
self-contained - no need to use other programs like <i> SAOImage </i>
for the display of images. Another advantage is that <i> BAOLab </i>
will be able to run on most UNIX systems - all you need to
compile it is a C-compiler (preferably gcc) and properly
installed X-libraries. The program is designed to require
as little hardware as possible, and even though <i> BAOLab </i> is able
to draw graphics on your screen, you can also use
it while sitting at a dumb VT-100 terminal, but with no graphics 
of course.

   BAO Hardware Division </h2>
Also known as <i> BAO Hardware Group </i>, this division is headed
by <b> Bjarne Lassen </b>. The division takes care of all kinds
of hardware installments to the observatory (except implementation
of new computer components which is done in cooperation between the hardware 
and software divisions).

     <i> Stepper motor TCS </i> 
     <dd> 
The first project of BAO Hardware Division was the construction of the 
<a href="TCS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~jacob/bao/tcs.html">
steppermotor controlled BTCS </a> - a vast step forward in the location
of faint objects. This system is based on two 4-phased steppermotors,
the one mounted on the Right Ascension axis having 800 steps / revolution,
and the declination motor having 400 steps / revolution. Both of the
motors are attached directly to the worm drives with no gears
in between - this makes it possible to use the stepper motors
for slewing the telescope with a rate of several degrees pr. second.
For tracking we use the so-called "micro-stepping" technique to
achieve a sufficiently smooth movement.

     <i> The BAG (Bjarne AutoGuider) </i>
<dd> Until recently, we had to guide our long exposures manually -
     a very tiresome job, and not always with the best results. It
     was therefore with very great expectations that we looked
     forward to the release of the BAG-camera (Bjarne AutoGuider)
     in early 1994. Unfortunately, the first version of the camera did
     not work very well, but during the summer the design was
     significantly improved and the autoguider is now very
     good.
<p>
<dt> <img src="REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/Icons/redball.gif">
     <i> The guideplatform </i>
<dd> Almost simultaneously with the development of the autoguider,
     a new <a href="INSTR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~jacob/bao/instr.html"> 
     guidetelescope </a> was implemented instead of the 60mm
     refractor we had previously been using. Along with a larger
     aperture (114 mm), the new guidescope also features a much
     better adjustment system, making it easy to find guidestars
     anywhere withing 3 degrees from the main object.
<p>
<dt> <img src="REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/Icons/redball.gif">
     <i> New equatorial mounting.</i>
<dd> Our next project is a new mounting for the telescope. The old
     one is not really capable of carrying all the things we have
     hung on it, and we have a lot of problems with mechanical
     flexure. 
<p>
<dt> <img src="REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/Icons/redball.gif">
     <i> New CCD camera.</i>
<dd> Our current CCD is a Lynxx PC camera, based on a Texas TC-211
     chip with only 192 x 165 pixels. This camera is rather old-fashioned
     now, so we hope that we will be able to get a new one in
     near future. The new camera should be based on a Kodak KAF-0400
     chip with 768 x 512 pixels, and much better noise characteristics.
