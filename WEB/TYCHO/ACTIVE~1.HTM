<center><h1>Other activities in Tycho Brahe Planetarium</center></h1>
The basement in the Planetarium contains, among other things, the large ventilation system which renews 40.000 m’ of air per hour.<p>
The first thing that our guests meet is the ticketsale in the foyer. Here you can also find a giftshop and an auditorium with room for approximately 45 people. Mechanical and electronical workshops, painting- and joiner's facilities are also placed on the groundfloor.<p>
Below the space theater we have a 380 m² exhibition area, called the Tycho Hall, displaying a permanent astronomy and spaceflight exhibition. Here you can also get a drink or a sandwich from the "Satellite Bar".<p>
Surrounding the Tycho Hall, the Archade offers changing
exhibitions of different themes.<p>
The only telescope in the Planetarium is a Heliostat, through which the Sun can be observed and displayed on a disc in the Archade.<p>
On the first floor you find the library offering information about astronomy and other related subjects to especially interested guests. The library is also used for meetings.<p>The management etc. is also placed on the first floor as well as <A href="CASSIO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/tbp/Cassiopeiaeng.html">Restaurant Cassiopeia</a>, mentioned elsewhere.
