I cannot guarantee that errors have not crept into the documents.  If errors
are found, I would appreciate knowing about them. Here are some general conditions
for use of this information.
<P>
Much of this material was produced while I was working for the U.S. Government,
during a 2 1/2 year technical exchange with Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Much of the material is in the public domain, but not all.  I have
used information from numerous sources and some of it is copyrighted. In
addition, I have used images from many different sources. Some of the
images are copyrighted.  Before you decide to use any of this material in a
publication, make sure it is in the public domain. Otherwise, you will
need to go through the process of obtaining proper permissions.
<P>
The material I produced as a U.S. Government employee may not be used to
state or imply the endorsement by the U.S. Government or by any U.S.
Government employee of a commercial product service or activity, or
used in any other manner that might mislead.
<P>

<H3>Images by Calvin J. Hamilton</H3>
I processed many of the images in this tour while
working for the U.S. Government. Most of these images are in the public domain.
Images which I have processed, and are in the public domain, will have a credit
line such as <I>(Credit: Calvin J. Hamilton)</I>. If you use these images,
please give me credit.

<H3>NASA/JPL and HST Images</H3>
Any NASA or JPL image can be freely used, but
please give them credit. Following are two statements by NASA and
one for Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images:

<LI>
No copyright is asserted for these images.  If a recognizable person
appears in an image, use for commercial purposes may infringe a right
of privacy or publicity.  These images may not be used to state or
imply the endorsement by NASA or by any NASA employee of a commercial
product, process or service, or used in any other manner that might
mislead.  Accordingly, it is requested that if these images are used
in advertising and other commercial promotion, layout and copy be
submitted to NASA prior to release.

<LI>
All of the images presented on NSSDC's Photo Gallery are in the public
domain. As such, they may be used for any purpose. NSSDC does ask,
however, that you acknowledge NSSDC as the supplier of the data. In
addition, where the source of the image (by project or as a specific
person) is credited in the text, you should also acknowledge that,
too.
<P>
<LI>
All of the HST images available via WWW and ftp may be used without
restriction as long as credit information accompanies the picture.
Credit usually includes the principal scientist responsible for the
data, AURA/STScI, NASA and/or ESA, the European Space Agency. Specific credit
information may be found in the captions accompanying the images as
plain text files. The captions are available via links from the Web
pages as well as separate files in the
<A HREF="tppmsgs/msgs11.htm#1136" tppabs="http://marvel.stsci.edu/ftp/stsci/epa/gif">gif directory</A> on
the ftp server.

<H3>Other Images</H3>
A few of the images come from
other sources; some of which are in the public domain, but
some have a copyright associated with them. In order to use these
images you will need to contact the author.
