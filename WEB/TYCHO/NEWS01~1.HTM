<h2>Latest News about the Lunar Eclipse on September 27</h2>

<p>Several <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> observers in Germany, parts of
France, and West-Denmark were clouded out, but here follow a few
reports from those who were not:</p>

<p><i>The Copper-red Moon looked like a Billiard Sphere made of Ivory
- lit by natural fire from one side.</i> (Gabor S.-Nagy, Budapest,
Hungary).</p>

<p><i>Our students expressed having had an experience for lifetime</i>
(Henry Noergaard, Noerre Gymnasium, Copenhagen, Denmark).</p>

<p><i>The Eclipse was sensational over Santiago, with clear sky and a
perfect sight</i> (Astronomy On-Line Chile, Jorge and Rodrigo).</p>

<p><i>A wonderful quiet night, the grashoppers were singing, while the
dark-red moon was hanging slightly above the planet Saturn.</i> (Bent
Klarmark, Kettinge Youth School, Denmark).</p>

<p>While observers in Europe had to stay up into the late night in
order to observe this eclipse, Stig Linander from Seattle had a most
comfortable evening view. Stig writes to <b>Astronomy On-Line</b>:</p>

<p><i>The Moon was already totally eclipsed during sunset - 1919 local
time.  While rising, it gave a strange ghostlike light above the
impressive Cascade Mountains.  Followed it until the end - Earth
atmosphere absorption seemed to be low - this was the brightest eclipse
I have ever seen</i>.</p>

<p>Several additional results - from Switzerland, Finland, France and
Denmark will be presented soon here on <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> -
together with student performed sextant measurements, drawings,
etc... Some measurements may even allow an estimate of the distance to
the Moon.  More details here on <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> shortly.</p>

<p>More reports, additional data - drawings etc. are most welcome!</p>

<p>At last, you should however not hesitate to visit the Norwegian
<b>Astronomy On-Line</b> site - here you may find some marvellous
eclipse photos, taken by the the students at the Norwegian Highschool
"Tromsdalen Gymnasium". <a

<p>So let us hope the solar eclipse on October 12 - and the weather -
will provide our eager observers with another experience that is just
as exciting!</p>


<p>Best greetings from the </p>
