<title> Annual report </title>
<H1> 
1. The <A HREF="INDEX-2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/"> Astronomical Observatory </A>
<p>
</H1>
<H2>
1.1 The <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~michael/dantel.html"> telescopes </A> of the Astronomical Observatory.
<p>
</H2>
The Astronomical Observatory operates a 1.54-m and a 50-cm telescope at the 
European Southern Observatory, ESO, La Silla, in Chile, a meridian circle on La Palma and also telescopes in Brorfelde. All of the telescopes
have run highly satisfactorily throughout 1994.

Throughout the entire period of time, the 50-cm telescope has been used for
Str&#246;mgren four-colour and H-beta photometry either in an 
observer-controlled or fully automatic mode. The observational data are  transferred to the Observatory using the data-network, the Internet, 
immediately after the observation on the night in question. In this way  
the data can be reduced immediately. This means that the telescope can be 
operated interactively. 
<p>
The 1.54-m telescope: The "<A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~per/dfosc/"> DFOSC </A>" instrument (Danish Faint Object 
Spectrograph and Camera) underwent a test on delivery, after which ESO will
offer the instrument for regular use. ESO will be responsible for the general 
maintenance of this instrument.
<p>
In 1994 a new Filter-And-Shutter Unit was constructed and built. This unit
makes it easy to change filter in front of the 
<A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~per/dfosc/"> DFOSC </A> instrument. In addition 
to this a new cooling unit for the 1.5-m telescope main mirror has been 
constructed and mounted, and thermal microturbulence is expected to be 
removed this way. Hereby it is expected that the telescope will produce 
even better images which means that even fainter astronomical objects will
be observable. A new Sky Baffle has been build which effectively removes
undesired scattered light when observing. Finally, a new type of cryostat
has been developed and built to cool a new, highly sensitive thinned CCD
with 2048x2048 pixels for the <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~per/dfosc/"> DFOSC </A> instrument.
<p>
In 1994 the 1.54-m telescope was primarily used with a CCD camera for direct
observations in selected spectral bands and also with the <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~per/dfosc/"> DFOSC </A> spectrograph
and the CORAVEL instrument for measurements of radial velocities.
<p>
The photoelectric 25-cm and 40-cm telescopes and the Schmidt telescope in 
Brorfelde were all running very well, and have been used in 1994. The Schmidt
telescope, which is equipped with a 1024x1024 CCD from NASA, has during the 
past year been of great scientific importance in several research projects 
running in parallel and has in addition been used for test observations 
with a camera using adaptive optics. This camera is being developed for 
use on the Nordic 2.5-m telescope, <A Href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2032" tppabs="http://nastol.astro.lu.se/Html/not.html%22"> NOT </A>, on La Palma. Finally a large number 
of student projects were carried out (Introductory Physics, Master and Ph.D.
projects).
<p>
The automated Carlsberg Meridian Circle has been in regular operation 
during the 
entire year of 1994. Observation were carried out in approximately 2800 hours
on 295 nights. Of the remaining 70 nights 52 were lost because of bad weather,
whereas only 18 were lost because of technical maintenance, problems with 
instrumentation etc. In December yet another spare computer was needed after a 
breakdown of the computer which controls the instrument.
<p>
<H2>
1.2 Cosmology and extragalactic astronomy.
<p>
</H2>
The Observatory witnessed in 1994 yet again a strong growth in research areas
related to the structure and evolution of the Universe, remote 
clusters of galaxies and also individual galaxies.
<p>
In the very early phase of the Universe - the inflationary phase - socalled
quantum fluctuations occur. These fluctuations, which at later epochs leads to
tiny variations in the matter density, are the seeds of galaxies and clusters
of galaxies, which are formed because of the gravitational interaction. They are
also responsible for the tiny fluctuations in the almost homogene cosmic 
background radiation. In general clusters of galaxies and individual 
galaxies contain much more mass than the mass which is related to the ordinary
baryonic mass which we know from our immediate surroundings. The physical 
nature of the main part of the matter in the Universe is thus unknown. One of the
possibilities is that the early quantum fluctuations resulted in primordial
black holes. If this is the case then it is possible to determine the physical 
conditions at this very early epoch and determine the distribution of mass associated
with the black holes. These studies were concluded in 1994.
<p>
A number of processes altered the spectrum of the initial fluctuations, because
of the formation of oscillations prior to the transition between ionised and
neutral matter (the recombination era). The traces of these oscillations are
to the found in the present distribution of the clusters of galaxies and 
especially in the small variations in the cosmic background radiation.
During 1994 special statistical filtering methods were developed, designed
to determine the ionisation history of the Universe. A underlying question 
in whether the Universe was re-ionised by the very powerful quasars. 
<p>
The Universe is not static. In fact it is expanding: the spectral lines of 
the galaxies are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum with 
an amount which is proportional to the distance to the galaxy. The redshift 
is here interpreted as a Doppler-effect caused by the receding motion of the 
galaxies. There is no convincing reason to doubt the validity of this 
interpretation of the measured redshifts. However, it is extremely difficult 
to prove that the Universe is actually expanding. According to the theory the   
brightness is expected to decrease stronger with redshift 
in an expanding Universe than in a static Universe. The tool needed to test
this is the "Fundamental Plane" - a relation between the surface brightness
of an elliptical galaxy and certain other properties of the elliptical galaxy.
The relation makes it possible to relate the measured surface brightness to
equal conditions. To do the test some 30 clusters of galaxies are observed
out to a redshift sufficiently large to determine the difference in 
surface brightness in an expanding Universe and the static Universe. 
The first observations - three relatively close clusters of galaxies - have
recently been carried out with the Danish 1.5-m telescope in ESO, La Silla.
<p>
Small variations in the intensity of the galaxies light distribution may in 
certain cases be caused by the presence of globular clusters. The 
identification of globular clusters have continued. 
<p>
Detailed investigations of selected clusters of galaxies, which contain large
amounts of hot gas (10 - 100 million degrees) have been continued. The hot gas
emits x-ray radiation and is thus slowly cooled. In some clusters of galaxies
the cooling time is less than the age of the cluster, and cold matter is 
"cooling out" on to the central dominant galaxy at a rate of up to more than 
500 solarmasses per year.The radiogalaxy Hydra A is such an example. The 
problem is what happens to the cooled-out gas: The mass of the cold gas 
phases is inadequate, as is normal star formation; the occurrence of young massive 
stars is generally low. Therefore it is normally assumed that the main fraction
of the mass is turned into low mass stars, but as these are extremely difficult to 
detect it is hard to verify the hypothesis. We find that the infrared radiation from Hydra A could be due to interstellar dust grains
that are heated and destroyed in the x-ray gas. A model that 
accounts for how dust can form in connection with starformation in the cooling
gas have been developed. The models explains the surprising occurrence of dust and indirectly shows
that stars are forming in the cooling x-ray gas. The observations have been 
made both with the Danish 1.5-m telescope and the ESO telescopes at the
La Silla observatory. Extensive observing programmes have in the course of the year
been planned for the european ISO satellite, which is expected to be launched 
in 1995.
<p>
As mentioned, the quasars probably play a considerable role in the evolution 
of the Universe. Quasars are not a homogeneous class of objects, and a large
amount of work has been done in classifying and correlating the properties of the 
different types. At the observatory a project aiming at a determination of the differences 
and similarities between spectral properties of radio-loud and radio-quiet 
quasars is carried out. To avoid a dependence on evolution and luminosity
in the properties of the emission lines, a dependence that has plagued 
earlier studies, the radio-quiet quasars have been selected carefully to 
ensure that these have similar redshifts and luminosities as the radio-loud
quasars, for which both optical and radio-data are available. The first 20
of a total of 70 objects have been observed using
the Danish 1.5-m telescope, ESO telescopes and the American multiple mirror
telescope.
<p>
The photometric monitoring of selected gravitationally lensed quasars with the 
Brorfelde Schmidt telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope have been continued
in an attempt to verify the previously measured time difference for the 
quasar DQS00957 and to obtain similar time differences for other candidates.
<p>
The enormous amounts of energy emitted by the quasars are usually thought to be
connected to the existence of a massive black hole in the center of the galaxy. The 
energy is emitted by matter which is attracted to the black hole and initially
form a hot rotating accretion disc around the black hole. To power this central
engine about 0.1 solar mass needs to be deposited per year. This is quite a lot - a fact that makes it hard to explain this phenomenon. Especially the capture 
of the stars and the interaction of the stars and the black hole have been 
studied detailed. The tidal interactions makes the star oscillate. When the star
in its elongated orbit passes the black hole, the amplitude of the 
oscillations will increase and the stars are disrupted. The matter then ends 
in the hot rotating disc. Furthermore hot rotating discs have been studied 
in general. A new general equation for the cooling has been derived and the 
maximum capture rate has been determined as a function of the viscosity of the 
disc.
<p>
In 1993 a search for supernovae in a precisely defined volume of the Universe
out to the distance of the Virgo cluster was initiated on the Brorfelde 
Schmidt telescope. The project was described in the last annual report. The 
telescope as well as the Danish weather is well suited for this project, since 
large variations in brightness are expected and because a supernova will be
visible in several months. Based on the experience from 1993 all galaxies 
observable from Brorfelde in the volume mentioned have been included. 
Almost 600 CCD exposures of 334 galaxies were made.
<p>
Detailed studies of binary stars in the two closest companion galaxies, 
the Magellanic clouds, are possible today, and can contribute with new
information about the evolution of massive stars. In addition to this, 
the distances of the companion galaxies are determined - this continues to be 
a strongly debated issue in the process of establishing the cosmological 
distance scale. Accurate data (masses, radii, temperatures, distances) for 
approximately 10 binary stars are aimed for. Results for 2 of these have been 
found, 3 are still being analyzed, and in 1994 CCD observations were made on 
yet a handful of candidates. In addition to this, ultraviolet spectra with 
the IUE satellite of essentially all the candidates were obtained. 
<p>
Finally, the phenomenon of cosmic gamma ray bursts should be mentioned, because
these probably originates in very distant extragalactic objects. Satellite 
observations show, that burst of gamma rays are received from space, 
normally lasting for seconds or minutes, in some cases a few hours. A burst is
roughly observed once a day, and the distribution on the sky is completely 
random. The reason for cosmic gamma ray bursts is still unknown and is today 
considered one of the big mysteries in modern astrophysics. Until now no gamma ray burst
source has been identified optically . Data from the Compton Observatory 
satellite has been used to show that two sources had the same position on the
sky. Supplementary optical observations were made with the Brorfelde Schmidt 
telescope. If the suggested repetition can be confirmed, the discovery will 
promote the understanding of the physical cause for this phenomenon.

1.3 The structure and evolution of the Milky Way
</H2>
<p>
The Milky Way is the prototype of a spiral galaxy. As is the case for 
other galaxies, it has developed from a primordial cloud of solely hydrogen-
and heliumgas into the complicated system of stars, gas and dust which we
observe today. During this evolution, all known elements were created by 
nuclear reactions in the stellar interiors, distributed into the interstellar
medium and partly recycled in the creation of new generations of stars. At the 
same time the distribution of the matter was altered to a thin disk with a
central bulge, surrounded by a depleted halo. Only in our own galaxy are we
able to identify the precise physical processes in this evolution through the 
imprints of the processes on the detailed chemical composition and motions of 
the stars that were created in the course of this evolution and the 
distribution of stars, gas and dust. These questions are the subject of a 
number of large and well coordinated investigations. 
<p>
One of the main goals is 
to obtain a complete knowledge of the ages, chemical compositions and space 
velocities for a complete and well defined sample of approximately  15.000
F, G and K dwarf stars over the entire sky within approximately 150 light 
years. The required observation have been made, and in 1994 the construction of the
database itself and entering of proper motions was initiated. Radial velocities  are
complete for a large fraction of the stars; the remaining stars are observed 
under an ESO programme of some 25.000 stars, which are also observed
by the HIPPARCOS-satellite (ESA). A detailed chemical analysis of appr. 200 
of the stars (publ. in 1993) showed the existence of a number of completely
new and interesting ways to attack the problem; these have been followed up
in 1994 with spectroscopic studies of strategically selected types of stars.
Another part of this investigation is a new cooperative project for identification
and investigation of stars with extremely low metallicity, from the very first
and as yet unexamined childhood of the galaxy. 
<p>
The ages and metallicities of F stars at greater distances (approx. 5000 light
years) are studied photometrically. The different 
stellar populations is now distinguishable in stars from 150 to 5000 light 
years, with ages between 2x10^9 years and 15x10^9 years and with a metallicity 
ranging from 0.001 to 3 times solar. The chemical composition of these stars 
is apparently changing drastically as close as approx. 2500 light years from the
Sun. A programme designed to search for very young stars in the halo has also 
been initiated. The main fraction of the mass of the MilkyWay is invisible and
may possibly consist of compact objects (MACHOs) with a mass which may cause a
measurable relativistic deflection of the light from a star which is farther
away, and seen in almost the same direction. The conditions for photometric and
simultaneously astrometrical measurements of MACHOs have been discussed 
theoretically. The center of the Milkyway contains a small, powerful radiosource,
which may be caused by a black hole with a mass of a million times the Sun. 
While this source is readily detected in radio observations, it is difficult to 
identify it at infrared wavelengths. An identification is very important in order
to understand the processes in the center. Therefore it is desirable to 
determine both the position of the radiosource and the positions of a number
of infrared sources with a precision better than 0.1 arc second. We have 
combined observations made with the meridian telescope on La Palma and CCD  
frames in the near infrared made with the 1.5-m telescope on La Silla. In this
way it was possible to establish a reference map of faint stars in the area 
around the center with an absolute precision of 0.06 ars seconds. To make
a certain identification we now need good radio observations. 
Finally the nearby interstellar clouds are studied by combining ultraviolet
data from the 'Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer' satellite with Str&#246;mgren photometry
from Chile. The most recent measurements show that the interstellar matter
in the vicinity of the Sun is not in pressure equilibrium and also can not
be considered as a homogeneous structure, which is of importance in order to 
understand the circulation of matter into stars and back to the instellar 
medium in the galaxy.

<H2>
1.4 The structure and evolution of the stars.
</H2>
<p>
The theory of stellar structure and evolution is a vital part of modern 
astrophysics: Not only does the stars by far make up the main part of the 
luminous mass in the Universe, they also create almost all of the 
of the elements heavier than helium in their interiors, and the theory forms the basis of almost all determinations of ages and in some cases 
also of distances in the Universe. Therefore it is of importance 
to continuously test if the best available evolutionary models are in agreement
with the most accurate observations of real stars. Two types of test objects 
are specially well suited for this: Binary stars, for which mass can be determined
accurately, and clusters of stars, in which the numerous members are stars with
the same age, but with different masses. 
<p>
Earlier comprehensive investigations have been continued and a number of young
binary stars with masses of 2 - 5 times the Sun (AR Aurigae, beta Aurigae, 
LZ Centauri, AG Persei, AO Velorum). An important result is that these stars,
which are very much younger than the Sun, all seem to have the same or lower
metallicity than the Sun. This is of significance in calculating 
evolutionary models and in comparing these with observations, confirming
a growing realization that models for the chemical evolution of the galaxy 
can not be based on the earlier assumption of a monotonically growing metallicity
with time.
<p>
Certain types  of stars are rare in well known binary systems, e.g. stars 
of one solar mass or less, and very young newly formed stars. A large photometric
search for binary stars like the Sun or cooler was initiated in 1994 and have 
resulted in the discovery of new systems. Detailed studies of 
a couple of very young binary stars have lead to whole new results about the
distribution and dynamics of such systems. Furthermore new and more accurate
methods for spectroscopy of such cool binary systems have been developed 
in order to obtain more accurate stellar masses and -radii, and also temperature,
chemical composition etc.
<p>
Clusters of stars are important in order to make a detailed control of stellar models. A controversy in the literature about the interpretation
of data for two open clusters have been resolved by systematic velocity 
measurements that showed "pollution" by field- and binary stars, after which some 
of the competing models were rejected.
<p>
Studies of pulsating variables have continued partly using asteroseismology, and
partly by analyzing lightcurves. Approx. 30 individual stars with observational data
taken from the literature have been examined in order to determine the periods
and identifying the pulsations. The most interesting case is a bright variable
in the globular cluster Omega Centauri. It has a period of 1.637 days and
is part of a small family of stars for whom the physical properties are not yet 
solved conclusively. To obtain modern and more accurate data extensive CCD 
observations have been prepared for the spring of 1995. These data will give 
both very precise light curves and pulsation periods, to be used in asteroseismology.

1.5 Plasmaphysics and magnetohydrodynamics
</H2>
<p>
Under the supervision of <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aake"> &Aring; Nordlund </A> supercomputer simulations and 
3D-visualizations on graphical workstations are performed. The general
aim is qualitatively to  understand turbulence and chaotic magnetic fields, 
with an emphasis on astrophysical relevance. Some of the concrete projects
are: Formation of structure on cosmological scales, supersonic mhd-turbulence
in cold molecular clouds with star formation, turbulence in accretion discs,
dynamo-effects in stars and accretion discs, turbulent convection and
excitation of solar and stellar pulsations, dissipation of turbulent magnetic fields
and spectralline formation in three dimensions.

1.6 Positional astronomy
</H2>
<p>
Determining the fundamental coordinate system, the small angular motions
of the stars (proper motions) on the sky, trigonometric distances (parallax) to
the stars is the primary task of astrometry. These data are of decisive 
importance for a number of astrophysical projects. 25 astrophysical projects
form the basis for the observations that are performed with the observatory's 
automatic Carlsberg Meridian Circle, CAMC, on La Palma. The members of the staff at the
observatory are PI (Principal Investigator) on 10 astrophysical projects in 
relation to the HIPPARCOS astrometric satellite. The astrometrical results are
used in the above mentioned astrophysical projects. In addition to this the 
following should be mentioned: 
In 1994 a new large project was initiated in cooperation with the Space 
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. 12.000 faint stars near equator
have been selected for observations with the CAMC.
With the help of these new precise reference star positions, it is planned to
re-reduce a number of the Schmidt plates, that are the foundation of the Hubble Space 
Telescope Guide Star Catalogue and hereby obtain a much improved accuracy. 
Carlsberg Meridian Catalogue Vol.8 has been finished, and it contains positions for   
18145 stars and 2143 observations of objects in the solar system. Again it 
has been possible to determine proper motions for a vast majority of these stars
(93 %), and the high precision have been maintained as before. 
<p>
ESA's astrometrical mission Hipparcos-Tycho have for three years until the
end of August 1993 measured positions, proper motions and distances for 
a million stars distributed over the entire sky with a much better accuracy
than possible from the surface of the Earth. The result will be of
fundamental importance for our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the 
MilkyWay and for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the stars.
The Danish group is part of an international cooperation which performs the
very demanding task of reducing the data. Analyses of the observations have
shown that the satellite will fulfill all expectations. A new  interferometry/astrometry mission has been approved as a key project in the 
planning of future ESA projects after the year 2000. The project is an astrometrical
and photometrical satellite which uses CCDs and an interferometric technique.
It will therefore be a million times more effective than the Hipparcos satellite.
It will be possible to measure 50 million stars with astrometric errors 
100 times smaller. In addition to this, the luminosity of the stars will be observed
in at least 5 colors, spanning from ultraviolet to infrared.

1.7 Instrumentation.
</H2>
<p>
Observational astrophysics depends on the best possible telescopes and 
observational <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~michael/daninst.html"> instruments </A>. At ESO Danish astronomers have access to the largest,
most modern and well equipped telescopes, whereas observational instruments 
have to be developed for the Nordic Optical Telescope, <A Href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2032" tppabs="http://nastol.astro.lu.se/Html/not.html%22"> NOT </A>,  and the Danish telescopes. Among these instruments
the priorities in 1994 were focused developing the largest and most sensitive 
detectors and the highest possible resolution. In 1994 a CCD camera developed
in Brorfelde was mounted on <A Href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2032" tppabs="http://nastol.astro.lu.se/Html/not.html%22"> NOT </A> with a 1048x1048 pixel detector. A camera 
with a 2048x2048 pixel CCD and an efficiency of nearly 90 % over a wide range
of wavelengths will be  ready for use on the Danish 1.5-m telescope in Chile in 
January 1995. More cameras will also be delivered in 1995. Furthermore, a cooperation
with the French EROS-group (Etude et Recherche d'Objets Sombres), which
is searching for dark matter in the Universe using the gravitational lensing
effect, has been started; cameras with a total of 16 of these large CCDs will be
built. In addition to this, ESO have signed a contract to test and optimize 
new CCD-detectors in the Brorfelde laboratory for use on La Silla. 
<p>
The highest image quality is obtained by cooling the main mirror of the 
telescope during the day to night temperature, and by performing a rapid correction
of the remaining image motions. A mirror cooling system for the 1.5-m 
telescope was developed and tested during 1994 and will be installed in 1995. A special small CCD-camera, which can perform image analysis with up 
to 0.006 seconds of time resolution, has also been developed. Tests at the <A Href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2032" tppabs="http://nastol.astro.lu.se/Html/not.html%22"> NOT </A>
shows that a very considerable improvement in the quality of the images 
(almost as the Hubble Space Telescope) can be obtained by correcting the 
image position approx. 50 times a second. Such a <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~mia/hirac"> HiRAC </A> (High Resolution Adaptive
Camera) is under construction and will be installed on <A Href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2032" tppabs="http://nastol.astro.lu.se/Html/not.html%22"> NOT </A> in 1995. The camera on 
the 1.5-m telescope is supplemented by an all-round wide angle instrument which
have caused much enthusiasm among colleagues (among others at the <A Href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2032" tppabs="http://nastol.astro.lu.se/Html/not.html%22"> NOT </A>) and an agreement
has been made to build more copies of the instrument. 
<p>
In connection with the automated Carlsberg Meridian Circle on La Palma a new
software system for collecting and storing the measured meteorological data
was developed and implemented. The system is based an a PC interfaced to 
the meteorological sensors and to the telescope control computer. Measurements are
made every 20 seconds and a mean is made over 15 measurements. In addition to 
this maximum and minimum values for the windspeed and -direction are determined
