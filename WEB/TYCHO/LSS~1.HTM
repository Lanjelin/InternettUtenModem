<P>During my <A HREF="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2022" tppabs="http://www.tac.dk/~lars_c/thesis/thesis.html">thesis</A>
work I found visualization of galaxy redshifts in 3D a wonderful tool to
experience Large Scale Structure in the Universe. Be my guest - Try yourself!
</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Man has always had a profound urge to explore his surroundings. In the
middle-age the expeditions went to the furthest corners of the globe. In
our days a lot of efford is being put into unveiling the nature of the
remote parts of the Universe. </P>

<P>The subject under investigation here is the <B>largest structures in
the Universe</B>. In the last decade a wealth of redshift surveys of the
Universe has made it possible to map the distribution of galaxies over
most of the sky with respect to their spatial location - as in the CfA+SSRS
redshifts surveys and the Las Campanas redshift survey seen below </P>

<P>and not only their projected position onto the celestial sphere - as
&quot;yesterdays&quot; surveys like the APM survey and the Lick survey
seen below. </P>

<P>As it turns out it is extremely difficult to measure distances in the
Universe in general, so we astronomers find ourselves in the usual position:
We have to measure something which is almost impossible because everything
else relies on it. And a lot relies on distances in the Universe, its fate,
just to name one thing.</P>

<DT> It is not that we are not engineous - We really try. Se below a number
of methods to probe out in the Universe: </DT>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="DIST.GIF" tppabs="http://www.tac.dk/~lars_c/thesis/dist.gif" HEIGHT=455 WIDTH=705 ALIGN=CENTER>
</P></CENTER>

<P>Well, the &quot;easiest&quot; (cheapest) way to measure distances, or
something close to distances, are the redshifts of galaxies. The galaxy
redshifts can as a first approximation be interpreted as distances through
the Hubble law - The universe expands and makes all galaxies move apart
from each other with velocity differences proportional to their distances
from each other. The expansion makes the wavelength of emitted light larger
or redder - the so called redshift - and this gives us a nice well-defined
relationship between the redshift and distance of a given object. </P>

<P>Now, the Universe is not a simple place and it is not supposed to be
an easy job to be an astronomer. So this is only exactly true under the
assumption that galaxies do not have masses and therefore do not attract
each other thereby giving rise to peculiar motions - e.g. motions on top
of the Hubble expansion. But this is ok as a first approximation. </P>

<P>In this approximation, where redshifts are proportional, we see that
galaxies are distributed in a non-isotropic way placed in a manifold of
structural elements - clusters, sheets, filaments and voids. Quite interesting
in itself - One might refer to this kind of cosmological mapping as cosmography
(see also [Christensen, 1996]). When working with this approximation of
a direct mapping between redshifts and distances we work in the so called
redshift space, which as mentioned neglects galaxy motions. Since Kaiser
published his memorable paper in 1987 [Kaiser, 1987] there has been quite
a fuzz about deconvolving the effects of this funny chunk of phase space
having two spatial and one velocity component. We will leave that part
of the story for now, but refer the interested reader to the <A HREF="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2022" tppabs="http://www.tac.dk/~lars_c/thesis/thesis.html">thesis</A>.
</P>

<H3>Background</H3>

<P>Before getting to the fun part I <B>really</B> think you should take
a look at the creation of the Universe, and in particular the creation
of structure - Structure which we among other things see as galaxies today.
In order not to expand this already very large page, I refer you to the
<A HREF="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2022" tppabs="http://www.tac.dk/~lars_c/thesis/thesis.html">thesis</A>. </P>

<H3>The Data</H3>

<P>The data used on this page are redshifts and positions for 46383 galaxies.
The data are gathered from the two CfA redshift catalogues in the NASA
Astrophysical Data System (ADS) together with the ENACS cluster catalogue,
the Southern Redshift Catalogue and the ENACS Literature Compilation. The
data are from many different authors, and include both wide angle and pencil
beam surveys. The total sample is not infinitely far away from fairness
at a distance of approximately z = 0.04 (i.e. v = 12000 km/s), but it includes
galaxies as far as z= 3.80. The sample is perhaps the largest collection
of redshifts in the World, but it suffers severe selection effects and
is very difficult to use for statistical analyses (one of the conclusions
in my thesis). </P>

<H3>Overview of the data</H3>

<P>Here is the angular distribution of the large sample of galaxy redshifts.
It shows a very nice view of the large scale structures we know of in our
&quot;neighbourhood&quot;. </P>

</P></CENTER>

<P>Here we look from the furthest outskirts of the sample and inwards towards
our position in the center. The sampling outside the central region (our
&quot;neighbourhood&quot;) is very sparse. The zone of Galactic obscuration
is clearly visible in the picture above. </P>

<H3>The northern CfA slice in various representations</H3>

<P>This is the wellknown<A HREF="FINAL-4.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/snaps/final-4.gif">
northern CfA slice</A>. Seen from this angle, it looks almost like a traditional
2D plot. Another look at this slice:<A HREF="3DVIS-~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/snaps/3dvis-sphere-snap.gif">Here
we reproduce the galaxies as polygons (spheres)</A>. Is is easier to grasp
the subtle 3D structure in this way, but the CPU load gets at least two
orders of magnitude larger.The sampled section in the two snapshots is
8h &lt;= alpha &lt;= 17h, 8.5 deg. &lt;= delta &lt;= 44.5 deg., and z &lt;
0.04. If we make a thinner slice in declination,<A HREF="CFASLI~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/snaps/cfaslicethin.gif">
like this</A>, we reduce contamination of the structure due to projections.

<P>Above we look closer at the Microscopium region (left) and the Coma
region (right) in 3D. The voids and filamentary structure are only first
visible when looking at the galaxy distributions in 3D. </P>

<H3>Projections/slices of the galaxy distribution</H3>

<P>The picture on top of the page is a 15 degree slice of a sample of the
CfA Catalogue ranging to $z=0.04$. This image is a snapshot from a animation
made by means of <A HREF="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2009" tppabs="http://sslab.colorado.edu:2222/projects/IDL/idl_ssl_home.html" <a>IDL</A>.
</P>

<P>I can offer you a total look around in the distribution of galaxies
in projection. This may give also give you a nice impression of the complicated
filamentary structure the galaxies are distributed in: <A HREF="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2025" tppabs="http://www.tac.dk.dk/~lars_c/thesis/node49.html#SECTION001100000000000000000">Slices</A>
</P>

<H3>ON the sky</H3>

<P>For fun I have tried to plot the positions of the nearest 15.000 galaxies
(white) as they look from our viewpoint on Earth, among the brightest 6.000
stars (yellow from the Henry Draper Catalogue). Here is the area near <A HREF="ORION.GIF" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/snaps/orion.gif">Orion</A>.

<P>HI hope you liked the tour!</P>
