<h2>Provisional report from the October 12 <a

reached almost 40 percent in Portugal. This marvellous image series is
courtesy of <b>Antonio Cidadao</b>, Portugal, who handled all the
observational tasks singlehandedly - including broadcast of the
eclipse on the Internet as desrcibed below. The times for the
different images are here (in UT): 13:11, 13:16, 13:21, 13:27 13:30,
13:36, 13:41, 13:46, 13:52, 13:56, 14:01, 14:06, 14:11, 14:16, 14:21,

<p>The October 12 Solar Eclipse will for sure remain a very special
event in the minds of the thousands of participating <b>Astronomy
On-Line</b> students, teachers, amateur astronomers and professionals
all over Europe.</p>

<p>Parts of Scandinavia were clouded out during the event on Saturday,
e.g. Finland, Norway, and parts of Denmark - but most of central
Europe was under influence of a high-pressure region entering from the
South Atlantic. Bulgaria had heavy fog. In Portugal the morning was
very foggy, but the fog lifted just in time.</p>

<p>Here follow some impressions from the different groups around
Europe:</p>

<ul> <li><p>From Toulouse in France: <i>What a wonderful weather for
this eclipse!  There were plenty of people in the park where the old
Observatory stands. We could see very well the luminous crescents on
the ground through the leaves on the trees - and because of the strong
wind, they were sweeping the ground, back and forth.</i></p></li>

<li><p>The Vienna Kuffner Group in Austria had beautiful weather
conditions. Both a black box camera and a Celestron C8 Schmidt
Cassegrain were applied and they had <i>lots of visitors</i> with
them, sharing the beuatiful eclipse.</p></li>

<li>Gabor writes from Hungary about their eclipse observations. In a
hurry, they applied dismounted floppy disks as solar filters.  The
arrangement by the Hungarian Astronomical Association was followed by
thousands of people.</p></li>

</ul>

<p><b>Please send your own contribution as soon as possible. Read
about more results in the Bulletins during the coming days!</b></p>


<h3>Distance to the Moon determined!</h3>

<ul> <li><p>In La Rochelle, the group was almost overrun by people,
making the measurements somewhat difficult. Nevertheless, the Rochelle
Group got a distance to the Moon of <b>350 000 km</b>, which is to be
compared with the exact value of <b>390 406 km</b> (from the
"Astronomical Almanac", calculated by Bjorn Franck Joergensen, Tycho
Brahe Planetarium, Denmark).</p></li>

<li><p>The <b>Astronomy On-Line<b> <a
href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/information/participants/de/de-0038.html"></b>Gluckers</b></a>
Group from Neumarkt, Germany measured a value of <i>H/W = 0,40</i> at
15:45 MET - implying a distance of <b>359 000 km</b>.</p></li>

<li><p>Similar results were obtained by the Vienna <a
href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/information/participants/at/at-0010.html"><b>Kuffner
Group</b></a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Knud Erik Sørensen from Horsens got a short break in the fog,
enabling his class 2B from Horsens High School to measure H/W = 0.447
at 14:57 MET. According to the Math 2D chapter in <a
href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/collaboration/soleclipse/solecl-2d.html">here</a>,
this gives a parallax of 0.93 Deg. Application of the sine relation
results in a distance of <b>348 000 km</b>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>So far, most of the received results are within <b>380 000 km +/-
10 percent</b>!  Some calculated distances are a bit too high - some
too low.</p>

<h3>First ever international live transmissions of a Solar
eclipse</h3>

<p><center><img src="NEWS03~1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/market/newspaper/news0302-2.jpg"><p><font size="-1"> The Danish
part of the live transmission collaboration got <a
href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/solar/"><b>these 18
images</b></a> of most of the eclipse. The times for the images are
given here (in UT): 13:07, 13:12, 13:17, 13:22, 13:27, 13:32, 13:37,
13:42, 13:47, 13:52, 13:57, 14:02, 14:07, 14:13, 14:24, 14:26, 14:29
and 14:32.<font size="+0"></center></p>

<p>During the eclipse itself, live pictures were shown some places on
Internet.</p>

<p>Both the <a href="TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#335" tppabs="http://www.ping.be/Mira">MIRA</a> and the <a
href="SOLAR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/astronomyonline/solar.html">Copenhagen
Site</a> had lot of requests.  The Copenhagen Homepage was unique by
showing images from 2 locations simultaneously - Portugal and Denmark.
On the latter "Solar eclipse TRANS-Europe observation homepage"
Antonio Cidadao from the very active Portuguese Amateur Society APAA
(previously partners on the EAAE Comet Hyakutake Parallax event - See
Sky & Telescope, July 1996) displayed real time CCD images, together
with images taken by students from Astronomical Observatory at the
University of Copenhagen. The Danish students had slightly hazy skies
until shortly after the maximum when a massive cloud cover
unfortunately came in from West. The same cloud cover had earlier that
morning closed over Soenderborg, Denmark, where the third party of the
live transmission resides. The disappointed students there regained
their spirit by doing On-Line calculations of the lunar distance. The
applied method was the 2D method described here in <b>Astronomy
On-Line</b>, the result was better than <b>10 percent</b> off the
official value.</p>

<p>This unique combination of international, simultaneous eclipse
images turned out to be a likely first of its kind. It is a clear
textbook demonstration of the astronomical term
<b>parallax</b>. Because Denmark is placed higher on the Globe when
compared to Portugal, the Danish <b>Astronomy On-Line</b> group
experienced the Moon as lower in the sky than the Portuguese
team.</p>

<p>More than a thousand visitors at <a
href="TYCHO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/tycho.html">Tycho Brahe Planetarium</a>
in Copenhagen enjoyed most of the eclipse (before the clouds), and
watched the parallax effect in the Internet images on a large format
screen in the exhibition area. Explanations were given partly by the
Director and the astronomers from the University.</p>

<p>The internet communication we experienced within <b>Astronomy
On-Line</b> was a great help to those groups who were clouded out. As
Milcho Tsvetkov from overcast Bulgaria writes: <i>We have to express
our deep thanks to the colleagues from Denmark and Portugal who
organized this so impressive observation of the solar eclipse via
networking</i>.</p>

<p> Also e-mails from different parts of Europe were received by the
groups during the eclipse. All with positive thoughts about the
work.</p>

<p>We are absolutely breathless of the fabulous results produced by
this European collaboration. Watch closely for <b>Astronomy
On-line</b> news bulletins in the near future with more results from
this wonderful astronomical event.</p>

<p> As Bent Klarmark from Denmark and his astronomy-dedicated students
stated, when they observed the high lunar mountains in silhoutte
against the solar limb: <i>Scientifically GREAT experience, in all
aspects.  Together with the beautiful autumn nature scenery, it made
us all remember the grandness of space, and the modesty of
mankind.</i> </p>
