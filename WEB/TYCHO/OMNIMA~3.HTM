Tycho Brahe Planetarium is also equipped with an Omnimax - a complicated film projector.<p>
The Omnimax uses the largest film format (size) in the history of movies. An ordinary cinema movie has a single picture size of 319 mm² and an Omnimax has a picture size of 3.376 mm². The larger film size - the better picture quality. The sharp picture is projected on the dome-shaped screen and a special designed sound system, produced by Sonics, surrounds the audience with a 6-channel, 4-way  sound with sub-bass. The result is a fantastic experience of being in the centre of the events - of being an actor in the film yourself.<p>
To ensure the largest number of seats in the planetarium, the Omnimax projector is lifted by en elevator from the projection room below the theater to a small projection box. The projection box is only just large enough to contain the Omnimax projector itself, while the film reels and the projectionist remain in the projection room.<p>
With the Omnimax you can experience all different kinds of sceneries, from under water expeditions to journeys in outer space. The film is projected on to the whole domeshaped screen and with the fantastic sound and picture you feel like being in the center of the events - sometimes so much that your ability to keep your balance is effected.<p
