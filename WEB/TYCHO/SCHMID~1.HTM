<h3><a name="intro">Introduction / history</a></h3>

<p>
Early plans of astronomical equipment at the 
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~michael/telescope/bror.html">
Brorfelde Astronomical Observatory</a>
include building of a Schmidt
telescope at the observatory workshop.
</p>
<p>
The following main data was decided by Professor Bengt
Str&oslash;mgren in the autumn 1958:<br>
Diameter of main mirror 75 cm, free opening 50 cm, focal
length 150 cm and with a "on/off" 15° objective prism.
</p>
<p>
The 
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~ijaf/schmidt/design.html">design</a>
of the telescope started in 1961, done by the
head of the mecanical workshop Mr.Poul Bechmann.
</p>
<p>
Soon after the  work started, mostly in the observatory
mecanical workshop, but some special and bigger parts for
telescope,(and the &Oslash; 6.8 Mtr. steel dome) was ordered from
outside, e.g. optics, worm & wormwheels and bigger welded
parts of the telescope and dome.
</p>
<p>
The concrete/stone part of the dome was designed by Professor
Gotlib, and contain on the observing floor a observing room, a
darkroom and a small "hot" room for the observer. In the
basement toilet, main gears,motors and refrigerator for
photografic plates is situated.
</p>
<p>
The telescope was installed in the dome in spring 1996 and
soon after the test started.
</p>
<p>
Because of serius troubles between the main mirror material
(F2 glass) and aluminium it was at last desided to buy another
mirror made of a better material.(Zeoudur)<br>
The new mirror has a diameter of 77 cm, the free opening is,
because of a deform corrector, cut to &Oslash;45 cm.
</p>
<p>
After a long break, the telescope was tested during the season
1973/1974, and finally in 1975 the regular obsevations could
start, using 150 x 150 x 1 mm photographic plates, with a
field  of 5°.2 on which it vas possible to reach stars down to
mag.18.5.
</p>
<p>
During the years 1975 to 1991 the telescope was used
continuously - observing many different fields, mostly direct
photographic fields, but also a lot of objective prism exposures
have been obtained.
</p>
<p>
The telescope has in the same period been used for education
of students, who has done small projects on the telescope.
</p>
<p>
A modification in 1989 - 1990 include a complete 
<a href="TCS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~ijaf/schmidt/TCS.html">TCS</a>
(Telescope Control System) with new direct drive motors, gears
and encoders in Ra. and Dec.
</p>
<p>
The total number of photographic plates kept in the Brorfelde
Schmidt plate archive from the period are about 2000 (excl. a
lot of test/focus plates)
(The archive is still in Brorfelde, placed in the main
building basement)
</p>
<p>
The plates are also registered in 
<a href="TPPMSGS/MSGS19.HTM#1905" tppabs="http://www.wfpa.acad.bg/intro.html">"Wide-Field Plate Database"</a>
(WFPDB in SOFIA)  
</p>
<p>
In 1991 it was again desided to modify the telescope, and
during 1991/1992 the telescope was equipped with a JPL
GRAF/Cassini 1024 x 1224, 12 micron pixel  
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~ijaf/schmidt/JPL-CCD.html">CCD camera</a>
which
replaced the photographic system. 
</p>
<p>
The CCD camera are controlled and operated by a Linux based PC
program 
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~ijaf/schmidt/BIAS.html">BIAS</a>
(Brorfelde Image Acquisition System)
</p>
<p>
Finally a CCD based 
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~ijaf/schmidt/baocam.html">guide camera</a>
(BAOCAM) was 
mounted on one of the guide telescopes on a x-y carrige.
</p>
<p>
In december 1992 the new system start to operate and has
continued since.......
</p>
<p>
The telescope operate in a service mode and observers are
requested to make a 
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~ijaf/schmidt/input_catalogue.html">
input catalogue</a>
.
</p>
<p>
Finally a lot of the most important 
<a href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~ijaf/schmidt/main_specifications.html">
main specifications</a>
for The Brorfelde Schmidt Telescope are listed.(updated late
in 1995.)
