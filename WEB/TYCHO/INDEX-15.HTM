This course was given during the spring semester 1996, by
<A HREF="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2038" tppabs="http://antares.ncl.ac.uk/~brandenb">Axel Brandenburg</A> and
<A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aake">&Aring;ke Nordlund</A>. &nbsp;The
main intent was to introduce General Relativity in such a way that the students
would obtain hands-on computing and visualizing experience with elementary
General Relativity problems. &nbsp;Originally, the plan for the examination
was to require the students to produce a video, accompanied by a short written
report. &nbsp;During the course, the idea came up to instead use WWW exhibits
(similar to the <A href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2055" tppabs="http://jean-luc.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Exhibits/">Exhibits</A>
of the <A href="tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2056" tppabs="http://jean-luc.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA Relativity Group</A>)
for the examination. &nbsp;The students embraced the idea
whole-heartedly,&nbsp;and spent considerable time experimenting with various
techniques for presentations and interactivity. &nbsp;The result was a very
nice set of <A HREF="EXHIBI~2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aake/teaching/rel/exhibits.html">Exhibits</A>. &nbsp;Eventually, we plan
to merge these individual exhibits, that use a variety of techniques, into
a single, more uniform permanent presentation.&nbsp;
<P>
The new examination format worked very well, but a word of warning is perhaps
appropriate to teachers and students who wish to try something similar:
&nbsp;WWW exhibits is a perfect example of ``Andersen's Law&#180;&#180;;
they take more than twice the time you expect, even after you take account
of Andersen's law... &nbsp;Good web tools should in principle simplify the
task, but in practice one just tends to add more machinery (forms, java,
frames, etc.) and Andersen's Law remains valid.
<P>
In addition to the <A HREF="EXHIBI~2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aake/teaching/rel/exhibits.html">exhibits</A>, we make the
<A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aake/teaching/rel/material.html">lecture notes and exercise material</A> available,
with the qualifying remark that the material is neither intended nor suitable
for self study, and that the exercises require access to files not (yet)
available through&nbsp;the WWW. &nbsp;We may, at some later time, attempt
to make the WWW material more&nbsp;self contained, by polishing the lecture
notes, and by providing WWW access to all files necessary to run the
exercises.&nbsp;
<P>
<A href="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aake/teaching/rel/docs.html" >Documentation and tutorials</A> on WWW related tools were
provided as support for the project work, and may be of general interest.
There are also a number of links to <A HREF="Pending_relink#examples" tppabs="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~aake/teaching/rel/docs.html#examples">sites with
GR related exhibitions</A> on that page.
