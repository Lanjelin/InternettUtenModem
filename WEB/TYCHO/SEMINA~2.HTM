>    Abstract: The most significant periodicities in the terrestrial impact
>    crater record are due to the <STRONG>"human signal"</STRONG>:
>    the bias of assigning integer values for the crater ages.
>    This bias seems to have eluded the proponents and opponents
>    of real periodicity in the occurrence of these events,
>    as well as the theorists searching for an extraterrestrial explanation
>    for such periodicity.
>    The <STRONG>"human signal"</STRONG> should be seriously considered by scientists in
>    astronomy, geology and paleontology when searching for a connection
>    between terrestrial major comet or asteroid impacts and mass extinctions
>    of species.

>and material content of our Universe with unprecedented accuracy. Large
>scale numerical simulation provides a means to study how the presently
>observed structure of the Universe grew from these fluctuations as a
>result of gravitational instability. The strong evolution predicted can
>now be observed directly since the largest ground-based telescopes are
>able to detect galaxies at distances so large that the light travel
>time approaches 90% of the age of the Universe.

<STRONG>Subject: SEMINAR COLL 19.03.97 Braginsky, Vladimir</STRONG>

                                JOINT COLLOQUIA
          Niels Bohr Institute for Astronomy, Physics and Geophysics

ATTENTION: These colloquia are directed to a broad spectrum of physicists, 
not only specialists. All staff members and guests are welcome to join, and 
the same applies to physics students of all categories and on all levels, 
including first-year students.

                  Vladimir Braginsky, Moscow State University
          <STRONG>"Detection of Gravitational Waves and Quantum Measurements"</STRONG>
                   Wednesday, March 19 at 03:15 pm in Aud. 3
                  H.C. Ørsted Institute, Universitetsparken 5

Abstract: The goal of the projects LIGO, VIRGO and GEO-600 is to create a 
new channel of astrophysical information, the gravitational wave astronomy, 
and thus to learn about almost unknown processes in our Universe. At the 
first stages of these projects, teams of experimentalists are erecting the 
main parts of terrestrial laser interferometric gravitational wave antennae.
At the end of this century and at the beginning of the next one, they are ex-
pecting to detect the bursts of gravitational radiation from astrophysical
catastrophes such as collisions of neutron stars and black holes. The gravi-
tational waves in a terrestrial laboratory produce very weak tidal accelera-
tions which give birth to very small vibrations of macroscopic masses (equal
of smaller than 10 to minus 16 cm). Such small mechanical vibrations inevit-
ably mean a confrontation with the quantum mechanical behaviour of microscop-
ic objects and the necessity to invent completely new instruments.
