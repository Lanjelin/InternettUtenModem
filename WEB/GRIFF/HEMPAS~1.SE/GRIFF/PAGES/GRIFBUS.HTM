<BR></center>Once upon a time there was a little puppy named Griff. He had moved from his 
family to live with two humans. The humans were very nice and gave him lots 
of food and candy. There were also many cats to chase.<BR><BR>
But one day, when Griff had lived with the humans for 2 months, they sent 
him on 5-day vacation to his old family. Griff was very sad to leave the nice 
humans that he now called mum and dad. He was happy to meet his dog-mum and
dog-grandparents but he was a bit worried about the humans who lived there too.<BR><BR>
When Griff arrived the host-humans were worried that they wouldn't be able
to catch Griff when he had to go into the house for the night.
Griff's mum and dad, who were very intelligent people, told them that if 
they'd say the word "CANDY" Griff would come at once!
So the mum and dad left their dog son with the host-humans. Griff was very 
happy! He played with the other dogs who lived there and with the human puppies.
And every night when the humans called "CANDY, Griff!", he came running at once.<BR><BR>
But then one evening when they called "CANDY, Griff!" as usual, Griff didn't come!
He was angry! Why did they call CANDY when there wasn't any?
One of the host-humans tried to catch Griff. But Griff just ran, faster than the wind!
He decided to play the "run around the house"-game. And there they ran in circles
for at least an hour and Griff wasn't angry anymore... It was so fun running
with a shouting human behind! The human didn't seem to enjoy it quite as much though...
 He just kept on shouting about how stupid Griff was.<BR><BR>
Later that evening Griff decided to go inside the house and sleep just to make the 
running human happy...<BR><BR>
When the human mum & dad came to take Griff home again the human-host said
that Griff did NOT come when ha called "CANDY". How strange the human mum and
dad thought. They tried to see where Griff were but there were so many puppies that
they couldn't tell for sure which one it was. Griff hardly recognized them either.
He wasn't that happy to see them. But when Griff came home and saw all cats
he barked happily and started to chase them.
The humans saw it and called "CANDY, Griff". Griff came at once as he knew that if
these humans said CANDY they always had something for him!
<BR><BR>
The moral of this story is : NEVER LIE TO A DOG! (And only use the candy command at emergencies)<BR>

Once upon a time... there was a dog called Griff. He was looking forward to Christmas
and he had even made his own <A HREF="CHRISTM.HTM" tppabs="http://hem.passagen.se/griff/pages/christm.htm">Christmas Page</A> at the WWW.
He had written to Santa to tell him what he wanted for Christmas and bought a chocolate filled Swedish
Advent-Calendar. He was very happy! But then..
<BR><BR>...then he heard that there were going to be CHILDREN at the Christmas celebration! 
"HELP ME!" Griff sighed. "What am I to do? Will they eat all the candy? Will they get all the presents? Will no one
talk to me"...<BR>
<BR>Christmas Eve<BR><BR>
**Knock** What was that?? Santa?? He sure looks ugly! He smells a lot like my human grandfather. Strange...
I wonder where HE is now? It wouldn't be good for him to miss Santa!<BR><BR>
Wow! I get presents!!! A bag full of pigs ears!!! And a pig tail!!!<BR> The poor human children only get boring toys and clothes, he he...
Hey! Why did SHE get chocolate and not I??? Give it to me! Yes that's better. Chocolate !! Yummie!!<BR><BR>
Christmas Day<BR><BR>
Time to celebrate Christmas again - this time with mum's parents and Birke.
Wow! Even more presents! Frolic dog food! YES!!!! And some "SCMACKOS" and...
<BR><BR>
Christmas is over...a whole YEAR til next time...but my birthday is closing in (March 19)!
