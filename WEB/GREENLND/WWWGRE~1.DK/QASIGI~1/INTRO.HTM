The magnificent weather. The unspoilt natural scenery. Seals and whales romping around the deep blue ocean. Trout-fishing in the splendid lakes and of course, the friendly local people, who make Qasigiannguit in particular an altogether special place to stay.<P>

Today, fishing is the principal livelihood in Qasigiannguit. The towns scrimping factory is one ofthe few in Greenland where it is still possible to watch the production cycle in progress at the plant.<P>
Ancient traditions are kept alive in Qasigiannguit. The art of kayaking is gladly demonstrated to visiting guests. On special festive occasions, the town choir dresses in national costume and dances and sings in true Greenlandic fashion. <P>
Winter is one of the most beautiful seasons that can be experienced in Qasigiannguit. Dog-sledge riding, both on the sea ice and in the surrounding inland areas, is the thrill of a lifetime. For those more interested in riding a snow mobile, there are plenty of possibilities too. The only limit is the imagination.<P>
Qasigiannguit is famous for its fine weather, with temperatures of anything up to 27 degrees Celsius. That makes this part of Disko Bay rich in vegetation - cow berries, bilberries and crow berries are among the many different species of plant. There are excellent opportunities for hiking in the mountains. Amongst other things, you can visit Bings Hule, the cave where the old shamans were tought their trade. Sailing trip to the Ice Fiord, where the huge icebergs twinkle up at the sky, or to the ghost-town of Akugdlit, where you can stay overnight at the old school. The region is also known for its fine fishing amenities, winter and summer alike. All fishing tackle and camping gear can be rented at Qasigiannguit Tourist-Service.<P>
