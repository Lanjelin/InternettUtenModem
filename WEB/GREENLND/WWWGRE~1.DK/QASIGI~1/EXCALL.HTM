Qasigiannguit Touristservice arrange in cooperation with Hotel Igdlo an exciting 
Greenlandic evening at Hotel Igdlo with Greenlandic food and entertainment. The 
menu consists of whale, seal, birds and whatever seafood is available.
As entertainment we have a presentation of the beautiful Greenlandic national 
costumes. The local  choir sings Greenlandic songs and show us the folk dance. 
Folk dancing originally came to Greenland with the Europeans - and particularly 
Scottish - whalers as early as the 17th century. The people of Greenland adopted 
these entertaining dances and still use them on special occasions.<P>

"Kaffe-mik" is an old Greenlandic tradition where you are invited for coffee at friends/relatives to celebrate a certain event e.g. a birthday. Usually stories are told about the person who is celebrated, stories from childhood to present, good and bad.
The visit itself is normally very short. Are the chairs around the coffee table occupied, you take a seat in the sofa and wait until there is a free chair at the table and the host will ask you to take a seat.<P>
