drivers are waiting for us. The trip takes us towards Str&oslash;mstedet, where 
Tasersuaq runs out into Laksebugten. We then cross Laksebugten and drive over 
land up to Ole's stone and M&aring;gefjeldet. At this particular place there is a 
fantastic wiev over the Discobay to the Disco Island. We have a cup of coffee 
and enjoy the pretty view while the dogs have a rest.<BR>

The tour starts at the shrimp factory, where the dogsledge drivers are waiting 
for us. We drive past Nûk, where we stop for a cop of coffee and enjoy the 
beautiful view over the Discobay. Then it goes across Akugdlit Kujataa, if you 
look to the southeast you can see the Icecap.<BR>
We arrive at Akugdlit, where we eat our lunchpackets. Akugdlit was closed down 
in the beginning of the sixties. Many of the buildings are still in use by the 
fishermen and hunters and the schoolchildren are using them as a summercamp.<BR>
After this well deserved break, where the dogs have had a rest, we drive back to 
Qasigiannguit. This time the tour goes over land at Nisât. Halfway over land 
there is a fantastic view towards Qasigiannguit.<P>

<A NAME="ili"><H3>2 days dogsledge tour to Ilimanaq </H3></A><P>

The tour starts at the outskirts of the town at Tasersuaq, where our dogsledge 
drivers are waiting for us. The trip takes us towards Str&oslash;mstedet, where 
Tasersuaq runs out into Laksebugten. We then cross Laksebugten and drive over 
land to M&aring;gefjeldet. At this particular place there is a fantastic wiev over 
the Discobay to the Disco Island.<BR>
We continue towards Ilimanaq, where we arrive after approx. 3 hours drive. The 
dogs have a rest and we eat out lunchpackets. We offload the luggage and drive 
further north to Ilulissat Icefiord, the worlds most productive glacier. This is 
an experience for life which you will never forget. While we take in the view we 
drink a cop of coffee.<BR>
We drive back to Ilimanaq, where we stay overnight. The dogs are feed and dinner 
is prepared. We spend the night relaxing and absorbing the many impressions we 
have had.<BR>
The next day we take the same route back to Qasigiannguit. Instead of going home 
via Str&oslash;mstedet, we turn west and drive around Rypeholmen, where we will try our 
luck with the fishingline. Many of the locals are at this place jigging for 
cods. Who knows if this might be our lucky day. If we catch anything the chef at 
the hotel will prepare it for dinner. <BR>
The trip end at the shrimp factory where we say goodbye to our driver and his 
dogs.<P>

The tour starts at the outskirts of the town at Tasersuaq, where our dogsledge 
drivers are waiting for us. The trip takes us towards Str&oslash;mstedet, where 
Tasersuaq runs out into Laksebugten. We continue on the track to the end of  
Laksebugten, then over land to the fishermen's cabin in Tasiussaq. The trip 
takes approx 4 hours.<BR>
We eat lunch and enjoy the beautiful nature. The next short drive goes to the 
Icecap at Sargardliup, where it is possible to spot seals and go hunting for 
birds. We drive back to the cabin where we stay overnight.<BR>
The next day the tour takes us up to Asiarmiut by the glacier. Here there is an 
fantastic view over the glacier. We drive the sledge onto the glacier, where the 
fishermen catch halibut. It is an unique experience to drive between the big 
blocks of ice. We stay overnight in the hut by Asiarmiut.<BR>
On the last day we drive all the way back to Qasigiannguit at the same track we 
came out on but the trip will not be less boring. <BR>The tour ends at Tasersuaq, 
where we say goodbye to the driver and his dogs.<P>

<A NAME="ilitasiu"><H3>1 day tour to Ilimanaq/Tasiussaq by snowmobile</H3></A><P>

Experience a wonderfull drive on snowmobile to Ilimanaq, the settelment by the 
Icefiord. We meet with our guide at the hotel. We are dressed in sealskin 
trousers and anorak because the Arctic temperatures easily reaches down to  -25 
degrees. <BR>Then we drive to Ilimanaq, the settlement by the Icefiord where our 
first stop is. The guide will show us around so we can get a feeling of how life 
is in a traditional fishing village.<BR>
We continue up to Ilulissat Icefiord, which is the worlds most productive 
glacier. We eat our lunchpackets and enjoy the view of  the big icebergs. You  
certantly get the feeling of the big forces in the Arctic nature.<BR>
Then we continue to Tasiussaq, where our next stop is at the fishermens cabin. 
Here you can experience the locals fishing halibut. They sell them to Royal 
Greeenland in Qasigiannguit. The last part of this tour goes via Str&oslash;mstedet and 
Tasersuaq, where the young boys often race over the ice on their snowmobiles.<P>
