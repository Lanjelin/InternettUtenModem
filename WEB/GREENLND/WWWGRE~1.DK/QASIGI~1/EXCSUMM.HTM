<A NAME="fishing"><H3>HIKING AND FISHING TRIP TO STR&Oslash;MSTEDET</H3></A><P>

Strømstedet is a popular fishing spot among the locals. We try our luck with the 
fishing rod and the catch will be prepared over a heather fire.
On this beautiful tour to Str&oslash;mstedet we walk along a track where you, on your 
right side, will have a magnificant view over Tasersuaq and Qaqarssuaq. The 
track we choose is at the bottom of the mountain, the area is very fertile and 
you will see many different plants and flowers. On the way home we climb the 230 
meter tall mountain on the west side of the lake Tasersuaq. We walk to the 
Telestation, here you can see Akugdlit to the south, the end of Laksebugten and 
then of course the magnificant view over the Discobay.<P>

Kayaking is an old Greenlandic tradition. Back in time, kayak turns were just 
one out of many
survival techniques. The kayak has had essential importance to the Inuits as a 
hunting- and travelling
tool for thousands of years. Today the kayak is only used in its original 
fashion at a very few locations in Greenland but there is an interes in 
maintaining the traditions and skills. Therefore, all over Greenland local kayak 
clubs have been established. An outline of the kayak history will be given.<P>
