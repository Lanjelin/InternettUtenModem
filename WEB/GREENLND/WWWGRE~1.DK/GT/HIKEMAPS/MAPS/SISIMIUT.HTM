<H1>General information about hiking in Greenland</H1></CENTER>
Greenland's impressive nature has attracted hikers for decades. The high
beautiful mountains, glaciers, icefilled fjords, the flora and fauna the
untouched nature and the silence provide the unique experience of the arctic.
The air is so clear that mountains can be seen from a distance of over 75
km and one can be in the wilderness for days without meeting other people.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commandments for hiking</B><BR>
Hiking in Greenland, outside inhabited areas, is mainly for experienced
hikers and provide that your physical condition and sense of direction are
good and that you know how to use a map and a compass.<BR>
<BR>
On longer tours you have to be able to enjoy untouched nature miles away
from the nearest inhabited place. A sensible attitude to adopt is the assumption
of being left completely to one's own devices. Only very limited assistance
is available for the hillwalker, such as for example marked paths, designated
routes, signposting, bridges and suchlike. <BR>
<BR>
The following rules of the mountains are a good help when going about in
the nature. By keeping these rules the risk of accidents en route will be
reduced.<BR>
<BR>
1. Don't start off on walks without some previous training and planning<BR>
2. Let someone know where you're heading and when you expect to be back.<BR>
3. Pay attention to the weather and the weather reports. <BR>
4. Listen to experienced hikers.<BR>
5. Be prepared for bad weather and accidents, even on short walks.<BR>
6. Always remember a map and compass.<BR>
7. Never go alone.<BR>
8. Turn back before things get chritical.<BR>
9. Conserve your strength; look for shelter while there is still time<BR>
10. Always take along the necessary emergency gear.<BR>
11. Always bring extra warm clothes - even on short day tours.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Choice of route and hiking technique</B><BR>
Before starting off, the route must be carefully planned. The map must be
studied and a route suitable for all on the team must be found. Difficult
passages must be taken under consideration before making the final decision
of the route. It is important to be in good form and remember; it is your
holiday! Even the weakest on the team must be able to complete the day's
march without getting totally exhausted. Allow good time to complete the
route and for delays so you have time to climb a mountain, see a ruin or
simply stay a day or two at a beautiful spot. Allow for 1 - 2 demurrage
days per week in consequense of rain, wind or fog. Avoid too many climbings
and descents which will tax your energy. As a guideline you can walk 3 -
4 km per hour on even ground. You will need approx. 1 hour extra everytime
you climb or descent 300 m. Take a break every hour and drink something
hot or eat chocolate or dried fruit in order to avoid an insufficient blood
sugar balance.<BR>
<BR>
When everything is planned you must inform the authorities (the police or
the tourist office) of the planned route, the estimated duration etc. -
and remember to inform them when the trip is complete. The planned route
must be followed as strictly as possible as this is where a search will
be initiated in case of emergencies. If you are too far away from the planned
route there is a risk that you will not be found.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Routes on the map</B><BR>
The recommended routes on the map are marked with different colors; Green
&gt; blue &gt; red &gt; black indicating the increasing level of difficulty.
The easiest routes - green and blue - are either on or close to beaten track.
Since they often follow unsurfaced roads, valleys or fjords, the need to
be able to read contour lines and find one&#180;s way and position using
a map and a compass is limited, so there is little risk of getting lost.
Hiking on recommended red and black routes calls for a greater sense of
direction, physical fitness and hiking experience. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sense of locality</B><BR>
In Greenland there are several places with lodes of ore in the underground
which influences on the compass and makes it difficult to find one's bearings.
As a consequence it is important to make note of the landform and the characteristics
of the nature, for example a large mountain, a certain lake etc. and compare
these observations with the information on the map. The routes are unmarked
- only a few routes are marked with cairns. As a supplement to the compass
we recommend mileometer, altimeter and protractor for maps.<BR>
<BR>
In Greenland there is a significant compass declination, this is indicated
on the map.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wind and weather</B><BR>
The weather in Greenland changes a lot faster than is usual in other countries.
The weather can change in 10 - 15 minutes. Suddenly it can be fogged and
thereby be difficult to find one's way or it can be storm and be necessary
to seek shelter for several hours before continuing the tour. Make sure
your equipment is geared for sudden changes in the weather. Most people
who suffer death in the mountains do not die of hunger but of frost. The
temperatures mentioned below indicate the temperatures in the different
months. However it is a good idea to bring gloves and a cap - even in the
summer, as it can be very cold when the wind blows. On the other hand it
can be very warm on a sunny spot - up to 20&#176; C.<BR>
The best months for hiking are from the middle of June to the end of August.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Foehn</B> is a dry and warm wind. It arises from a highpressure area
east or northeast of Greenland from where the wind blows over the sea and
crosses the inland ice towards a low pressure area west of Greenland. In
western Greenland the wind comes down from the mountains as a warm, dry
and often very intense wind from the south east. When the wind reaches the
East Coast the temperature falls and the humidity taken up over sea falls
down as precipitation. When the wind reaches the west coast the temperature
rises again. The foehn can be portended by black/blue lensshaped clouds
over the inland ice and fall in the barometric pressure. The temperature
on the west coast rises at the same time as the foehn breaks through with
great intensity. The foehn can last for days and occur several times during
the same month. The wind force is at it's peak close to the ice cap and
decreases as it approaches the coast. Only very few tents can stand the
pressure from a foehn storm and therefore we recommend you to dismantle
the tent and seek shelter behind big and heavy rocks. A foehn storm seldom
lasts more than 1-2 days. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fjordwind.</B> The wind arises when the sun heats the rock faces and
the air in the fjords. The heated air is enlarged and goes up which causes
a vacuum effect right above the colder water in the fjords. Hereby wind
is sucked from the sea through the fjord. The phenomenon occurs from noon
to the afternoon when the heat has reached its peak. The fjord wind gives
a wind force of 15 m per secund, i.e. strong breeze. Towards the evening
the wind will decrease. Fjord wind only occurs on warm and sunny days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tide.</B> In Greenland the difference between lowtide and hightide is
approx. 3 m. This is especially important to kayakkers as it is easier to
row with the tide water than against the tide water. When kayakkers go ashore
it is important to place the kayak at a point where the high tide cannot
reach the kayak. For hikers the tide is important when rivers are to be
crossed. It is a good idea to cross rivers early in the morning before the
sun melts too much ice into the river or at low tide. The tide is caused
by the attractions of the moon and the Earth and does not follow the 24
hour rhytm. Therefore we recommend you to get a tide table with precise
information before going on a kayak or hiking tour <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fog</B>. Occasionally there is fog in the fjords. This is often influenced
by the field ice (especially May to June). Fog caused by field ice frequently
occurs in calm and cloudy weather and can last the whole day. This kind
of fog is most common in the mouth of the fjords and at the coast. In the
autumn (August to September) the sea fog can get all the way into the fjords.
This kind of fog typically occurs in the morning, goes away around noon
and returns in the evening.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing and equipment</B><BR>
When hiking in the Greenlandic nature it is important to be able to take
care of oneself as you will often be far away from inhabited areas. Therefore
it is important to be prepared for an emergency situation beforehand - even
if your trip is just for the weekend. Plan the tour carefully and make sure
you have sufficient supplies and emergency equipment along with the ordinary
hiking gear. The clothes must protect against the cold, the wind, precipitation,
the sun and the heat. It is a good idea to dress so the bodytemperature
can be regulated through the day. Three layers of clothing is recommended;
the inner layer must keep you warm even though the clothes get wet, the
middle layer must insulate against the cold and the outer layer must be
wind and rain proof. We recommend you to bring:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing</B>: &#183;Underwear, preferably woollen &#183;Extra socks and
soles &#183;Underwear with long legs and sleeves allowing perspiration to
escape &#183;Canvas or cotton clothing &#183;Warm sweater or fleeced sweatshirt
&#183;Rain and windproof jacket and trousers &#183;Cap and finger gloves
&#183;Good hiking boots &#183;Shorts and T-shirts for warm days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camp cookware: </B>&#183;Trangia cooking gear including sufficient methylated
spirits or stove and pots including sufficient fuel bottles &#183;Mug, plates
and cups &#183;Cutlery &#183;Bottles or thermo bottle for water &#183;Salt,
pepper and spices &#183;Plastic bags, lighter etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sleeping gear</B>: &#183;Tent &#183;Sleeping bag &#183;Sleeping pad (insulating)
&#183;Toilet requisities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Security</B>: &#183;Map (and an extra map) &#183;Compass &#183;Emergency
radio and ANNA emergency kit &#183;Extra tent pegs and tent poles &#183;Sewing
kit &#183;Tools for repairs &#183;Multi purpose tools &#183;Strong knife
&#183;Extra chocolate &#183;Shoes for wading &#183;Approx. 20 m strong string.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Nice to have</B>: &#183;Binoculars &#183;Fishing gear &#183;Handbooks
&#183;Tape or plaster for blisters &#183;Sunglasses &#183;Little rucksack
or hip pack &#183;Insect repellant &#183;Head net.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Footwear</B>: Much hiking in Greenland takes place on soil that does
not drain particularly well. Hiking boots of goretex are worth considering.
They are waterproof while allowing foot perspiration to escape. Some chooses
hiking rubber boots which are excellent on rainy days and in landscapes
with many small rivers and streams.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Emergency equipment:</B> We recommend ANNA emergency kit supplemented
wih VHF radio or ELT-emergency transmitter. The ANNA kit contains, whistle,
compass, flares (launching tube + cartridges), signalling mirror, aluminium
foil wind sleeve, signal flag and a belt so that the kit can be strapped
around the waist as well as instructions in Danish, English and Greenlandic.
ANNA emergency kit can be bought at KNI shops, ship's supply stores and
in some towns. They are also available from Greenlandair at the heliport
or airport or at tourist offices. The kit has been designed especially for
Greenlandic conditions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tents:</B> In general tunnel and domeshaped tents are good in high winds.
In rough weather and high winds, for example foehn, light weight tent pegs
are highly inadequate. High winds can lacerate many of the lightweight materials
used to manufacture tents these days. Bring a few extra tent pegs and poles
- just in case. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Insects/mosquitoes:</B> Bring sufficient supplies of insect repellants
and a head net. In addition to this it is a good idea to bring loosefitting
clothes that can be properly closed and tightened at your wrists or ankles.
Some hikers prefer to walk in the evening/night and sleep during the day
as the mosquitoes are less active in the evenings. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplies</B>: On hiking tours in Greenland it is necessary to bring all
provisions from home as there is little or no possibility of buying groceries
en route. Shops and grocery stores in the towns and villages do not have
special products for hikers and mountaineers such as for example freezedried
dishes. Therefore it is important to bring food that is not too heavy and
that can keep. Remember you will have more appetite when hiking - you will
need around 3,000 calories per day and therefore it is a good idea to bring
supplies with many carbohydrates. Remember to bring emergency supplies for
extra days. <BR>
<BR>
As a supplement to the freezedried dishes you can pick berries and mushrooms
on the hill sides. The common berries in Greenland are crowberries and blueberries
and can be picked from July. The edible mushroom sorts are roughstremmed
boletus, grisette, &quot;The Deceiver&quot; (red amethyst cap.) and horse
mushroom. Before picking mushrooms one should consult literature with pictures.
In addition to berries and mushrooms the food can be varied with fresh fishes.
If you intend to fish you must buy a fishing permit at the local tourist
office or police station. The tourist office can also inform you on which
months the arctic char can be caught and on the preserved rivers. Regarding
fresh meat, this must be bought at the local market as it is forbidden for
tourists to shoot quarries.<BR>
<BR>
The supplies should contain abundant cocoa, coffee, tea, chocolate, dried
fruit or biscuits for breaks and cosy evenings.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding drinking water, Greenland has some of the purest water on Earth.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camping and cabins</B><BR>
With few exceptions it is permitted to pitch your tent anywhere in Greenland,
however, it is necessary to respect the cultivated areas and meadows of
hay around the sheepfarming stations in South Greenland, preserved areas
and ruins from ancient times as well as lakes supplying the nearby village
with fresh water. Please respect a line of minimum 20 m from any ruin. The
arctic nature is very voulnerable and demands extra attention and consideration.
Please bear this in mind when you choose the camp site. Leave the area the
way you wish to refind it and leave nothing but footprints. Burn your trashes
or bring it along when the tour continues. As a general rule a good campsite
is a place where the ground is flat and the pegs can get a purchase and/or
a place with large boulders to which to lash the tent down. Another important
consideration is a site protected by the terrain with running water close
by. Avoid dry river beds or lowlying areas close to rivers as a camp here
will easily be flooded in case of heavy rain. If you intend to make a campfire
you should avoid making one on peat soil as fire can spread under the soil
and come up weeks later at another place. Use only dry twigs or charcoal
for fires. All arctic vegetation grows very slowly and it takes a long time
for the nature to reestablish damages. A Dwarf birch with a stem of 5 cm
can be 100 years old.<BR>
<BR>
In Greenland the cabins are few and far between, however, practice in Greenland
is to make remote chalets available to everyone and therefore they will
rarely be locked. For the same reason comfort is sparse and chalets in this
category are seldom particularly wellkept or clean. Originally the cabins
were built for hunters who use the cabins on hunts far away from the villages.
Overnight accommodation is usually free of charge.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fording: </B><BR>
During a hike it will often be necessary to ford rivers. According to the
rule of thumb, one should never wade deeper than up to the knees. Otherwise
it is best to wait for the water level to drop (approx. 24 hours after heavy
rain). Another idea is to follow the river upstream to a better fording
place or do the exact opposite; go to the outflow and wade across at the
next low tide. It is a good idea to bring along a pair of rubber shoes as
special &quot;waders&quot; which it does not matter if you get wet. These
will give you a much surer grip on smooth and sharp stones. Some form of
wading stick also increases safety considerably.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Search and rescue parties </B><BR>
Search and rescue parties are the job of the police all over Greenland.
As a general rule a rescue is free of charge for the victim. If the accident,
however, was selfinduced or was due to an act of folly or the rescue party
was called unnecessarily the police can issue an invoice to the victim.
Each case is evaluated by the police and the police decides whether the
victim must take a part of the costs.<BR>
<BR>
A standard travel and health insurance normally cover rescues related to
acciddents. However accidents on expeditions, i.e. crossing the ice cap
or similar, demand special insurances. All insurances must be taken out
before departure to Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Survival technique</B><BR>
When going on hikes you must always be prepared for the worst. In case of
emergencies or accidents it is important to keep one's head, avoid panic
and not to give up. Accidents are never the same and it is impossible to
make a list of how to avoid the different types of accidents or how to behave
in each situation. However, the first rule is to give emergency treatment,
to stabilise the situtation and to keep the injured person warm and protected
against sun, coldness rain and wind. After this you can look for help. A
large team can be divided in two and minimum two persons can look for help.
Remember to mark the place of the accident on the map. If you know there
are other hikers in the area or you can see/hear a helicopter/ aircraft,
you can use the flares or the whistle from the ANNA emergency kit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire:</B> If you have lost the last match fire can be made the primitive
way by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other or by means of a burningglass
from a magnifying glass, binoculars or a lens.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Finding one's way:</B> Without map and compass it is almost impossible
to find one's way. However, if you loose both of your compasses you can
find the four points of the compass with a fairly accurate watch. Before
noon (12.00) the four points can be found by letting the hour hand point
towards the sun and halve the distance between the hour hand and the number
12. This direction is South. In the afternoon (after 12.00) the distance
between the number 12 and the hour hand is South.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Being found:</B> If you have had an accident and you want to be found
it is important to draw the attention to yourself in a very obvious way.
This can be done by making signals with whistle, mirrors, flares, distress
rockets, SOS in oversize, flags, clothing etc. It is important that the
signals can be seen from the air, as most rescue parties take place with
helicopter. Do not discharge the flares until you can hear a helicopter
as they only lighten for a short period. When signalling with a mirror in
nice weather, an aircraft can see you from a distance of 75 km. It is important
to stay close to the planned route - here a search will start. Many people
are found too late because they did not make themselves visible from the
air. If you are close to inhabited areas or in an area with other hikers,
you can blow the whistle 6 times/minute every second minute. Answer to this
signal is 3 whistles/minute.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fishing permits</B><BR>
Anyone over the age of 18 who wants to fish in Greenland must have a valid
fishing permit. Fishing permit can be obtained at the local tourist office
or from the police. <BR>
Nanortalik is the southernmost town in Greenland and is first and foremost
famous for its landscape - especially the Tasermiut fjord. Nanortalik is
a fishing/hunting municipality and has a population of 2,700, 1,200 of whom
live in the 5 villages. You can get to Nanortalik by boat or helicopter
from Narsarsuaq or Qaqortoq.<BR>
