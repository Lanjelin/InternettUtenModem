<BR>
<B>The history of Kangerlussuaq</B><BR>
Kangerlussuaq, means the long fjord in Greenlandic. The fjord is 185 km
long, with Kangerlussuaq Airport located at the far end, approx. 60 km north
of the Arctic Circle. <BR>
Sondrestrom Air Base, known under the code name Bluie West 8 was founded
on October 7th 1941 by the United States Air Force (USAF). Earlier that
year, on April 9th 1941, Greenland's security was entrusted to the USA by
the Danish Ambassador as Denmark itself was unable to ensure Greenland's
security and supplies to the country under the German occupation of Denmark.
The USA set up a number of military bases and weather stations in Greenland
during the Second World War, including the military base at Kangerlussuaq.
During the war, Bluie West 8 soon became one of the most important stopover
sites for flying missions between the USA and its allies in Europe, owing
to the fine flying conditions for which Kangerlussuaq became known.<BR>
<BR>
After the war, in 1950, Bluie West 8 was handed back to Denmark, and on
April 27th 1951 the base reverted to the USA when Denmark and the USA signed
a new defence agreement, whereby the Americans opened Bluie West 8 under
the name of Sondrestrom Air Base.<BR>
<BR>
Between November 15th 1954 and October 1st 1965, SAS began making use of
Kangerlussuaq for stopovers on the route Copenhagen-Los Angeles.<BR>
The non-stop route linking Copenhagen and Kangerlussuaq had thus been created
and, besides being an American military base, the airport became the gateway
to Greenland. In 1960, the civil aspect of the base was established with
a transit hotel as annex.<BR>
<BR>
During the post-war period, which saw the onset of the cold war between
the two world powers, the USA and the USSR, DEW (Distant Early Warning)
radar stations were set up by the Americans from 1958 until far into the
1970s: the DYE-2 and DYE-3 stations on the inland ice, DYE-1 at Sisimiut
and DYE-4 at Kulusuk. Sondrestrom's main mission since that time has been
to supply the DEW stations, with both Greenlandair and USAF collaborating
on the supply work.<BR>
<BR>
When the disarmament between the USA and the USSR started in 1989, the Pentagon
decided to close down the DEW stations for the period 1990-91, soon followed
by the decision to shut down the American base. On September 30th 1992,
USAF left S&oslash;ndre Str&oslash;mfjord and on October 1st 1992, the entire
airport came under Greenland Home Rule and was given its first Greenlandic
name, Kangerlussuaq, as its official title. Kangerlussuaq Airport (Mittarfeqarfiit)
is operated by the Airport Authority under Greenland's Home Rule.<BR>
Until the Second World War, the Kangerlussuaq area had never been populated,
though the fjord had been used as summer sealing and fishing grounds.<BR>
<BR>
Today, with a population of approx. 250 - 300, Kangerlussuaq Airport is
an exclusively civil area, outside any municipal classification. The resident
population is directly or indirectly employed in connection with airport
operations, and the airport town has both a kindergarden and a school. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Scientific research </B><BR>
Kangerlussuaq has always been known for playing host to scientific research
teams, who have used Kangerlussuaq as their base. Kangerlussuaq is much
used by expeditions and has a special hotel for scientists. The following
are the research teams most firmly rooted in Kangerlussuaq:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kellyville.</B> The &quot;Sondrestrom Incoherent Scatter Radar&quot;
Research Centre is sited near the port in an unofficial township by the
name of Kellyville. The Centre is financed by the USA's National Science
Foundation and run by the American company SRI International in association
with the Danish Meteorological Institute. The station's chief assignment
is basic research into the ionosphere (and northern lights) and the outer
atmosphere (incl. the depth of the ozone layer). For those interested, a
sightseeing trip to Kellyville can be arranged by Kangerlussuaq Tourism.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;<B>GRIP&quot;</B> - The Greenland Icecore Programme - was a European
research programme organized under the European Science Foundation. Eight
European countries collaborated on drilling through the inland ice at its
highest point 800 km north-east of Kangerlussuaq. After four years' work,
drilling was completed at a depth of 3,028 metres in the summer of 1992.
This means that the recorded icecore stretches 250,000 years back in time.
Each and every snowstorm during that quarter of a million years is represented
in the core. Analyses of the ice enable climatic and atmospheric changes
to be charted back in time.<BR>
<BR>
<B>PICO </B>- the Polar Ice Coring Office - has been represented in Kangerlussuaq
since the mid-seventies. PICO is now a department of the University of Alaska
at Fairbanks, and its job is to support all American research under the
National Science Foundation originating from Kangerlussuaq.<BR>
<BR>
The main assignment of recent years has been support to American deep drilling,
a parallel project to GRIP. In addition, PICO provides logistic support
to many other projects, including research into Greenland's geology and
in particular the study of Greenlandic falcons. Falcons ringed in Kangerlussuaq
have been spotted on the east coast of the USA and in South America.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Flora</B><BR>
The vegetation depends on the climatic conditions and the landscape. The
area between Kangerlussuaq close to the ice cap and Sisimiut by the Sea
has significant differences in the vegetation. In the fjord there are approx.
200 sorts of flowering plants and brackens while the coast region has approx.
165 sorts. 6 of these plants only grow in this area and 40 other plants
are common in this region and very rare in the rest of Greenland. <BR>
<BR>
The most common plant community is dwarf-shrub heath dominated by small
bushes , i.e. Arctic blueberry, dwarf birch and crowberry in different variations.
In the high mountains the plant communities are fell-field and in the low-land
it is copse. Among the different heath plants such as mountain-heath, white
Arctic bell-heather and rock cranberry, the Arctic blueberry is the most
important. Sweet Arctic blueberries can be found almost everywhere in the
summer and are highly appreciated by hikers and hill walkers. Crowberry
is another sweet berry, but it is more common by the coast. The dwarf-birch
prefers the warmer areas away from the coast. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Willow scrub </B>can be found in the entire area except in mountains
over 2 - 300 m. At the coast and in the high mountains the scrub is creeping
and becomes a part of the dwarf-shrub heath. In protected valleys away from
the coast the willow grows almost like trees and can be almost 3 m high
and form a thick copse. The copse appears on both dry ground and close to
rivers and streams. Willow-herb and common horsetail are often seen where
the willow stands on dry ground. Willow at rivers and streams often has
high grasses and the edible angelica as near neighbours. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Herb-slopes</B> are luxuriant plant communities, rich in herbs of many
kinds. They are found on south slopes with sufficient water supply throughout
the summer and during the winter protected by snow. Often herb-slopes are
fresh green spots directly under vertical rocks. The vegetation is dominated
by broad-leaved, sappy herbs as angelica and cluster-flowered lady's-mantle.
Grasses and brackens are common on herb slopes close to water. Typical herb-slopes
cannot be found in the inner parts of the country as the summer is too dry
and the snow cover in the winter too thin. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fell-field</B> are wind-exposed plant communities with low and sparse
vegetation. The vegetation is found on solifluction soils, patterned ground
and rocky ravines. The higher mountains the more fell-field you will experience.
On hiking routes through fell-field the common plants are nard sedge, broad-leaved
willow-herb, Arctic poppy and moss campion. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The sour bog</B>s dominated by peat bogs can mainly be found near the
coast line. Due to the springy foundation hiking in areas with moss requires
that the hillwalkers are in good physical form - especially if it rains.
In some bogs dwarf bich and heath plants form large dry tufts between the
mosses.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lichen</B> is dominated by reindeer moss and other moss sorts but grasses
and flower plants can also be seen. Lichen requires complete snow cover
during the winter and is very important to the reindeer population. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fauna</B> <BR>
The area around Kangerlussuaq is richer in mammals and birds and has a larger
mammal density than most of the other regions in Greenland. The large ice-free
inland with the different types of landscape was known as an important summer
hunting place to which hunters from all of Greenland were attracted.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Reindeer</B>. The area between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut has been among
the largest and most productive reindeer areas in Greenland for decades.
Over the past years, however, the population of wild reindeer (tuttu in
Greenlandic) have declined all over Greenland. The calve areas are very
close to the ice cap, northeast to Kangerlussuaq. Reindeer move around a
lot; the coastal areas are grazed in the winter time and the areas near
the ice cap are grazed during the summer.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Musk ox</B> (Umimmak in Greenlandic). Musk oxen from the northern Greenland
were transfered to the Kangerlussuaq area in the beginning of 1963 and 1965.
Musk oxen look like a cross between a sheep and an ox but are a race unto
itself. Today the original 27 &quot;newcomers&quot; from the 1960'ies have
proliferated into about 3,000 animals. The animals are quite stationary
and prefer the area south of Kangerlussuaq towards the ice cap and Paradisdalen.
Keep distance to the animals as they are not very friendly to strangers.
If a group of musk oxen form a ring and the bull steps forward you have
come too close to the oxen. If the bull steps forward and make a feint,
there is a real risk that the animals will attack you. Depending on the
circumstances the critical distance to the animals is approx. 50 m. If you
get too close you should walk away quietly without too much noice and fast
movements. If you keep a distance to the animals they will ignore people
almost completely.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Alpine hare</B> is white throughout the year, however the female hare
turns a bit greyish having given birth to young ones. The youngs are born
in the end of June. Especially in the inland the hare's funny jumping and
&quot;boxing&quot; can be seen quite often. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Arctic fox.</B> The blue and the white Arctic fox are common throughout
Greenland. The white fox is mainly seen in the inland and the blue fox is
more common along the coast line. Foxes in the coastal area prefer areas
with great tide range.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Birds</B>. Around 50 bird species breed in Greenland and around 150 species
are more or less regular migratory birds. Among the small species hikers
will quickly notice the wheatear with its black T on a white tail. The birds
follow the progress of hikers keenly from big stones, warning each other
by clicking sounds that resemble two stones being banged together. The snow
bunting is recognized by its black and white plumage. Together with the
lapland bunting and the redpoll the small birds add a twittering, fluttering
touch to the summer mountain with their hectic courting, nest-building and
egg-laying. The snow bunting breed in rock crevices, the lapland bunting
on the ground and the redpoll in bushes. If hikers in ravines with large
boulders suddenly come across the flapping wings of a female grouse pretending
to be ill, they can be pretty sure that well-camouflaged young lie flattened
in the surrounding vegetation only a few metres away. The charming small
red-necked phalaropes can be seen delicately licking their way along the
edge of lakes, swimming in the water.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ravens</B> can be seen and heard a long way off, never missing a chance
to disturb circling white-tailed eagles. The white tailed eagle, gerfalcon
and the peregrine falcon are more common here than in other regions. The
gerfalcon can be recognized on its white crest and the noisy screems. All
larger bird species breed on inaccessible rocks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Breeding white-fronted </B>gooses can be seen in the inner parts of the
country around Kangerlussuaq. The gooses are easily frightened. Canada gooses
with more pointed wings and characteristic black-white patterns are also
common. Due to flight feather changes the gooses cannot fly during a period
of 3 weeks in the summer. In this period the birds are very vulnerable and
frightened and as a consequence hikers are requested to keep a long distance
to the birds. The area is also a known breeding ground for mallards, long-tailed
ducks and great northern diver while the red-throated diver is a bit more
rare. If your night is disturbed by scary screems the culprit is the breeding
great northern diver. A number of ordinary sea birds can be seen close to
the coast. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Arctic char</B> is the only freshwater fish in this part of Greenland
except from sticklebacks. Most lakes in the highlands are almost without
fishes. Some of the lakes, however, have a small stock of Arctic char. The
seagoing Arctic char returns in the late summer to the river or lake where
it was born, plump, silvery and tasty having eaten caplin and other marine
delicacies all summer. Along the coast and in the head of the fjord in Sisimiut
municipality some of the richest char rivers can be found. Apart from the
char the angler can catch Atlantic and Greenland cod. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mosquitoes</B>. Among the many insects in Greenland the mosquitoes draw
the attention to themselves in a rather unpleasant way. As the animal life
is rich and the climate is relatively mild and warm in the inner part of
the country the mosquitoes are numerous. In some very dry summers where
the small punds in which the mosquitoes lay their eggs dry out, the nuisance
is not so intense. Nevertheless repellants are required. The mosquitoes
disappear after the first night frosts. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Polar bears</B> are never seen in this part of the country.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rabies</B> has been very common in this area, but now it has been reduced
significantly. However it is adviceable to take simple precautions. The
white and blue Arctic foxes are usually shy and avoid people. If a fox behaves
unnaturally and comes forward to people in stead of running away you should
be on the alert and try to scare the fox away. Rabies is transmitted through
bites and spittle. Therefore all cooking gear, food and cutlery should be
taken into the tent at night. Rabies bites must be treated with medicine
within a few days after a bite. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Geology</B><BR>
2500 million years ago the Nassuttoqid folding was created. Since then many
processes and displacements have given the mountains and valleys its present
form. Approx. 3 million years ago the icing of Greenland started. 1 - 2
million years ago the ice cap was covering all of Greenland and at the coldest
spots it reached the Davis Street. Large amounts of ice covered the area
between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut until the ice cap receded 8 - 10,000
years ago after which the present landscape was formed. Many of the boulders
lying on quite unmotivated spots were tranported here with the ice from
the central part of Greenland and left behind when the ice melted. Since
the ice melted along the coast the land has raised and today sediments from
the sea can be seen up to 120 m above sea level. <BR>
<BR>
In the area between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut many variants of the common
rock can be found. The light coloured Ikertoq-gneiss dominates the area.
Contrary to granite gneiss is characterized by being different on different
surfaces. Due to the relative softness of the Ikertoq gneiss the long lakes
and fjords which dominate the landscape have been formed through planing
from glacier tongues. Amphibolite can be seen as long dark stripes in the
gneiss. In amphibolite red and brown garnets are common. In Kangerlussuaq
garnets the size of tennis balls have been found. 
<H4>THE AREA AROUND KANGERLUSSUAQ</H4>
<B>North of Kangerlussuaq</B> the area is hilly and it is easy to walk in.
There are many lakes of various sizes. The dry climate makes it easy to
walk even 3 - 500 m above sea level. On hikes in this area fording is rarely
necessary. As there are only a few special marks in the area it can be difficult
to orientate. The lakes are the main characteristics in the area.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Towards the ice cap</B> the climate is very dry. As the sunlight is very
intense the evaporation is very high - especially on south slopes. These
seem very barren and parched. This is also characteristic for the valleys
Sandflugtsdalen and &Oslash;rkendalen where you can find areas with shifting
sand, sand hills and lyme grass. The way to the ice cap goes through &Oslash;rkendalen
and the road/wheel track east-north east. The sand has been grinded from
Greenland's bedrock and deposited at the end of &quot;dead&quot; glaciers
(glaciers that do not reach to the sea). The melt water river in Sandflugtdalen
Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua (Watson River) brings large amounts of sand and silt.
This can make quicksands so do not ford. The water is very cold, streaming
from under the ice it is approx. 0,5&#176; C. Musk oxen can often be seen
on the south side of the river. The ice cap is around 50 - 60 m high and
is very impressive to look at. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Isunngua</B> means &quot;land of the little hills&quot; and are a number
of small hills 5 - 700 m above sea level with steep sides between two glaciers.
During the summer the area around point 575 close to the ice cap is not
very suitable for ordinary hillwalkers. Meltwater makes it very difficult
to cross the rivers but by means of ice axes, rope, straps and anti skids
and many detours it is possible to reach the point. Expeditions crossing
the ice cap climb down from the ice at this point.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kangerlussuaq - Israndss&oslash;en - Isunngua (approx 90 km - demanding
route)</B>. Follow the road towards the ice cap and turn left at Sugarloaf
where the road forks. Take bearing of a hollow in the northern lying hills.
The route is quite demanding and you should choose the easiest way to the
hollow - just remember to keep a northern course. The first target is the
brook between the lake Sanningasoq and the lake Aajuitsup Tasia where you
can camp. At the brook there is a red/white mark (1996) where the brook
can be passed. Having passed the brook walk around the lake Aajuitsup Tasia
on its northern banks. The hike continues along the valley and the edge
of the ice. The terrain rises through a valley with many beautiful waterfalls.
From here you reach a lake which you follow until you reach a small melt-water
river. If it is possible to cross the river at the red/white mark (1996)
you can continue some kilometres in northeastern direction to a large waterfall
under the Isunngua glacier and camp here. After the detour you walk back
to the lake and cross the melt-water river and from here you continue in
northwestern direction along the small river and four small lakes which
you follow on the left side. The ground is rising. At some spots there are
very steep sides towards the lakes. At Israndss&oslash;en, the lake at the
edge of the ice cap, there are good camping possibilities. If you continue
after the Israndss&oslash;en it gets difficult to orientate. From the south
end of the lake you take bearing of a col in southwest direction. Approx.
halfway over the col there is a mark on the rock face. Pass the col and
walk between two small lakes. After the lakes the terrain gets more demanding
and there are some tough up's and down's over ridges and valleys until the
foot of the point 581-mountain. From the top of point 581 you can see all
the way around the icecap. At the top there is a cairn with a book in which
visitors should write their names. The route continues along the ridge south
of the glacier valley to point 543. From point 543 and back to Kangerlussuaq
there are only a few characteristic points in the terrain which makes it
difficult to orientate. From the top of point 543 continiue in southwest
direction towards the valley. Further through the valley, there is a ridge
which has to be climbed. In front of the ridge there is a small brook. From
the top of the ridge you can look down in a valley that winds its way to
the west. At the far end of the valley there is a large boulder with a mark.
From here you can either climb the mountain or follow the main course around
the mountain. Approx. 3 km further ahead you walk down the mountain and
from here it is easier to orientate. Follow a route south of point 590.
From here the rest of the way to the northwestern end of the lake Sanningasoq
is manageable as the terrain is falling. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Ammalortup Nunaa area towards the south. </B>This area is hilly and
has rocks around 300 - 600 m above sea level. You can walk almost everywhere
even though it might be difficult to orientate. This area is the musk oxen's
favourite place. The differences in the area can be bigger than it seems
from the map and hiking can be quite demanding. In the valleys along the
rivers and lakes it is easier to walk. However the short grass, which is
the musk oxen's favourite make it difficult to walk. The musk ox area is
bounded by large melt-water rivers, the fjord and the sandy delta. Ammalortup
Nunaa is ideal for hiking tours of one weeks duration. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Around Ammalortup Nunaa.</B> The tour takes about 4 - 7 days. Day 1 -
(7 hours): Start at the little river mouthing in the south end of the lake
Tasersuatsiaq. Walk southwest up the ridge. It is easier to walk in the
heights as there are many ravines and steep sides close to the fjord. Certain
parts can be difficult because of the vegetation. The route goes left of
point 468. From here you continue to the river Naqinnera. The view over
the fjord is magnificient. Camping is recommended near the river. Day 2
- (5 - 8 hours): Keep point 380 on your right side until you reach the lakes.
At the southern end of the lakes there is a waterfall ravine from where
you can enjoy the view. If you are tired you can camp a bit further uphill
at the lake. The route continues over rocky ground with scattered vegetation
and small lakes to the south end of the big lake on the northern route marked
on the map. At the lake there are camp sites. (As an alternative route to
lake Ammalortoq you can cross the highland in order to get to the valley
Aasivissuit. In this valley there are many musk oxen and ruins from ancient
hunting camps) Day 3 - (7 - 8 hours): Today's walk continue in the highland
towards the south end of lake 450. The route is hilly and it is necessary
to use a compass as there are only a few characteristic points in the terrain.
Keep a northeastern compass course and after the big lakes you continue
in eastern direction and pass many lake systems. There are many possibilities
of studying birds and botany around the lake. The route might seem a bit
long but the climbings and descents are not steep. Day 4 - (6 - 7 hours):
The last stretch is downhill to the edge of the lake Ammalortoq. You walk
east passing the hills on the northern side and walk along many small lakes.
En route you can overlook the whole valley. At Ammalortoq you can camp on
the northern side of the river. When returning to Kangerlussuaq you can
continue in the highland in northeastern direction and pass the lake Orsuarnisaarajuttoq
on its south side or return following other routes through the pass at Perserajuut.
Store Salts&oslash; north of Tasersuatsiaq is worth visiting. On the west
side of the lake the musk oxen lick salt in the thick moss. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kangerlussuaq - lake Tasersuatsiaq - lake Orsuarnisaarajuttoq - lake
Ammalortoq (approx 27 km):</B> Ammalortoq is a good starting point for hikes
in the area. The tour (one way) - can be done in 1 - 2 days. Day 1 (5 hours):
Start at the south end of lake Tasersuatsiaq. If you take the route north
of the lake you will find some interesting plant communities, however this
route is a bit steeper than the route south of the lake. At the eastern
lying river mouthing in the lake there are places with green grass and a
wonderful view and if you do'nt want to continue you can find a good camp
site here. When continuing, follow the river through the ravine on your
left. On the left hillside garnet crystals in the dark amphibolite can be
found. Day 2 ( 8 - 9 hours): The day's stretch starts with a longer rise
to a pass with many small lakes. On the horizon the icecap can be seen faintly
for the first time on this tour. The stretch along the lake Orsuarnisaarajuttoq
is easiest to walk on the south side. Certain passages en route are on sand
but will not cause problems. At the end of the lake you walk uphill through
the pass. From here you can enjoy the view over the lake Ammalortoq. From
the pass continue left around a small lake and walk through a natural hollow
directly versus the middle of the lake Ammalortoq. En route you can see
herb-slopes and hares. Stay on the right side of the river. On the way to
the lake you will pass northern willow. <BR>
<BR>
The lake Ammalortoq is worth a longer stay. The north beach is sand and
gravel and the south beach is clay. Some of the clay stretches contain minerals
similar to the ones in quicksands. South of the lake there is a magnificient
view. Here the river has formed a canyon-like ravine with thundering fosses.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Amitsorsuaq lake (west) (Map </B>2) In the western end of the large
lake Amitsorsuaq Sisimiut Tourism (see adress) has made an activity centre
with accommodation facilites and canoes. The centre is manned during the
summer. The distance from Kangerlussuaq harbour to the eastern side of the
lake is approx 22 km (one long day's walk). Here you can stay overnight
and paddle on to the canoe centre ( 20 km) the following day and stay a
few days. Against payment Kangerlussuaq Tourism can arrange transport from
the airport to the harbour which will shorten the walking distance to the
centre. 
<H4>Shorter tours under your own stream around Kangerlussuaq</H4>
There are many excellent alternatives for hiking and bicycle outings, as
there are several kilometres of road, tarmacked and gravelled. The following
tours are just examples on nature experiences in the area.<BR>
<BR>
<B>K&oslash;kkenfjeldet</B> From the airport hotel you walk on the road
leading to the ice cap. At the end of the runway you turn left and walk
up-hill. After the hill you pass a quarry and a small lake. 100 m further
on you will find the road leading to K&oslash;kkenfjeldet<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kellyville - approx. 2 x 18 km</B>. From the airport area, you can walk
or cycle to the harbour and the scientific Kellyville Institute. The road
to the harbour is tarmacked and passes through magnificent, hilly countryside.
On foot, the trip takes about 3 hours each way, or about 1 hour by bike,
depending how fit you are! <BR>
<BR>
<B>The harbour - approx 2 x 13 km</B>. From the airport area, you can walk
or cycle to the fjord.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lake Tasersuatsiaq (Lake Ferguson) - approx 2 x 5 km</B>. From the airport
area, you can walk or cycle to the lake which is the reservoir for Kangerlussuaq.
Roklubben's (The rowing club) building is set amid very scenic surroundings,
on the shores of the 7 km-long lake. While out walking or cycling, you may
be lucky enough to see reindeer and musk oxen, which often graze near the
area backing onto the lake and Roklubben. Following the gravel track by
foot, the walk either way will take about 1 hour, by bike about 1/2 hour.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ravneklippen (Black Ridge) - approx 2 x 6 km.</B> If you wish to see
the inland ice (or ice cap), the sea and the Kangerlussuaq region from above,
you can take a walk to the top of Ravneklippen to the radar house from where
you can enjoy the impressive view of the entire region. If you're lucky,
there may also be reindeer and musk oxen nearby. From the Radar House, you
can follow the path that climbs to an old landing radar installation dating
back to the American era. From there, you will also have a splendid view
of the hinterland. The path is gravelled, and the walk either way takes
roughly 1-2 hours. You can extend your hike to the lake Store Salts&oslash;.
On the west side of the lake the musk oxen lick salt in the thick moss.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sugar Loaf - approx. 2 x 8 km</B>. Having passed the golf course and
if you feel up to a longer walk, follow the gravel path alongside the stream
leading to the ice cap or rent a bike for the tour. As the name implies,
Sugar Loaf is a mountain reminiscent of an old-fashioned sugar loaf. <BR>
Once you have reached Sugar Loaf, you can walk up the mountainside to the
end of the path. From the top you can overlook the fjord on the west and
the ice cap on the eastern side. On foot, the trip will take about 2 hours
each way; by bike about 1/2 hour either way. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Elvfossen - approx 2 x 10 km.</B> Having passed Sugarloaf follow the
track and turn right towards the waterfall. Meltwater from the icecap runs
through a bottleneck in the rocks towards the river. End of June to the
end of August are the best months to enjoy the waterfall as the melting
is at its peak in these months.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The inland ice - approx. 2 x 25 km</B>. This hike takes its toll and
is a full day's walk, though it is definitely the most imposing walk of
all and worth every last ounce of physical exertion. On a good summer's
day, the hike to the inland ice is a manageable project, as the entire path
is readily accessible. If you have only a short time to spare, you can return
the same day, however this calls for good leg muscles. The ideal solution
is to spend a few days with a tent and sleeping bag, if you have the chance.
Follow the path eastwards from the airport area, past Sugar Loaf on the
north side. From here, follow the wheel track towards the inland ice. Do
remember warm top clothing, as it is cooler at the inland ice. Pay attention
to the ice - it is very dangerous if you get hit by falling iceblocks. Remember
this when putting up your tent. When returning you can walk the same way
as before or follow the ridge between Sandflugtdalen and Aajuitsup Tasia.
It is easy to walk on the ridge and if you are in luck you can see reindeer.<BR>
<BR>
Remember to observe the safety signs, as the inland ice can calve at any
time! And whatever you do, don't walk on the wet, sandy surfaces as these
may be quicksands. Due to the quicksands and the strong current it is too
dangerous to cross the stream. On your way back, take the lower car track
which passes American aircraft wrecks. People who are fit will manage the
walk to the inland ice and back in about 8 hours, not counting a short stop
at the ice. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bicycle outings </B><BR>
From about May 1st, when the roads are free of ice, to about September 15th,
the area around Kangerlussuaq has plenty of bicycle outings to offer. Please
obtain further information from Kangerlussuaq Tourism.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Skiing</B><BR>
In the winter, Kangerlussuaq Tourism rents cross-country skis, ski boots
and bob-sleighs. It is possible to go on a cross-country skiing expedition
from Kangerlussuaq to Sisimiut on the Arctic Circle Race route. The route
is approx 160 km. The best period is from mid March to mid April. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Angling</B> <BR>
<B>Lake Tasersuatsiaq</B>. Fine lake-fishing for Arctic char sized 500 -
1,500 g, some larger fish up to 2 - 3 kg. Good fly-fishing amenities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Kangerlussuaq Fjord</B>. From the end of May to the middle or end of
July the fjord water is slightly unclear at times.Very fine coastal fishing
for char sized 1 - 2 kg with good chances of fish sized 2 - 3 kg; possibility
of trophy fish up to 4 - 5 kg.<BR>
<BR>
<B>River Robinson</B>. Mid-late July until the middle of September. Strong-flowing
river, slightly unclear water. Fish: as under coastal fishing.<BR>
<BR>
Fishing in the lakes in the environs of Kangerlussuaq. If your walks take
you south of Kangerlussuaq Harbour, approx. 8 - 12 hours' hike in the direction
of the great lakes of the inland, there are good facilities for Arctic char
fishing. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Transport facilities for fishing</B>. Arrangements for transportation
to the fishing sites can be made by Kangerlussuaq Tourism. Transportation
to the fishing sites in the fjord and to Robinson River is by boat and takes
1 - 2 hours. Kangerlussuaq Tourism also arranges a day's fishing trip by
helicopter during July-August.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dog sledding</B><BR>
A dog sled trip is the experience of a lifetime. Providing you book in good
time, you can even try this Greenlandic winter amusement in Kangerlussuaq
. Dog sled drivers from Sisimiut often do trips from Kangerlussuaq. A dog
sled tour from Kangerlussuaq to Sisimiut takes 3 days but shorter tours
can also be arranged.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Accommodation in Kangerlussuaq <BR>
Kangerlussuaq Hotel</B> has three hotel buildings with some 190 hotel rooms.
Some rooms have en suite facilities, while the rest have good toilet and
bathing facilities on the same floor. In addition to this there are cheap-rate
dormitories (sleep-ins).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camp School.</B> Sheraton, Hilton, Claridge and Condo are the slightly
humorous names given by the Americans to the buildings in the Old Camp,
which is today an excellent camp school. There are about 100 beds in total,
with access to communal facilities. Further information on camp school in
Kangerlussuaq is available from Kangerlussuaq Tourism and Team Arctic.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cabins</B>. Some cabin owners in Kangerlussuaq rent cabins to hiking
tourists. These cabins vary, ranging from primitive to superior in standard.
Contact Kangerlussuaq Tourism for further details.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campsite</B>. The campsite near the landing strip at Greenlandair's freight
terminal is used from spring to autumn by hiking tourists wishing to stay
in the Kangerlussuaq airport area. Check-in is at the airport hotel's reception,
providing access to toilet, bathing huts and washing machines in C corridor.
On site, you will find tables, benches and a barbecue. In the Kangerlussuaq
area, you can get out into the countryside in a matter of minutes, and outside
the built-up area there are splendid areas for camping, e.g. at the foot
of Sugar Loaf.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lockers for campers</B>, etc. Against a small fee luggage you wish to
leave behind can be deposited at Kangerlussuaq Tourism. This is only possible
during the summer season.<BR>

</H1>
<BR>
<B>The nature</B><BR>
Greenland's impressive nature has attracted hikers for decades. The high
beautiful mountains, glaciers, ice-filled fjords, the flora and fauna the
untouched nature and the silence provide the unique experience of the Arctic.
The air is so clear that mountains can be seen from a distance of 75 - 200
km and one can be in the wilderness for days without meeting other people.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commandments for hiking</B><BR>
Hiking in Greenland, outside inhabited areas, is mainly for experienced
hikers and provide that your physical condition and sense of direction are
good and that you know how to use a map and a compass.<BR>
<BR>
On longer tours you have to be able to enjoy untouched nature far away from
the nearest inhabited place. A sensible attitude to adopt is the assumption
of being left completely to one's own devices. Only very limited assistance
is available for the hillwalker, such as for example marked paths, designated
routes, signposting, bridges and suchlike. <BR>
<BR>
The following rules of the mountains are a good help when going about the
nature. By keeping these rules the risk of accidents en route will be reduced.<BR>
<BR>
1. Don't start off on long walks without some previous training and planning<BR>
2. Let someone know where you're heading and when you expect to be back.<BR>
3. Pay attention to the weather and the weather reports. <BR>
4. Listen to experienced hikers.<BR>
5. Be prepared for bad weather and accidents, even on short walks.<BR>
6. Always remember a map and compass.<BR>
7. Never go alone.<BR>
8. Turn back before things get chritical.<BR>
9. Conserve your strength; look for shelter while there is still time<BR>
10. Always take along the necessary emergency gear.<BR>
11. Always bring extra warm clothes - even on short day tours.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Choice of route and hiking technique</B><BR>
Before starting off, the route must be carefully planned. Difficult passages
must be taken under consideration before making the final decision of the
route. It is important to be in good form and remember; it is your holiday!
Even the weakest on the team must be able to complete the day's march without
getting totally exhausted. Allow good time to complete the route and for
delays so you have time to climb a mountain, see a ruin or simply stay a
day or two at a beautiful spot. Allow for 1 - 2 demurrage days per week
in consequense of rain, wind or fog. Avoid too many climbings and descents
which will tax your energy. As a guideline you can walk 3 - 4 km per hour
on even ground. You will need approx. 1 hour extra everytime you climb or
descent 300 m. Take a break every hour and drink something hot or eat chocolate
or dried fruit in order to avoid an insufficient blood sugar balance.<BR>
<BR>
When everything is planned you must inform the authorities (the police,
friends, family, hotel, or the tourist office) of the planned route, estimated
duration etc. - and remember to inform them on your return. The planned
route must be followed as strictly as possible as this is where a search
will be initiated in case of emergencies. If you are too far away from the
planned route there is a risk that you will not be found.<BR>
Routes on this map<BR>
The recommended routes on this map are marked with different colours; Green
&gt; blue &gt; red &gt; black indicating the increasing level of difficulty.
The easiest routes - green and blue - are either on or close to beaten track.
Since they often follow unsurfaced roads, valleys or fjords, the need to
be able to read contour lines and find one&#180;s way and position using
a map and a compass is limited, so there is little risk of getting lost.
Hiking on recommended red and black routes calls for a greater sense of
direction, physical fitness and hiking experience. <BR>
<BR>
The routes on this map are only a small selection of the actual possibilities
in the terrain. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sense of locality</B><BR>
In Greenland there are several places with metal ores in the underground
which influences on the compass and makes it difficult to find one's way.
As a consequence it is important to make note of the landform and the characteristics
of the nature, for example a large mountain, a certain lake etc. and compare
these observations with the information on the map. The routes are unmarked
- however some are marked with cairns. As a supplement to the compass we
recommend mileometer, altimeter and protractor for maps.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Compass declination</B><BR>
In Greenland there is a significant compass declination, this is indicated
on the map.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wind and weather</B><BR>
The weather in Greenland changes a lot faster than in other countries. In
10 - 15 minutes it can be fogged and thereby be difficult to find one's
way or it can be storm and be necessary to seek shelter for several hours
before continuing the tour. Make sure your equipment is geared for sudden
changes in the weather. Most people who suffer death in the mountains do
not die of hunger but of frost.<BR>
<BR>
Kangerlussuaq has a typical continental climate owing to its great distance
from the open sea. That makes for dry, warm summers with temperatures up
to 18 - 20&#176;C, but conversely cold winters with temperatures that can
drop right down to -50&#176;C. From end November to mid-June, the fjord
is frozen. Not nearly as much snow falls in Kangerlussuaq as in other coastal
towns. The sun ducks below the horizon on November 22nd and reemerges, radiantly,
on January 22nd, after an absence of precisely 2 months. From mid-April
to mid-August, it is light 24 hours a day, but because of the mountains,
there is no midnight sun.<BR>
<BR>
The temperatures mentioned below indicate the temperatures in the different
months. However it is a good idea to bring gloves and a cap - even in the
summer, as it can be very cold when the wind blows. <BR>
<BR>
The best months for hiking are from the middle of June to the end of August.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mean temperature - Celcius</B><BR>
April -11,4, May 1,4, June 10,5, July 11,6, August, 6,7, September 3,1,
October -3,6.<BR>
<BR>
Foehn is a dry and warm wind. It arises from a high-pressure area east or
northeast of Greenland from where the wind blows over the sea and crosses
the inland ice towards a low-pressure area west of Greenland. In western
Greenland the wind comes down from the mountains as a warm, dry and often
very intense wind from the south east. The foehn can be portended by black/blue
lens-shaped clouds over the inland ice and fall in the barometric pressure.
The temperature on the west coast rises at the same time as the foehn breaks
through with great intensity. The foehn can last for days and occur several
times during the same month. Only very few tents can stand the pressure
from a foehn storm and therefore we recommend you to dismantle the tent
and seek shelter behind big and heavy rocks. A foehn storm seldom lasts
more than 1 - 2 days. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing and equipment</B><BR>
When hiking in the Greenlandic nature it is important to be able to take
care of one-self as you will often be far away from inhabited areas. Therefore
it is important to be prepared for an emergency situation beforehand - even
if your trip is just for the weekend. Plan the tour carefully and make sure
you have sufficient supplies and emergency equipment along with the ordinary
hiking gear. The clothes must protect against the cold, the wind, precipitation,
the sun and the heat and it is a good idea to dress so the bodytemperature
can be regulated through the day. Three layers of clothing is recommended;
the inner layer must keep you warm even though the clothes get wet, the
middle layer must insulate against the cold and the outer layer must be
wind and rain proof. We recommend you to bring:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing:</B> &#183;Underwear, preferably woollen &#183;Extra socks &#183;Underwear
with long legs and sleeves allowing perspiration to escape &#183;Canvas
or cotton clothing &#183;Warm sweater or fleeced sweatshirt &#183;rain and
windproof jacket and trousers &#183;Cap and finger gloves &#183;Good hiking
boots &#183;Shorts and T-shirts for warm days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camp cookware:</B> &#183;Trangia cooking gear including sufficient methylated
spirits or stove and pots including sufficient fuel bottles &#183;Mug, plates
and cups &#183;Cutlery &#183;Bottles or thermo bottle for water &#183;Salt,
pepper and spices &#183;Plastic bags, lighter etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sleeping gear:</B> &#183;Tent &#183;Sleeping bag &#183;Sleeping pad (insulating)
&#183;Toilet requisities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Security</B>: &#183;Map (and an extra map) &#183;Compass &#183;Emergency
radio and ANNA emergency kit &#183;Extra tent pegs and tent poles &#183;Sewing
kit &#183;Tools for repairs &#183;Multi purpose tools &#183;Strong knife
&#183;Extra chocolate &#183;Shoes for wading &#183;Approx. 20 m strong string.
<BR>
<BR>
We recommend <B>ANNA</B> emergency kit supplemented wih VHF radio or ELT-emergency
transmitter. The kit has been designed especially for Greenlandic conditions
and includes instructions in Danish, English and Greenlandic. The ANNA kit
contains whistle, compass, flares (launching tube + cartridges), signalling
mirror, astro blanket, signal flag and a belt so that the kit can be strapped
around the waist. ANNA emergency kit can be rented at Kangerlussuaq Tourism
in Kangerlussuaq. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Nice to have</B>: &#183;Binoculars &#183;Fishing gear &#183;Handbooks
&#183;Tape or plaster for blisters &#183;Sunglasses &#183;Little ruck-sack
or hip pack &#183;Insect repellant &#183;Head net.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Footwear</B>. Much hiking in Greenland takes place on soil that does
not drain particularly well. Hiking boots of gore-tex are worth considering.
They are waterproof while allowing foot perspiration to escape. Some chooses
hiking rubber boots which are excellent on rainy days and in landscapes
with many small rivers and streams.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tents</B>. In general tunnel and dome-shaped tents are good in high winds.
In rough weather and high winds, for example foehn, light weight tent pegs
are highly inadequate. High winds can lacerate many of the lightweight materials
used to manufacture tents. Bring a few extra tent pegs and poles - just
in case and secure your tent with stones around the tent pegs and on the
sides of of the tent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Insects/mosquitoes</B>. Bring sufficient supplies of insect repellants
and a head net. In addition to this it is a good idea to wear loose-fitting
clothes that can be properly closed and tightened at your wrists or ankles.
Some hikers prefer to walk in the evening/night and sleep during the day
as the mosquitoes are less active in the evening. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplies</B>. On hiking tours in Greenland it is necessary to bring all
special provisions from home as there is little or no possibility of buying
groceries en route. Shops and grocery stores in the towns and villages do
not have special products for hikers and mountaineers such as for example
freeze-dried foods. Remember to bring emergency supplies for extra days.
Ordinary groceries and methylated spirits for the cooking gear can be obtained
at the small supermarket &quot;Butikken&quot; in Kangerlussuaq. The supplies
should contain abundant cocoa, coffee, tea, chocolate, dried fruit or biscuits
for breaks and cosy evenings.<BR>
<BR>
As a supplement to the freeze-dried foods you can pick berries and mushrooms
on the hill sides. The common berries in Greenland are crowberries and blueberries
and can be picked from July. The edible mushroom sorts are rough-stremmed
boletus, grisette, &quot;the deceiver&quot; (red amethyst cap.) and horse
mushroom. Before picking mushrooms one should consult literature with pictures.
In addition to berries and mushrooms the food can be varied with fresh fishes.
If you intend to fish you must buy a fishing permit at the local tourist
office or police station. <BR>
<BR>
Regarding drinking water, Greenland has some of the purest water on Earth
and it can be drunk directly from rivers and streams. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Camping and cabins </B><BR>
With few exceptions it is permitted to pitch your tent anywhere in Greenland.
The exceptions are preserved areas and ruins from ancient times as well
as lakes supplying the nearby village or town with fresh water. Please respect
a line of minimum 20 m from any ruin. The Arctic nature is very vulnerable
and demands extra attention and consideration. Please bear this in mind
when choosing the camp site. Leave the area the way you wish to refind it
and leave nothing but footprints. Burn your trashes or bring it along when
the tour continues. As a general rule a good campsite is a place where the
ground is flat and the pegs can get a purchase and/or a place with large
boulders to which to lash the tent down. Another important consideration
is a site protected by the terrain with running water close by. Avoid dry
river beds or lowlying areas close to rivers as a camp here will easily
be flooded in case of heavy rain. <BR>
<BR>
In Greenland the cabins are few and far between, however, practice in Greenland
is to make remote chalets available to everyone and therefore they will
rarely be locked. For the same reason comfort is sparse and chalets in this
category are seldom particularly well-kept or clean. Originally the cabins
were built for hunters who use the cabins on hunts far away from the villages.
Overnight accommodation is usually free of charge.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fording</B><BR>
During a hike it will often be necessary to ford rivers. According to a
rule of thumb, one should never wade deeper than up to the knees. Otherwise
it is best to wait for the water level to drop (approx. 24 hours after heavy
rain). Another idea is to follow the river upstream to a better fording
place or do the exact opposite; go to the outflow and wade across at the
next low tide. It is a good idea to bring along a pair of rubber shoes as
special &quot;waders&quot; which it does not matter if you get wet. These
will give you a much better grip on smooth and sharp stones. Some form of
wading stick also increases safety considerably.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire</B><BR>
Due to the Arctic climate the land around Kangerlussuaq is very dry. A fire
in the hills would be a catastrophe for the area as fire on peat soil can
spread under the vegetation and appear on the surface miles away from the
ignition place. As a consequence extra attention to the risk of fire is
required; do not stub out a cigarette on the earth, make your campfires
in moisted areas, i.e. close to lakes and rivers or on stones - not directly
on the dry earth. Put stones around the campfire and do not leave the fireplace
until the fire has burnt out or been extinguished with water. Stoves and
cooking gear must be placed on an uninflammable foundation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Quicksands</B><BR>
At many places - especially close to the ice cap there are quicksands so
be careful when crossing the rivers. Places with vegetation and large boulders
should be safe. Colour changes in the sand are not necessarily a sign of
quicksands.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Search and rescue parties </B><BR>
Search and rescue parties are the job of the police all over Greenland.
As a general rule a rescue is free of charge for the victim. If the accident,
however, was self-induced or was due to an act of folly or the rescue party
was called unnecessarily the police can issue an invoice to the victim.
Each case is evaluated by the police and the police decides whether the
victim must take a part of the costs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Survival technique</B><BR>
When going on hikes you must always be prepared for the worst. In case of
emergencies or accidents it is important to keep one's head, avoid panic
and not to give up. Accidents are never the same and it is impossible to
make a list of how to avoid the different types of accidents or how to behave
in each situation. However, the first rule is to give emergency treatment,
to stabilize the situtation and to keep the injured person warm and protected
against sun, coldness rain and wind. After this you can look for help. A
large team can be divided in two and minimum two persons can look for help.
Remember to mark the place of the accident on the map. If you know there
are other hikers in the area or you can see/hear a helicopter/ aircraft,
you can use the flares or the whistle from the ANNA emergency kit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire.</B> If you have lost the last match fire can be made the primitive
way by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other or by means of a burning-glass
from a magnifying glass, binoculars or a lens.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Finding one's way</B>. Without map and compass it is almost impossible
to find one's way. However, if you loose both of your compasses you can
find the four points of the compass with a fairly accurate watch. Before
noon (12.00) the four points can be found by letting the hour hand point
towards the sun and halve the distance between the hour hand and the number
12. This direction is south. In the afternoon (after 12.00) the distance
between the number 12 and the hour hand is south.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Being found</B>. If you have had an accident and you want to be found
it is important to draw the attention to yourself in a very obvious way.
This can be done by making signals with whistle, mirrors, flares, distress
rockets, SOS in oversize, flags, clothing etc. It is important that the
signals can be seen from the air, as most rescue parties take place with
helicopter. Do not discharge the flares until you can hear a helicopter
as they only lighten for a short period. When signalling with a mirror in
nice weather, an aircraft can see you from a distance of 75 km. Many people
are found too late because they did not make themselves visible from the
air or left the planned route. If you are close to inhabited areas or in
an area with other hikers, you can blow the whistle 6 times/minute every
second minute. Answer to this signal is 3 whistles/minute.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fishing permits </B><BR>
Fishing and hunting permits can be purchased from Kangerlussuaq Tourism
or from the police. Char fishing in the Kangerlussuaq area starts on July
1st and ends on August 30th. Please check with Kangerlussuaq Tourism or
