<H1><CENTER>Hiking, kayakking and mountaineering around the Tasermiut fjord:</CENTER>
</H1>
<B>TASERMIUT FJORDEN - NANORTALIK</B><BR>
The Tasermiut Fjord is 75 km-long and is characterized by imposing mountains,
to which any climber cannot help but be attracted, but there are also ample
opportunities for the &quot;commonplace&quot; hillwalker. The fjord winds
its way northeast from Nanortalik and ends at the face of the tidewater
Tasermiut glacier, which spills steeply down from the inland ice. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tasiusaq</B> is the only village in the Tasermiut Fjord apart from the
sheepfarms. The village has approx. 90 inhabitants who mainly live by fishing
and hunting. However the sheepfarming is closely related to the village
as sheep and lamb can be seen in the village throughout the summer. Tasiusaq
has a small KNI general store with a limited selection of food and a postoffice
from where you can call home or send a fax. If you go on a hiking tour you
are advised to buy your supplies in your home country or in Nanortalik.
In 1986 the village got a new school where children are taught until the
6th grade. After this the school education continues at a boarding school
in Nanortalik. The school has kitchen and bathing facilities which - to
a limited extent - can be used by visitors. The church is from 1992. From
Tasiusaq there is a KNI-liner shuttling to Nanortalik. Reservation can be
made at Nanortalik Tourist Office or KNI's office. Due to a limited capacity
on the boat you are advised to book in advance. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Aappilattoq</B> is the easternmost of 5 villages in Nanortalik municipality
and has approx. 220 inhabitants. Some years ago there were many settlements
and villages in the Cape Farewell country but after they were abandoned,
the people have moved to Aappilattoq. Some of Aappilattoq's inhabitants
even moved here from the East Coast. This marks the village in general as
a more Eastgreenlandic village and a more traditional Greenlandic lifestyle
can be seen here. The village is very isolated and the ways of transportation
to and from the village are not very welldeveloped. The field ice from the
East Coast flowing with the current contribute to the isolation of Aappilattoq
as the ice can make it impossible to sail for several months. Normally Aappilattoq
is isolated by the field ice from May to July. When it is impossible to
sail, a Bell 212 helicopter for 9 passengers takes care of the transportation
of people and supplies to and from Nanortalik. The people in Aappilattoq
mainly live by hunting and fishing. Aappilattoq is the tannery Great Greenland's
main supplier of seal skin. Another of Aappilatoq's tradition is hunt for
polar bear. The hunters go on long boat tours in their small dinghies to
the East Coast. On their hunting tours they stay in tents or primitive cabins.
In Aappilattoq there is a KNI general store with food supplies, fuel and
other necessities and a postoffice. The church was built in 1986. In the
school the children are taught until the 6th grade. After this they go to
the boarding school in Nanortalik. The school in Aappilatoq has kitchen
and bathing facilities which - to a limited extent - can be used by visitors.
From Aappilattoq there are weekly departures with the KNI liner to Nanortalik.
En route the boat stops in the village Frederiksdal. Due to the limited
capacity it is advised to book in good time.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Qinngua Dalen</B> (Qinngua Valley) also known as Paradisdalen is
the only woodland in Greenland. It is not a forrest in the european sense
of the word but a forrest of birch (Betula pubescens) and northern willow
(Salix glauca) where most trees are 3 - 4 m high and some of them up to
8 m. It is a very vigorous valley and apart from the trees more than 300
different plants can be found here. Nanortalik municipality has made the
Qinngua Dalen a nature reserve where it is forbidden to interfere in the
nature, i.e. it is not allowed to collect plants, cut down trees, hunt or
fish. Naturally it is also forbidden to disturb bird nests or collect eggs
from these. It is allowed to camp in the area but only under careful consideration
for the nature. Apart from the flora the Qinngua Dalen offers a fantastic
landscape, there is a lake, a river, lowlying country and twisted alpine
mountains with glacier tongues. In addition to this there are traces of
the Norsemen - close to the river you can see the ruins of a Norseman's
farm. (Unfortunately it is eroding away due to its location close to the
river). A very wellpreserved sheepfold can also be seen.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Klosterdale</B>n. Here the Norsemen had one of two monasterys. (In
the Uunnartoq fjord there is a convent). The monastery in the Klosterdalen
was for monks of the Augustinian order. It was a small monastery with small
houses, stables, storerooms and folds for animals. Further up in the valley
there are some saeter cottages. The monastery is situated in the middle
of a fantastic landscape with giant rocks, river, ice and a vigorous nature.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The icecap and glaciers</B>. The icecap is approx. 1,800,000 km2. At
the highest level the ice cap is 3,200 m above sea level. Its thickest point
is 3,500 m. At the edge of the inland ice the highest mountain peaks are
higher than the ice cap. These peaks are called &quot;Nunatakker&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
The inland ice ends at the bottom of the Tasermiut fjord from where it rises
to 1,400 m above sea level. On the east side of the ice it is possible to
go ashore and get so close to the ice that you can touch it. The glacier
is active but only smaller pieces of ice calves into the fjord. However
the ice pieces are large enough to be dangerous - even for large boats as
they make waves which can cause capsizing or make the boat strike against
the rocks. Kayakkers are therefore advised to keep a long distance to the
glacier and all icebergs passing. <BR>
<BR>
At present the glacier in the Tasermiut Fjord is drawing back. This can
be seen by the large barren rubbing from the ice on the rock faces. The
Sermitsiaq glacier on the right side of the fjord is one of two glaciers
in the Tasermiut fjord and has covered the landscape all the way down to
the fjord. Now it has drawed itself back 1,5 km. There are photographs of
the glacier made in 1894 where the Sermitsiaq glacier touched the fjord.
In average this means the glacier has drawed itself back approx. 15 m per
year.<BR>
<BR>
In 1881 the polar explorar Gustav Holm visited the Sermitsiaq glacier and
in his description he writes about some Norsemen's graves getting covered
with ice in the Dalen now filled with Sermitsiaq. Gustav Holm setted out
in order to find the descendants of the Norsemen. In stead he found out
that the East Coast of Greenland was an inhabited and not a deserted place.
Sermitsiaq is the best described glacier in Tasermiut. Around 1833 the glacier
was described as increasing in size and to have reached the fjord but not
producing icebergs. Around 1876 the glacier produced iceberg over a large
front but soon after - in 1881 the glacier was thinning out. This caused
the creation of a beach between the main part of the glacier and the fjord.
According to the description the glacier only touched the fjord at one spot.
The thinning out seems to have taken place through most of this century
even though it has increased since the mid 1920'ies.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding the Sermeq glacier in the bottom of the fjord there are no descriptions
before 1880. From these sources it seems that the glacier broadened to its
maximum size between 1880 and 1890 after which it has been drawing back
until 1960, all together 1 km. Since 1960 it seems that the front of the
glacier has stabilised at one spot where the glacier is very steep; coming
from a level of 1,400 m into the fjord - a distance of only 3 km.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fauna<BR>
Birds</B>. In the area the following birds can be seen; White tailed eagles,
gyr falcons, ravens, snowy owls (very rare), snow buntings, redpolls, wheatears,
red necked phalaropes, purple sandpipers, different kinds of gulls, ptarmigans,
red breasted mergansers, red throated divers/ loons, Great northern divers,
Cormorants, br&uuml;nnich's Guillemots - alk in Greenlandic, black guillemots,
common eiders, king eiders, long tailed ducks, puffins, mallards, dovekies
and many other. <BR>
<BR>
<B>White tailed eagle.</B> The white tailed eagle can often be seen in the
Tasermiut Fjord where they have their nests. Up to 6 eagles have been seen
hovering together. The eagles have a number of nests in the fjord and are
not to be disturbed. Stay far away from the breeding ground and watch the
eagles through your binoculars instead. The older birds can be identified
by the yellow beak and their white taile which they get when they are between
4 and 6 years old. The length of the birds is approx. 90 cm and the wing
spang up to 230 cm. This makes the eagle the biggest breeding bird in Greenland.
The white tailed eagle enjoy total protection all over Greenland. The white
tailed eagle is a bird of prey who mainly feed on carrion and fish. In the
winter time - when the fjords are frozen the eagles seek to the coast and
can often be seen in the town Nanortalik. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Polar Bear</B>. The name of the town Nanortalik means the &quot;Place
of the Bears&quot;. Only hunters with hunting as their main occupation can
get license to shoot polar bears. Hikers and mountaineers do not have to
fear a meeting with a polar bear as the recommended hiking routes are mainly
out of the routes where polar bears have been seen. The best chances of
meeting a polar bear you will have in the fjords around Aappilatoq and at
Frederiksdal. The polar bears are brought here by the field ice from the
East Coast with the southgoing polar current - normally from January to
June. Polar bears mainly feed on seals so a hiker or mountaineer will not
have priority on the day's menu. During the past 50 years no people have
been attacked by polar bears in South Greenland. A polar bear does not see
very well but in return for that it has a very welldeveloped sense of smell.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Seals</B>. Seals are often seen, especially in the mouth and the bottom
of the Tasermiut Fjord and in the area around Aappilattoq. The most common
seal in the Tasermiut Fjord is the fjord seal also called ringed seal. However,
the harp seal is getting more and more common. The harp seal can be seen
in schools of 10 to 30 individuals who often &quot;jump&quot; out of the
water. From a distance it looks as if the water is boiling. In the Tasermiut
fjord the seals eat arctic char, capellin and Greenland cod (Uvak). Outside
the coasts of Aappilattoq and Nanortalik the hooded seal can be seen. It
comes from the East Coast along with the field ice.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Whales</B>. From August to October you can be sure to see minke whale
in the mouth of the Tasermiut fjord and if you are in luck, you can meet
minke whale everywhere from the mouth of the fjord to the village Tasiusaq.
Humpback whale and killer whale can also be seen but mainly in the mouth
of the fjord. If you should meet a whale when sailing in a kayak, do not
be afraid - even though they get close to you, they are not agressive. Only
the killer whale is a beast of prey which feed on seal, fish and cuttlefish.
If you meet a killer whale it might be wise to seek closer to the coast.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Angling</B><BR>
Especially arctic char but also Greenland cod - Uvak in Greenlandic, spottet
catfish, atlantic salmon and even Greenland shark are the main catch possibilities
for anglers around Nanortalik. Especially at the lake Tasersuaq and the
river Quusuaq it is possible to catch arctic char between 2 - 4 kg. Angling
for Arctic char can also be done in the rivers. In Greenland it is a tradition
not to clean the fishes in the rivers or lakes as it is said to scare the
fishes. As guest in the country you should respect this and clean your fish
away from the rivers. Another advise is only to catch the fish you need
and to use hooks without barb. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sheepfarming</B><BR>
All over South Greenland (Narsaq, Qaqortoq, Nanortalik) there are sheep
farmers, all together around 60 farms with 20,000 sheep. In the Tasermiut
Fjord there are two sheepfarmers, one at Nuugaarsuk - close to Nanortalik
municipality's camp school, the other named &quot;Sapputit&quot; between
Tasiusaq and the lake Tasersuaq. Guests are very welcome at the sheepfarmers.
The farmers can give information on the area and sell fish and meat to the
hikers passing the farms. Please remember that the sheepfarmers fields are
not camp sites. Camping can be done everywhere outside the farms and away
from historic ruins. At Saputit the whole family is good with languages
and very service minded, therefore we recommend you to visit this place.
From time to time it is possible to rent the family's dinghy and sail to
the Qinngua Dalen.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Flora</B>. <BR>
In the mild subarctic climate in the Tasermiut Fjord the vegetation is very
rich. At a summary examination in 1995 59 higher plants were found along
with different kinds of moss, lichen and fungi. In all probability there
are more than 300 higher sorts of plants in the fjord. The vegetation consists
of the plant communities copse, and moor (crowberry, dwarf birch, moss and
lichen). As an example fir-, stiff- and alpine club moss can be seen on
the same place. There are many possibilities of colleting mushrooms from
July to early autumn. However, you should always consult a book with pictures
so you do not collect the poisonous sorts. In the late summer there are
many possibilities for picking arctic blueberries and crowberries. Tea can
be made of the flower Labrador tea which can be collected on the rock faces
near the springs. Arctic thyme is also very common and can give the char
the finishing touch. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Geology</B>. <BR>
The main part of the bedrock in the area around the Tasermiut Fjord is granite.
This make the mountain very suitable for mountaineering. In the mountains
you can find rose quartz and in the rivers it is possible to find small
amounts of gold. Remember - if you plan to take stones and minerals out
of the country you must buy a certificate from the Greenland Home Rule Government.
<BR>
<B>Trekking Tasiusaq - Klosterdalen - TasiusaqFauna</B><BR>
In order to get to the village Tasiusaq you have to travel with the KNI-liner
or charter a boat in Nanortalik. If you choose the KNI-liner, we advise
you to make reservation in advance as the boat's capacity is limited. The
sail takes 2 hours from Nanortalik. As the shop in Tasiusaq has only a small
selection of food you are advised to buy all provisions in either your home
country or in Nanortalik. <BR>
<BR>
From the village Tasiusaq you head north in easy country (area with many
sheep) to the sheep farms Saputit and Saputit Tasia. At Saputit Tasia hillwalkers
are always welcome. Here you can get some good advise, buy smoked whale
meat or smoked char etc. In case of bad weather you can ask for shelter.
From the year 1997 there will be a peat house for rent in the area. The
lake Tasersuaq must be walked on the south side. It will take approx. 1
day to walk from Saputit Tasia to the Qinngua Dalen. Due to the c. 1,5 -
2 metre high bushes it is hard to walk in this country. At the point under
the text &quot;Tasersuaq&quot; two different hiking routes are marked. The
route going up the mountain has many bushes - the other route along the
lake must be walked close to the shore and from time to time it is necessary
to jump from stone to stone.<BR>
<BR>
However, the Qinngua Dalen is worth it all as this is the only woodland
in Greenland. The forrest consist of 5 - 6 m high glandular birch. In the
Qinngua Dalen 300 different plants have been located. The Qinngua Dalen
is a nature reserve and it is forbidden to collect plants, cut down trees,
hunt or fish. Camping is allowed.<BR>
<BR>
From the Qinngua Dalen you follow the river on the east side and walk in
its northeast direction. After a small lake you arrive in an area with many
boulders - a demanding terrain. In June you can still find snow or ice here
which makes it easier to walk. It takes approx. 1/2 - 1 day to walk the
distance between the Qinngua Dalen and the small lake. From here you continue
towards Drepanocladus Dam. Like the previous distance this is demanding
terrain with boulders. You can camp by the mouth of the fjord Kangikitsoq
from where you can enjoy the view towards the Cape Farewell country.<BR>
<BR>
From Kangikitsoq you follow the river in its north direction. Pass the lake
on its west side. The distance from Kangikitsoq to the lake is just as hard
to walk as the two previous distances. After the lake you walk down to the
Klosterdal. Cross the river Uiluit Kuua from a high point or close to its
mouth. It is easier if you do it on the rock face. The Klosterdalen itself
is also hard to walk in as it has a lot of bushes. However the landscape
is fantastic and from the valley you can see to the inland ice in the bottom
of the Tasermiut fjord. The ruin of the monastery is on the north side of
the river. This is worth remembering when you decide where to cross the
river. At the ruin you might see other people for the first time in days
as it is a frequently used recreational area for the people in Nanortalik.
Often the place is used as base camp for mountaineers who try their strength
against the mountain Ketil.<BR>
<BR>
The route going back to Tasiusaq follows the fjord. You have to wade across
a lot of small rivers on the way. Here it is a good idea to wait for the
low tide or to cross the rivers just before dawn before the ice melts and
fills the rivers with water. Just before the river Kuussuaq which leads
to the lake Tasersuaq you will find a plantation of larch. This is an experimental
forrest which is now 25 years old. En route you will pass Nanortalik municipality's
camp school &quot;Nuugaarsuk&quot;. In case of bad weather you can find
shelter here. Accommodation for the night can be booked through the tourist
office before you depart on the hike. If you haven't booked in advance you
can pay after your return to Nanortalik. The camp school's neighbour is
a sheep farmer.<BR>
<BR>
From Kuussuaq it is easy to continue as the sheep have already made paths.
The distance from Kuussuaq to Tasiusaq can therefore be walked in about
3 hours. In Tasiusaq there is a small KNI general store and a post office
from where you can call home.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mountaineering </B><BR>
The landscape in the Tasermiut fjord has been compared with Yosemite in
the USA and Patagonia in South America. From the fjord the mountains rise
almost vertical. The 2003 m high mountain Ketill is one of the greatest
challenges for a mountaineer. Ketil has the world's largest perpendicular
mountainside; over 1400 m. Mountaineers from all over the world flock to
this mountain in order to try their strength against this &quot;Bigwall&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Apart from Ketil there are other challenging mountains in the area; &quot;Kirkespitret&quot;
1287 m, &quot;Tininnertup&quot; 1720 m and &quot;Ularmetorsuaq&quot; with
peaks between 1800 - 1850 m.<BR>
<BR>
Nanortalik Tourist Office offered advice and support for expeditions in
the area in 1996. Over the years the company has collected reports from
ascents in the area.<BR>
Safety. When kayakking you should follow the coastline as far as possible
and make frequent use of your map and a sea chart. Use visible landmarks
to get your bearings, such as points, rivers, mountains and valleys. It
is very important to note there can be long coastal sections where cliffs
fall so vertically that it is impossible to reach land if there is a strong
wind. The South Greenland tides are around 3 m. Waves against a strong tide
can be high. Especially during a Fohn waves can be high. Never paddle too
close to icebergs. If a large iceberg capsizes, it can create a real tidal
wave. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kayakking in Tasermiut Fjord</B><BR>
Suggested route. The kayak tour is an easy 12 - days tour (approx. 110 km).
The tour is organized the way that you have plenty of time to spend 1/2
- 1 day on excursions and/or activities ashore in the fantastic landscape.<BR>
<BR>
The tour starts in Nanortalik at the edge of the field ice (June - July)
and continues into the Tasermiut fjord in its northeast direction. Gradually
the climate changes from cold to mild the longer you paddle into the fjord.
With a clear sky you will be able to see all the way to the inland ice at
the end of the Tasermiut fjord. <BR>
<BR>
The landscape between the field ice and the inland ice is mild with sheep
farms and the only woodland in Greenland and all of that surrounded by high
and steep alpine mountains with glaciers. <BR>
<BR>
Day 1. It is a good idea to start in the afternoon from Nanortalik and paddle
on to Tuapaat, a distance of approx. 3 km. It is an easy start and it will
give you a chance to check the equipment before you get too far away. Highlights.
On the way you get a good view to the Kigisut islands - a traditional summer
hunting place for seals. In June and July you might see some of the ice
near Tuapaat. Salmons can often be seen close to the shore in July and August.
In August and September you can see minke whales. If the wind comes from
the south east the fieldice can be pressed into Tuapaat. Sometimes there
is fog in the area. Overnight. Tuapaat is an abandoned settlement and is
a very good camp site.<BR>
<BR>
Day 2. Start from Tuapaat, end in Tasiusarssuk, a distance of 12 km. Highlights.
Near Tuapaat you can try your luck with the fishing tackle and fish for
Salmon. In the area it is also possible to see minke whale or seals. En
route you will pass the characteristic mountain &quot;Jacobinerhuen&quot;
which looks like a face. In case of wind from the south east the fieldice
can be pressed into the fjord. Overnight at Tasiusarssuk where you can see
ancient Inuit ruins and ruins from the time of the Norsemen. At Tasiusarssuk
there is a small hut for 6 persons which can be used free of charge for
accommodation in case of bad weather. At Tasiusarssuk there is a waterfall
and a good river for arctic char fishing.<BR>
<BR>
Day 3. Start from Tasiusaarssuk, end at the banks south of Tasiusaq, a distance
of approx. 17 km. Highlights. The climate is getting milder and it is a
bit warmer here than in Nanortalik. The temperature difference can be up
to 5 degrees Celcius. In clear weather you can see all the way to the inland
ice.You have to cross the fjord. The best place to do so is at Niagornaq
where the fjord is only 1,7 km wide. As always it is best to cross the water
early in the morning. Overnight. The last 5 km before Tasiusaq are flat
and dry. You will therefore have to go up in the country to find a good
camp site. Comments. In Tasiusaq it is possible to buy additional provisions
and to make phone calls.<BR>
<BR>
Day 4. Start from Tasiusaq, end in Kuussuaq, a distance of approx. 12 km.
Highlights. South of Nuugaarsuk you pass a sheep farm. The red building
is a camp school. This school can be seen from a long distance. South of
point 270 gold has been found. The river Kuussuaq is a very good - but crowded
- place for arctic char fishing. Overnight. There are many good places to
put up your tent. <BR>
<BR>
Day 5. Start from Kuussuaq, end in Qinngua, a distance of approx. 11 km.
You have to carry your kayak c. 500 m when going from the fjord to the lake
Tasersuaq where you will paddle c. 10 km. Highlights. The landscape with
river, valley and lake is very beautiful. A small colony of seagulls and
sometimes sheep can be seen on the &quot;big&quot; island in Tasersuaq.
Overnight. There are many good places to camp near the Qinngua Dalen. Comments.
The Qinngua Dalen is a protected area and it is the only woodland in Greenland.
It is forbidden to collect plants, cut down trees, hunt or fish and to make
camp fire. <BR>
<BR>
Day 6. Restingday at the Qinngua Dalen. Highlights. As the valley is the
only woodland in Greenland it is quite famous for it's trees. There are
many ruins from the time of the Norsemen a few kilometres up the valley.
There are many possibilities for hiking tours in the valley. Comments. Do
your best to help protect this area and to keep it a place untouched by
civilization! <BR>
<BR>
Day 7. Start from Qinngua, end at the north banks of the bay behind Tasiusaq,
a distance of approx. 13 km + transport of the kayak with tractor. If the
tractor is not at the lake side on your arrival, you must walk c. 15 minutes
to the sheep farm. If there aren't anyone there you must return to the river
at Kuussuaq and enter the fjord from here. Highlights. At the sheep farm
Saputit Tasia the family is very helpful and can provide you with shelter
in case of bad weather. The farm sells smoked salmon, lamb and whale meat.<BR>
<BR>
Day 8. Start from the bay behind Tasiusaq, end in Nalasut - a distance of
c. 4 km. Highlights. From the river many small hikes can be made.The youth
hostel at Nallasut is owned by an institution for mentally handicapped people.
From time to time they use the hostel themselves but if there are free beds,
they are happy to get visitors. Overnight. If you are interested, you can
spend the night at the youth hostel at Nallasut.<BR>
<BR>
Day 9. Start from Nallasut, end c. 1 km south west of point 240 - west of
the &quot;K&quot; in Nanortalik. The distance is c. 20 km. Highlights. An
abandoned village and ruins from the time of the Norsemen. Overnight. Camping
is suggested near the abandoned village and the ruins.<BR>
<BR>
Day 10. Start 1 km. west of point 240, end in Nanortalik, a distance of
c. 14 km. The best place to cross the fjord is at Naujat Nuat.<BR>
<BR>
Day 11 and 12. Extra days in case of bad weater or if you want to spend
an extra day on an excursion on foot or by kayak.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Equipment</B> <BR>
From Nanortalik Tourist Office (1996) you could hire: Kayaks, rubber dinghies,
sleeping bags, tents, VHF radios, Fishing tackle. Equipment for climbing
on glaciers (for 12 persons) is also available. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Insurance</B><BR>
All persons renting a kayak or a rubber dinghy must take out a personal
travel insurance covering the whole vacation in Greenland. The insurance
must be made before the departure to Greenland.

<B>GENERAL INFORMATION - HIKING IN GREENLAND </B><BR>
Greenland's impressive nature has attracted hikers for decades. The high
beautiful mountains, glaciers, icefilled fjords, the flora and fauna the
untouched nature and the silence provide the unique experience of the arctic.
The air is so clear that mountains can be seen from a distance of over 75
km and one can be in the wilderness for days without meeting other people.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commandments for hiking</B><BR>
Hiking in Greenland, outside inhabited areas, is mainly for experienced
hikers and provide that your physical condition and sense of direction are
good and that you know how to use a map and a compass.<BR>
<BR>
On longer tours you have to be able to enjoy untouched nature miles away
from the nearest inhabited place. A sensible attitude to adopt is the assumption
of being left completely to one's own devices. Only very limited assistance
is available for the hillwalker, such as for example marked paths, designated
routes, signposting, bridges and suchlike. <BR>
<BR>
The following rules of the mountains are a good help when going about in
the nature. By keeping these rules the risk of accidents en route will be
reduced.<BR>
<BR>
1. Don't start off on walks without some previous training and planning<BR>
2. Let someone know where you're heading and when you expect to be back.<BR>
3. Pay attention to the weather and the weather reports. <BR>
4. Listen to experienced hikers.<BR>
5. Be prepared for bad weather and accidents, even on short walks.<BR>
6. Always remember a map and compass.<BR>
7. Never go alone.<BR>
8. Turn back before things get chritical.<BR>
9. Conserve your strength; look for shelter while there is still time<BR>
10. Always take along the necessary emergency gear.<BR>
11. Always bring extra warm clothes - even on short day tours.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Choice of route and hiking technique</B><BR>
Before starting off, the route must be carefully planned. The map must be
studied and a route suitable for all on the team must be found. Difficult
passages must be taken under consideration before making the final decision
of the route. It is important to be in good form and remember; it is your
holiday! Even the weakest on the team must be able to complete the day's
march without getting totally exhausted. Allow good time to complete the
route and for delays so you have time to climb a mountain, see a ruin or
simply stay a day or two at a beautiful spot. Allow for 1 - 2 demurrage
days per week in consequense of rain, wind or fog. Avoid too many climbings
and descents which will tax your energy. As a guideline you can walk 3 -
4 km per hour on even ground. You will need approx. 1 hour extra everytime
you climb or descent 300 m. Take a break every hour and drink something
hot or eat chocolate or dried fruit in order to avoid an insufficient blood
sugar balance.<BR>
<BR>
When everything is planned you must inform the authorities (the police or
the tourist office) of the planned route, the estimated duration etc. -
and remember to inform them when the trip is complete. The planned route
must be followed as strictly as possible as this is where a search will
be initiated in case of emergencies. If you are too far away from the planned
route there is a risk that you will not be found.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Routes on the map</B><BR>
The recommended routes on the map are marked with different colors; Green
&gt; blue &gt; red &gt; black indicating the increasing level of difficulty.
The easiest routes - green and blue - are either on or close to beaten track.
Since they often follow unsurfaced roads, valleys or fjords, the need to
be able to read contour lines and find one&#180;s way and position using
a map and a compass is limited, so there is little risk of getting lost.
Hiking on recommended red and black routes calls for a greater sense of
direction, physical fitness and hiking experience. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sense of locality</B><BR>
In Greenland there are several places with lodes of ore in the underground
which influences on the compass and makes it difficult to find one's bearings.
As a consequence it is important to make note of the landform and the characteristics
of the nature, for example a large mountain, a certain lake etc. and compare
these observations with the information on the map. The routes are unmarked
- only a few routes are marked with cairns. As a supplement to the compass
we recommend mileometer, altimeter and protractor for maps.<BR>
<BR>
In Greenland there is a significant compass declination, this is indicated
on the map.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wind and weather</B><BR>
The weather in Greenland changes a lot faster than is usual in other countries.
The weather can change in 10 - 15 minutes. Suddenly it can be fogged and
thereby be difficult to find one's way or it can be storm and be necessary
to seek shelter for several hours before continuing the tour. Make sure
your equipment is geared for sudden changes in the weather. Most people
who suffer death in the mountains do not die of hunger but of frost. The
temperatures mentioned below indicate the temperatures in the different
months. However it is a good idea to bring gloves and a cap - even in the
summer, as it can be very cold when the wind blows. On the other hand it
can be very warm on a sunny spot - up to 20&#176; C.<BR>
The best months for hiking are from the middle of June to the end of August.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Foehn</B> is a dry and warm wind. It arises from a highpressure area
east or northeast of Greenland from where the wind blows over the sea and
crosses the inland ice towards a low pressure area west of Greenland. In
western Greenland the wind comes down from the mountains as a warm, dry
and often very intense wind from the south east. When the wind reaches the
East Coast the temperature falls and the humidity taken up over sea falls
down as precipitation. When the wind reaches the west coast the temperature
rises again. The foehn can be portended by black/blue lensshaped clouds
over the inland ice and fall in the barometric pressure. The temperature
on the west coast rises at the same time as the foehn breaks through with
great intensity. The foehn can last for days and occur several times during
the same month. The wind force is at it's peak close to the ice cap and
decreases as it approaches the coast. Only very few tents can stand the
pressure from a foehn storm and therefore we recommend you to dismantle
the tent and seek shelter behind big and heavy rocks. A foehn storm seldom
lasts more than 1-2 days. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fjordwind.</B> The wind arises when the sun heats the rock faces and
the air in the fjords. The heated air is enlarged and goes up which causes
a vacuum effect right above the colder water in the fjords. Hereby wind
is sucked from the sea through the fjord. The phenomenon occurs from noon
to the afternoon when the heat has reached its peak. The fjord wind gives
a wind force of 15 m per secund, i.e. strong breeze. Towards the evening
the wind will decrease. Fjord wind only occurs on warm and sunny days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tide.</B> In Greenland the difference between lowtide and hightide is
approx. 3 m. This is especially important to kayakkers as it is easier to
row with the tide water than against the tide water. When kayakkers go ashore
it is important to place the kayak at a point where the high tide cannot
reach the kayak. For hikers the tide is important when rivers are to be
crossed. It is a good idea to cross rivers early in the morning before the
sun melts too much ice into the river or at low tide. The tide is caused
by the attractions of the moon and the Earth and does not follow the 24
hour rhytm. Therefore we recommend you to get a tide table with precise
information before going on a kayak or hiking tour <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fog</B>. Occasionally there is fog in the fjords. This is often influenced
by the field ice (especially May to June). Fog caused by field ice frequently
occurs in calm and cloudy weather and can last the whole day. This kind
of fog is most common in the mouth of the fjords and at the coast. In the
autumn (August to September) the sea fog can get all the way into the fjords.
This kind of fog typically occurs in the morning, goes away around noon
and returns in the evening.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing and equipment</B><BR>
When hiking in the Greenlandic nature it is important to be able to take
care of oneself as you will often be far away from inhabited areas. Therefore
it is important to be prepared for an emergency situation beforehand - even
if your trip is just for the weekend. Plan the tour carefully and make sure
you have sufficient supplies and emergency equipment along with the ordinary
hiking gear. The clothes must protect against the cold, the wind, precipitation,
the sun and the heat. It is a good idea to dress so the bodytemperature
can be regulated through the day. Three layers of clothing is recommended;
the inner layer must keep you warm even though the clothes get wet, the
middle layer must insulate against the cold and the outer layer must be
wind and rain proof. We recommend you to bring:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing</B>: &#183;Underwear, preferably woollen &#183;Extra socks and
soles &#183;Underwear with long legs and sleeves allowing perspiration to
escape &#183;Canvas or cotton clothing &#183;Warm sweater or fleeced sweatshirt
&#183;Rain and windproof jacket and trousers &#183;Cap and finger gloves
&#183;Good hiking boots &#183;Shorts and T-shirts for warm days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camp cookware: </B>&#183;Trangia cooking gear including sufficient methylated
spirits or stove and pots including sufficient fuel bottles &#183;Mug, plates
and cups &#183;Cutlery &#183;Bottles or thermo bottle for water &#183;Salt,
pepper and spices &#183;Plastic bags, lighter etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sleeping gear</B>: &#183;Tent &#183;Sleeping bag &#183;Sleeping pad (insulating)
&#183;Toilet requisities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Security</B>: &#183;Map (and an extra map) &#183;Compass &#183;Emergency
radio and ANNA emergency kit &#183;Extra tent pegs and tent poles &#183;Sewing
kit &#183;Tools for repairs &#183;Multi purpose tools &#183;Strong knife
&#183;Extra chocolate &#183;Shoes for wading &#183;Approx. 20 m strong string.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Nice to have</B>: &#183;Binoculars &#183;Fishing gear &#183;Handbooks
&#183;Tape or plaster for blisters &#183;Sunglasses &#183;Little rucksack
or hip pack &#183;Insect repellant &#183;Head net.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Footwear</B>: Much hiking in Greenland takes place on soil that does
not drain particularly well. Hiking boots of goretex are worth considering.
They are waterproof while allowing foot perspiration to escape. Some chooses
hiking rubber boots which are excellent on rainy days and in landscapes
with many small rivers and streams.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Emergency equipment:</B> We recommend ANNA emergency kit supplemented
wih VHF radio or ELT-emergency transmitter. The ANNA kit contains, whistle,
compass, flares (launching tube + cartridges), signalling mirror, aluminium
foil wind sleeve, signal flag and a belt so that the kit can be strapped
around the waist as well as instructions in Danish, English and Greenlandic.
ANNA emergency kit can be bought at KNI shops, ship's supply stores and
in some towns. They are also available from Greenlandair at the heliport
or airport or at tourist offices. The kit has been designed especially for
Greenlandic conditions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tents:</B> In general tunnel and domeshaped tents are good in high winds.
In rough weather and high winds, for example foehn, light weight tent pegs
are highly inadequate. High winds can lacerate many of the lightweight materials
used to manufacture tents these days. Bring a few extra tent pegs and poles
- just in case. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Insects/mosquitoes:</B> Bring sufficient supplies of insect repellants
and a head net. In addition to this it is a good idea to bring loosefitting
clothes that can be properly closed and tightened at your wrists or ankles.
Some hikers prefer to walk in the evening/night and sleep during the day
as the mosquitoes are less active in the evenings. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplies</B>: On hiking tours in Greenland it is necessary to bring all
provisions from home as there is little or no possibility of buying groceries
en route. Shops and grocery stores in the towns and villages do not have
special products for hikers and mountaineers such as for example freezedried
dishes. Therefore it is important to bring food that is not too heavy and
that can keep. Remember you will have more appetite when hiking - you will
need around 3,000 calories per day and therefore it is a good idea to bring
supplies with many carbohydrates. Remember to bring emergency supplies for
extra days. <BR>
<BR>
As a supplement to the freezedried dishes you can pick berries and mushrooms
on the hill sides. The common berries in Greenland are crowberries and blueberries
and can be picked from July. The edible mushroom sorts are roughstremmed
boletus, grisette, &quot;The Deceiver&quot; (red amethyst cap.) and horse
mushroom. Before picking mushrooms one should consult literature with pictures.
In addition to berries and mushrooms the food can be varied with fresh fishes.
If you intend to fish you must buy a fishing permit at the local tourist
office or police station. The tourist office can also inform you on which
months the arctic char can be caught and on the preserved rivers. Regarding
fresh meat, this must be bought at the local market as it is forbidden for
tourists to shoot quarries.<BR>
<BR>
The supplies should contain abundant cocoa, coffee, tea, chocolate, dried
fruit or biscuits for breaks and cosy evenings.<BR>
<BR>
Regarding drinking water, Greenland has some of the purest water on Earth.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camping and cabins</B><BR>
With few exceptions it is permitted to pitch your tent anywhere in Greenland,
however, it is necessary to respect the cultivated areas and meadows of
hay around the sheepfarming stations in South Greenland, preserved areas
and ruins from ancient times as well as lakes supplying the nearby village
with fresh water. Please respect a line of minimum 20 m from any ruin. The
arctic nature is very voulnerable and demands extra attention and consideration.
Please bear this in mind when you choose the camp site. Leave the area the
way you wish to refind it and leave nothing but footprints. Burn your trashes
or bring it along when the tour continues. As a general rule a good campsite
is a place where the ground is flat and the pegs can get a purchase and/or
a place with large boulders to which to lash the tent down. Another important
consideration is a site protected by the terrain with running water close
by. Avoid dry river beds or lowlying areas close to rivers as a camp here
will easily be flooded in case of heavy rain. If you intend to make a campfire
you should avoid making one on peat soil as fire can spread under the soil
and come up weeks later at another place. Use only dry twigs or charcoal
for fires. All arctic vegetation grows very slowly and it takes a long time
for the nature to reestablish damages. A Dwarf birch with a stem of 5 cm
can be 100 years old.<BR>
<BR>
In Greenland the cabins are few and far between, however, practice in Greenland
is to make remote chalets available to everyone and therefore they will
rarely be locked. For the same reason comfort is sparse and chalets in this
category are seldom particularly wellkept or clean. Originally the cabins
were built for hunters who use the cabins on hunts far away from the villages.
Overnight accommodation is usually free of charge.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fording: </B><BR>
During a hike it will often be necessary to ford rivers. According to the
rule of thumb, one should never wade deeper than up to the knees. Otherwise
it is best to wait for the water level to drop (approx. 24 hours after heavy
rain). Another idea is to follow the river upstream to a better fording
place or do the exact opposite; go to the outflow and wade across at the
next low tide. It is a good idea to bring along a pair of rubber shoes as
special &quot;waders&quot; which it does not matter if you get wet. These
will give you a much surer grip on smooth and sharp stones. Some form of
wading stick also increases safety considerably.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Search and rescue parties </B><BR>
Search and rescue parties are the job of the police all over Greenland.
As a general rule a rescue is free of charge for the victim. If the accident,
however, was selfinduced or was due to an act of folly or the rescue party
was called unnecessarily the police can issue an invoice to the victim.
Each case is evaluated by the police and the police decides whether the
victim must take a part of the costs.<BR>
<BR>
A standard travel and health insurance normally cover rescues related to
acciddents. However accidents on expeditions, i.e. crossing the ice cap
or similar, demand special insurances. All insurances must be taken out
before departure to Greenland.<BR>
Survival technique<BR>
When going on hikes you must always be prepared for the worst. In case of
emergencies or accidents it is important to keep one's head, avoid panic
and not to give up. Accidents are never the same and it is impossible to
make a list of how to avoid the different types of accidents or how to behave
in each situation. However, the first rule is to give emergency treatment,
to stabilise the situtation and to keep the injured person warm and protected
against sun, coldness rain and wind. After this you can look for help. A
large team can be divided in two and minimum two persons can look for help.
Remember to mark the place of the accident on the map. If you know there
are other hikers in the area or you can see/hear a helicopter/ aircraft,
you can use the flares or the whistle from the ANNA emergency kit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire:</B> If you have lost the last match fire can be made the primitive
way by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other or by means of a burningglass
from a magnifying glass, binoculars or a lens.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Finding one's way</B>: Without map and compass it is almost impossible
to find one's way. However, if you loose both of your compasses you can
find the four points of the compass with a fairly accurate watch. Before
noon (12.00) the four points can be found by letting the hour hand point
towards the sun and halve the distance between the hour hand and the number
12. This direction is South. In the afternoon (after 12.00) the distance
between the number 12 and the hour hand is South.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Being foun</B>d: If you have had an accident and you want to be found
it is important to draw the attention to yourself in a very obvious way.
This can be done by making signals with whistle, mirrors, flares, distress
rockets, SOS in oversize, flags, clothing etc. It is important that the
signals can be seen from the air, as most rescue parties take place with
helicopter. Do not discharge the flares until you can hear a helicopter
as they only lighten for a short period. When signalling with a mirror in
nice weather, an aircraft can see you from a distance of 75 km. It is important
to stay close to the planned route - here a search will start. Many people
are found too late because they did not make themselves visible from the
air. If you are close to inhabited areas or in an area with other hikers,
you can blow the whistle 6 times/minute every second minute. Answer to this
signal is 3 whistles/minute.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fishing permits</B><BR>
Anyone over the age of 18 who wants to fish in Greenland must have a valid
fishing permit. Fishing permit can be obtained at the local tourist office
or from the police. <BR>
Nanortalik is the southernmost town in Greenland and is first and foremost
famous for its landscape - especially the Tasermiut fjord. Nanortalik is
a fishing/hunting municipality and has a population of 2,700, 1,200 of whom
live in the 5 villages. You can get to Nanortalik by boat or helicopter
from Narsarsuaq or Qaqortoq.<BR>
