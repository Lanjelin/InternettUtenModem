<H1>Hiking between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut</H1>
<H3>(The classic route from the icecap to the sea - 180 km.)</H3>
</CENTER>

<EM><STRONG>The map is map two in a series of three hiking maps covering the area from
the ice cap near Kangerlussuaq to the town Sisimiut by the sea. The Kangerlussuaq
area is described on map one and the Sisimiut area on map three </STRONG></EM><BR>
<BR>
<B>Flora</B><BR>
The vegetation depends on the climatic conditions and the landscape. The
area between Kangerlussuaq close to the ice cap and Sisimiut by the sea
has significant differences in the vegetation. In the inner parts of the
fjord area there are approx. 200 sorts of flowering plants and brackens
while the coast region has approx. 165 sorts. 6 of these plants only grow
in this area and 40 other plants are common in this region and very rare
in the rest of Greenland. <BR>
<BR>
The most common plant community is dwarf-shrub heath dominated by small
bushes, i.e. Arctic blueberry, dwarf birch and crowberry in different variations.
In the high mountains the plant communities are fell-field and in the low-land
it is copse. Among the different heath plants such as mountain-heath, white
Arctic bell-heather and rock cranberry, the Arctic blueberry is the most
important. Sweet Arctic blueberries can be found almost everywhere in the
summer and are highly appreciated by hikers and hill walkers. Crowberry
is another sweet berry, but it is more common by the coast. The dwarf-birch
prefers the warmer areas away from the coast. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Willow scru</B>b can be found in the entire area except in mountains
over 2 - 300 m. At the coast and in the high mountains the scrub is creeping
and becomes a part of the dwarf-shrub heath. In protected valleys away from
the coast willows grow almost like trees and can be almost 3 m high and
form a thick copse. The copse appears on both dry ground and close to rivers
and streams. Willow-herb and common horsetail are often seen where the willow
stands on dry ground. Willow close to rivers and streams often has high
grasses and the edible angelica as near neighbours. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Herb-slopes</B> are luxuriant plant communities, rich in herbs of many
kinds. They are found on south slopes with sufficient water supply throughout
the summer and during the winter protected by snow. Often herb-slopes are
fresh green spots directly under vertical rocks. The vegetation is dominated
by broad-leaved, sappy herbs as angelica and cluster-flowered lady's-mantle.
Grasses and brackens are common on herb slopes close to water. Typical herb-slopes
cannot be found in the inner parts of the country as the summer is too dry
and the snow cover in the winter too thin. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fell-field</B> are wind-exposed plant communities with low and sparse
vegetation. The vegetation is found on solifluction soils, patterned ground
and rocky ravines. The higher mountains the more fell-field you will experience.
On hiking routes through fell-field the common plants are nard sedge, broad-leaved
willow-herb, Arctic poppy and moss campion. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The sour bog</B>s dominated by peat bogs can mainly be found near the
coast line. Due to the springy foundation hiking in areas with moss requires
that the hillwalkers are in good physical form - especially if it rains.
In some bogs dwarf bich and heath plants form large dry tufts between the
mosses.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lichen</B> is dominated by reindeer moss and other moss sorts but grasses
and flower plants can also be seen. Lichen requires complete snow cover
during the winter and is very important to the reindeer population. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fauna</B> <BR>
The area around Kangerlussuaq is richer in mammals and birds and has a larger
mammal density than most of the other regions in Greenland. The large ice-free
inland with the different types of landscape was known as an important summer
hunting place to which hunters from all of Greenland were attracted.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Reindeer</B>. The area between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut has been among
the largest and most productive reindeer areas in Greenland for decades.
Over the past years, however, the population of wild reindeer (tuttu in
Greenlandic) has declined all over Greenland. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Musk ox</B> (Umimmak in Greenlandic). Musk oxen from the easternGreenland
were transferred to the Kangerlussuaq area in the beginning of 1963 and
1965. Musk oxen look like a cross between a sheep and an ox but are a race
unto itself. Today the original 27 &quot;newcomers&quot; from the 1960'ies
have proliferated into about 3,000 animals. The animals are quite stationary
and prefer the area south of Kangerlussuaq towards the ice cap and Paradisdalen.
Keep distance to the animals as they are not very friendly to strangers.
If a group of musk oxen form a ring and the bull steps forward you have
come too close to the oxen. If the bull steps forward and make a feint,
there is a real risk that the animals will attack you. Depending on the
circumstances the critical distance to the animals is approx. 50 m. If you
get too close you should walk away quietly without too much noice and fast
movements. If you keep distance to the animals they will usually ignore
people almost completely.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Alpine hare</B> is white throughout the year, however the female hare
turns a bit greyish having given birth to young ones. The youngs are born
in the end of June. Especially in the inland the hare's funny jumping and
&quot;boxing&quot; can be seen quite often. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Arctic fox</B>. The blue and the white Arctic fox are common throughout
Greenland. The white fox is mainly seen in the inland and the blue fox is
more common along the coast line. Foxes in the coastal area prefer areas
with great tide range.<BR>
Rabies has been very common in this area, but now it has been reduced significantly.
However it is adviceable to take simple precautions. The white and blue
Arctic foxes are usually shy and avoid people. If a fox behaves unnaturally
and comes forward to people in stead of running away you should be on the
alert and try to scare off the fox. Rabies is transmitted through bites
and spittle. Therefore all cooking gear, food and cutlery should be taken
into the tent at night. Rabies bites must be treated with medicine within
a few days after a bite. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Birds</B>. Around 150 species are more or less regular migratory birds.
Among the small species hikers will quickly notice the wheatear with its
black T on a white tail. The birds follow the progress of hikers keenly
from big stones, warning each other by clicking sounds poll the small birds
add a twittering, fluttering touch to the summer mountain with their hectic
courting, nest-building and egg-laying. The snow bunting breed in rock crevices,
the lapland bunting on the ground and the redpoll in bushes. If hikers in
ravines with large boulders suddenly come across the flapping wings of a
female grouse pretending to be ill, they can be pretty sure that well-camouflaged
young lie flattened in the surrounding vegetation only a few metres away.
The charming small red-necked phalaropes can be seen delicately licking
their way along the edge of lakes, swimming in the water.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ravens</B> can be seen and heard a long way off, never missing a chance
to disturb circling white-tailed eagles. The white tailed eagle, gerfalcon
and the peregrine falcon are more common here than in other regions. The
gerfalcon can be recognized on its white crest and the noisy screems. All
larger bird species breed on inaccessible rocks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Breeding white-fronted gooses</B> can be seen in the inner parts of the
country around Kangerlussuaq. The gooses are easily frightened. Canada gooses
with more pointed wings and characteristic black-white patterns are also
common. Due to flight feather changes the gooses cannot fly during a period
of 3 weeks in the summer. In this period the birds are very vulnerable and
frightened and as a consequence hikers are requested to keep a long distance
to the birds. The area is also a known breeding ground for mallards, long-tailed
ducks and great northern diver while the red-throated diver is a bit more
rare. If your night is disturbed by scary screems the culprit is the breeding
great northern diver. A number of ordinary sea birds can be seen close to
the coast. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Arctic char </B>is the only freshwater fish in this part of Greenland
except from sticklebacks. Most lakes in the highlands are almost without
fishes. Some of the lakes, however, have a small stock of Arctic char. In
the late summer the seagoing Arctic char returns to the river or lake where
it was born, plump, silvery and tasty having eaten caplin and other marine
delicacies all summer. Along the coast and in the head of the fjord in Sisimiut
municipality some of the richest char rivers can be found. Apart from the
char the angler can catch Atlantic and Greenland cod. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mosquitoes</B>. Among the many insects in Greenland the mosquitoes draw
the attention to themselves in a rather unpleasant way. As the animal life
is rich and the climate is relatively mild and warm in the inner part of
the country the mosquitoes are numerous. In some very dry summers where
the small punds in which the mosquitoes lay their eggs dry out, the nuisance
is not so intense. Nevertheless repellants are required. The mosquitoes
disappear after the first night frosts. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Polar bears</B> are not seen in this part of the country.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Geology</B><BR>
2500 million years ago the Nassuttoqid folding was created. Since then many
processes and displacements have given the mountains and valleys its present
form. Approx. 3 million years ago the icing of Greenland started. 1 - 2
million years ago the ice cap covered all of Greenland and at the coldest
spots it reached the Davis Street. Large amounts of ice covered the area
between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut until the ice cap receded 8 - 10,000
years ago after which the present landscape was formed. Many of the boulders
lying on quite unmotivated spots were tranported here with the ice from
the central part of Greenland and left behind when the ice melted. Since
the ice melted along the coast the land has raised and today sediments from
the sea can be seen up to 120 m above sea level. <BR>
<BR>
In the area between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut many variants of the common
rock can be found. The light coloured Ikertoq-gneiss dominates the area.
Contrary to granite gneiss is characterized by being different on different
surfaces. Due to the relative softness of the Ikertoq gneiss the long lakes
and fjords which dominate the landscape have been formed through planing
from glacier tongues. Amphibolite can be seen as long dark stripes in the
gneiss. In amphibolite red and brown garnets are common. In Kangerlussuaq
garnets the size of tennis balls have been found. <BR>
<BR>
T<B>HE CLASSIC ROUTE FROM THE ICE TO THE SEA</B><BR>
The main route on the three maps is the polar route between Kangerlussuaq
and Sisimiut. The recommended route is marked with cairns for approx. every
2 km in flat terrain and a bit closer in the heights (approx. 200 cairns
marked the route in 1996). The cairns are marked with a red half-moon. We
recommend hikers to build more cairns between the already excisting cairns.
However, this iniciative must be taken with great care as it is important
only to build along the excisting main route. The route follows the easiest
and safest way to Sisimiut. The route is a demanding route in the untouched
and uninhabited wilderness between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut and calls
for the hiker's skills regarding sence of locality, physical condition and
knowledge of mountain hiking. You will find altitude differences of several
hundred meters and difficult stretches with boulder fields. Wading in large
rivers cannot be avoided. It is necessary to be able to carry a rucksack
of approx. 20-25 kg packed with complete equipment, reserve equipment, emergency
gear and food supplies for the whole tour. The hiker must be experienced
in reading maps and contour lines, the using of compass under concideration
of significant declination (see the map) and possess the skills needed to
be able to find one's way in unmarked mountain terrain. All of these conditions
must be fulfilled before the 180 km long route can be done securely and
become a positive experience.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How long will it take to walk the classical route of approx. 180 km</B><BR>
Naturally this depends on the person's skills. Typically hikers use 8-10
days including the day of arrival in Kangerlussuaq. Large groups should
count on spending 10 days on the distance. Experienced hikers in smaller
groups can walk the distance somewhat quicker (5-6 days). All planning regarding
time for the hike depends on the weather, however, the summers are usually
dry and nice in this part of the country.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The route</B><BR>
It is good advice to contact the tourist information on arrival and arrange
transport by car the first 15 km to the research station Kellyville. This
is a comfortable and easy start on the tour to Sisimiut. If you prefer walking,
you will, if you watch carefully, be able to discover a falcon nest only
300 m away from the airport. The nest is situated on a projection approx.
50 m uphill on the southern side of the mountain &quot;K&oslash;kkenfjeldet&quot;.
The vegetation on the rock face is very dry and sunburned during the midsummer,
this is due to the small amount of precipitation and the position in direct
sunlight. The road to the harbour runs along an approx. 200 million year
old earth quake canyon. The earth quake made a deep canyon in the entire
landscape in southern direction. Approx. 500 m before the harbour you follow
the track towards the research station &quot;Kellyville&quot;, where research
of the sun, northern light, activities on the sun surface, the ozonlayer
etc. is made. This is the starting point of the hike. A few hundred meters
from Kellyville the road gradually disappears and from now on the orientation
relies on map and compas only. At the end of the road there is a marked
path which takes you north of Brayas&oslash; and south of Limn&aelig;as&oslash;.
(The lakes Hundes&oslash;en, Brayas&oslash; and Limn&aelig;as&oslash; are
salt water lakes so remember to fill up your water supplies before starting
from Kangerlussuaq!). From here the terrain goes upwards. 3 lakes will be
passed on the northern side. The route continues south from the southeastern
end of Qardligssuit Lake (means big trousers in Greenlandic). South of Qardligsuit
follow a very distinct reindeer track, a tongue between 2 lakes. From here
you leave the path and walk uphill from where you follow the valley southwest
to the Amitorssuaq lake. <BR>
<BR>
On a flat piece of headland at the eastern end of Amitorssuaq the first
one of Sisimiut Tourism's cabins is situated. This is a good camp site.
From here you follow Amitorssuaq in it's full length along the south shore.
On this stretch it is easy to orientate. As an alternative means of transport
you can rent a canoe and paddle to the canoe center at the other end of
the lake. Along almost the entire lake (approx. 10-30 m above water level)
there is a reindeer track on which it is easier to walk than along the shore.
The whole area is covered with small bushes. Approx 8 km from the south
end of the lake and approx. 1 km before point 194, lies a typical circus
valley with a small lake in the center. In this area there is a tall cairn
problably of Dorset or Norseman origin. On the steep mountainsides of Amitorssuaq
there are numerous falcon nests and therefore excellent opportunities to
observe these birds. A few kilometres before the west end of the lake there
are some dunes. At the western end of Amitorssuaq, Sisimiut Tourism runs
a canoe center (see text below). This is a good place to spend a day or
more. The route continues northwest and follows the river through a valley
towards Kangerdluatsiarssuaq. Between the two lakes the ground is swampy
and wet and we advise you to keep to the southwest side of the valley. <BR>
<BR>
<B>By Taserssuaq</B> you are 10 m above sea level. Late in the summer there
are excellent chances of catching trouts here, when they swim upstream to
the lake. <BR>
<BR>
<B>From Kangerdluatsiarssu</B>aq with sand beach a physically demanding
lap in west-southwest direction across a plateau 300-500 m above sea level
begins. Aim at point 490 in western direction. (The point is not so noticeable
as indicated on the map). Through a south west course, you now have to pass
through difficult terrain with many smaller ravines and past numerous larger
and smaller lakes. The entire north side of the plateau towards Itivneq
is a very steep mountainside with only a few places to descent. Do not take
any unnecessary chances. It can be difficult to orientate when crossing
the plateau as it does not have the usual plateau qualities. The section
should not be done in fogged weather or when visibility is bad. En route
uphill the cairns are placed closer. In good visibility Pingo makes a good
mark. There are chances of seeing reindeer in the area. From here the typical
continental vegetation and climate slowly changes.<BR>
<BR>
From the top the cairns must be followed downhill towards the plain and
the projecting mountain formation on the other side of the plain. Here it
is possible to cross the river. Most of the places the river is deep and
it can be difficult to find a low water access. Therefore do not spend too
much time in trying to find a place with low water from where the river
can be crossed. Having crossed the river walk west along the rock face.
After this you should (evaluate your strenght, supplies etc.) and consider
whether you should take the longer hike north bound to Sisimiut via a valley
north of Nerumaq or the somewhat shorter but more difficult hike west bound
to the village Sarf&aacute;nguaq. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Itivneq</B> valley is a flat moisted valley, through which the slow moving
and winding river &quot;Oles Lakseelv&quot; drains a large area around the
Lake Taserssuaq. The first circling sea eagles (Greenlandic name: Nattoralik)
tells you that you are getting closer to the sea. After rain, the valley
with its many lakes, ponds and moisted vegetation can make hiking a very
wet experience. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Via Itivneq to Sarf&aacute;ngua</B>q <BR>
Between Itivneq and Sarf&aacute;nguaq you hike in Alpine coastal mountains.
There are many smaller hills and steep ravines. On the southwestern side
of the rock face it is necessary to wade across many small streams. Vegetation
is rich and can be somewhat heavy to walk in.<BR>
<BR>
The route continues west near the river and turns south west through the
pass between point 850 and Arnaq Qavdlunaq (the Danish woman). By staying
in the heights the wading through streams is eased. Stay in the heights
towards the pass by Igalassat. Cross Igalassat and onward southwest in alpine
mountains in an altitude of 3-400 m. Several smaller, but steep ravines
are not clearly marked on the map but have to be passed. The descent goes
southwest towards the lake by Sarf&aacute;nguaq. There are trouts in the
lake, but as the lake is the water supplying lake of Sarf&aacute;nguaq,
it is not allowed to camp here. From the valley towards the fjord end of
Imartuninguaq you can follow the water pipe to the point by Sarf&aacute;nguaq.
The residents of the village usually come and take hikers across the narrow
strait, if you wave and shout. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sarf&aacute;nguaq</B>. About 100 people inhabit the village Sarf&aacute;nguaq.
In the village there are many possibilites of experiencing traditional Greenlandic
lifestyle. Most of the residents in this typical Greenlandic settlement
are hunters and fishermen. There is a KNI-shop, where you can shop for provisions
and get information on ways of transportation, make a telephone call or
send a fax. Not many in the village speak anything but Greenlandic, so you
will often be gesticulating in order to make yourself understood. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Via Itivneq to Sisimiut</B><BR>
If you continue to Sisimiut from Itivneq you must pass the plain. The only
possible place to pass the river is by the cleft. From here the ascent is
steep north along the westside of the cleft. Here reindeer tracks can be
followed all the way to the mountain ridge in western direction. <BR>
You continue north west on the south side of the water system. At the lakes
there are reeindeer tracks. In the area between the tracks there are no
paths and the ground is swampy and wet. By the lake with the island lies
another one of Sisimiut Tourism's cabins. From the lake you follow a valley
along the mountain ridge north of the Nerumaq valley. The valley must be
followed in it's full length in southwestern direction on the north side
of the river. Southwest of the lake, east of the fjord Kangerdluarssuk Tugdleq,
you walk approx. 150-200 m uphill. Stay at this curve and head westbound
through a hilly landscape of boulders, ravines and rivers. Stay in the heights
until you meet the dog-sled track, which leads through Qerrortussup Majoria.
The ascent through Qerrortussup Majoria is steep and almost 450 m high.
When descending from the plain at the top of the pass, you follow the northside
as large block of rocks make the south side difficult to pass. Follow the
landmark of Sisimiut, &quot;K&aelig;llingeh&aelig;tten&quot;, on the way
towards the town. After this you pass the Sisimiut ski-lift. Before you
get to the track leading you to the town, you can try to spot the sleeping
and praying priest, who &quot;hides&quot; in the mountains north of Sisimiut.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The canoe center at the Amitsorsuaq lake</B> <BR>
In the western end of the large lake Amitsorsuaq, Sisimiut Tourism has made
an activity centre with accommodation facilites and canoes (125 m2). The
centre is manned during the summer. The distance from Kangerlussuaq harbour
to the eastern side of the lake is approx. 22 km (one long day's walk).
Here you can stay overnight and paddle on to the canoe centre (20 km) the
following day and stay a few days. Against payment Kangerlussuaq Tourism
can arrange transport from the airport to Kellyville which will shorten
the walking distance to the canoe centre.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Arctic Circle Race track</B><BR>
From March to the end of April it is possible to complete the distance from
Kangerlussuaq to Sisimiut on cross country skiis. The period depends on
the snow and ice conditions and we recommend you to contact Kangerlussuaq
Tourism or Sisimiut Tourism for exact information on the weather before
planning a ski holiday along the Arctic circle. The Arctic Circle Race track
is a pure experience of the unspoiled Arctic nature during the winter. The
main route of approx. 160 km is marked on the map and can be done in 3-7
days. En route there are cabins which can be used for overnight accommodation.
Due to your own safety and in case of emergencies you should, however, bring
a tent anyway. It is possible to hire a dog sled with driver from Sisimiut
or Kangerlussuaq to guide you on the tour. One dog sled can carry the equipment
of 2-3 persons. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Dog sledding from Kangerlussuaq to Sisimiut</B><BR>
A dog sled trip is the experience of a lifetime. Providing you book in good
time, you can even try this Greenlandic winter amusement in Kangerlussuaq.
Dog sled drivers from Sisimiut often do trips from Kangerlussuaq with tourist
or go hunting in this area. A dog sled tour from Kangerlussuaq to Sisimiut
takes 3 days, but shorter tours can also be arranged by Kangerlussuaq Tourism
or Sisimiut Tourism. Please contact these companies for bookings.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Accommodation in Sarfannguaq </B><BR>
In the village Sarfannguaq accomodation is possible in the school which
has a kitchen, toilet and wash basin, living room &amp; TV. Booking at Sisimiut
Tourism. (see adress below) <BR>
<BR>
<B>Transportation from Sarfanguaq</B><BR>
Once a week a KNI cargo boat from Sisimiut calls the port of the village
Sarfannguaq. In addition to this Sisimiut Tourism arranges boat tours to
the village during the sommer. In the winter you can visit the town by dog
sled. <BR>

<CENTER><H1>General information about hiking in Greenland and in the area
between Kangerlussuaq and Sisismiut:</H1></CENTER>

<B>The nature</B><BR>
Greenland's impressive nature has attracted hikers for decades. The high
beautiful mountains, glaciers, ice-filled fjords, the flora and fauna the
untouched nature and the silence provide the unique experience of the Arctic.
The air is so clear that mountains can be seen from a distance of 75 - 200
km and one can be in the wilderness for days without meeting other people.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commandments for hiking</B><BR>
Hiking in Greenland, outside inhabited areas, is mainly for experienced
hikers and provide that your physical condition and sense of direction are
good and that you know how to use a map and a compass.<BR>
<BR>
On longer tours you have to be able to enjoy untouched nature far away from
the nearest inhabited place. A sensible attitude to adopt is the assumption
of being left completely to one's own devices. Only very limited assistance
is available for the hillwalker, such as for example marked paths, designated
routes, signposting, bridges and such<BR>
like. <BR>
<BR>
The following rules of the mountains are a good help when going about the
nature. By keeping these rules the risk of accidents en route will be reduced.<BR>
<BR>
1. Don't start off on long walks without some previous training and planning<BR>
2. Let someone know where you're heading and when you expect to be back<BR>
3. Pay attention to the weather and the weather reports <BR>
4. Listen to experienced hikers.<BR>
5. Be prepared for bad weather and accident even on short walks<BR>
6. Always remember a map and compass.<BR>
7. Never go alone<BR>
8. Turn back before things get chritical<BR>
9. Conserve your strength; look for shelter while there is still time<BR>
10. Always take along the necessary emergency gear<BR>
11. Always bring extra warm clothes - even on short day tours<BR>
<BR>
<B>Choice of route and hiking technique</B><BR>
Before starting off, the route must be carefully planned. Difficult passages
must be taken under consideration before making the final decision of the
route. It is important to be in good form and remember; it is your holiday!
Even the weakest on the team must be able to complete the day's march without
getting totally exhausted. Allow good time to complete the route and for
delays so you have time to climb a mountain, see a ruin or simply stay a
day or two at a beautiful spot. Allow for 1 - 2 demurrage days per week
in consequense of rain, wind or fog. Avoid too many climbings and descents
which will tax your energy. As a guideline you can walk 3 - 4 km per hour
on even ground. You will need approx. 1 hour extra everytime you climb or
descent 300 m. Take a break every hour and drink something hot or eat chocolate
or dried fruit in order to avoid an insufficient blood sugar balance.When
everything is planned you must inform the authorities (the police, friends,
family, hotel, or the tourist office) of the planned route, estimated duration
etc. - and remember to inform them on your return. The planned route must
be followed as strictly as possible as this is where a search will be initiated
in case of emergencies. If you are too far away from the planned route there
is a risk that you will not be found.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Routes on the map</B><BR>
The recommended routes on this map are marked with different colours; Green
&gt; blue &gt; red &gt; black indicating the increasing level of difficulty.
The easiest routes - green and blue - are either on or close to beaten track.
Since they often follow unsurfaced roads, valleys or fjords, the need to
be able to read contour lines and find one&#180;s way and position using
a map and a compass is limited, so there is little risk of getting lost.
Hiking on recommended red and black routes calls for a greater sense of
direction, physical fitness and hiking experience. <BR>
<BR>
The routes on this map are only a small selection of the actual possibilities
in the terrain. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sense of locality</B><BR>
In Greenland there are several places with metal ores in the underground
which influences on the compass and makes it difficult to find one's way.
As a consequence it is important to make note of the landform and the characteristics
of the nature, for example a large mountain, a certain lake etc. and compare
these observations with the information on the map. The routes are unmarked
- however some are marked with cairns. As a supplement to the compass we
recommend mileometer, altimeter and protractor for maps.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Compass declination</B><BR>
In Greenland there is a significant compass declination, this is indicated
on the map. Near the head of the Itivneq the ground contains Granodiorit
which contains iron. This can result in local compass deflections. In this
area you should follow the contour lines on the map. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Wind and weather</B><BR>
The weather in Greenland changes a lot faster than is usual in other countries.
In 10 - 15 minutes it can be fogged and thereby be difficult to find one's
way or it can be storm and be necessary to seek shelter for several hours
before continuing. Make sure your equipment is geared for sudden changes
in the weather. Most people who suffer death in the mountains do not die
of hunger but of frost. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The climate</B>  between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut changes from typical
continental climate by the inland ice to typical coastal climate by the
coast approx. 200 km. west of the ice cap. Not nearly as much snow falls
in Kangerlussuaq as in the coastal towns. <BR>
<BR>
As you move from the continental areas towards the costal areas the climate
changes and gets more oceanic and unstable. In the summer, frequent cyclone
formations over the low pressure areas in the Davisstrait contribute with
strong winds from south- and western directions and cause heavy rain. Some
of the hiking tours are on southwest bound slopes which are more or less
open towards the sea. On such slopes the precipitation in the coastal areas
can be significant. In the summer more than twice as much rain falls in
the coastal regions (approx. 50 mm per month) as by the ice cap (approx.
20 mm per month). The difference and changing of the landscape make room
for a number of different local conditions, which means that climate and
precipitation can vary radically within small distances. A good precept
to remember is listening to the weather forecast before going on a hike,
however weather forecasts are quite unreliable in Greenland as they cannot
take local conditions into consideration. <BR>
<BR>
The temperatures mentioned below indicate the temperatures in the different
months. However it is a good idea to bring gloves and a cap - even in the
summer, as it can be very cold when the wind blows.<BR>
<BR>
The best months for summer hiking are from the middle of June to the end
of August. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mean temperature - Celcius</B><BR>
Kangerlussuaq: April -11,4, May 1,4, June 10,5, July 11,6, August, 6,7,
September 3,1, October -3,6.<BR>
<BR>
Sisimiut: April -9,8, May -0,9, June 4,0, July 7,3, August 5,5, September
3,7 October -1,3 <BR>
<BR>
<B>Foehn</B> is a dry and warm wind. It arises from a high-pressure area
east or northeast of Greenland from where the wind blows over the sea and
crosses the inland ice towards a low-pressure area west of Greenland. In
western Greenland the wind comes down from the mountains as a warm, dry
and often very intense wind from the south east. The foehn can be portended
by black/blue lens-shaped clouds over the inland ice and fall in the barometric
pressure. The temperature on the west coast rises at the same time as the
foehn breaks through with great intensity. The foehn can last for 1 - 2
days and occur several times during the same month. Only very few tents
can stand the pressure from a foehn storm and therefore we recommend you
to dismantle the tent and seek shelter behind big and heavy rocks. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing and equipment</B><BR>
When hiking in the Greenlandic nature it is important to be able to take
care of one-self as you will often be far away from inhabited areas. Therefore
it is important to be prepared for an emergency situation beforehand - even
if your trip is just for the weekend. Plan the tour carefully and make sure
you have sufficient supplies and emergency equipment along with the ordinary
hiking gear. The clothes must protect against the cold, the wind, precipitation,
the sun and the heat and it is a good idea to dress so the bodytemperature
can be regulated through the day. Three layers of clothing is recommended;
the inner layer must keep you warm even though the clothes get wet, the
middle layer must insulate against the cold and the outer layer must be
wind and rain proof. We recommend you to bring:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing</B>: &#183;Underwear, preferably woollen &#183;Extra socks &#183;Underwear
with long legs and sleeves allowing perspiration to escape &#183;Canvas
or cotton clothing &#183;Warm sweater or fleeced sweatshirt &#183;rain and
windproof jacket and trousers &#183;Cap and finger gloves &#183;Good hiking
boots &#183;Shorts and T-shirts for warm days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camp cookware:</B> &#183;Trangia cooking gear including sufficient methylated
spirits or stove and pots including sufficient fuel bottles &#183;Mug, plates
and cups &#183;Cutlery &#183;Bottles or thermo bottle for water &#183;Salt,
pepper and spices &#183;Plastic bags, lighter etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sleeping gear</B>: &#183;Tent &#183;Sleeping bag &#183;Sleeping pad (insulating)
&#183;Toilet requisities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Security:</B> &#183;Map (and an extra map) &#183;Compass &#183;Emergency
radio and ANNA emergency kit &#183;Extra tent pegs and tent poles &#183;Sewing
kit &#183;Tools for repairs &#183;Multi purpose tools &#183;Strong knife
&#183;Extra chocolate &#183;Shoes for wading &#183;Approx. 20 m strong string.
<BR>
<BR>
We recommend ANNA emergency kit supplemented wih VHF radio or ELT-emergency
transmitter. The kit has been designed especially for Greenlandic conditions
and includes instructions in Danish, English and Greenlandic. The ANNA kit
contains whistle, compass, flares (launching tube + cartridges), signalling
mirror, astro blanket, signal flag and a belt so that the kit can be strapped
around the waist. ANNA emergency kit can be rented at Kangerlussuaq Tourism
in Kangerlussuaq or Sisimiut Tourism in Sisimiut. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Nice to have:</B> &#183;Binoculars &#183;Fishing gear &#183;Handbooks
&#183;Tape or plaster for blisters &#183;Sunglasses &#183;Little ruck-sack
or hip pack &#183;Insect repellant &#183;Head net.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Footwear.</B> Much hiking in Greenland takes place on soil that does
not drain particularly well. Hiking boots of gore-tex are worth considering.
They are waterproof while allowing foot perspiration to escape. Some chooses
hiking rubber boots which are excellent on rainy days and in landscapes
with many small rivers and streams.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tents.</B> In general tunnel and dome-shaped tents are good in high winds.
In rough weather and high winds, for example foehn, light weight tent pegs
are highly inadequate. High winds can lacerate many of the lightweight materials
used to manufacture tents. Bring a few extra tent pegs and poles - just
in case and secure your tent with stones around the tent pegs and on the
sides of the tent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Insects/mosquitoes.</B> Bring sufficient supplies of insect repellants
and a head net. In addition to this it is a good idea to wear loose-fitting
clothes that can be properly closed and tightened at your wrists or ankles.
Some hikers prefer to walk in the evening/night and sleep during the day
as the mosquitoes are less active in the evening. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplies.</B> On hiking tours in Greenland it is necessary to bring all
special provisions from home as there is little or no possibility of buying
groceries en route. Shops and grocery stores in the towns and villages do
not have special products for hikers and mountaineers such as for example
freeze-dried foods. Remember to bring emergency supplies for extra days.
Ordinary groceries and methylated spirits for the cooking gear can be obtained
at the small supermarket &quot;Butikken&quot; in Kangerlussuaq, the KNI
shop in Sarfannguaq or in the shops in Sisimiut.<BR>
The supplies should contain abundant cocoa, coffee, tea, chocolate, dried
fruit or biscuits for breaks and cosy evenings.<BR>
<BR>
As a supplement to the freeze-dried foods you can pick berries and mushrooms
on the hill sides. The common berries in Greenland are crowberries and blueberries
and can be picked from July. The edible mushroom sorts are rough-stremmed
boletus, grisette, &quot;the deceiver&quot; (red amethyst cap.) and horse
mushroom. Before picking mushrooms one should consult literature with pictures.
In addition to berries and mushrooms the food can be varied with fresh fishes.
If you intend to fish you must buy a fishing permit at the local tourist
office or police station. <BR>
<BR>
Regarding drinking water, Greenland has some of the purest water on Earth
and it can be drunk directly from rivers and streams. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Camping and cabins </B><BR>
With few exceptions it is permitted to pitch your tent anywhere in Greenland.
The exceptions are preserved areas and ruins from ancient times as well
as lakes supplying the nearby village or town with fresh water. Please respect
a line of minimum 20 m from any ruin. The Arctic nature is very vulnerable
and demands extra attention and consideration. Please bear this in mind
when choosing the camp site. Leave the area the way you wish to refind it
and leave nothing but footprints. Burn your trashes or bring it along when
the tour continues. As a general rule a good campsite is a place where the
ground is flat and the pegs can get a purchase and/or a place with large
boulders to which to lash the tent down. Another important consideration
is a site protected by the terrain with running water close by. Avoid dry
river beds or lowlying areas close to rivers as a camp here will easily
be flooded in case of heavy rain. <BR>
<BR>
In Greenland the cabins are few and far between, however, practice in Greenland
is to make remote chalets available to everyone and therefore they will
rarely be locked. For the same reason comfort is sparse and chalets in this
category are seldom particularly well-kept or clean. Originally the cabins
were built for hunters who use the cabins on hunts far away from the villages.
<BR>
<BR>
Between Kangerlussuaq and Sisimiut, Sisimiut Tourism has built a canoe-center
and a few primitive cabins as accommodation and resting place for hikers
and skiers. The cabins are approx 15 m2 which is comfortable for 4 persons.
The cabins are unlocked. and not always particularly well-kept or clean
and sometimes the cabins have been subjected to vandalism, however the cabins
are very important for the security en route. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fording</B><BR>
During a hike it will often be necessary to ford rivers. According to a
rule of thumb, one should never wade deeper than up to the knees. Otherwise
it is best to wait for the water level to drop (approx. 24 hours after heavy
rain). Another idea is to follow the river upstream to a better fording
place or do the exact opposite; go to the outflow and wade across at the
next low tide. It is a good idea to bring along a pair of rubber shoes as
special &quot;waders&quot; which it does not matter if you get wet. These
will give you a much better grip on smooth and sharp stones. Some form of
wading stick also increases safety considerably.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire</B><BR>
Due to the Arctic climate the land around Kangerlussuaq is very dry. A fire
in the hills would be a catastrophe for the area as fire on peat soil can
spread under the vegetation and appear on the surface miles away from the
ignition place. As a consequence extra attention to the risk of fire is
required; do not stub out a cigarette on the earth, make your campfires
in moisted areas, i.e. close to lakes and rivers or on stones - not directly
on the dry earth. Put stones around the campfire and do not leave the fireplace
until the fire has burnt out or been extinguished with water. Stoves and
cooking gear must be placed on an uninflammable foundation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Quicksands</B><BR>
At many places - especially close to the ice cap there are quicksands so
be careful when crossing the rivers. Places with vegetation and large boulders
should be safe. Colour changes in the sand are not necessarily a sign of
quicksands.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Search and rescue parties </B><BR>
Search and rescue parties are the job of the police all over Greenland.
As a general rule a rescue is free of charge for the victim. If the accident,
however, was self-induced or was due to an act of folly or the rescue party
was called unnecessarily the police can issue an invoice to the victim.
Each case is evaluated by the police and the police decides whether the
victim must take a part of the costs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Survival technique</B><BR>
When going on hikes you must always be prepared for the worst. In case of
emergencies or accidents it is important to keep one's head, avoid panic
and not to give up. Accidents are never the same and it is impossible to
make a list of how to avoid the different types of accidents or how to behave
in each situation. However, the first rule is to give emergency treatment,
to stabilize the situtation and to keep the injured person warm and protected
against sun, coldness rain and wind. After this you can look for help. A
large team can be divided in two and minimum two persons can look for help.
Remember to mark the place of the accident on the map. If you know there
are other hikers in the area or you can see/hear a helicopter/ aircraft,
you can use the flares or the whistle from the ANNA emergency kit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire</B>. If you have lost the last match fire can be made the primitive
way by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other or by means of a burning-glass
from a magnifying glass, binoculars or a lens.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Finding one's way.</B> Without map and compass it is almost impossible
to find one's way. However, if you loose both of your compasses you can
find the four points of the compass with a fairly accurate watch. Before
noon (12.00) the four points can be found by letting the hour hand point
towards the sun and halve the distance between the hour hand and the number
12. This direction is south. In the afternoon (after 12.00) the distance
between the number 12 and the hour hand is south.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Being found.</B> If you have had an accident and you want to be found
it is important to draw the attention to yourself in a very obvious way.
This can be done by making signals with whistle, mirrors, flares, distress
rockets, SOS in oversize, flags, clothing etc. It is important that the
signals can be seen from the air, as most rescue parties take place with
helicopter. Do not discharge the flares until you can hear a helicopter
as they only lighten for a short period. When signalling with a mirror in
nice weather, an aircraft can see you from a distance of 75 km. Many people
are found too late because they did not make themselves visible from the
air or left the planned route. If you are close to inhabited areas or in
an area with other hikers, you can blow the whistle 6 times/minute every
second minute. Answer to this signal is 3 whistles/minute.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fishing permits </B><BR>
Fishing and hunting permits can be purchased from Kangerlussuaq Tourism,
Sisimiut Tourism or from the police. Char fishing in the Kangerlussuaq area
starts on July 1st and ends on August 30th. Please check with Kangerlussuaq
Tourism, Sisimiut Tourism or the police, as dates and rules may change from
year to year. Please familiarize yourself with protected areas, where all
fishing is banned. In 1996 fishing were banned in following areas on the
map: Akulleq (N67&#186;17' - W053&#186;50'), Avalleq (N66&#186;49' - W052&#186;22).
