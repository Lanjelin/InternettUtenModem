<H1><CENTER>Hiking around Ilulissat:</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
The area around Ilulissat offers outstanding experiences highly characterized
by the scenery from the icefjord, the inland ice, glacier and the Disko
bay.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fauna</B><BR>
Throughout the summer there is a fair chance to see whales, huge flocks
of birds and seals playing in the surface of the water.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Flora</B><BR>
The vegetation is characterized by Dwarf Birch and Arctic Blueberry. The
creeping vegetation is known by Mountain-heath, White Arctic Bell-heather
and Lapland Rose-bay. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Geology</B><BR>
The inner parts of the area consist of very old rock of gneiss and granite
formed more than 1,5 billion years ago. The landscape has eroded down to
rounded shapes and many hidden interesting valleys, clefts and steep mountain
walls can be found. <BR>
<BR>
Kangia (Ilulissat Isfjord) Approx. 45 km from the town you find the enormous
Sermeq Kujalleq (Ilulissat Glacier), which is the largest glacier in the
northern hemisphere. Sermeq Kujalleq is probably the most productive glacier
in the world. In 24 hours the masses of ice move approx. 22 m and produces
approx. 20 billion tons of ice. In a year the glacier produces more than
3 km3 of broken ice masses. It takes approx. 1 1/2 year for the ice masses
to move from the ice cap to the mouth of the icefjord 45 km away. The ice
fjord is more than 600 m deep and the icebergs easily float towards the
open sea. Close to the mouth of the fjord the dept of the sea is only 200-300
m due to the moraine. At this spot, the big icebergs aground and give cause
to one of the most beautiful sights in Greenland, before it is melting,
calving or being pressed/squeezed over the soilmasses and can continue as
floading islands into the Disko Bay. <BR>
<BR>
<B>SHORT DAY-HIKES AROUND ILULISSAT<BR>
<BR>
Sermermiutdalen</B> (The Sermermiut valley) to Kingittoq Nuua - approx 1
1/2 hour The first section of the route is cairned with yellow stones. It
starts out on the southern outskirts of the town next to the old heliport
and follows the Sermermiut valley further out to Kingittoq Nuua (the colour
of the cairns will change from yellow in the beginning to red). From here
the route leads to a nice viewpoint round the cape and ends by the new powerplant.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Along the icefjord</B> - approx 4 hours. The route is cairned with blue
stones and starts from &quot;K&aelig;llingekl&oslash;ften&quot; close to
Sermermiut south of the town. The route goes east along the icefjord towards
the inland ice. After this the route continues on the rock face and passes
the southern part of a beautiful lake. The route ends at the quarry. <BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;K&aelig;llingekl&oslash;ften&quot;</B> is situated east of the
settlement Sermermiut. A little path leads to a narrow 35 m deep cleft.
From this cleft old women used to throw themselves out in periods of extreme
famine. In the pre-colonial period comitting suicide was sometimes the only
posibility of saving children and young people and thereby avoid a settlement
from becoming extinct.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sermermiut</B> - 1 hour (part of the route marked with yellow stones).
This is an easy hike starting from the old heliport. Follow the &quot;the
yellow route&quot; to the end of the Sermermiut valley. Here it is still
possible to see ruins from the old Inuit settlement. On the way back follow
the valley towards the heliport. During summer the valley can be swamped
at some places. Bring good hiking or rubber boots and walk close to the
yellow route on the west side of the little valley. <BR>
 <BR>
The former settlement Sermermiut was inhabited from approx. 1400 BC to approx.
1850 AD. The settlement was the largest known settlement in Greenland in
1737 AD. In 1741 the grocer Jacob Severin founded a harbor and a trade station
nearby. Over the years this station developed and became the largest town
in the northern part of Greenland. Today the trade station remain an important
town for industries and is known under the name Ilulissat.<BR>
<BR>
The rich fauna of fish and seals is one of the main reasons that this area
has been a good place for people to settle down for thousands of years.
Melting glaciers give off big masses of oxygen which has been kept in the
ice under high pressure for centuries. The live-giving oxygen increases
the fauna production in the ice fjord. <BR>
<BR>
Archaeologists have proved that every culture who lived along the west coact
of Greenland have inhabited Sermermiut for shorter or longer periods. The
ruins in the area are low round or rectangular walls overgrown with grass.
Along the beach you can see old kitchen middens. The cliff next to the former
settlement is filled with bones from seals and other animals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Seqinniarfik</B> (Holms Bakke). This route is slightly demanding. The
starting point is the old heliport and from here you continue to Sermermiut.
From Sermermiut you follow the eastgoing blue route from &quot;K&aelig;llingeh&aelig;tten&quot;
towards the icefjord. En route you pass two Inuit graves, which are worth
studying. The hill Seqinniarfik is just east of grave no 2. From this vantage
point you walk towards point 203. Before reaching point 203 turn left downwards
through the cleft to the quarry. <BR>
<BR>
Every year on January 13 at 12.45 p.m the inhabitants of Ilulissat gather
on top of the hill Seqinniarfik (Holms Bakke) in order to welcome the sun
which appears on the horizon after 6 weeks of absence. <BR>
<BR>
<B>LONGER HIKES AROUND ILULISSAT<BR>
<BR>
Oqaatsut</B> (The village Rodebay) - long route - approx 2 days. The village
is a small fishing- and hunting community with approx. 60 inhabitants. The
tour is approx. 22 km and starts from the old heliport. From here the walk
goes to the Sermermiut settlement and further along the icefjord. From the
place where you pass Seqinniarfik(Holms Bakke) you walk northeast through
the river valley. With the mountain Akinnaq on the left hand you will reach
Kangerluarsuk in the early evening. The cleft Ujuup Kuua which leads towards
Kangerluarsuk is narrow and there can be dangerous passages with ice and
snow in the summer. If you follow the coastline towards Kangerluarsuk(Bredebugt)
you reach the big lake Kangerluarsuk Tasia. From here you walk north-west
along the northern coastline of Kangerluarsuk to Oqaatsut. In the village
there is a shop where you can buy food and there is a youth hostel. Tenting
is allowed until 300 m from the village or south of the village graveyard.
In order to return to Ilulissat you can either arrange to be picked up by
boat or walk back. KNI has a weekly route to the settlement in the summer
season (1996). Tour boats from Ilulissat regularly call the port. Against
payment is it usually posible to get a lift back to Ilulissat.<BR>
<BR>
If you walk back to Ilulissat there is a more direct path to follow along
the bay Kangerluarsuk until the mountain terrain clearly changes near the
head of the bay. From here you follow the dog sled path towards Ilulissat.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The village Oqaatsut</B> (Rodebay) - short route. A direct route to Oqaatsut
starts by the airport and follows the coast line. It takes approx. 5-8 hours
with a little day-rucksack.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hiking northeast of Ilulissat </B>- approx 3 days. The tour can start
off from Ilulissat Airport and goes north to the bay Kangerluarsuk (Bredebugt).
The bay is to be followed till you reach a small riverbed Ujuup Kuua. From
Ujuup Kuua you continue along the cleft in southeastern direction. The cleft
is narrow and there can be dangerous passages with ice and snow in the summer.
The riverbed is filled with stones and is difficult to pass. After approx.
2 km the valley opens, close to a low water lake. You continue south east
until you reach a cleft which leads to the lake Nalluarsuup Tasia. From
the top of the 400 m mountain crest by the lake you can see the icefjord
and the glacier in the distance. Follow the coast line along the icefjord
when you return to Ilulissat. En route you pass a little hunting cabin by
the cove Aallaaniarfik. From this cabin a relatively clear dog sled path
will lead to the town north of point 230. The tour ends at the quarry. Alternatively
it is possible to continue along the icefjord to Sermermiut and walk towards
Ilulissat through the valley, which leads to the old heliport.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Paakitsup Nunaa north of Ilulissat</B> is a beautiful and rarely visited
area. One should keep to the ridge on the peninsula, as the coasts along
the Disko bay and Sikuiuitsoq are difficult to walk along. The 50 km long
Paakitsoq-fjord(not on the map) is very beautiful but long and very difficult
to walk along. This area is only suitable for experienced mountain hikers.
In Ilulissat it is possible to be transported by boat to Paakitsoq-fjord
and walk back to Ilulissat - or the other way around. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Hike to the inland i</B>ce - Sermeq Avannarleq. The glacier Sermeq Avannarleq
is inactive and situated close to the huge active glacier Sermeq Kujalleq.
Start from the quarry and walk east on the southside of the plain Narsarsuaq
along the ridge Qilakitsoq. The area is swampy especially in June and July.
Walk on the right side of the last big lake and then south east to &quot;Little
Akinaq&quot; (approx. 150m). Follow the valley east until you reach the
river. Use the stones by the river bed as stairs until you reach the elevation
of approx. 250 m. Follow the lakes to Nalluarsuup Tasia. On the moraine
embankment in the middle of the lake there is a dilapidated cabin B53. The
lake is to be passed on the northern side. Continue in south eastern direction
then turn east. Follow the easiest and most natural way along the lakes,
until you reach an elevation of approx. 350 m from where it is possible
to see the Sikuiuitsoq fjord, the inland ice and Sermeq Avannarleq. This
place is a unique experience and many hikers stop here and walk back to
Ilulissat. Allow two days each way. <BR>
<BR>
If you choose to continue to Sermeq Avannarleq and the lake Tasersuaq you
must follow the 350 - 400 m curve. When returning you can either walk the
same way back or follow the Paakitsoq-fjord. It takes approx. one week to
walk from Paakitsoq to Ilulissat. The area is only suitable for experienced
mountain hikers. <BR>
  <BR>
<B>The village Ilimanaq</B> (Claushavn). The village is situated approx.
30 km south of Ilulissat and is a little hunting and fishing community with
approx. 70 inhabitants. Several times a week tour boats visit the village.
KNI calls the port once a week. From the village it is possible to walk
to Qasigiannguit (Christiansh&aring;b) which will take 3-4 days on foot.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Summer activites. </B><BR>
The town offers a variety of activities and tour programmes. Among other
things there are helicopter tours to the inland ice, boat tours to the ice
fjord and various villages and settlements, guided walks in and around the
city, visits in villages in the Ilulissat area, summer dog sledding, angling,
barbeque, kayakking, weekend by the inland ice, &quot;Kaffe-mik&quot; (coffee
parties), base camp, rents of cabins etc. etc.<BR>
  <BR>
<B>Winter activites </B><BR>
For many people a dog sled tour in Greenland is the experience of a lifetime.
During the winter (February-April) and spring dog sled tours of various
duration are offered. In Ilulisat the tours vary from a few hours to day
tours to the village Oqaatsut and longer dog sled tours for several weeks
north to the town Uummannaq.<BR>
Ice fishing with hunters on the icefjord, snow mobile driving, cross country
skiing, overnights in the mountains in small primitive cabins or snow igdloos

<H1><CENTER><HR>General information about hiking in Greenland:</CENTER>
</H1>
<B>The nature</B><BR>
Greenland's impressive nature has attracted hikers for decades. The high
beautiful mountains, glaciers, ice-filled fjords, the flora and fauna, the
untouched nature and the silence provide the unique experience of the Arctic.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The map</B><BR>
This map is a part of a series of new hiking maps published by Greenland
Tourism a/s, P.O. Box 1552, DK-3900 Nuuk, Greenland. E-mail: <A HREF="mailto:tourism@greennet.gl">tourism@greennet.gl</A><BR>
<BR>
<B>Commandments for hiking</B><BR>
Hiking in Greenland outside inhabited areas, is mainly for experienced hikers
and provide that your physical condition and sense of direction are good,
and that you know how to use a map and a compass.<BR>
<BR>
On longer tours you have to be able to enjoy untouched nature far away from
the nearest inhabited place. A sensible attitude to adopt is the assumption
of being left completely to one's own devices. Only very limited assistance
is available for the hillwalker, such as for example marked paths, designated
routes, signposting, bridges and suchlike. <BR>
<BR>
The following rules of the mountains are a good help when going about the
nature. By keeping these rules the risk of accidents en route will be reduced.<BR>
<BR>
1. Don't start off on long walks without some previous training and planning<BR>
2. Let someone know where you're heading and when you expect to be back.<BR>
3. Pay attention to the weather and the weather reports. <BR>
4. Listen to experienced hikers.<BR>
5. Be prepared for bad weather and accidents, even on short walks.<BR>
6. Always remember a map and compass.<BR>
7. Never go alone.<BR>
8. Turn back before things get chritical.<BR>
9. Conserve your strength; look for shelter while there is still time<BR>
10. Always take along the necessary emergency gear.<BR>
11. Always bring extra warm clothes - even on short day tours.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Choice of route and hiking technique</B><BR>
Before starting off, the route must be carefully planned. Difficult passages
must be taken under consideration before making the final decision of the
route. It is important to be in good form and remember; it is your holiday!
Even the weakest on the team must be able to complete the day's march without
getting totally exhausted. Allow good time to complete the route and for
delays so you have time to climb a mountain, see a ruin or simply stay a
day or two at a beautiful spot. Allow for 1 - 2 demurrage days per week
in consequense of rain, wind or fog. Avoid too many climbings and descents
which will tax your energy. As a guideline you can walk 3 - 4 km per hour
on even ground. You will need approx. 1 hour extra everytime you climb or
descent 300 m. Take a break every hour and drink something hot or eat chocolate
or dried fruit in order to avoid an insufficient blood sugar balance.<BR>
<BR>
When everything is planned you must inform the authorities (the police,
friends, family, hotel, or the tourist office) of the planned route, estimated
duration etc. - and remember to inform them on your return. The planned
route must be followed as strictly as possible as this is where a search
will be initiated in case of emergencies. If you are too far away from the
planned route there is a risk that you will not be found.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Routes on the map</B><BR>
The recommended routes on this map are marked with different colours; Green
&gt; blue &gt; red &gt; black indicating the increasing level of difficulty.
The easiest routes - green and blue - are either on or close to beaten track
Since they often follow unsurfaced roads, valleys or fjords, the need to
be able to read contour lines and find one&#180;s way and position using
a map and a compass is limited, so there is little risk of getting lost.
There is a numberof easy routes around Ilulissat and the icefjord. <BR>
Hiking on recommended red and black routes calls for a greater sense of
direction, physical fitness and hiking experience. <BR>
<BR>
The routes on this map are only a small selection of the actual possibilities
in the terrain. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sense of locality</B><BR>
In Greenland there are several places with metal ores in the underground
which influences on the compass and makes it difficult to find one's way.
As a consequence it is important to make note of the landform and the characteristics
of the nature, for example a large mountain, a certain lake etc. and compare
these observations with the information on the map. The routes are unmarked
- however some are marked with cairns. As a supplement to the compass we
recommend mileometer, altimeter and protractor for maps.<BR>
<BR>
Compass declination<BR>
In Greenland there is a significant compass declination, this is indicated
on the map.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wind and weather</B><BR>The weather in Greenland changes a lot faster than in other countries. In
10 - 15 minutes it can be fogged and thereby be difficult to find one's
way or it can be storm and therefore be necessary to seek shelter for several
hours before continuing the tour. Make sure your equipment is geared for
sudden changes in the weather. Most people who suffer death in the mountains
do not die of hunger but of frost.<BR>
<BR>
The northern Greenland is characterized by stable climate both during the
summer and the winter. The area is called &quot;station of high-pressure&quot;.
Winter tourists who go dog sledding will experience cold, dry and stable
climate with sun most of the time.<BR>
The sun in Ilulissat ducks below the horizon on December 1 st and reemerges,
radiantly, on January 13th, after an absence of 6 weeks. From May 24th to
July 24th there will be midnight sun.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mean temperature - Celcius</B><BR>
January -20,9, February -19,8, March -23,3, April -9,8, May -1,6, June +5,6,
July +9,2, August +6,3, September +4,8, October +0,3, November -10,4.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Foehn</B> is a dry and warm wind. The foehn can be portended by black/blue
lens-shaped clouds over the inland ice and fall in the barometric pressure.
The temperature on the west coast rises at the same time as the foehn breaks
through with great intensity. The foehn can last for days and occur several
times during the same month. Only very few tents can stand the pressure
from a foehn storm and therefore we recommend you to dismantle the tent
and seek shelter behind big and heavy rocks. A foehn storm seldom lasts
more than 1 - 2 days. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tide</B>. In Greenland the difference between low-tide and high-tide
in the Disko area is approx. 2-3 m. This is especially important to kayakkers
as it is easier to row with the tide water than against the tide water.
When kayakkers go ashore it is important to place the kayak at a point where
the high tide cannot reach the kayak. For hikers, the tide is important
when rivers are to be crossed. It is a good idea to cross rivers early in
the morning before the sun melts too much ice into the river, or at low
tide. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kayakking</B>. When kayakking you should follow the coastline as far
as possible and make frequent use of your map and a chart. Use visible landmarks
to find your bearings such as points, rivers, mountains and valleys. Never
paddle in the icefjord or too close to icebergs. If a large iceberg capsizes,
it can create a real tidal wave. Bring a tide water table. When camping
close to glaciers or at sea shores close to large icebergs it is important
to place the kayak at a high point.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing and equipment</B><BR>
When hiking in the Greenlandic nature it is important to be able to take
care of one-self as you will often be far away from inhabited areas. Therefore
it is important to be prepared for an emergency situation beforehand - even
if your trip is just for the weekend. Plan the tour carefully and make sure
you have sufficient supplies and emergency equipment along with the ordinary
hiking gear. The clothes must protect against the cold, the wind, precipitation,
the sun and the heat and it is a good idea to dress so that the bodytemperature
can be regulated through the day. Three layers of clothing is recommended;
the inner layer must keep you warm even though the clothes get wet, the
middle layer must insulate against the cold and the outer layer must be
wind and rain proof. We recommend you to bring:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing</B>: &#183;Underwear, preferably woollen &#183;Extra socks &#183;Underwear
with long legs and sleeves allowing perspiration to escape &#183;Canvas
or cotton clothing &#183;Warm sweater or fleeced sweatshirt &#183;Rain and
windproof jacket and trousers &#183;Cap and finger gloves &#183;Good hiking
boots &#183;Shorts and T-shirts for warm days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camp cookware</B>: &#183;Trangia cooking gear including sufficient methylated
spirits or stove and pots including sufficient fuel bottles &#183;Matches
&#183;Mug, plates and cups &#183;Cutlery &#183;Bottles or thermo bottle
for water &#183;Salt, pepper and spices &#183;Plastic bags &#183;Lighter
etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sleeping gear:</B> &#183;Tent &#183;Sleeping bag &#183;Sleeping pad (insulating)
&#183;Toilet requisities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Security</B>: &#183;Map (and an extra map) &#183;Compass &#183;Emergency
radio and ANNA emergency kit &#183;Extra tent pegs and tent poles &#183;Sewing
kit &#183;Tools for repairs &#183;Multi purpose tools &#183;Strong knife
&#183;Extra chocolate &#183;Shoes for wading &#183;Approx. 20 m strong string.
<BR>
<BR>
We recommend <B>ANNA</B> emergency kit supplemented with VHF radio or ELT-emergency
transmitter. The kit has been designed especially for Greenlandic conditions
and includes instructions in Danish, English and Greenlandic. The ANNA kit
contains whistle, compass, flares (launching tube + cartridges), signalling
mirror, astro blanket, signal flag and a belt so that the kit can be strapped
around the waist. The ANNA emergency kit can often be rented at the tourist
offices.<BR>

<B>Nice to have:</B> &#183;Binoculars &#183;Fishing gear &#183;Handbooks
&#183;Tape or plaster for blisters &#183;Sunglasses &#183;Little ruck-sack
or hip pack &#183;Insect repellant &#183;Head net.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Footwear</B>. Much hiking in Greenland takes place on soil that does
not drain particularly well. Hiking boots of gore-tex are worth considering.
They are waterproof while allowing foot perspiration to escape. Some chooses
hiking rubber boots which are excellent on rainy days and in landscapes
with many small rivers and streams.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tents</B>. In general tunnel and dome-shaped tents are good in high winds.
In rough weather and high winds, for example foehn, light weight tent pegs
are highly inadequate. High winds can lacerate many of the lightweight materials
used to manufacture tents. Bring a few extra tent pegs and poles - just
in case and secure your tent with stones around the tent pegs and on the
sides of the tent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Insects/mosquitoes</B>. Bring sufficient supplies of insect repellants
and a head net. In addition to this it is a good idea to wear loose-fitting
clothes that can be properly closed and tightened at your wrists or ankles.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplies</B>. On hiking tours in Greenland it is often necessary to bring
all special provisions from home as there is little or no possibility of
buying groceries en route. Groceries, methylated spirits or gaz for the
cooking gear and freeze-dried foods is available in Ilulissat in shops or
at the tourist office. The supplies should contain abundant cocoa, coffee,
tea, chocolate, dried fruit or biscuits for breaks and cosy evenings. Remember
to bring emergency supplies for extra days. <BR>
<BR>
Regarding drinking water, Greenland has some of the purest water on Earth
and it can be drunk directly from rivers and streams. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Camping and cabins </B><BR>
With few exceptions it is permitted to pitch your tent anywhere in Greenland.
The exceptions are preserved areas and ruins from ancient times as well
as lakes supplying the nearby village or town with fresh water. Please respect
a line of minimum 20 m from any ruin. The Arctic nature is very vulnerable
and demands extra attention and consideration. Please bear this in mind
when choosing the camp site. Leave the area the way you wish to refind it
and leave nothing but footprints. Burn your trashes or bring it along when
the tour continues. As a general rule a good campsite is a place where the
ground is flat and the pegs can get a purchase and/or a place with large
boulders to which to lash the tent down. Another important consideration
is a site protected by the terrain with running water close by. Avoid dry
river beds or lowlying areas close to rivers as a camp here will easily
be flooded in case of heavy rain. <BR>
<BR>
With few exceptions cabins in the Ilulissat area are privately owned. It
is not permitted to use the cabins without permission from the owner. However
some huts in the area can be rented through the tourist office before starting
off.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fording</B><BR>
During a hike it will often be necessary to ford rivers. According to a
rule of thumb, one should never wade deeper than up to the knees. Otherwise
it is better to wait for the water level to drop (approx. 24 hours after
heavy rain). Another idea is to follow the river upstream to a better fording
place or do the exact opposite; go to the outflow and wade across at the
next low tide. It is a good idea to bring along a pair of rubber shoes as
special &quot;waders&quot; which it does not matter if you get wet. These
will give you a much better grip on smooth and sharp stones. Some form of
wading stick also increases safety considerably.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Search and rescue parties </B><BR>
Search and rescue parties are the job of the police all over Greenland.
As a general rule a rescue is free of charge for the victim. If the accident,
however, was self-induced or was due to an act of folly or the rescue party
was called unnecessarily, the police can issue an invoice to the victim.
Each case is evaluated by the police and the police decides whether the
victim must take a part of the costs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Survival technique</B><BR>
When going on hikes you must always be prepared for the worst. In case of
emergencies or accidents it is important to keep one's head, avoid panic
and not to give up. Accidents are never the same and it is impossible to
make a list of how to avoid the different types of accidents or how to behave
in each situation. However, the first rule is to give emergency treatment,
to stabilize the situtation and to keep the injured person warm and protected
against sun, coldness, rain and wind. After this you can look for help.
A large team can be divided in two and minimum two persons can look for
help. Remember to mark the place of the accident on the map. If you know
there are other hikers in the area or you can see/hear a helicopter/ aircraft,
you can use the flares or the whistle from the ANNA emergency kit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire</B>. If you have lost the last match fire can be made the primitive
way by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other or by means of a burning-glass
from a magnifying glass, binoculars or a lens.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Finding one's way</B>. Without map and compass it is almost impossible
to find one's way. However, if you loose both of your compasses you can
find the four points of the compass with a fairly accurate watch. Before
noon (12.00) the four points can be found by letting the hour hand point
towards the sun and halve the distance between the hour hand and the number
12. This direction is south. In the afternoon (after 12.00) the distance
between the number 12 and the hour hand is south.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Being found. </B>If you have had an accident and you want to be found
it is important to draw the attention to yourself in a very obvious way.
This can be done by making signals with whistle, mirrors, flares, distress
rockets, SOS in oversize, flags, clothing etc. It is important that the
signals can be seen from the air, as most rescue parties take place with
helicopter. Do not discharge the flares until you can hear a helicopter
as they only lighten for a short period. When signalling with a mirror in
nice weather, an aircraft can see you from a distance of 75 km. Many people
are found too late because they did not make themselves visible from the
air or left the planned route. If you are close to inhabited areas or in
an area with other hikers, you can blow the whistle 6 times/minute every
second minute. Answer to this signal is 3 whistles/minute.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fishing permits</B> <BR>
Fishing permits can be purchased from the Tourist office. Please familiarize
yourself with protected areas, where all fishing is banned and the periods
where angling is permitted. Information on preservations and close seasons
is available at the tourist office. Dates and rules may change from year
to year. <BR>
