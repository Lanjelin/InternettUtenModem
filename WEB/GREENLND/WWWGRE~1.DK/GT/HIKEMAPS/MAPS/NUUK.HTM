<H1><CENTER>Guide to the Nuuk Hiking Map:</CENTER>
</H1>
Greenland has attracted hikers for decades. The high beautiful mountains,
glaciers, ice-filled fjords, the flora and fauna the untouched nature and
the silence provide the unique experience of the arctic. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Hike around Quassussuaq (Lille Malene) - 12 km</B><BR>
The guiding is very simple - keep Quassussuaq on your right all the way
round. By following this advice it will be very difficult to get lost. The
tour takes approx. 4 - 6 hours and the level of difficulty is easy to slightly
difficult.<BR>
<BR>
(1) Start from the peat house at the road going to the airport just before
the large curve on the road. On the plain towards the fjord the &quot;Bedstemorforeningen&quot;
(Grand ma's association) has made a traditional Greenlandic house of peat
in order to show the young Greenlandic population how people were living
not too long ago. From the house you follow the asphalted road towards the
airport. Halfway through the curve you turn right and cross the parking
ground. (2) Having crossed the parking ground you turn right over the hill.
Here and there you can see traces of the path around Quassussuaq. The view
over the flat Akia (Nordlandet), the mountain Sermitsiaq and the fjord is
magnificient. (3) After approx. 1 km there are some beautiful foldings on
the face of the cliff. Take a close look and your imagination will help
you see different figures. A little bit further on there is a small cliff
towards the water (4). The path is between the cliff and Quassussuaq. After
the cliff the path gets more visible. If you hear a deep sound on your way
to the next projection it comes from two rivers in the valley you are about
to see. (5) From the river it is possible to make a detour to point 472.
From this peak there is a deep view into the fjord system. The route around
Quassussuaq continues over the first river. Be careful on the slippery stones
and do not be afraid to get wet socks. (6) From the river the route gets
a bit more difficult. On the right side of the river the ground rises sharply
and a waterfall of 5 - 10 m can be heard clearly. The vegetation is vigorous
due to the water nearby. (7) From here the route flattens out and after
another minor climb the ground gets flat and you have reached a lake with
melted water. By following the bank very close to Quassussuaq you will get
to a projection which is very suitable for a lunch break.<BR>
<BR>
(8) The view over the lake and the river which forms a delta can give you
the illusion that you are in a small aircraft over the Amazon river and
have the jungle beneath you. (9) The ground rises slightly and the next
part of the route goes through a more barren terrain. In the pass you are
at the highest point, 260 m above sea level. On the other side of the pass
there is a system of lakes. The first one is very small but deep. If the
weather is good you could try a short dive. (10) A header from the largest
stone into the cold water is indeed an experience to remember. But, be careful;
the watertemperature is 1 - 2&#176; C so do not stay in the water too long
and make sure you get warm afterwards. (11) Man-made creations can be seen
again. Large pylons with wires cross the route. The wires are from a hydro-electric
power station 56 km away in the fjord Buksefjorden which supplies the population
in Nuuk with environmentally compatible energy. The view over the fjord
with the skerries and the sea is magnificient - take a break and enjoy it.
On your right you can get a glimpse of Nuuk. In front of you, deep down
you can see the lake Qallussuaq (Cirkuss&oslash;en) which supplies Nuuk
with fresh water. The Danish name refers to the large amphitheatre-shaped
valley in which the lake is situated. The Greenlandic name means spoon.
After the descent follow the path on the right side of the river. At the
lake there are small rivers to pass. (12) Along the bank of the lake there
are some instruments which are used for weather and water measurements.
Pay regard and do not touch the equipment. At the end of the lake the river
is to be crossed for the last time, this time over a dam made of concrete.
(13). <BR>
(14) Under the gravel road from the lake there are water pipelines. Follow
the gravel road and enjoy the view over the skerries. (15) At a northgoing
curve on the road there is a navigation mark. Here you must leave the road
and follow the water pipeline over a small mountain crest with granite boulders
on the side. This is the last prevention on the route. Over the rock face
the refuse disposal plant is situated and from here you can see Nuussuaq
- the suburb to Nuuk. And here the tour ends (16).<BR>
<BR>
<B>To the top of Quassussuaq (Lille Malene)</B><BR>
If you want a short tour and still have the chance for a magnificient view
over the landscape, the tour to the top of Quassussuaq is recommended. From
here you can enjoy the view over Nuuk, Akia (Nordlandet), islands, peninsulas
and the sea. Start from the skiing lift behind the airport and follow the
lift to the top of Quassussuaq. The tour can be done in 2 - 3 hours. On
weekdays bus no. 3 goes from the town centre to the airport.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ukkusissat (Store Malene)</B><BR>
Another day-tour possibility is a walk to the top of Ukkusissat (772 m).
From the top you can enjoy the view over Nuuk, Akia (Nordlandet), Sermitsiaq
and into the fjord Kangerluarsunnguaq (Kobbefjord). One of the mountains
along The Kangerluarsunnguaq has a glacier with perpetular snow. One of
the routes follows the pylons going to the hydro electric power station
in Buksefjorden. It is hard but not difficult in dry weather. The tour can
be done in 4 - 7 hours. The route is gradually rising and at some places
you will be walking on uncovered rock surface which can be slippery on rainy
days. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kangerluarsunnguaq (Kobbefjord)</B><BR>
Kangerluarsunnguaq is a recreational summer skiing area for people from
Nuuk. There are many hiking possibilities of different degrees as well as
many possibilities for glacier hiking, skiing and mountaineering. <BR>
The best time for winter tour skiing in the area is from the middle of February
to the end of April. (When the fjord is frozen and you can cross it). Please
inquire at Nuuk Tourism for detailed information on the ice situation. In
the summer you can be transported by boat to the area. You can walk back
to Nuuk or the other way around. Depending on the tide the tour can be done
in 1 - 2 days. The most difficult passage en route is the northeastern side
of the fjord from the head of the fjord to the island Kissaviannguit. In
Kangerluarsunnguaq there are 3 cabins (1996) which can be rented at Nuuk
Tourism. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Eqaluit Paarliit (Pr&aelig;stefjorden)</B><BR>
If you can get boat transport to and from the fjord there are many hiking
possibilities. At the beach there are 10 private cabins and a camp school
(1996). On the other side of the beach there is a plain which is suitable
for primitive camping. Hikes and walks start from the cabins. There are
many paths in the valley and by the river. In the river arctic char can
be caught. If you stay close to the river you can always find the way back.
For those who are interested in longer hikes the tour to Qasigiannguit at
the fjord Ameralik (Lysefjord) is recommended. From Eqaluit Paarliit the
tour continues to the end of the valley. Afterwards you continue in northeastern
direction and pass 3 lakes. Lake no. 3 must be passed on its northeastern
side. From here you continue to Qasigiannguit. Follow the path east of the
river. At the beach there are 3 cabins. Camping is recommended close to
the river. The tour takes approx. 2 - 3 days each way.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Qoorqut</B><BR>
It is possible to walk the distance Nuuk-Qoorqut, however, we only recommend
it to very experienced hikers. The tour can be done in 3 - 4 days and has
many climbs and descents. From Qoorqut the hike can continue to the village
Kapisillit and from here to the ice cap. The hike from Qoorqut to Kapisillit
is a nice tour. At Qassi, halfway from Nuuk to Qoorqut, there are some dangerous
passages which requires special attention. The tour is recommendend in July
and August. <BR>
<B>Snow mobiling</B><BR>
The season for snow mobiling normally starts around November - December,
however this depends on the weather and snow conditions. Rent of snow mobiles
with driver can be arranged through Nuuk Tourism.<BR>
<BR>
An exciting short tour to the vantage point at Ukkusissaq (Store Malene)
should be experienced. Here there is a great view over the landscape. From
this point you can continue to Kangerluarssunnguaq (Kobbefjord), if there
is sufficient snow at the descent. The way down at Itillinnguaq to Kangerluarssunnguaq
is in an indirect way the entrance to the recreational areas around Nuuk.
The fjord is most passable from the middle of February to the end of April
in frosty weather. At the island Kissaviannguit Qeqertaat there can be holes
and openings in the ice. Remember that driving and walking on ice is always
connected with danger. <BR>
<BR>
Do not take out on a snow mobile on your own and bring emergency equipment
as recommended on hiking tours. For example an ANNA emergency kit and a
VHF radio. Respect the cross country skiiers and their tracks around Nuuk
and the skiing lift. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Winter hiking and camping </B><BR>
After a period with thaw and frost the ice crust gets hard and icy. In such
periods (March - April) the hill sides are as a road and are easy to walk
on. It is a good idea to bring ski sticks for support and perhaps anti skids
for boots to use when descending and climbing steep passages. During the
thaw period in the summer it is important to pay attention to &quot;snowbridges&quot;
over rivers and streams. Be careful at slippery and icy hill sides - a slide
down a mountain side is very dangerous. <BR>
<BR>
The area behind Quassussuaq (Lille Malene) has many possibilities for short
campings with tent if you would like to try this in the winter (April).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camping</B><BR>
There are many suitable places along the north coast close to the The road
going to the airport and on the plain between Ukkusissat and Qinngorput
(Malenebugten) - only the plain is quite far away from the town. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Kayakking </B><BR>
When kayakking you should follow the coastline as far as possible and make
frequent use of your map and a sea chart. It is necessary to orientate from
landmarks and take note of characteristics of landscape such as headlands,
rivers, mountains and valleys. It is very important to note there can be
coastal sections where cliffs fall so vertically that it is impossible to
reach land if there is a strong wind. The tides are around 3 - 4 m. Waves
against a strong tide can be high. Never paddle too close to icebergs. If
a large iceberg capsizes, it can create a real tidal wave. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fauna</B><BR>
Throughout the summer there is a fair chance to see whales and seals hunting
for food in the fjordsystem. With your fishing tackle you can catch Greenland
Cod, Sculpins, American Plaice and even Arctic Char. Fishing in the fjord
and rivers requires a fishing permit. Further away from the town you can
see Reindeer, Snow buntings, Lapland buntings and Ptarmigans. Behind bushes
you might see nests with eggs. Ravens and Seagulls watch over every movement
in the terrain. Foxes and white tailed eagles can also be seen. Close to
the town the animals are shy. The only animals that do not fear the human
being are mosquitoes - in fact they are very eager to get in touch with
people. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Flora</B><BR>
The flora is very varied around Quassussuaq and you can see Northern willow,
Lichen, Moss, Arctic blueberries and Crowberries. Towards Paradisdalen Club
moss and Roseroot can be seen as well as mushrooms. The pass is rather barren
with Lichen. The descent to the lake Qallussuaq is a sunny and moisted area.
Here the flora is very vigorous and apart from the above mentioned plants
there are Coltsfoot and even Brackens.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Geology</B><BR>
The tour around Quassussuaq shows some of the characteristics of the rocks.
Some of the oldest mountains on Earth have been found here, dating 3,5 billion
years back. Quassussuaq is a separate mountain surrounded by gneiss and
felspar.<BR>
<BR>
Geologists believe that Akia (Nordlandet) is a small continental plate between
two other continents. The boundary is the eastern side of the Sermitsiaq
island and along Ukkussissat. In the area there are stripes going north-northeast
- south-southwest. 
<H1><CENTER><HR>General information about hiking in the Nuuk area:</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
When going for longer walks outside Nuuk one should be familiar with safety
on hikes and proper clothing and equipment. On longer tours one should also
be able to use a map and a compass. If you are not too sure, you should
choose a guided hike organized by Nuuk Tourism.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commandments for hiking</B><BR>
Hiking in Greenland, outside inhabited areas, is mainly for experienced
hikers and provide that your physical condition and sense of direction are
good and that you know how to use a map and a compass.<BR>
<BR>
On longer tours, you have to be able to enjoy untouched nature miles away
from the nearest inhabited place. A sensible attitude to adopt is the assumption
of being left completely to one's own devices. Only very limited assistance
is available for the hillwalker, such as for example marked paths, designated
routes, signposting, bridges and suchlike. <BR>
<BR>
The following rules of the mountains are a good help when going about the
nature. By keeping these rules the risk of accidents en route will be reduced.<BR>
<BR>
1. Don't start off on long walks without some previous training and planning<BR>
2. Let someone know where you're heading and when you expect to be back.<BR>
3. Pay attention to the weather and the weather reports. <BR>
4. Listen to experienced hikers.<BR>
5. Be prepared for bad weather and accidents, even on short walks.<BR>
6. Always remember a map and compass.<BR>
7. Never go alone.<BR>
8. Turn back before things get chritical.<BR>
9. Conserve your strength; look for shelter while there is still time<BR>
10. Always take along the necessary emergency gear.<BR>
11. Always bring extra warm clothes - even on short day tours.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Choice of route and hiking technique</B><BR>
Before starting off, the route must be carefully planned and difficult passages
must be taken under consideration before making the final decision of the
route. It is important to be in good form and even the weakest on the team
must be able to complete the day's march without getting totally exhausted.
Avoid too many climbings and descents which will tax your energy. As a guideline
you can walk 3 - 4 km per hour on even ground and you will need approx.
1 hour extra everytime you climb or descent 300 m. <BR>
<BR>
When everything is planned you must inform the authorities (the police,
your family, friends, hotel, or the tourist office) of the planned route,
the estimated duration etc. - and remember to inform them on your return.
The planned route must be followed as strictly as possible as this is where
a search will be initiated in case of emergencies. If you are too far away
from the planned route there is a risk that you will not be found.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Routes on the map</B><BR>
The recommended routes on this map are marked with different colors; Green
&gt; blue &gt; red &gt; black indicating the increasing level of difficulty.
The easiest routes - green and blue - are either on or close to beaten track.
Since they often follow unsurfaced roads, valleys or fjords, the need to
be able to read contour lines and find one&#180;s way and position using
a map and a compass is limited, so there is little risk of getting lost.
Hiking on recommended red and black routes calls for a greater sense of
direction, physical fitness and hiking experience. <BR>
<BR>
The routes on the map are only a small selection of the actual possibilities
in the terrain.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sense of locality</B><BR>
In Greenland there are several places with metal ores in the underground
which influence on the compass and makes it difficult to find one's way.
As a consequence it is important to make note of the landform and the characteristics
of the nature, for example a large mountain, a certain lake etc. and compare
these observations with the information on the map. <BR>
<BR>
In Greenland there is a significant compass declination, this is indicated
on the map.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wind and weather</B><BR>
The weather in Greenland changes a lot faster than is usual in other countries.
In 10 - 15 minutes it can be fogged and thereby be difficult to find one's
way or it can be storm and be necessary to seek shelter for several hours
before continuing the tour. Make sure your equipment is geared for sudden
changes in the weather. Most people who suffer death in the mountains do
not die of hunger but of frost. The temperatures mentioned below indicate
the temperatures in the different months. It is a good idea to bring gloves
and a cap - even in the summer, as it can be very cold when the wind blows.
On the other hand it can be very warm on a sunny spot -up to 20&#176; C.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Foehn</B> is a dry and warm wind. The foehn can be portended by black/blue
lens-shaped clouds over the inland ice and fall in the barometric pressure.
The temperature on the west coast rises at the same time as the foehn breaks
through with great intensity. Only very few tents can stand the pressure
from a foehn storm and therefore we recommend you to dismantle the tent
and seek shelter behind big and heavy rocks. A foehn storm seldom lasts
more than 1-2 days. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tide</B>. In Greenland the difference between low-tide and high-tide
is approx. 3-4 m. This is especially important to kayakkers as it is easier
to row with the tide water than against it. When kayakkers go ashore it
is important to place the kayak at a point where the high tide cannot reach
the kayak. For hikers the tide is important when rivers are to be crossed.
It is a good idea to cross rivers early in the morning before the sun melts
too much ice into the river or at low tide. <BR>
<BR>
We recommend kayakkers to bring a tide water table. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Clothing and equipment</B><BR>
When hiking in the Greenlandic nature it is important to be able to take
care of one-self as you will often be far away from inhabited areas. Therefore
it is important to be prepared for an emergency situation beforehand - even
if your trip is just for the weekend. Make sure you have sufficient supplies
and emergency equipment along with the ordinary hiking gear. The clothes
must protect against the cold, the wind, precipitation, the sun and the
heat and it is a good idea to dress so the bodytemperature can be regulated
through the day. Three layers of clothing is recommended; the inner layer
must keep you warm even though the outer layer gets wet, the middle layer
must insulate against the cold and the outer layer must be wind and rain
proof. We recommend you to bring:<BR>
Clothing: Underwear, preferably woollen Extra socks Underwear with long
legs and sleeves allowing perspiration to escape Canvas or cotton clothing
Warm sweater or fleeced sweatshirt Rain and windproof jacket and trousers
Cap and finger gloves Good hiking boots Shorts and T-shirts for warm days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Camp cookware</B>: Trangia cooking gear including sufficient methylated
spirits or stove and pots including sufficient fuel bottles Mug, plates
and cups Cutlery bottles or thermo bottle for water Salt, pepper and spices
Plastic bags, lighter etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sleeping gear</B>: Tent Sleeping bag Sleeping pad (insulating) Toilet
requisities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Security:</B> Map (and an extra map) Compass Emergency radio and ANNA
emergency kit Extra tent pegs and tent poles Sewing kit Tools for repairs
Multi purpose tools Strong knife Extra chocolate Shoes for wading Approx.
20 m strong string. <BR>
<BR>
We recommend <B>ANNA</B> emergency kit supplemented wih VHF radio or ELT-emergency
transmitter. The kit has been designed especially for Greenlandic conditions.
The ANNA kit includes instruction in Danish, English and Greenlandic and
contains, whistle, compass, flares (launching tube + cartridges), signalling
mirror, astro blanket, signal flag and a belt so that the kit can be strapped
around the waist. ANNA emergency kit can be bought at KNI shops and ship's
supply stores. ANNA emergency kit is also available from Greenlandair at
the heliport or airport or at tourist offices. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Nice to have</B>: Binoculars Fishing gear Handbooks Tape or plaster for
blisters Sunglasses Little ruck-sack or hip pack Insect repellant Head net.<BR>
Footwear: Much hiking in Greenland takes place on soil that does not drain
particularly well. Hiking boots of gore-tex are worth considering. They
are waterproof while allowing foot perspiration to escape. Some chooses
hiking rubber boots which are excellent on rainy days and in landscapes
with many small rivers and streams.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tents:</B> In general tunnel and domeshaped tents are good in high winds.
In rough weather and high winds, for example foehn, light weight tent pegs
are highly inadequate. High winds can lacerate many of the lightweight materials
used to manufacture tents. Bring a few extra tent pegs and poles - just
in case and secure your tent with stones around the tent pegs and on the
side of the tent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Insects/mosquitoes</B>: Bring sufficient supplies of insect repellants
and a head net. In addition to this it is a good idea to bring loose-fitting
clothes that can be properly closed and tightened at your wrists or ankles.
Some hikers prefer to walk in the evening/night and sleep during the day
as the mosquitoes are less active during the evenings. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Supplies:</B> On hiking tours in Greenland it is necessary to bring all
special provisions from home as there is little or no possibility of buying
groceries en route. Shops and grocery stores in the towns and villages do
not have special products for hikers and mountaineers such as for example
freeze-dried foods. Remember to bring emergency supplies for extra days.
The supplies should contain abundant cocoa, coffee, tea, chocolate, dried
fruit or biscuits for breaks and cosy evenings. <BR>
Regarding drinking water, Greenland has some of the purest water on Earth
and it can be drunk directly from rivers and streams. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Camping and cabins</B><BR>
With few exceptions it is permitted to pitch your tent anywhere in Greenland,
however, it is necessary to respect the preserved areas and ruins from ancient
times as well as lakes supplying the nearby village or town with fresh water.
Please respect a line of minimum 20 m from any ruin. The arctic nature is
very vulnerable and demands extra attention and consideration. Please bear
this in mind when choosing the camp site. Burn your trashes or bring it
along when the tour continues. As a general rule a good campsite is a place
where the ground is flat and the pegs can get a purchase and/or a place
with large boulders to which to lash the tent down. Another important consideration
is a site protected by the terrain with running water close by. Avoid dry
river beds or lowlying areas close to rivers as a camp here will easily
be flooded in case of heavy rain. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fording: </B><BR>
During a hike it will often be necessary to ford rivers. According to a
rule of thumb, one should never wade deeper than up to the knees. Otherwise
it is best to wait for the water level to drop (approx. 24 hours after heavy
rain). Another idea is to follow the river upstream to a better fording
place or do the exact opposite; go to the outflow and wade across at the
next low tide. It is a good idea to bring along a pair of rubber shoes as
special &quot;waders&quot; which it does not matter if you get wet. These
will give you a much surer grip on smooth and sharp stones. Some form of
wading stick also increases safety considerably.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Search and rescue parties </B><BR>
Search and rescue parties are the job of the police all over Greenland.
As a general rule a rescue is free of charge for the victim. If the accident,
however, was self-induced or was due to an act of folly or the rescue party
was called unnecessarily the police can issue an invoice to the victim.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Survival technique</B><BR>
In case of emergencies or accidents it is important to keep one's head,
avoid panic and not to give up. Accidents are never the same and it is impossible
to give guidelines for behaviour. However, the first rule is to give emergency
treatment, to stabilize the situtation and to keep the injured person warm
and protected against sun, coldness, rain and wind. After this you can look
for help. A large team can be divided in two and minimum two persons can
look for help. Remember to mark the place of the accident on the map. If
you know there are other hikers in the area or you can see/hear a helicopter/
aircraft, you can use the flares or the whistle from the ANNA emergency
kit.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fire</B>: If you have lost the last match, fire can be made the primitive
way by rubbing two pieces of wood against each other or by means of a burningglass
from a magnifying glass, binoculars or a lens.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Finding one's way: </B>Without map and compass it can be almost impossible
to find one's way. However, if you loose both of your compasses you can
find the four points of the compass with a fairly accurate watch. Before
noon (12.00) the four points can be found by letting the hour hand point
towards the sun and halve the distance between the hour hand and the number
12. This direction is south. In the afternoon (after 12.00) the distance
between the number 12 and the hour hand is south.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Being found</B>: It is important to draw the attention to yourself in
a very obvious way. This can be done by making signals with whistle, mirrors,
flares, distress rockets, SOS in oversize, flags, clothing etc. It is important
that the signals can be seen from the air, as most rescue parties take place
with helicopter. Do not discharge the flares until you can hear a helicopter
as they only lighten for a short period. When signalling with a mirror in
nice weather, an aircraft can see you from a distance of 75 km. Many people
are found too late because they did not make themselves visible from the
air. If you are close to inhabited areas or in an area with other hikers,
you can blow the whistle 6 times/minute every second minute. Answer to this
signal is 3 whistles/minute.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fishing permits</B><BR>
Anyone over the age of 18 who wants to fish in Greenland must have a valid
fishing permit. Fishing permit can be obtained at the local tourist office
or from the police. <BR>
The hills around Nuuk offer fantastic experiences for hikers. There are
many routes of different level of difficulty.<BR>
