<H2><A NAME="Geography">Geography</A></H2>
Greenland is the world's largest island covering an area of 2,175,600 sq. km. Geographically, it belongs to the North American continent. Across the Nares Strait there are only 26 km separating North West Greenland from Canada. To compare, Svalbard (Spitzbergen) and Iceland are 500 and 275 km away, respectively.
<br>
It is 2,670 km from the farthest point north, Cape Marris Jeppup (only 740 km from the North Pole) to the southern most tip, Cape Farewell, which lies at the same latitude as Oslo.
<br>
The inland ice-cap covers an area of 1.8 million square kilometres and represents 10% of the world's total fresh water. At its centre the ice-cap is 8 km thick. Greenland's ice-free regions cover an area of 341,700 sq. km.
<H2><A NAME="Climate">Climate</A></H2>
From north to south, Greenland spans several climatic zones. Even in South Greenland the presence of the inland ice-cap still gives rise to a climate which is Arctic (sub-Arctic). The annual mean-temperature is below zero and summer temperatures rarely exceed 10°C. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Greenland was -70°C at the northern most tip of the ice-cap.
<br>
The colossal ice-cap has its own climatic character. The edges of the inland ice experience frequent hurricanes and snow storms. On a yearly average, a metre of snow falls on the ice-cap. This is the equivalent of 34-35 centimetres of water. Annually, Greenland's southern region receives over 2000 mm more rain than the northern region.
<br>
There are also marked differences in the climate along the coastal regions and in the hinterland.
<H2><A NAME="Permafrost and Topography">Permafrost and Topography</A></H2>
Permafrost, as the name suggests, is the layer of earth which is perpetually frozen. Only the surface thaws during the short but intense summers. This phenomenon, common over all of northern Greenland and in parts of South Greenland, creates problems for the construction industry.
<br>
The ice-free coastlands are characterized by mountainous terrain. The highest peaks are situated on the East coast where peaks reach almost 4,000 metres above sea level.
<H2><A NAME="Vegetation">Vegetation</A></H2>
Greenland lies north of the tree line and with rare exceptions it is not possible to cultivate crops. For example, the growing season is too short to allow even wheat to mature.
<br>
Forest-like brush exists in many places. The sunniest valleys in South Greenland have stands of strong, upright birch trees which attain a height of up to 7 metres. Greenlandic ash and various species of willow, evergreens, ferns and several species of herbs also grow in South Greenland. Greenland has a highly varied flora growing on its mountain-slopes, marshes and meadows.
<br>
Although the soil in Greenland is fertile, its productivity is improved with the addition of fertilizers.
<br>
<H2><A NAME="Ice">Ice</A></H2>
Most of Greenland is surrounded by ice. The pack-ice from the polar regions floats along the East coast, around Cape Farewell and is conducted up the west coast. Gradually it breaks up and melts, occasionally reaching as far north as Nuuk.
<br>
It is not normally possible to sail in the Disko Bay (Upernavik) region from December to April or May. Sometimes even the Sisimiut region is impassable during this period. Qaanaaq can be reached by sea only in July, August and September. Ammassalik can be reached from July to October and Illoqqortoormiut only from July to September.<P>
