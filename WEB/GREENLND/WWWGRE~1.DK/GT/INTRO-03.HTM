With the help of the Danish king's assistance in 1721, the Norwegian priest, Hans Egede, equipped an expedition to Greenland to convert the Greenland Vikings to Christianity, little knowing that they had long ago disappeared. For obvious reasons a Lutheran mission and trading station was established among the Greenlanders instead. Colonialism was thereby established, lasting until constitutional change in 1953.
<br>
In the beginning, colonialism in Greenland was synonymous with an isolationist policy. The Danish authorities feared outside competition and felt that the Greenland society was too vulnerable to foreign influences. Progress took its own course as the introduction of trade and the concentration of the population upset the social structure. In a short time Greenlandic society underwent change and became based around the colonies.
<br>
The first sign of Greenlandic participation in the decision making process was seen in 1857 with the establishment of Superintendentships which were responsible for some aspects of governing at the local level of society. In 1908 two Greenlandic Country Councils were established, one in the North and the other one in the South. Simultaneously, the Superintendentships became the equivalent of town or county councils based on the Danish traditions for organization.
<br>
As in other places, World War II changed social and political conditions and in 1950 the two County Councils were amalgamated into the Greenland Council. Municipal administration was re-structured and made more efficient in preparation for major social changes already on the horizon.
<br>
With constitutional change in 1953, Greenland became a part of Denmark. Colonialism was annulled and as in the Faeroe Islands, Greenland was granted two seats in the Danish Parliament. As Danish citizens, Civil rights accorded to the Danes were granted to the Greenlandic population. Health conditions and educational possibilities were radically improved.

<H2><A NAME="The Homerule System">The Homerule System</A></H2>
In May 1979 The Home Rule Government was established. Thus, Greenland obtained status as a special cultural identity within the Kingdom of Denmark, a status the Faeroese had procured in 1948. A basic tenant of the Home Rule Government is that administration of Greenlandic matters be conducted by the Greenlandic authorities whereas cases pertaining to the Danish Kingdom fall under Danish jurisdiction.
<br>
The transfer of all the areas deemed necessary to the proper functioning of the Home Rula Government have now been completed. It has taken place gradually. The first transfer placed responsibility for the municipalities with the Home Rule Government in 1979 at its formation. The next step was the transfer in 1980 of responsibility for schools, church, the social system, and the tax department amongst others. The State run Royal Greenland Trade Department (KGH) was transferred in 1985-86 and was re-named The Greenland Trade Department (KNI). The Greenland Technical Organization later re-named Nuna-Tek, was transferred in 1987, as was responsibility for the housing section and infra-structure. The last major sector transferred was the Department of Health in 1992.
<H2><A NAME="The Parliament and Cabinet">The Parliament and Cabinet</A></H2>
The Home Rule Government is composed of representatives elected in Greenland and an administration led by a cabinet. The cabinet is elected by the parliament.
<br>
Otherwise known as government, the Greenland Cabinet is comprised of a chairman (The Premier of Greenland) and a number of ministers. Responsibility for the administration of the Home Rule Government lies with the Cabinet. Members of the cabinet have fiscal responsibility in distinct areas, though all important decisions are made during parliamentary sessions.
<br>
The latest election was held on March 4, 1995. Today the parliament consists of 31 elected representatives. The cabinet consists of seven members, a coalition between two parties - <STRONG>Siumut</STRONG> (<EM>The Social Democratic Party</EM>) with twelwe mandates and <STRONG>Atassut </STRONG>(<EM>Liberal Party</EM>) with ten. In addition to the parties represented in the cabinet, three addition parties are represented in the Parliament: <STRONG>Inuit Ataqatigiit</STRONG> (<EM>Socialist Party</EM>) with six seats, <STRONG>Akulliit Partiiat</STRONG> (<EM>Center Party</EM>) with two seats and <STRONG>Kattusseqatigiit</STRONG> (<EM>Union of Indenpendents</EM>) with one seat.<P> The following ministries represent the portfolios of the cabinet ministries:
<br>
Ministry of Finance and Housing
<br>
Ministry of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture
<br>
Ministry of Health, The Environment and Research
<br>
Ministry of Culture, Education and The Church
<BR>
Ministry of Trade and Industry, Transportation and Public Works
<br>
Ministry of Social Affairs and The Labour Market

The High Commissioner of the Danish State is the chief representative of the Danish State. His function is to facilitate, represent, and to plan meetings between the Greenlandic authorities and the Danish government including occasional representatives of foreign countries. Moreover, the functions as a representative of the authorities of the Danish State within Greenland pertaining to the application of matters of principal dealing with Home Rule Government. He also attends parliamentary sessions and can carry out recommendations concerning Cabinet laws and statuary circulars issued by the Home Rule Government.
<br>
The High Commissioner of the Danish State's responsibility has been greatly reduced in tempo with the transfers to the Home Rule Government. Nevertheless the High Commissioner is the chief head of the Danish State and administers legal family affairs and is responsible for holding elections for the Danish Parliament in Greenland, including referendums dealing with the relationship between Greenland and Denmark.
<br>
There are also other state institutions in Greenland. Both the Chief Justice and the Police Commissioner are a part of the Danish judicial system.
<br>
Moreover, the Ministry of Defence maintains a naval post which facilitates fisheries inspection and matters of territorial sovereignty. In order to maintain the sovereignty in Greenland, the department of defence maintains the Sirius Patrol in Northeast Greenland which carries out surveillance by dog-sledge.
<br>
The United States of America still maintains a military and radar base at Pituffik/Thule.<BR>
<H2><A NAME="Municipalities">Municipalities</A></H2>
Greenland is divided into 18 municipalities. The municipal structure is comprised of a town and a number of villages. The town normally has the highest population, usually a thousand or more inhabitants. Large fishing industries, educational and administrative centres are located here. The size of the municipalities varies a great deal. The Municipality of Upernavik in North Greenland, for example, covers a geographic area the size of Denmark, whereas the Municipality of Ivigtut is one of the smallest. 80% of Greenland's population live in towns.
<br>
Several years after independent municipal administration was initiated in 1905, municipalities began to manage wild-life resources and the social sector, expenses being refunded by the State Treasury.
<br>
In the mid 60's, matters relating to construction, environmental cleanliness, maintenance of roads, amongst others, were allocated to the municipalities. After 1971 the municipalities were allowed to retain a certain percentage of the taxes.<BR>
<H2><A NAME="Villages">Villages</A></H2>
The villages are the smallest dwelling places within municipalities. The population is more sparse in comparison to towns, usually from under 100 and up to over 600 inhabitants. The means of subsistence in such places is generally the same: hunting and fishing. Today, there are approximately 100 villages throughout Greenland. The Municipality of Upernavik has the largest number of villages - 11 in all.
<br>
Village councils are elected; they carry out the tasks delegated to them by the board of governors from the town councils. The village council can recommend its own policies to the board of governors, which, as far as possible deal with issues concerning the village where they reside.<P>
