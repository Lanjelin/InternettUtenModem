Passport and visa regulations for Greenland are similar to the current rules applicable to Denmark. However, a special permit (&quot;entry approval&quot;) is needed for transit through Thule Air Base/Pituffik. This permit can be applied for through the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs or through the Danish embassies abroad. It is recommended to apply well in advance of any planned trip to Greenland. Persons arriving without the necessary permits run the risk of being sent back to Copenhagen.<BR>
  <BR>
<I>Conditions of entry outside populated areas:</I><BR>

Anyone traveling to Greenland to go mountain-climbing or ascend glaciers in isolated areas, cross the ice-sheet or undertake any other similar sporting activity, or wishing to pay a visit to Greenland National Park must apply for a permit well in advance of their departure from:<BR>

Greenland is regarded as being overseas for Danish customs purposes. Information about what can be brought into Greenland tax-free is available at airports. Various articles for personal use can be imported, but there is a ban on the import of guns, pistols, fully and semi-automatic weapons, narcotics and live animals, including domestic pets and birds of any kind. Guide dogs for the blind are an exception.<P>

Travel from Greenland to Denmark is subject to the general rules governing imports from a non-EC country.<BR>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="Export restrictions">Export restrictions</A></H3>

Certain countries have introduced a ban on products originating from Greenland: for instance, sealskin products, objects made of whale tooth/tusk and so on. For the sake of the customs authorities in your home country, you will need in certain cases to bring along a certificate confirming that the relevant products are not made of material from an endangered species. Such certificates are obtainable from shops and tourist offices, where further information can also be had about specific restrictions applicable in various countries.<BR>

The range of goods available in Greenland differs greatly from town to town and in the case of North and East Greenland also depends on the time of year. Generally speaking, the range available in larger towns is much the same as that available in smaller towns of Scandinavia, though prices do vary. For example, fruit and vegetables are expensive while dairy produce is cheap. Prices are generally on a par with those in Scandinavia.<BR>

In most towns, there are opportunities to buy items of Greenlandic homecraft. The most common homecraft products are objects carved from bone and reindeer antler (jewelry and tupilaks, etc.) and soapstone, hidework, pearlwork, Greenlandic stones shaped into jewelry, models of Greenlandic hunting implements and so on.<BR>
       <BR>
Souvenirs can generally be bought in the local shops, at the tourist office, at the Seamen's Home, at hotels, privately and in some smaller towns at the post office. There is no haggling or bargaining over prices. When buying hides or hide products, always make sure the skins are tanned. Untreated Greenlandic hides will not keep in the European climate.<BR>
