<STRONG>You will always get most out of a trip if you have had an opportunity to familiarize yourself with your destination beforehand. Possible sources of relevant information are described below.</STRONG><BR>

All towns in Greenland have a tourist office or service function able to provide information about accommodation and experience opportunities in the individual town. The tourist office can also advise you on and organize special events as well as arranging contacts with, for example, institutions and public authorities.<BR>
  <BR>
Most tourist offices also offer guided outings, sales of homecraft and similar. Some tourist offices hire out kayaks, tents, sleeping bags, skis, bicycles and fishing gear.<BR>
       <BR>
Since the possibilities for experiences and activities, local transport and forms of overnight accommodation other than hotels and seamen's homes often change and are largely seasonal, it would be expedient to enquire about the latest changes even during your planning phase.<BR>

Information office where travelers to Greenland can obtain information about holiday destinations prior to departure.<BR>
       <BR>
Greenland Tourism a/s is staffed by Greenlandic, Danish, English and German-speaking personnel who are willing to deal with all enquiries by phone or in writing, responding with brochure material as well as advice and guidance of an individual nature. Highly specific questions, however, will be referred to more specialized institutions.<BR>
       <BR>
One essential function of the office is the distribution of Greenland Tourism a/s' own brochures and information material.<BR>
       <BR>
For larger organized events in which Greenland is represented, either directly or indirectly, the office can offer support in the form of display/exhibition material, video lending and brochures. Other forms of support can be discussed on an individual basis.<BR><BR>

<I><B>Key map</B></I><BR>
Under the auspices of the National Survey and Cadastre, Denmark, a number of maps have been produced over the years on different scales and with varying quality. To mention just a few of these here: the key or index map, 1:5,000,000, of the whole of Greenland, Orthofoto's 1:100,000 of North Greenland and a series of maps with 1:125,000, covering all ice-free areas throughout Greenland with the exception of North Greenland.<BR>

Kalaallit Nunaat Atlas is an excellent general survey work in Danish and English versions, which in addition to map material includes a wealth of information about Greenland in general: Natural conditions, weather, climate and a large body of statistical material.<BR>

Based on the National Survey and Cadastre's basic material, SAGA-Maps has produced a series of 20 maps in all, which in a user-friendly way cover the inhabited and most commonly visited areas of Greenland. The scale is 1:250,000, the equidistance 50 m. The maps are marked with towns and villages, ruins from former Inuit and Norse settlements, sled tracks and waterfalls.<BR>
       <BR>
Please bear in mind that the legend for the maps must be requested as an appendix, as it is not printed on the actual maps.<BR>
       <BR>
SAGA-Maps also publishes historical guides with text and illustrations. To date, these cover four areas: Nuuk, whose theme is the &quot;Norse Period&quot;&#59; Ammassalik, whose theme is &quot;Traditional Greenlandic Culture&quot;&#59; Disko Bay, where the theme is the &quot;Colonial Age&quot;&#59; and finally Sisimiut/Kangerlussuaq, whose theme is &quot;Whaling&quot; and the American presence at Sondre Strom Air Base (1942-1982).<BR>
       <BR>
The historical guides are published in Danish, English, German and Greenlandic and are available both as separate guides as well as printed on the back of the four 1:250,000 SAGA-Maps in question.<BR>
  <BR>
<I>Price level:</I><BR>
Single, folded map sheets: approx. US $10.<BR>
4 map sheets in plastic folder: approx. US $30, and the complete series<BR>
of 20 maps for approx. US $130.<BR>
  <BR>
<I><B>Marine charts</B></I><BR>
A number of charts of Greenlandic waters are available. For sailing beyond rock distance, the key maps on a scale of 1:400,000 can generally be used.<BR>
       <BR>
A large part of the most densely sailed part of the coast has been mapped on detailed charts, i.e. 1:80,000 and/or 1:40,000. For certain seas and individual channels, fairways and straits, there are detailed special-purpose charts from 1:20,000 right down to 1:2,500.<BR>
       <BR>
Not all map material is up to date, however, and not all Greenlandic waters have been surveyed. The material is currently undergoing general revision.<BR>
       <BR>
These charts are produced by the National Survey and Cadastre, Denmark.<BR>

<B><I>Hiking maps</I></B>  <BR>
Greenland Tourism a/s has produced completely <A HREF="HIKEMAPS/DEFAULT.HTM" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/gt/hikemaps/default.htm">new hiking maps</A> for 13 areas. For South Greenland 3 water-repellent secondary maps have been produced in A2 size (43.5 x 61.5 cm). These are sold cased in plastic together with an updated hiking guide, and cover the area around Narsarsuaq, Narsaq, Qaqortoq and the entire Vatnaverfi Peninsula to Alluitsup Paa (in Danish, Sydproven). For Ammassalik Island two secondary maps have been produced together with an updated hiking guide in Danish, English and German.<BR>
<BR>
Please check the special <A HREF="HIKEMAPS/DEFAULT.HTM" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/gt/hikemaps/default.htm">hiking map information</A><BR>
       <BR>
The new hiking maps are on a scale of 1:100,000 and are based on entirely new photogrammetrical plotting made from aerial photos. North-South meridians have been drawn in and lines corrected for variation.<BR>
       <BR>
The distance between the contour lines (equidistance) will be 25 m. The maps are printed in 6 colors with place-names included according to the new orthographical conventions. It will be possible to gauge the size (and passability) of watercourses from the map with reasonable certainty. All lakes larger than 100 m have been included and the shape of the lakes reproduced for recognizability - a great advantage for detailed orienteering in Greenland.<BR>
       <BR>
On the maps and in the route descriptions, recommended hiking trips have been drawn in as well as a large amount of information of value to the hill-walker, including the degree of complexity of the hike, overnight accommodation, rough camping sites, boat routes, fording points, archaeological sights and supply replenishment points.<BR>
       <BR>
The route descriptions are published in Danish, German and English, while the maps also feature Greenlandic text.<BR>
       <BR>
In Greenland, the maps pack can be bought at tourist offices and at the bookstore Atuakkat in Nuuk.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="Greenlander Centers">Greenlandic activity and culture centres in Denmark</A></H3>
The five Gr&oslash;nl&aelig;nderhuse, or Greenlander Centers, were originally student hostels and meeting places for Greenlanders doing their studies and Greenlanders living in Denmark. Today, they function to a greater extent as cultural centers. Greenlander Centers offer courses and lectures on Greenlandic affairs and are able to organize courses by way of preparation for holidays.<BR>
      <BR>
In addition, Greenlander Centers can arrange contacts with other relevant institutions in Denmark and Greenland as well as replying to enquiries of a general and specific nature. In addition, the centers can send out a certain degree of brochure material on Greenland. Greenlander Centers are also the home of associations and clubs dealing with traditional Greenlandic culture, such as kayak-building, choristry, pearl embroidery and other arts and crafts.<BR>
       <BR>
A number of exhibitions on Greenland are held annually, and from these Greenlander Centers, homecraft, literature, posters, Greenlandic music and the world-famous Greenlandic Christmas<BR>
seals are sold.<BR>
