<BR><HR><B>GREENLAND FOR ANGLERS</B><A NAME="anchor199941"></A><B><A HREF="#anchor199941">
</A></B><BR>
Halibut the size of coffee tables, giant cod and mega-catfish weighing 10-20
kilos, salmon of the deepest pink and king-size char eager to bite. Does
that sound like a dream? Well, it's not in Greenland. A country where your
dreams can become reality and fishing adventures in unique natural surroundings
are waiting for you everywhere, in scenery which can change from the lushest
valleys with golden flowers and green bushes to bare stony plains hemmed
in by rugged mountains with snow on top.<BR>
Greenland offers a wealth of opportunities for the angler. The world's largest
island is like a great buffet table, but distances are great and it is essential
to prioritise and plan the fishing tour thoroughly, deciding where to start
and finish.<BR>
<BR>
Enticing fishing adventures are practically everywhere, or as good as: in
deep blue fjords and further out at sea you will find halibut - the largest
of the species are found along the coast of Greenland, say biologists, and
now and again a monster halibut goes on the war path, making the rod bend
to its limit, the line sing in the wind and the reel sound like a dentist's
drill.<BR>
<BR>
Greenland is also known for its large catfish and it is not unusual for
fish up to 15-20 kg to be landed. There are also 10-20 kg cod as well as
a sea of smaller ones at 3-8 kg - if you can track them down!<BR>
<BR>
In addition, there are the handsome rosefish - also known as Norway haddock
or ocean perch. These are fine orangey-red perch with squinting eyes and
spines on their backs. Rosefish of 1-3 kg are everyday fare in Greenlandic
waters.<BR>
<BR>
In late summer shoals of salmon of the deepest hue invade the Greenlandic
coast and fjords. Salmon from near and far gather in Greenland for the big
feeding party of the year. The salmon generally follow in the wake of the
large feed shoals of capelin, krill and sandeels and, if you are lucky,
you can track down the salmon by boat or dinghy. For periods some quite
unforgettable salmon trolling is offered, with copious catches of bright
silver beauties in the lovely fjords, where you can follow the changing
face of the Greenlandic landscape from the sea whilst sailing amongst seals,
whales and icebergs.<BR>
<BR>
If you would rather have firm ground under your feet, there are innumerable
gushing wild rivers and lakes as clear as gin which offer battles with the
liveliest Arctic char, who are always willing to put up a fight. Along the
coast, too, there is splendid Arctic char fishing in June and July, when
the char migrate to saltwater to find food. <BR>
<BR>
Greenland is fantastic and catch-tastic and at the same time a world of
its own - the like of which can be experienced virtually nowhere else on
earth.<BR>
<BR>
The seasons are also unique: March/April is winter in Greenland, with sparkling
snow-covered landscapes, dog-sledge driving, ice fishing for Greenland halibut
in the fjords and Arctic char from the ice over the lakes, clear weather,
temperatures below zero and high sun.<BR>
<BR>
In May and June the brief Greenlandic spring turns into the Arctic summer.
North of the Arctic Circle the midnight sun makes the days long. The Arctic
char put to sea, cod and halibut come into the fjords to feed themselves
up on krill, sandeels, prawns and capelin. Whales surface and the first
salmon hit Southern Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of August and September the first signs of autumn appear. The
mountain landscape changes colour and glows with beautiful oranges, red
and yellows. The weather can be very fine, the clouds are gone and the nights
are black and cold. Average temperatures are still above zero. In fact,
the weather is a bit like what you find in June with pleasant and stable
weather conditions a feature.<BR>
<BR>
If the weather is clear the Northern Lights send their hazy rays into the
dark night sky in south-west Greenland, pointing straight up to the stars.
It is an unforgettable sight which makes any laser light show pale by comparison.<BR>
<BR>
The Arctic char are now on their way up river to spawn and offer exciting
battles. The catfish are biting again after the first night frost, and draw
into shallower water after having spent a summer holiday with 100-200 metres
of water over their backs. The salmon are in fine form after feeding themselves
up in fjords and in open waters in the Davis Strait.<BR>
<BR>
In Greenland the angler can find almost all his heart desires, and it can
be a problem deciding which of the splendid fish to go for.<BR>
<BR>
If you have only a limited period of time (2-3 weeks), we recommend that
you contact the regional and local tourist offices in good time so that
you can put together exactly the right fishing expedition. Several travel
agencies also organise special tours, and it can often be an advantage to
take part in a &quot;package&quot; tour where everything is arranged by
the tour operator. Not only do you save on planning time, but you also know
what to expect of the trip.<BR>
<BR>
You can also choose to arrange a very 0special fishing expedition by yourself
or with a group of like-minded people, and dip your rod into some of the
virginal waters far off the beaten track. It doesn't have to cost a great
deal more, provided there are a few of you to share the costs. You might
have your own special dream of experiencing virginal waters in Greenland:
going out to a river or lake where the char have never seen a spinner before
- or one which is perhaps visited by only a few people each year. Or a fishing
club or a few good friends may embark upon a sea-fishing adventure on a
cutter amongst icebergs, seals and whales to fish for halibut or large catfish.
Here it is clearly an advantage to make special arrangements with like-minded
people from home - possibly in co-operation with the travel agencies specialising
in Greenland. Give free rein to your ideas - and let the dream become reality.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe your catches won't break any records in Greenland, but you will almost
certainly catch a lot of fish - and experience a unique and unforgettable
landscape into the bargain.<BR>
<HR><B>GETTING TO GREENLAND AND TRAVELLING AROUND<BR>
<BR>
Getting to Greenland </B><A NAME="anchor208005"></A><BR>
In recent years it has become easier and considerably cheaper to fly to
Greenland than before. The flight takes 4-5 hours. Greenland has several
international airports served by scheduled airlines. Narsarsuaq in Southern
Greenland has services from Copenhagen in Denmark and Keflavik in Iceland.
Eastern Greenland has links between Kulusuk and Keflavik in Iceland, and
Kangerlussuaq has services to Canada and Copenhagen.<BR>
<BR>
In 1995 the price of a return APEX ticket between Denmark and Kangerlussuaq
was DKK 4,600. An APEX ticket between Copenhagen and Nuuk cost DKK 7,600
whilst Copenhagen-Ilulissat cost approx. DKK 7,200 and Copenhagen-Sisimiut
around DKK 7,600.<BR>
<BR>
From Iceland to Narsarsuaq in Southern Greenland the price of a standard
return ticket was DKK 5,400 whilst the price of an APEX ticket was DKK 3,200.
<BR>
<BR>
From Iceland to Kulusuk a standard return ticket cost DKK 4,500 in 1995
and an APEX ticket DKK 3,500.<BR>
<BR>
Further details of airline tickets, departures and prices are available
from all travel agencies which are IATA agents. In addition, the airlines
SAS, Iceland Air and First Air have offices internationally.<BR>
<HR><B>Getting about in Greenland</B><A NAME="anchor209737"></A><BR>
Greenlandair provides internal flights in Greenland and covers Narsarsuaq,
Nuuk, Ilulissat, Kulusuk and Kangerlussuaq in small aircraft. The other
routes are flown either in large Sikorsky 61 helicopters or smaller helicopters
such as Bell 212s. Qaanaaq (Thule) is served via Kangerlussuaq. Special
fishing expeditions to remote waters are often made in a small aircraft
or helicopter. In the main towns it is possible to charter a helicopter
from Greenlandair.<BR>
<BR>

Tel. +299 28888. Fax +299 28836<BR>
<BR>
If you want to go out to a particularly remote river or mountain lake it
may be necessary to be flown there. This is a relatively expensive business,
approx. DKK 3,000-4,000 for a half-hour flight, but the price is affordable
if there are a number of you to share the cost. For example, for six people
it would cost approx. DKK 600 per person for a 30-minute flight. Otherwise
the 1995 charter prices per hour from Greenlandair were as follows: DKK
25,500 for an SK61 helicopter, a Bell 212 cost DKK 18,900 per hour, a Bell
206 could be hired for approx. DKK 6,000 an hour, a Bell 206 LR cost DKK
8,300 an hour and an AS 350 DKK 9,000 per hour (1995 prices). Fixed-wing
aircraft can also be hired by the hour: for example, a Dash 7 costs DKK
21,960 an hour whilst a Twin Otter costs DKK 11,000 an hour. Aircraft and
helicopter transport can be arranged in the major towns and airports.<BR>
<BR>
If you do not want to fly in Greenland there is also a regular boat which
sails along the coast of south-west Greenland. This service is operated
by the company KNI, which has three vessels sailing along the coast. You
can sleep and eat on board these passenger ships for a reasonable price,
and the trip is an experience within an experience. In addition, there are
a number of smaller ships linking towns and villages locally.<BR>
<BR>
It is considerably cheaper to sail than to fly; for example, a ticket from
Sisimiut to Nuuk by ship starts at DKK 800 for a cabin place - the same
trip costs DKK 2,250 by air, but the limited number of tickets available
on the coastal routes mean it is recommended that you book the trip in very
good time. And remember, too, that Greenland's own population are keen travellers
in the summer period. You are therefore advised to reserve tickets on ships
or aircraft in good time.<BR>
<BR>
Ticket bookings and seat reservations can be made, and information on departure
times obtained, at local KNI passenger offices, but also via the international
distribution and booking system Amadeus to which over 100,000 travel agencies,
tour operators and airlines are connected. An alternative is to contact
KNI's head office in Greenland:<BR>

<BR>
During the voyage you will experience many aspects of this splendid wilderness
as it constantly changes shape and colour. Fjords sparkle; curious seals
stick their heads above water to greet you and &quot;wave&quot; goodbye
with their tails. Icebergs sail past in every colour from jade green to
ice blue. Whales surface and send their spray metres into the air.<BR>
<BR>
All transport is subject to weather conditions, and weather changes in Greenland
can rapidly cause delays or changes to travel schedules, so make sure you
have at least one day spare when planning your schedule in case the weather
should show its worse side. These are the terms in the Arctic. Air traffic
is particularly vulnerable to fog and bad weather. At times, boat traffic
also has to stop, such as when a storm comes in from the sea or when icebergs
prevent all sailing because of currents and wind.<BR>
<BR>
There are no real roads in Greenland. Cars can be driven only in towns,
airports and larger settlements, but otherwise the major forms of transport
are by aircraft or boat. In the six months of winter you can also travel
overland by snow scooter - and, north of the Arctic Circle, by dog-sledge
too.<BR>
<BR>
Often it is impossible to get to fishing areas without a boat because of
the large distances involved. A passenger-approved boat with room for 8-18
people costs DKK 4,000-6,000 a day. That's why it is clearly an advantage
to be part of a group if you want to go on day trips to remote waters. In
Kangerlussuaq and Narsarsuaq, however, lakes and rivers are available close
to the airport, and you can hike to your mountain char adventure in a reasonably
short time.<BR>
<HR><B>Accommodation</B><A NAME="anchor227664"></A><BR>
Accommodation is available on a private basis: in apartments, tents or cabins,
in youth hostels, seamen's homes or hotels - all depending on your preference
and finances.<BR>
<BR>
Greenland has hotels in all categories. Most of the hotels were built in
the past 10 years and have facilities such as en-suite bathrooms and TV
and telephone in the rooms. A single en-suite room costs around DKK 750
a night, whilst a double room costs around DKK 950.<BR>
<BR>
The seamen's homes were originally built to provide overnight accommodation
for sailors whilst their ship was in port. Today they can be used by anyone
wanting simpler accommodation. A single room without en-suite facilities
costs from DKK 350, whilst a double room costs from DKK 500.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Youth hostel&quot; is a term used to cover a very varied range of
facilities and in Greenland they are similar to the youth hostels we know
in Europe. Many larger towns have a youth hostel with facilities such as
a kitchen, dormitories, bathrooms, flush toilets, kiosk, etc. One night's
accommodation costs around DKK 150-250. <BR>
<BR>
Most anglers choose to stay in a village or town and use this as a starting
point for day trips. This is particularly the case for sea anglers and salmon
trolling enthusiasts, whilst anglers going after Arctic char often go on
trips of longer duration in the country, living in a tent.<BR>
<BR>
If you are staying in a village or town and want to go out to remote fishing
waters, transport to the fishing waters will in some cases be by helicopter
or aircraft, which can be chartered in the major towns: Kulusuk, Narsarsuaq,
Nuuk, Kangerlussuaq and Ilulissat. It is also possible to be taken out to
a particular river or lake by boat, live in a tent or cabin for a period
and be collected later. You can also hike out to the char river yourself
- of course, this is the cheapest way to see Greenland, but it is by no
means the worst way. On a combined fishing and hiking trip you really get
the feel of the unique natural environment at close quarters, and if you
are lucky and observant you may see reindeer, musk oxen, arctic foxes, grouse,
white-tailed eagles or some of the very common species of migratory birds
which visit the country in the summer months.<BR>
<HR><B>The best places to fish in Greenland</B><A NAME="anchor211902"></A><BR>
This question is always the first one asked by anglers when planning a fishing
trip to Greenland. It can be answered very easily: there is good fishing
everywhere - or virtually everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
All over the country the natural landscape provides opportunity for great
experiences with your rod, whether in rivers, lakes or at sea. Having said
that, don't forget that Greenland is an enormous island and certain fishing
waters are easier to get to than others. You should also know that even
the most easily accessible fishing waters are visited by very few people
- often you will have the water to yourself.<BR>
<BR>
If you take part in a package tour you don't have to think about internal
transport in Greenland by air or boat or about accommodation and meals -
everything is arranged from home.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, if you organise the trip independently, it is essential
to plan and consider transport facilities thoroughly before your departure.
If you decide to fish in an area close to the Atlantic airport where you
land, then your transport within Greenland will be relatively cheaper than
if you want to visit a remote fishing area. As a starting point, you should
bear in mind that each flight will cost between approx. DKK 280 and DKK
3,000.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to go fishing at sea you will need boat transport. There are
normally several suitable, approved boats in the larger towns. In smaller
towns and villages it can be difficult to find a boat or dinghy which is
approved by the Maritime Authority. Often there are only private boats,
fishing vessels or dinghies owned by local fishermen and hunters. The same
applies if you want to be transported to the fishing area by boat rather
than hiking to a lake or river.<BR>
<BR>
In Southern Greenland flights from Denmark land at Narsarsuaq Airport. On
the edge of the town is a small harbour served by regular boats which sail
off Southern Greenland. These boats are a cheap way to travel compared with
travel by aircraft or helicopter. The towns in the area are close to each
other, as is usual in Greenland, and much of the angling in the area has
been charted by locals. In addition, there are good opportunities to combine
mountain hiking with fishing in the area. There is a range of accommodation
in Narsarsuaq (population 137), Qaqortoq (population 3,178), Narsaq (population
1,753) and the surrounding villages. Several sheep farmers in Southern Greenland
offer private accommodation close to rivers and lakes with plenty of fish.<BR>
<BR>
A helicopter can be chartered in Narsarsuaq if you want transport out to
remote waters. Within a short distance of Narsarsuaq there is sea fishing
for halibut, cod and catfish. There is also excellent Arctic char fishing
and fascinating trolling for salmon in the area. Boats can be hired for
sea-fishing and salmon trolling in Narsaq and Qaqortoq. You can also book
<BR>
transport by boat to the great char waters in the area from here.<BR>
<BR>
In Central Greenland there are 3 towns: Sisimiut (population 4,839), Maniitsoq
(population 3,067) and Nuuk (population 12,483), and close to the Inland
Ice is the airport town of Kangerlussuaq (population 281). <BR>
<BR>
Aircraft from Denmark land in Kangerlussuaq several times a week and there
are a number of rivers and lakes offering fishing for Arctic char close
to the town. It is also possible to go sea-fishing from the little harbour
on the edge of the town - at the bottom of the 180 kilometre long S&oslash;ndre
Str&oslash;mfjord.<BR>
<BR>
You can charter a helicopter at Kangerlussuaq Airport if you want to visit
the more difficult to access waters in the area.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to visit other towns or fishing waters it will be necessary
to use a scheduled flight or helicopter. As an example, a one-way ticket
by helicopter to Sisimiut cost DKK 1,040 in 1995. Sisimiut is particularly
well-known for its formidable sea-fishing for halibut and large catfish,
huge cod and large rosefish. In addition, experiments are in progress involving
trolling for salmon in the area, and several rivers and lakes rich in fish
sparkle with Arctic char in peak condition.<BR>
<BR>
Nuuk, which lies at the mouth of the Godth&aring;b Fjord, offers interesting
and varied fishing in a powerful fjord complex. You will find several boats
which can be chartered for angling in the town. You can also charter a helicopter
or seaplane in Nuuk if you want to visit the large untouched area known
as &quot;the North Country&quot;. This is a real char paradise with many
practically virginal char lakes.<BR>
<BR>
In Disko Bay the towns are relatively close to each other. You can reach
Disko Bay by taking a domestic flight via Kangerlussuaq to Illulissat (population
4,057) or by scheduled boat. In the six summer months the towns around Disko
Bay are served by ships which cover the area regionally at frequent intervals.
These provide plenty of opportunities to visit several fishing waters and
areas. In addition, helicopters can be chartered from Ilulissat. The area
offers both exciting sea-fishing for cod and halibut, char fishing in lakes
and rivers and incredibly fascinating ice fishing for Greenland halibut
with local fishermen and hunters. Disko Bay also contains huge icebergs
from the active glaciers in the area, which make sea-fishing here a unique
experience.<BR>
<BR>
Eastern Greenland contains the town of Ammassalik (population 1,561) with
an airport at Kulusuk (population 327) and a number of surrounding villages.
The easiest way to get to Eastern Greenland is by air from Iceland. The
area offers exciting sea-fishing for cod, Greenland halibut, catfish, Greenland
shark and halibut.<BR>
<BR>
From Kulusuk and Ammassalik chartered helicopter trips are offered to Arctic
char waters far from the towns.<BR>
<BR>
In the Thule region, which is the most northerly populated area in Greenland,
you can ice-fish for Greenland halibut and Arctic cod close to the town
of Avanersuaq. Transport to the area is via Kangerlussuaq to the American
base at Pittufik.<BR>

<HR><B>FISHING FOR ARCTIC CHAR</B><A NAME="anchor212507"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="PHOTO/SALMON.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/gt/photo/salmon.jpg" ALT="Peter Steensen with a salmon" WIDTH=187 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=1>
</CENTER>
<P>Zzzzz - the brake on the reel gives line and the rod marks out the beat
in sharp staccato. A wild Arctic char has attacked the Mepps spinner in
the crystal clear river and is haring off downstream.<BR>
<BR>
In the next pool the water is calmer, but the Arctic char like that just
as much and put up a good fight for their freedom, catapulting out of the
water several times. However, in the end the fish has to give in and slides
into the landing net in all its splendour. A fine fish of a couple of kilos
- and a trophy in the life of any angler who dreams of catching this beautiful
torpedo-shaped char, a keen fighter with gunpowder in him.<BR>
<BR>
Not without reason is the Arctic char a fish valued by anglers. It is both
strong, game, reckless and fights like a Norwegian salmon. A fish of 2-3
kilos has the strength of a fish twice its size and in numerous places the
lakes and rivers glisten with the prospect of fishing adventures in a unique
and virtually unspoiled wilderness.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the Arctic char which are outwitted weigh from 0.3 to 2 kilos. The
average size of Arctic char in Greenland used to be larger, but because
of illegal net fishing in the mouths of rivers the average size of these
beautiful fish has been in decline. Having said that, the fishing is still
top class in many spots, and there are only a few places in Scandinavia
where can you find a similar attraction with as many fine Arctic char as
there are in Greenland.<BR>
<HR><B>Arctic char</B><A NAME="anchor212773"></A><BR>
The Arctic char is also known by the name &quot;mountain trout&quot; and
both permanently resident and sea-migrating types of the species are found,
not only in Greenland but throughout the circumpolar region, such as in
Iceland, Canada and Northern <BR>
Norway. The Arctic char is known in Greenlandic as Eqaluk.<BR>
<BR>
The permanently resident fish are found in certain lakes. These are Arctic
char which do not migrate to the sea - generally because the water in question
no longer has access to the sea. These permanent fish are similar to the
sea-migrating Arctic char, but for most of the time they live in rivers
or lakes without migrating to the sea to eat in the summer. That's why permanent
fish do not gain so much weight as sea-migrating fish, which consume a lot
of food during their migration to the sea.<BR>
<BR>
It takes 3-5 years after birth in freshwater for the small sea-migrating
Arctic char to become large enough to migrate from the cold freshwater of
rivers and lakes which contain little nutrition to the well-stocked dining
room of the sea.<BR>
<BR>
The Arctic char gains a lot of weight in the 6-10 weeks of summertime, which
the fish spends in the sea, gorging itself on capelin, krill, prawns and
other good things from the sea.<BR>
<BR>
In principle, the Arctic char is the only member of the Salmonidae family
found in Greenlandic rivers and lakes. That is not quite true any more,
because one river, &quot;The Kapisilit River&quot; at the back of the Godth&aring;b
fjord, has a small stock of salmon. However, Greenlanders have decided to
call the Arctic char &quot;Greenland salmon&quot;. This can cause confusion
and is misleading because of the confusion with the &quot;proper&quot; salmon
in the Kapisilit river - the genuine Atlantic salmon which is drawn to Greenlandic
waters in large shoals in the late summer. Greenlanders call these salmon
&quot;scaly salmon&quot; because of their loose, large scales.<BR>
<BR>
When the Arctic char migrates upstream after a period in saltwater it may
weigh anything from a few hundred grams to 3-4 kilos. During its initial
period in the river the fish is characterised by its bright silver scales
and almost blue-green back with small light spots along the sides at the
bottom. After a period in freshwater the fish changes colour, the back becomes
more greeny and light yellow spots appear. Cock-fish which are to spawn
gradually become bent, and the belly of the Arctic char takes on the most
beautiful orangey-red hue. The white edges of the red pectoral and dorsal
fins bear witness to the fact that the fish is ready to spawn.<BR>
<BR>
Once breeding has been completed in October/November, the winter is spent
in the river or the lake from which the fish originates. Through most of
the winter the fish takes in almost no food in this poorly nutritious, cold
freshwater.<BR>
<BR>
The average size of the Arctic char varies significantly from river to river
and from sea to sea - depending on the feeding conditions and how untouched
the water is. In certain waters in remote locations which are, therefore,
not exposed to illegal net fishing, Arctic char may be up to 70-80 cm in
length, but by far the majority are rarely over 60 cm. Anglers can generally
expect fish weighing up to 1-3 kilos. However, even fish of this size are
an impressive piece of biology which any angler should respect. A fish weighing
1-1.5 kilos can easily be 20 years old! Take this growth and compare it,
for example, with a Scandinavian salmon or sea trout which reaches this
weight in just 1-2 years.<BR>
<HR><B>Arctic char in rivers</B><A NAME="anchor213035"></A> <BR>
The 4-6 weeks from July onwards are considered to be the real peak season
for Arctic char, with most of these fiery sprinters cropping up in the mouths
of rivers and upstream towards the spawning grounds. Then it is just a matter
of having a spinner or spoon-bait in the water for, unlike the Atlantic
salmon which does not take in food in freshwater, the Arctic char likes
to eat - and how!<BR>
<BR>
In Southern Greenland the river fishing starts in mid-July and the further
north you go along the coast, the later the fish migrate up the rivers.
It is generally the large fish which migrate first, whilst smaller Arctic
char weighing 400-800 grams follow suit. <BR>
<BR>
Greenland's rivers can be divided into cloudy or unclear melt-water rivers,
and clear rivers which, generally, originate from lakes, where the cloud
in the water has fallen to the bottom.<BR>
<BR>
Most Greenlandic rivers are short and fast-flowing with thrashing waterfalls,
and therefore the fish will, almost without exception, prefer the calm areas
of the river away from the main current.<BR>
<BR>
Remember, too, that the greater the fall a river has in the lower stages,
the fewer fish it tends to attract! In the worst case, rivers with too abrupt
a fall may be entirely empty of fish or may only contain a very small stock
of Arctic char in the mouth area.<BR>
If the Arctic char do not migrate they will often stay behind rocks or in
deep &quot;holes&quot;, or at the edges or in the &quot;backwaters&quot;
of the pools, which are always found near one bank where the river bends.
The backwater is the place where the current in the river runs almost in
the opposite direction to the main current. Backwaters are typically found
at bends in the river. The phenomenon can be deduced by observing that the
river seems to be running round and round in circles rather than running
downstream.<BR>
<BR>
Since the Arctic char is a social fish, it likes to migrate up river with
others of the same size, and the fish also migrate to the spawning place
together with other Arctic char. 3-7 fish may come one after the other,
and one can almost watch fish by fish as they migrate from one resting place
to the next. When the fish reach the spawning ground there is a fight for
places - there is no question of sharing here.<BR>
<BR>
In daylight hours the Arctic char often prefers places in the river where
it can be sheltered, particularly in clear weather with high sunshine. This
may be behind rocks or small water excrescences which waft midstream, along
the banks or behind large rocks where the fish can be sheltered and feel
secure. When the sun is lower in the sky the fish often venture to other
places in the current in their migration upstream.<BR>
<HR><B>Spinning in rivers</B><A NAME="anchor213260"></A> <BR>
To get the most out of your fishing a 6-8 foot (180-240 cm) one-handed rod
of graphite or carbon with a relatively fast and swift action designed to
cope with casting weights from 6-15 grams is a good starting point. These
are light and fast rods which cast well and give fingertip feeling of the
artificial bait at the end of the line. There is absolutely no reason to
use long unwieldy rods, much too large reels and excessively strong equipment
overall. It takes much of the excitement out of the fishing. The best rods
for the purpose should be so hook-sensitive that you feel even the slightest
nip and irregular pulling from the spoon-bait.<BR>
<BR>
If the river is more than 15 metres wide, however, it may sometimes be advantageous
to have a slightly longer spinner rod, e.g. an 8 foot rod (240 cm), since
this makes it easier to hold the line free from the current.<BR>
<BR>
Choose a small and light fixed-spool reel which suits the size of the rod
and ensure it is filled to the spool edge with 0.25 mm line. Thinner lines
may be an advantage in some places, particularly in completely clear rivers
where the visibility is so good that you almost have to bend down to find
the surface. If there are a lot of boulders and rocks, for example, at least
0.25 mm line must be spooled onto the reel, otherwise you will place a sea
of spinners and spoon-baits on the bottom. Let the nature of the river decide
the line thickness spooled onto the reel and take both 0.20 and 0.25 mm
line with you.<BR>
<BR>
For spinning you should take along 200-300 metres of extra line in addition
to what you need to fill the reel. After just a few days' fishing the line
will have suffered so much damage from wear on stones and rocks under the
surface that it can easily break. <BR>
<BR>
Spinning for Arctic char is generally carried out with small spinners, e.g.
Vibrax, Mepps no. 2-3 in silver and copper, possibly with red dots; Mepps
Black Fury is also one of the most successful. Rooster Tail spinners and
Panter and Mrrum spinners in weights from 4-15 grams are also splendid to
have with you in your tackle box.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the many spoon-baits considered favourites by the locals for river
and lake fishing in Greenland are: Jensen Tobis, Flipper, M&oslash;resilda,
Filur, Toby, Jensen Pirk, Trumf and similar types in weights from 3-12 grams.<BR>
<BR>
The sea-migrating Arctic char is generally not fussy about spinners, spoon-baits
and flies when in the river, but can be very selective in his choice of
artificial bait and does not like to waste unnecessary energy pursuing the
&quot;food&quot; several metres down in the flowing water. For the first
2-4 days the Arctic char is often not very aggressive in his behaviour,
but any fish which gets a spinner or spoon-bait served in front of his nose
may well be enticed to the hook.<BR>
<BR>
In some waters a spinner with silvery and red dots may be the only thing.
In others, the spinner should preferably have a green body. There are also
places where a combination of colours such as red, yellow and black is the
most successful. Amongst other things, it depends on the colour, visibility
and food conditions in the water. For this reason there is nothing to be
done but try out different hardware from the tackle box and find out the
local favourites yourself.<BR>
<BR>
Having said that, the most important thing is to be able to fish slowly
and precisely with a spinner or spoon-bait so that the artificial bait works
where the Arctic char are found: at the edge of currents and backwaters
- and slightly off the bottom.<BR>
<BR>
It is advantageous to take small breaks during the spinning in, known as
spin/stop pauses, so that the spoon-bait or spinner is able to stop in the
water and then sink towards the bottom. That is a delicacy which even a
fussy Arctic char can rarely resist - and, snap! Once you have got a fish,
the spinning-in speed has been incorporated and you have found the right
spinner and a good place, there are not many refinements beyond that in
fishing!<BR>
<BR>
Once the first fish has been landed you will generally have a good impression
of where the Arctic char prefer to stay in the river. If it is a large pool
or calm water along the edge of a current, you can collect several fish
within a small area. Such places should naturally always be reconnoitred
extra thoroughly.<BR>
<BR>
In certain periods the Arctic char in the river will be easily scared, particularly
when the water level is low and the fish have remained in the same place
for some time. The fishing can then come to an abrupt end when you have
landed the first fish, even if you can see that there are more fish there.
Instead you should make a mental note of the place and possibly come back
later the same day or the next day. The fish will then be guaranteed to
bite again.<BR>
<HR><B>Spinning in lakes</B><A NAME="anchor213612"></A> <BR>
Certain rivers are linked to lakes to which the Arctic char migrate to spawn.
Other lakes, which do not have access to the sea, have a stock of permanent
fish, as mentioned previously, which are also exciting to outwit. These
char may not be quite so big, but then it is not always size that matters
but the pleasure of the catch. And the fishing can be at least as challenging
and enthralling; for example, in the lakes it is perfectly normal to see
Arctic char coming swishing up in the wake of the spinner or spoon-bait
at close quarters. Your heart will be racing, and if the fish is not hooked
that time, perhaps it will be duped with the next cast if you change spinner
or spoon-bait or perhaps try a different colour or weight.<BR>
<BR>
In clear lakes the Arctic char are often found in areas of still water,
in bays and inlets, and quite often at the edge where the still water meets
a gentle current, or where the wind is rippling the surface.<BR>
<BR>
If the lake has a marked change in depth, that is a definite place to find
Arctic char. In such places it is not unusual to find the water black with
fish at the border between the shallow and deep water. Then you need to
have the brake adjusted correctly and hold your tongue! The same is true
of tips of spits and points of deep water near land.<BR>
If the rivers which run into the lake are small, try these areas. Many fish
like to stay here, in the water which is rich in oxygen, and often it is
precisely in such a place that Arctic char are served up.<BR>
<BR>
If you are fishing in small, clear lakes and want to cover a slope or slightly
deeper water, the spinner or spoon-bait should preferably go down far enough
for the artificial bait to just skim the bottom. The rod may need to be
held vertical so that it points up into the air whilst spinning in, meanwhile
jerking the point of the rod slightly.<BR>
<BR>
Small, lively spoon-baits of 6-12 grams are ideal for lake fishing, since
they can be spun deep and it is easy to induce marked movements. The same
applies to spinners used for river fishing, but they probably need to be
in larger sizes for lake fishing (see page 5). And don't forget lead-head
spinners such as the Mrrum spinner and the French Mepps lead-head spinners
in weights of up to 12 grams which, in some places, reign supreme because
their design means that the blade of the spinner rotates all the time, even
when making spin/stop pauses during spinning in.<BR>
<HR><B>Fly fishing for Arctic char in seas and rivers</B><A NAME="anchor58290"></A>
<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="PHOTO/FLY.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/gt/photo/fly.jpg" WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=1>
</CENTER>
<P>Fly fishing in Greenland is practised either in cloudy melt-water rivers
or clear rivers and lakes. In unclear rivers you really have to work for
each individual fish. Even with a sink line and large, bushy, preferably
colourful flies the fly fisherman will catch only 1 fish for every 10 landed
by the spinning angler. Fly fishing in such waters is therefore not particularly
to be recommended for those who just want to catch fish continuously - but
it can be done if you are patient and persistent enough.<BR>
<BR>
The best choice for the purpose is AFTM 7-8 class equipment with 50-75 metres
back line and fly line, sink tip line or a slow-sinking line and flies and
streamers of sizes 1-4 in shocking colours, and fly patterns such as March
Brown, March Brown Silver and Krogsgaard size 4-6 are classics for Greenland's
Arctic char. Streamers and wet-flares in fluorescent colours can come up
trumps - ambulance red (orange-red) in particular has proved to be very
successful. The same applies to streamers and wet-flares with a red tail
or red body and dark flies with a little silver and gold.<BR>
<BR>
Most fly fishing for Arctic char in rivers is downstream fishing, and it
is necessary to cover where the fish are staying relatively accurately with
the &quot;feathers&quot; at the end of the snell. The fly must also be fished
very slowly and as deep as possible. The fly fisherman has often been dealt
poor cards in the cloudy melt-water rivers, which are almost cream in colour
and fast-flowing.<BR>
<BR>
In order to have success with the fly rod in rivers, it is a matter of seeking
out the traditional stamping grounds of the Arctic char; i.e. pools, areas
of shelter from the current and areas close to rocks, and the places where
backwaters and current lees are formed.<BR>
<BR>
In rivers with clear or shallow water and in lakes a class 6-7 or 7-8 with
fly line and 50-75 metres back line is an excellent starting point. In slightly
deeper rivers it may be advantageous to change the fly line for a slow-sinking
line or possibly a sink tip line. In some lakes long-casting lines such
as WF line are preferable, particularly in the waters where a long cast
is required in order to reach deeper water.<BR>
<BR>
In some of the clear seas it is not unusual to see &quot;ringing&quot; Arctic
char eating insects at the surface. In the high summer you can experience
classic dry fly fishing here when the big mosquito hatching takes place.
However, note that it is a tall order to catch many fish with dry flies
- and to entice the Arctic char to rise at all for the &quot;little bugs&quot;,
but then that is why it is an enthralling form of fishing for &quot;connoisseurs&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Particularly small flies of sizes 8-14 are suitable for these occasions,
but otherwise flies in shocking and provocative colours often help to encourage
the biting instinct of the Arctic char.<BR>
<BR>
In the lakes the Arctic char can be easily frightened and shy away from
the clinking of small stones in the water, and uninhibited trampling on
the edge is transmitted surprisingly well in the water. Should the Arctic
char be close to the bank, it will not be many minutes before it has been
frightened off to the other end of the lake.<BR>
<HR><B>Mountain hiking and fishing</B><A NAME="anchor214547"></A> <BR>
Mountain hiking and Arctic char fishing is an excellent combination. And
in only a few places in the world can you experience the Arctic environment
as close at hand as in Greenland, where virtually virgin waters with large,
old fish are spread out across the landscape.<BR>
<BR>
Rivers rumble and streams effervesce in remote valleys where rugged mountain
tops frame the splendours. The silence is almost alarming and the air tastes
strangely dry, but also pure and clean.<BR>
<BR>
However, before a fishing trip can be a success it must be planned thoroughly
to ensure, amongst other things, that there are fish in the waters which
you plan to visit. And when planning your mountain fishing trip DO REMEMBER
the migration of the Arctic char! In certain rivers they do not migrate
upstream after going to feed in the sea until late, and there is nothing
worse than getting to the water which you expect to be full of fish - and
finding not a single one!<BR>
<BR>
So always contact regional or local tourist offices and get information
on fishing waters and good areas for mountain hiking in good time before
planning the trip. The local tourist offices can help you with information
and give good tips on where, when and how best to put the trip together.<BR>
<BR>
In recent years Greenland Tourism a/s has drawn up a number of hiking maps
which may be of great assistance in your planning. With these maps in your
hand it will be much easier to organise your hiking trip and prepare a precise
schedule.<BR>
<BR>
There are hiking maps covering Narsarsuaq, Narsaq, Qaqortoq, Alluitsup Paa
and Ivittuut. In 1996 maps of Ammassalik, Sisimiut, Ilulissat and Nanortalik
were published. In addition, there are a number of older maps and a number
of new ones in preparation that can be ordered from local tourist offices,
which also provide information on any Arctic char waters, routes and other
circumstances which it is useful to know about when planning a trip. However,
compared with other mountainous areas in Scandinavia, Greenland's are some
of the most uncharted - and this must be taken into account in your plans.
For example, make sure you do not underestimate the enormous distances which
exist in Greenland and which often &quot;shrink&quot; on a map, particularly
if the scale is 1: 250 000. If the map is used correctly you can track down
from home the more remote lakes and rivers which are practically untouched
and seldom visited by the locals. It may be that you have to take a long
trip by boat, air or on foot - but what does it matter if you have a fishing
adventure to beat them all?<BR>
<BR>
Often you can find paths by looking for place names on the map. Many names
have a meaning, for example Equalit means Arctic char and Kapisilit salmon,
whilst Quinqua means a river at the back of a fjord. In this way the place
names can tell you a lot about the locality.<BR>
<HR><B>Spinning for Arctic char on the coast</B><A NAME="anchor214831"></A>
<BR>
In the first part of the season from mid-July until the fish migrate back
to the rivers you can experience exciting fishing for Arctic char at river
mouths, along the coast and at the bottom of the fjords - especially in
the period around rising water.<BR>
<BR>
The fishing concerned is, first and foremost, spinning with spoon-bait.
This fishing is similar in principle to Scandinavian coastal fishing for
sea trout, but fly fishermen can also join in if their technique is correct.<BR>
<BR>
Experience has shown that the Arctic char seldom migrate particularly far
from their birth river - most are found in the neighbouring area. Often
the migration of the Arctic char almost consistently follows the coast and,
therefore, it can often pay to arrange the fishing at points and spits where
the fish come close to land because of favourable current and feeding conditions.
Investigate points, spits and reefs at river mouths particularly efficiently
by wave-form casting in the freshwater leaving the river. It is in the last
half of the period of rising water in particular that the fishing takes
place, and often in the very shallow water. Often it can pay to wait for
the fish to come past and reveal themselves at the surface - then it is
just a matter of getting going with your tackle.<BR>
<BR>
Areas with seaweed, mussel and stone reefs which break the surface, and
marked stone formations at the mouths of rivers, should be investigated
particularly thoroughly. The Arctic char tend to gather in shoals - often
the first couple of castings can be fruitless, but then things suddenly
start to happen. Fish after fish is enticed out.<BR>
<BR>
When spinning you have to experiment with different kinds of artificial
bait and different colour combinations and, as far a possible, use different
spinning-in speeds so that the spoon looks ill in the water and entices
the fish. Suddenly a fish bites; you have found the right formula, the right
spoon or a good place.<BR>
<BR>
Early in the season the Arctic char are generally starved and prefer slightly
larger mouthfuls which imitate, say, capelin and sandeel. In July/August,
when the Arctic char have gradually got into better condition, they become
more fussy and sometimes only go after small delicacies such as prawns or
small crustaceans.<BR>
All-round equipment used for river fishing is excellently suited to coastal
fishing for Arctic char but, at times, a rod of 8-9 feet (240-270 cm) is
necessary in order to get a sufficiently long cast and in order to be able
to control the artificial bait properly because of waves or wind on land
and along the coast.<BR>
<BR>
Artificial bait with a lively movement that can go high in the water even
with slow spinning-in is required.<BR>
<BR>
Amongst the best spoon-baits are: Jensen Tobis, Flipper, M&oslash;resilda,
Filur, Toby, Jensen Pink, Trumf and similar lean and &quot;scuttling&quot;
types in weight categories from 3-12 grams.<BR>
<BR>
Spinners must also be used busily; for example, Vibrax size 1-3, Mepps Aglia
and Black Fury 1-3, Panter 7 grams, Jensen Insect 7 grams, the Mrrum spinner
and Droppen 3-12 grams, as well as the others used for river and lake fishing.<BR>
<BR>
It is not necessary to bring along waders in your luggage. They are heavy,
impractical and take up a lot of room.<BR>
<HR><B>Coastal fly fishing for Arctic char</B><A NAME="anchor215147"></A>
<BR>
Coastal fly fishing is developing at breakneck speed - including in Greenland,
although it must be said that it is a sport reserved for specialists and
connoisseurs. However, if you are reasonably well-trained in fly tackle,
are able to achieve reasonable casting lengths and know the ground rules
of fly fishing, it is an uncommonly fascinating sport in beautiful and alluring
coastal scenery when the Arctic char are in the sea feeding themselves up.<BR>
<BR>
The best fishing is not generally experienced until July at the river mouths,
when the water is rising. At this time the Arctic char are messing about
in the freshwater part of the river and are often fit for a fight. <BR>
<BR>
Good standard equipment for coastal fly fishing consists of a rod 2.40-3.60
metres (8-12 feet) in length of AFTM class 6-7, 8-9. In principle, any fly
reel can be used provided it is resistant to saltwater, has a proper brake
and can hold at least 80 metres of back line (Dacron) as well as the fly
line.<BR>
<BR>
Use of floating line, WF or shooting head and a 2.5-3 metre snell is most
widespread.<BR>
<BR>
Good flies which can be recommended include: Mickey Finn, Stickleback, Black
Palmer, Tobis, Blue Dun, Blue Dun Grizzly, Zulu Palmer, prawn and crayfish
imitations and streamers which resemble capelin or sticklebacks, but also
bushy flies which behave wildly in the water are now turning up trumps.<BR>
<BR>
Investigate points, spits and reefs in the vicinity of river mouths particularly
efficiently. Areas with mussel, stone reefs which break the surface of the
water and marked stone formations must be investigated particularly thoroughly.
The fishing is best in rising water, and the last part of the tidal water
rise in particular offers the best fishing because the Arctic char are then
within casting distance and are pottering about looking for food in the
very shallow water.<BR>
<BR>
Early on in the season - in June and July - the fly is taken in in long,
relatively rapid movements with small breaks, so the &quot;feather&quot;
occasionally gets to skim the bottom. Later in the season it can often be
advantageous to change from streamers which, after all, are supposed to
resemble fish fry, to small hackle flies which resemble prawns, small crustaceans,
sticklebacks, large beach fleas or winkles. Colour-trailing flies in shocking
colours such as red-orange, ambulance red and yellow are particularly productive
- they often make the Arctic char see red!<BR>
<BR>
It is difficult to be specific about the best time to fish, but evening
and morning fishing produce particularly good catches. At these times the
Arctic char are very close to land and you can actually hear splashes and
see &quot;rings&quot; from fish moving around in the very shallow water.
However, the very best time is in the last half of the period around rising
water. In this part of the tidal water period the Arctic char are often
in high spirits. This is when fly fishermen have the best opportunities
to experience a taut line with a wild fish hunting out prawns, beach fleas
or some other little delicacy - and the fly at the end of the snell.<BR>
<HR><B>Fishing for Arctic char from a dinghy</B><A NAME="anchor215481"></A>
<BR>
When fishing from a dinghy moving over reefs you have a splendid opportunity
to investigate the coast from the sea. It is an effective form of fishing
when the Arctic char are in the sea in order to feed, since you can fish
the coastal sections and estuaries whilst moving in on the productive places
at the back of the fjord where the Arctic char are hunting for food.<BR>
<BR>
You cast in the direction in which the boat is going, and naturally compensation
must be made for this when spinning in. When you find a good place you can
cast anchor and cast in wave-forms across the productive area. Investigate
slopes near the mouths of rivers and stone formations where shallow and
deep water meet in particular.<BR>
The same spoon-bait is used for the fishing as is used for spinning in rivers,
lakes and on the coast.<BR>
<HR><B>Trolling for Arctic char</B><A NAME="anchor215652"></A> <BR>
&quot;Trolling spoon-bait&quot; after the boat, or surface trolling as this
type of fishing is also called, is an effective form of fishing when the
Arctic char are looking for food in saltwater.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of casting out and spinning in 300 times, it is easier to drag spoon-bait
20-40 metres behind the dinghy whilst sailing at a walking pace.<BR>
<BR>
You can fish excellently with 2-4 rods at once - 1 or 2 on each side of
the boat, each with its own spoon-bait, e.g. a 7-18 grams Toby bait, a Tasmanian
Devil or a black and grey Rapala wobbler of 7-9 cm, a small Nils Master
wobbler or perhaps a spinner. In reality, the purpose of the spoon-bait
and spinners is the same as those used for coastal fishing. The same applies
to the rod, reel and line.<BR>
<BR>
The spoon-bait and wobblers are cast 20-40 metres behind the boat. Different
spoon-baits and spinners are tried out whilst zigzagging to and fro along
the coast. Many kilometres of inviting coastline can quickly be investigated.<BR>
<BR>
Whilst fishing it is important to ensure that the artificial bait is moving
&quot;correctly&quot; in the wake of the boat. Look at the tip of the rod.
If it nods, the spoon-bait, spinner or wobbler is moving correctly; but
if the tip of the rod is still, the artificial bait may have caught in growth
or seaweed, which needs to be removed from the treble hook.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to fish more efficiently, cover a wider area and make a wider
spread of the artificial baits behind the boat, fishing with a planer board
is the right way to do it.<BR>
<BR>
There are various designs of planer board but, in principle, it is like
a plough which extends 20-50 metres out to the side and sails parallel to
the boat. It is very common to fish with two planer boards, one on each
side of the boat. <BR>
<BR>
The planer board is fixed to a mast which projects a couple of metres above
the boat because the line connected to the planer board must be kept free
of the water.<BR>
<BR>
Once the planer board has been put out, the number of metres of line on
the reel by which you want the artificial bait to fish behind the boat are
cast. The fishing line from the reel and rod is then jammed in a line clip
and placed on the planer board line.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as you give line on the reel the line clip will slide out towards
the planer board line and, in this neat way, you can decide yourself how
far away from the boat the line release should be and, thus, also where
the artificial bait is to fish. The brake on the reel is then adjusted -
it must not be too firm, but must be taut enough for the line not to be
drawn off the reel because of the water pressure.<BR>
<BR>
It is a good idea to leave the &quot;grumbler&quot; on the reel on. It is
a good bite notifier if you are not paying attention yourself in the fraction
of a second when the fish bites.<BR>
<BR>
The rod is placed in a rest and the line tensioned. The rest of the rods
are made ready for fishing in the same way, since there is nothing to stop
you fishing with several line releases on the planer board line at the same
time. In fact, that's the idea!<BR>
<BR>
Now it is just a matter of investigating the starved Arctic char whilst
sailing along the coast at a walking pace.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly the rod bends - a Arctic char has fallen into the trap. <BR>
<BR>
The Arctic char which has been hooked will generally go straight up to the
surface. So you should follow it nicely first if it is not to abscond in
a wild escape. It varies from fish to fish.<BR>
<BR>
Before the Arctic char is landed the deck needs to be cleared of tackle
so that nothing is in the way. When the fish approaches the boat it will
often try one more escape - a last desperate attempt to slip back to freedom.<BR>
<BR>
Put gentle pressure on the fish and let it circle around alongside the boat
until it has run off the worst of it. Then steer it into the mesh of the
landing net head first and lift the fellow on board. <BR>
<BR>
A large landing net is the most certain landing tool. The frame must have
a diameter of at least a metre and the net sack must be deep.<BR>
<BR>
Always clean the first Arctic char of the day straight away and study its
stomach contents. This will be some indication of what the Arctic char is
eating and which tactics and artificial bait you should choose.<BR>
<HR><B>Ice-fishing for Arctic char</B><A NAME="anchor215991"></A> <BR>
Fishing through ice for Arctic char is an almost unresearched method of
catching these exciting fish whilst they are overwintering in Greenlandic
lakes which do not freeze to the bottom. It is a type of fishing which has
become very widespread in northern Scandinavia and Canada, but which has
not spread with the same enthusiasm in Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
A special rod known as a pimple rod is used for the fishing, consisting
of a short blade half a metre in length which has a handle and a small reel
fitted.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to try out this type of fishing you should obtain the tackle
whilst at home since it is not sold in Greenland. However, you can also
get by with spinner tackle if necessary - the only thing you have to change
is the line, which should be no thicker than 0.20 mm.<BR>
<BR>
There are a large number of jigs in various designs and colours of 2-12
grams on the market which are suitable for the fishing. Most ice-fishing
jibs are equipped with a small snell across the hook which can be baited
with, say, Power Bait, a prawn or possibly salmon eggs of the type which
can be bought in a tin. Whichever type of bait is chosen, it is first a
matter of finding the Arctic char and luring them to the hook.<BR>
<BR>
Arctic char are often found close to the deepest sections of the lake, just
outside inlets into the lake or in the vicinity of underground springs.
Often you have to try various places before tracking down the fish - but
once you have found one, there are generally others in the vicinity.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the ice-fishing tackle you will need an ice drill. In places
where you cannot hire an ice drill you will have to take one along. Contact
the regional or local tourist offices for more information.<BR>
<HR><B>Returning fish</B><A NAME="anchor216233"></A> <BR>
There is no reason to destroy more Arctic char than you want to eat yourself.
It is an unwritten rule which every angler visiting Greenland should bear
in mind.<BR>
<BR>
Arctic char which are returned to the water without being frightened, without
wounds and without too much injury survive - for the most part. However,
it is important that the fish are handled delicately, not least during landing
and the hook releasing operation, otherwise their chances will be poor.<BR>
During the fight the concentration of lactic acid in the fish's blood increases
considerably - often this can be seen in the fish after it has been landed,
e.g. through the escape of blood at the fins and in the head region. Fish
in lactic acid shock do not always survive, particularly so if you just
dump the fish in the water. Instead you should give the fish &quot;artificial
respiration&quot;. This is easy to do and is based on holding the head of
the Arctic char up towards the current so that fresh water runs through
the gills. If the water is still, move the fish gently to and fro in the
water whilst holding it carefully under the belly and tail. Only when the
gills are pumping regularly again should you let go of the fish. If the
fish is first given artificial respiration in this way, it means in most
cases that the Arctic char will regain its strength and survive.<BR>
<BR>
During the landing take care that the protective layer of slime on the fish
is not damaged when the fish is landed, and never hold fish which are to
be returned to the water in the eye socket - that is cruelty to animals.
<BR>
<BR>
Once you have landed the fish which you want to have for your evening meal
in your lap, it can be better to fish with a barbless hook. These hooks
themselves make the fishing more exciting since you cannot allow yourself
to make a mistake or the fish will break loose. Barbless hooks can be removed
from the fish's mouth with a quick pull, whilst general hooks require the
use of a hook releaser.<BR>
<HR><B>Plan your Arctic char adventure thoroughly from home</B><A NAME=
"anchor216606"></A> <BR>
If you have very special wishes concerning visiting far-off waters which
are a long way from a town or village, you may choose to be flown out to
the fishing place by Greenlandair. It is an excellent way of having a proper
fishing adventure if there are a few of you travelling together. Then the
price is reasonable. However, such fishing expeditions should be planned
in the minutest detail from home. Amongst other things, you must obtain
the necessary permits and a helicopter or aircraft must be booked in good
time.<BR>
<BR>
If you only have limited time available (1-2 weeks) it is recommended that
you take part in one of the package tours which are offered by several travel
agencies. This not only saves a lot of planning time, but you also know
what to expect before you set off, since it has generally been tried and
tested and is of certain quality.<BR>

<P>Large halibut, terrifying catfish, splendid cod in the 10-15 kg class,
rosefish with large shining eyes and a number of other exciting species
in unpolluted Arctic waters make Greenland an eldorado for sea-anglers.<BR>
<BR>
The many predatory fish which live in Greenland have a glorious life because
the waters are literally a dining room full of delicacies. There are capelin,
shellfish, prawns, large sandeels - practically everything good from the
sea.<BR>
<BR>
In many places in Greenland sea-fishing with a rod, reel and line is as
good as unexplored. Every single trip can offer surprises. But unfortunately
the lack of knowledge and experience concerning the fishing can also be
a problem for visiting anglers, since in only a few places has the fishing
been systematised and productive places recorded. Exploring and charting
the thousands of productive sites which are spread out across this big island
is a major and almost impossible task, but it is being carried out very
locally in Greenland in order to find the best sea-fishing sites and areas
for the benefit of incoming sea-anglers.<BR>
<BR>
The sea around Greenland is large and deep. Depths of 400-600 metres are
not particularly uncommon, but fortunately it is not here that most angling
is practised. The majority of sea-fishing takes place in depths of 20-90
metres. Betweentimes it is necessary to be able to fish greater depths of
150 metres or more if going for rosefish or large catfish, for example.<BR>
<HR><B>Sea-fishing tackle</B><A NAME="anchor217025"></A> <BR>
By far the majority of angling in the sea off Greenland takes place with
a jig of 150-400 grams. It is important to have strong tackle: 20-50 pound
rods and multiplier reels such as Ambassadeur 10 000, Penn or Shimano reels
of the same size, which can hold at least 200 metres of 0.60 mm nylon line.
The above type of reel is robust and must be equipped with brakes that are
in tiptop condition, because the brake on the reel must never thrash or
function irregularly when exposed to even traction. If this is the case,
the brake disks should be replaced or the reel overhauled. The sea-fishing
line must be either 0.50-0.60 mm nylon line or 30-70 pound Dacron, or spun
line as it is also known - or the new Kevlar line is an even better choice.
The advantage of the spun line and Kevlar line is that it is hardly elastic
at all. Even when fishing in a depth of 150 metres you have as much &quot;fingertip
feeling&quot; with the jig in the water as if it were just under the keel.<BR>
<BR>
Nylon line, on the other hand, is elastic and actually gives a lot - 20-50%.
For this reason it is difficult to feel the cautious nips when fishing in
depths of over 50 metres.<BR>
<BR>
Some sea-anglers prefer to use fully drawn steel wire line, but this is
only necessary in depths of over 150-200 metres. The wire is very thin in
relation to its strength and is therefore barely caught by the current.
Moreover, it is entirely inelastic and does not give an inch, so you always
have good contact with the bait at the end of the line. The problem with
steel wire is simply that it has a tendency to kink - and, if it does, the
wire breaks very easily.<BR>
<BR>
Whichever type of line you prefer, take along extra line, e.g. 300-500 metres,
from home so that the line on the reel can be replaced if necessary. Nylon
line is not sold everywhere in Greenland and it can be difficult to get
precisely the line thickness you are looking for.<BR>
<BR>
Most marine fish off Greenland are not particularly fussy about what is
on the hook, but silver and colour-radiating jigs rarely fail.<BR>
<BR>
Jigs are sold in many places locally, but they are relatively expensive
and can easily cost DKK 90-120 each. And although a jig is fairly heavy
in your luggage, expect to lose a couple of jigs on each day trip. It is
therefore recommended that you take a good arsenal of jigs of 100-400 grams
with you to cover the fishing you may encounter.<BR>
<BR>
It is rare to need a jig of over 300 grams and in most fjords there are
no problems &quot;holding&quot; the bottom with a 200 gram jig and knowing
you are fishing there. Only in the most powerful period of tidal change
will you need a jig of over 300 grams in order to fish at the bottom, where
many predatory fish tend to stay when the current is at its strongest. It
is always a good idea to change the hook on the purchased jigs for treble
hooks of size 6-8/O. These hooks are solid and can cope with harder stresses
and that is useful, particularly when a halibut is in your sights.<BR>
<BR>
Remember hangers in your tackle box - and use them well. In Greenland hangers
can be used for most sea fishing - with or without bait. Norske gummimak,
Red Gill, lyskroge, Eddystone Eel and the like are excellent and provide
an extra chance of success but, since in Greenlandic waters really big fish
are possible, you should not fish with more than one or, at most, two hangers.
If a double cod of 2 times 10 kg is hooked, such a dynamic duo is more than
difficult to get to the surface even for the most experienced sea angler.<BR>
<BR>
Many people choose to fish with a baited hanger. A strip of sea scorpion,
cod or other fish is placed on the hook so that the exposed meat moves freely
in the current after the jig. A strip of meat of 5-15 centimetres is cut
out of the fish used for bait. The strips must be pointed and thicker at
one end than the other so that the piece of bait looks almost like a pennant.
The thick end of the bait is placed firmly in the treble hook of the jig.
The strip of fish will dangle in the water like a tail and attract fish
to the jig, not only through its busy movement in the current, but also
through its aroma. This method of fishing is very widespread and is a well-known
trick used frequently by local snell and handline anglers. <BR>
<BR>
A rod belt is not necessary but it is still good to have one with you in
your luggage in case a 100 kg halibut is on the warpath. Sea-fishing at
depths of around 40-80 metres can be demanding and heavy and here it can
be convenient to use a rod belt - not least, because the groin gets rather
sore after a few hours' fishing.<BR>
<BR>
A tackle box is essential for the sea angler. Firstly, it gives you a secure
place to keep your jigs, hangers, swivels, line spools, pliers, knife and
other bits and pieces. Secondly, you can find what you need in a flash.
On major fishing expeditions at sea there is always a tendency for things
to disappear just when you need them. If tackle and bits and pieces have
a permanent place in a box they are easier to find - at least in theory!<BR>
<BR>
Remember warm clothing. The weather in Greenland can change a great deal
and very rapidly, not least at sea: from summer and sunshine to winter weather
in less than an hour! On some summer days you can fish in short sleeves
up to midday, but then suddenly in the afternoon it becomes so bitingly
cold that you have to put on a jacket, thermal clothes and a coat.<BR>
<BR>
On your top half it is best to wear several layers of thin clothing rather
than a thick sweater since the air between the layers provides insulation.
Thermal clothing and fibre fleece are ideal for the purpose. No only do
they take up no more room than ordinary clothes in your luggage, but they
also keep you warm much better. Wool or cotton sweaters have the same insulating
properties. In addition to two or three layers of clothing underneath it
is usually worth having rainwear with you, firstly because it is wind-tight
and watertight and, secondly, because it doesn't matter if you get dirt
or fish slime on your clothing.<BR>
<BR>
Often the sea-angler will need to have one or two layers under his fishing
trousers, e.g. long johns and possibly thermal trousers. If it is windy
or feels raw cold, it is good to have a wind-tight and watertight set of
overtrousers to hand, which both provide insulation and also seal your body
away from the cold.<BR>
<BR>
Fingers can get cold and there is practically nothing worse for stopping
you concentrating on the fishing. Neoprene gloves are a good choice and
keep in the heat even if they get wet. Woollen gloves are an excellent alternative.<BR>
<BR>
Don't forget a cap or hat and scarf. When the wind is coming directly from
the Inland Ice it is cold about the ears.<BR>
<BR>
Warm footwear is essential. Wellington boots are the worst thing imaginable
because they provide absolutely no insulation. The ideal footwear is waterproof
leather boots which are a couple of sizes too big, leaving room for one
or two pairs of thermal or woollen socks.<BR>
<HR><B>Jig fishing</B><A NAME="anchor217400"></A> <BR>
There are no refinements in Greenlandic jig fishing. Once the jig has reached
the bottom, small nodding movements are made with the tip of the rod. There
is no justification for big arm movements at depths of 30-50 metres. It
is better for the jig to make small jumps and be able to attract and sparkle
in the water. Now and again reel in a couple of metres so that the jig is
lifted a couple of metres off the floor - and then let it fall to the floor.
In depths of over 50 metres somewhat more powerful jig movements may be
made to compensate for the elasticity of the line.<BR>
<BR>
One of the best ways of controlling jig fishing is by using what is known
as the &quot;thumb method&quot;. This is a very effective way of operating
the jig tackle which can be learned quickly: when the jig has reached the
bottom, do not switch on the multiplier reel. Instead place the thumb of
your right hand on the reel so that it is blocked, making it impossible
for the line to run off the reel. Now make the characteristic jig movements
with the rod. Now and again release the pressure of your thumb on the spool
so that the line is released and the jig moves towards the bottom. Continue
jigging using the same formula for a while. When there is so much line out
in the water, because of the operation of the boat and the current resistance,
that you have poor contact with the jig, reel the line onto the spool and
start again.<BR>
<HR><B>Coarse fishing with natural bait</B><A NAME="anchor217658"></A> <BR>
Coarse fishing with natural bait is particularly effective if you want to
catch certain fish at the bottom - those which first and foremost use their
sense of smell to find the bait.<BR>
<BR>
In other words, the essence of this fishing is for the fish to sniff his
way to the spoils which lie exposed on a hook at the bottom. Many people
choose to fish with a baited jig, but if you are going for, say, catfish,
bottom fishing with natural bait may be a bit more fruitful. The catfish
is by nature a demersal or bottom fish which sniffs its way to the bait
and cautiously considers whether or not it is edible. Mussels are one of
the items very high on the catfish's list of favourite foods and are a supreme
bait.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to fish with mussels you can collect them at low water at the
bottom of the fjords or in harbours - and it is rarely a problem collecting
enough for a day's fishing in an hour to an hour and a half. However, the
problem can be putting the mussel bait on the hook, because the soft meat
does not sit well on the hook shaft and easily comes off. To prevent this
happening and to prepare a really good treat for the catfish it is a good
idea to bring a fine-mesh hair net or bandage net from home. Hair nets can
be bought in most draper's shops. The alternative is fine-mesh bandage net,
which is sold by most pharmacies.<BR>
<BR>
Open 4-8 mussels, take out the flesh from inside and pack the sticky mass
into the hair net or bandage net, which is baited onto a hook of size 3/O-4/O.
You do not need large pieces of bait because the catfish prefers small mouthfuls
about the size of a walnut. You can also use 5-15 cm long pointed strips
of fish for the fishing, e.g. sea scorpion, cod or fjord cod, attached to
the hook shaft in one or two places. The thick end must be on the hook so
that approximately half the bait extends across the point of the hook and
moves like a tail in the water.<BR>
<BR>
Coarse fishing from a moving boat is the most widespread method for covering
large areas, whilst fishing from an anchored boat is practised more rarely.<BR>
<BR>
You can use the standard equipment used for jig fishing for coarse fishing
too.<BR>
As with traditional jig fishing, it is a matter of getting the snell and
the natural bait to work on the bottom, and it must do so all the time.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as the snell has been cast down to the bottom the line is tensioned
so that the lead at the end of the snell drags across the bottom. Now and
again line is given by the reel since the current and the moving boat gradually
lift the snell and bait up in the water. Now and then you will also need
to reel line onto the reel because the boat moves over a slope or peak.<BR>
<BR>
Most fish are cautious when biting. After the first careful nip has been
noted, give the fish time to swallow the bait. Only when it takes line and
swims away with the spoils in its mouth is the rod lifted backwards in a
controlled counter-bite.<BR>
<BR>
The most widespread snell used for fishing from a moving boat is something
like a paternoster snell, but this can be improved if you bind it. Here
the lead weight at the bottom of the snell has been replaced with a jig
from which the hook has been removed. In its place, fit a 10-15 cm line
snell which goes out to the baited hook. During fishing the snell should
clip the bottom and you must not make too big arm movements - rather the
contrary. Many fish are timid, e.g. the catfish, and taste the bait first
before swallowing the mouthful on the hook. Give the fish time and do not
be too keen when the first nip is taken. Instead, keep cool and let the
fish have a little time before giving a rapid but controlled counter-tug
so that the hook gets a hold in the fish's mouth.<BR>
<BR>
Gliding tackle is used for fishing from an anchored boat. The tackle differs
from the paternoster snell in that the fish can take the bait without noticing
resistance from the lead weight. When a fish tugs cautiously on the bait,
the lead weight remains lying on the bottom and the fish does not feel any
resistance when lifting the bait on the hook up from the bottom.<BR>
<HR><B>Tiring out and landing the fish</B><A NAME="anchor217965"></A> <BR>
Once the fish has been caught and firmly hooked, it needs an opportunity
to work off its rage. Keep a taut line all the time and start &quot;pumping&quot;
the fish towards the surface. Lift up the rod in an even movement so that
the unknown is lifted up out of the deep and then reel in line whilst lowering
the rod. Continue with this pumping action but be ready to give line and
adjust the reel brake if the fish resists. It is necessary to master this
method in order to be able to land large fish. It is also a good method
for getting even small duellists up from deep water, rather than using too
much arm strength getting the fish up on the reel.<BR>

<IMG SRC="PHOTO/THYGE.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/gt/photo/thyge.jpg" WIDTH=184 HEIGHT=123 BORDER=1></CENTER><BR>
The halibut, or Nataarnaq as it is known in Greenlandic, is considered by
anglers to be the king of the North Atlantic and is a very formidable fish
to get on your hook. Quite definitely the preferred bite for the sea angler
in Greenland!<BR>
<BR>
Halibut may be caught all along the west coast, but are particularly widespread
in the areas around the Paamiut bank near Sisimiut and in Disko Bay. It
is a greedy predatory fish and is one of those fish which can move freely
in different layers of water because it has a swim bladder. Although the
halibut is greedy, it is a difficult fish to dupe since it is only active
for limited periods of the day. This is often in the period around rising
water.<BR>
<BR>
If you fish out at sea, for example, the tidal water may be very significant
for the resulting catch. Moreover, experience shows that the best fishing
is found where the current stands still between steep narrow fjords. When
the tidal water current is at its highest the halibut often seeks shelter
on the bottom. At this point in time it doesn't particularly want to bite,
but is does.<BR>
<BR>
For most anglers fishing for halibut in Greenland means fish from 10-60
kilos. However, larger fish of the species are regularly landed by hook
and line anglers on the west coast and occasionally also turn up in the
nets of trawlers. Here the fish can be of different proportions, and monster
halibut of around 4 metres in length weighing 100-300 kilos are landed every
year.<BR>
<BR>
However, as a rule you will find large &quot;flounders&quot; of over 100
kilos further out at sea - often on slopes and close to the top of the large
fishing banks off south-west and central Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The halibut</B> is unusually slow-growing, although it can reach an impressive
size. It has emerged that the fish does not become sexually mature until
10-15 years old, when it is around a metre in length and weighs around 10-15
kilos.<BR>
<BR>
Spawning takes place in 300-1000 metres of water, from December to May.
After hatching the eggs rise up towards the surface and the young live pelagically
at a depth of around 100 metres.<BR>
<BR>
Immediately after spawning the halibut migrates to shallower waters in order
to feed on the large stocks of food closer to the coast. Here it eats the
outsize flatfish, cod, rough dab, fjord cod (uvak), salmon - and it is also
keen on Arctic char.<BR>
<BR>
Halibut of 10-50 kilos often migrate right into the bottom of the fjords.
And from mid-June to October fish of the size stated above have a tendency
to stay on slopes near freshwater outlets where there are deposits of sand
or gravel.<BR>
<BR>
If you are one of the lucky ones in the right place at the right time, you
may suddenly see the outline of a large flatfish about 10 metres below the
keel as it glides elegantly and gracefully across the light sand or gravel
floor. Several local line anglers can tell you how they have seen halibut
the size of a coffee table swarming around at low water whilst the Arctic
char almost jump out of the water in fright to save themselves. If you see
a fish over the bottom, hold on tight to your tackle, pray to God and keep
your powder dry!<BR>
<BR>
Jig fishing and coarse fishing, or a combination of the two, from moving
boats across the productive places is the way to catch halibut.<BR>
<BR>
A baited jig is used a lot for this fishing by local handline and snell
anglers, and is an effective method because the strip of fish on the treble
hook of the jig makes the movement of the jig more lively and spreads a
scent in the water. The halibut is curious, and the combination of the shining
jig and the pleasantly smelling strip of meat which attracts him in the
water can get this big eater to follow the jig right up to a few metres
below the boat before it suddenly comes in for its share.<BR>
<BR>
It is often advantageous to choose a jig of 200-350 grams which has a large
bearing surface and therefore works in a lively way in the current. Experience
has also shown that it can pay to let the jig work from the bottom up to
mid-water, after which you cast the jig down to the bottom again to repeat
the process. This is because the halibut is of a curious nature and is often
attracted by anything which looks different in the water.<BR>
<BR>
You can jig-fish optimally by fitting a hanger, size 1/O-3/O, approx. half
a metre above the jig, which is baited with a strip of fish of 5-8 cm. The
best bait for this purpose is Arctic char, say the Greenlanders, but a sea
scorpion tail or a strip of meat from cod or fjord cod can also be used
to excellent effect.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The catfish in Greenland</B> can be big. Three types are found in Greenland,
these being the blue catfish (Anarhicius denticulatus), the striped catfish
(Anarhicius lupus) and the spotted catfish (Anarhicius minor).<BR>
<BR>
Many people think that the catfish is a greedy and irascible predatory fish
which hunts without inhibition. This is entirely wrong. The catfish is a
very cautious fish which prefers to live on mussels, crayfish and other
shellfish, such as its frightening jaws were created to crunch. And if the
catfish should break a tooth when biting its way through a shellfish it
doesn't matter, because the fish changes its teeth every year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Catfish</B> grow very slowly in the Arctic - the big catfish around a
metre in length are thought to be around 20 years old.<BR>
<BR>
Special coarse fishing with natural bait and fishing with a baited jig produces
the most fish. In the latter case you fish the baited jig with very slow
and soft jig movements just above the bottom.<BR>
<BR>
However cautiously the catfish may bite, it is so wild and irascible when
caught as to make the rod bend and flop, and is a tough opponent to get
into a dual with. And although the fish cannot be considered a fast swimmer,
it always fights bravely for every centimetre of line.<BR>
<BR>
Look out for the catfish's big teeth. They can be sharp as needles, so it
can bite through leather gloves and boots as easily as anything. Always
use long-nosed pliers when loosening the hook from the teeth. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The blue catfish</B> may be up to 35-40 kilos and is the largest of the
catfish species. It is very much a deep sea fish which often prefers depths
of over 100 to 600 metres and is caught only very rarely by anglers. It
is generally dark blue in colour with unclear spots. The meat is fairly
watery and it is not a popular fish to eat amongst Greenlanders.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Atlantic (striped) catfish</B> is the most widespread and is found
at the foot of cliffs, where it lives a lonely life finding food. Otherwise,
most of the time it seeks shelter in cracks and crevices on the bottom.
It can grow to 125 cm and 25 kilos and is best enticed using natural bait,
but is also often caught with a jig and hanger - with or without bait. In
Greenlandic the Atlantic catfish is known as Qeeraaraq and the fish differs
from the other species of catfish in that it lives in shallower waters,
preferably near rocks.<BR>
<BR>
The spotted catfish, or Qeeraq Milattoq as it is called in Greenlandic,
can grow big. Fish of 120-140 cm and 30-35 kilos are regularly landed by
hook and line anglers. It is widespread in Greenlandic waters to the north
of Upernavik and Ammassalik.<BR>
<BR>
The world record for a spotted catfish is also held in Greenland. A fish
of 23.35 kilos was landed with a rod and line near Sisimiut in the 1980s.
This record has not yet been broken.<BR>
<BR>
The spotted catfish prefers to stay on mussel-bottoms or a slightly soft
bottom with some boulders. It is characteristically a bottom fish which
may be found at depths of 25-600 metres, but which is generally found at
100-150 metres where it &quot;vacuums&quot; the bottom of muscles, crayfish
and sea urchins.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The cod</B>, which is called Saarullik in Greenlandic, is found in copious
quantities in certain places and can grow to be colossal in Greenlandic
waters. Every year cod of up to 20-30 kg are landed and for the sea angler
a fish of this calibre is something of a challenge to beat, for Greenlandic
cod always fight to the last - regardless of size.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, cod fishing in Greenland has gradually declined in recent
years and in certain areas the fun duellist is in short supply, but there
are still a large number of exciting and almost virgin areas with large
cod, e.g. in the sea and fjord areas of central Greenland around Sisimiut
and further north.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time the cod stay at the bottom, but in Greenland it is not
uncommon for this popular angler's fish to be found in free bodies of water.
Here cod are generally found in plentiful numbers at the edges of shoals
of feed fish and around well-ventilated knolls in particular.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as the capelin move into the Greenlandic fjords to spawn in the
summer, cod follow in their wake. And so long as capelin are in the neighbouring
layer, cod can be found in the shallower water, i.e. at 20-80 metres.<BR>
<BR>
In sheltered waters and in the fjords cod are found in greatest numbers
on and near knolls and peaks in 40-80 metres of water, so you need to keep
an eye open with the echo-sounder and see where fish are shown.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Cod fishing</B> in sheltered waters generally goes on until the first
period of real frost, after which the cod seek out deeper water. The fish
often spend the winter at depths of 150-200 metres or lower.<BR>
<BR>
Morning and evening fishing and fishing in the period around rising water
is generally the most lucrative. This is partly due to the fact that the
feed fish shoals are split and assembled at these times and so the cod has
optimal hunting opportunities. And if you can track down peaks, current
places with good water ventilation and plenty of feed fish under the keel,
cod are often within casting distance.<BR>
<BR>
The sea areas and fjord systems are large and the fishing points numerous,
and if you want to experience good cod fishing you need local knowledge.
Even with local knowledge however, it can be a problem finding cod of a
good size on some days.<BR>
<BR>
Jig fishing is the most widespread method where cod are concerned. A baited
jig and baited hanger are equally effective weapons if you want to catch
this formidable fighter.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rosefish</B> taste wonderful and are something of an Arctic speciality.
There are three species of rosefish in Greenland and the largest of the
species, Sebastes marinus, can be up to 1 metre long and weigh up to 10-15
kilos. Biologists reckon that fish of this calibre are around 60 years old,
but there are not many of them. Most of the rosefish caught have an average
size of one and a half kilos, but regardless of the size it is always an
unusually attractive fish which you cannot help being taken with.<BR>
<BR>
Rosefish are characteristically demersal fish, liking to stay at or near
the bottom. The largest rosefish are generally caught in the deep water
around 80-200 metres and it has also emerged that the fish migrate a long
way up and down the watercourses in the course of a day. However, there
are exceptions and it has emerged that even large rosefish now and then
like to stay in water of 20-50 metres - in very special places. Rosefish
feed live young.<BR>
<BR>
The rosefish is a perch and resembles this member of its family in shape;
it has the same sharp gill cover and pointed spike. <BR>
<BR>
Be careful when taking the fish off the hook because you could cut or prick
yourself on the pointed spike and sharp gill cover.<BR>
<BR>
Rosefish live primarily on crustaceans, molluscs or prawns and are caught
by jig and hanger. However, the hangers are the fish's favourite - especially
coloured and lively ones.<BR>
<BR>
It can be difficult to feel the rosefish's cautious nip when fishing in
a depth of 100 metres or more. But as soon as you notice a cautious tug
on the line it is bound to be rosefish at play. However, wait a little while
before reeling in the jig and snell and let the tackle stay in the water.
In a short time it can be &quot;full house&quot; and every single hook can
be decorated with its own fish. When the rosefish is revealed from the deep
it is not uncommon for it to get decompression sickness because of the pressure
change. The eyes are practically on sticks and the stomach hangs out of
the mouth of the fine red-orange fish. For this reason, rosefish caught
in deep water cannot be replaced because of decompression sickness. Be careful
when lifting the rosefish on board because it easily flops off the hooks.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fjord cod</B> (Arctic cod), or uvak as it is known in Greenlandic, is
found in large numbers in virtually all Greenlandic waters. The fjord cod
looks a bit like the cod in appearance, but this is where the similarity
ends because it does not fight anywhere near as well as real cod. Neither
does it get anywhere near as big - seldom over 3-4 kilos. It is easy to
distinguish between the two fish because the fjord cod is plumper in appearance
and the fins are smaller and rounded compared with those of the cod. The
fjord cod also has a darker colour and may have reddish glints in some places.
In addition, it has a darker lateral line than the cod. <BR>
<BR>
Fjord cod are generally found at all depths but occur in greatest numbers
at depths of down to 80 metres. In some places the number of fjord cod is
so overwhelming that they represent a real problem for anglers. Fjord cod
can bite incessantly, and if there are other predatory fish in the area
the greedy fjord cod gives them no chance of getting to the jig or the natural
bait first.<BR>
<BR>
The Greenland halibut may be confused with an ordinary halibut, but rarely
grows to more than 1 metre and 10-15 kilos. The Greenland halibut also has
a more grey-blue colour - on both sides - and is slimmer and more symmetrical
in form than its big brother, the halibut. It can also be distinguished
from the halibut by its even lateral line above the pectoral fin, placing
the left eye just in front of the dorsal fin. The Greenland halibut is a
characteristic Arctic fish and is often met pelagically in free bodies of
water where the biologists assume it swims across the water.<BR>
<BR>
In southern Greenland, Greenland halibut are found in particular in ice
fjords, but they are most widespread in Northern Greenland - north of Qaanaaq
and Ittoqqortoormiit. Greenland halibut prefer the greater depths of 200-400
metres water, often on the soft and slightly sludgy floor of the ice fjord.
The Greenland halibut, which is called Qalerarik in Greenlandic, is not
as common a catch for anglers, but now and then is duped in special places.
Its preferred food is prawns and small fish.<BR>
<BR>
In the winter Greenland halibut are caught directly from the ice with a
handline and hook line, e.g. in the Ummannaq area, and from the ice in Ilulissat.
This type of fishing must be said to be an unusual challenge to the angler
wanting a very special ice-fishing experience in the Arctic.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ice fjord fishing</B> has a charm all of its own. It is the ultimate
form of fishing which takes place in the winter from the ice in Ilulissat,
amongst other places, where you can go on trips throughout the winter with
local fishermen, having the ultimate experience on a dog sledge and landing
Greenland halibut through the ice. The Greenland halibut weigh 10-15 kilos
on average and are splendid spoils. Strangely enough, it is one of those
fish for which it has not yet been possible to determine its age because
it lives at a constant temperature.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Greenland shark</B>, which anglers like to call the &quot;strange creation&quot;,
live at depths from 200-600 metres. They are Greenland's largest fish and
may be up to 6.5 metres in length. The Greenland shark is a large brown
shark. It has a full set of teeth but its food consists mainly of fish and
carrion. Since the Greenland shark - also known to the Greenlanders as Eqalussuaq
- has very poor eyesight, it uses primarily its sense of smell to find its
food.<BR>
<BR>
The Greenland shark is widespread in several of the major fjord systems
towards the north of Qaanaaq and Danmarkshavn, but this mystical creation,
which is particularly known for its fine liver and which weighs 20-25 kilos
on average, is fished in only a few places. It is not a prominent or fast
fish for anglers; instead it lives up to its Latin name &quot;somniculosus&quot;,
or &quot;sleepy&quot;. Most of those anglers who have fought with the fellow
say it is almost like having a heavy sack of potatoes at the other end of
the line, but it is still fascinating to catch for those anglers who want
something a bit more special - most of all because of its enormous size.<BR>
<BR>
The Greenland shark often has fixed places it goes to in order to eat. Experience
from Norway suggests that it is therefore advantageous to concentrate the
fishing on certain places and that you should pre-feed before and during
the fishing. To this end you can use an old potato sack with freshly milled
fish with which whale oil, seal blubber or fish oil has been mixed in -
just what whets the Greenland shark's appetite. The pre-feed in the potato
sack is cast down together with the anchor to a depth of 200-300 metres
or more. Here the contents of the sack are slowly washed out into the water,
forming a scent which attracts the Greenland shark. In order for the scent
to remain constant a new portion of pre-feed should be prepared after a
couple of hours' fishing.<BR>
<BR>
Greenland shark can be big, but in most cases you can manage with relatively
light tackle. A 30-50 pound rod and a reel which holds a suitable line capacity,
e.g. Penn 6/O-10/O, or any multiplier reel which holds between 300-600 metres
of 0.60 mm line, can be used.<BR>
<BR>
When fishing in deep water spun line (Dacron), Kevlar line or wire line
is often an advantage, since it gives greater sensitivity with the first
cautious bite. At the other end of the line you will need a wire snell of
5-7 metres. The rig is bound by two pieces of 200 kg wire snell: 1.5 metres
of wire with hook, connected to a swivel which is then followed by a further
3-5 metres of wire. The inserted coupling, which is what the swivel is in
reality, stops the line kinking during the fishing, and the wire filters
together.<BR>
<BR>
Choose a single hook of size 10/O-12/O, which is baited with whale meat,
seal blubber, pieces of fish or rotten meat - and preferably with a decent
amount of lunch!<BR>
<BR>
The Greenland shark is not known for his willingness to fight, but it may
still be necessary to have a rod belt and shoulder pad when a 3 metre shark
is to be brought up from a depth of 300 metres.<BR>
<BR>
Sea-fishing for Greenland shark can be organised for those anglers interested.
However, the trip will require a lot of planning from home. And it is no
secret that there is very little knowledge and experience to be found locally
for those anglers wanting to pioneer this type of fishing. An expedition
for Greenland shark will often be easiest to organise for a small group
of enthusiasts who hire a boat between them for a period.<BR>
<BR>
Like the fjord cod, the rough dab is one of the fish often landed when fishing
in the sea. The rough dab is similar to the common dab and can be large
- 3-4 kilos is not unusual. The rough dab is not reckoned to be a particularly
good fish to eat because its meat is watery, but in fact the flavour is
not bad if the fillets of the fish are dried with salt for a day to draw
some of the water out of the meat.<BR>
<BR>
The rough dab is greedy, has a large mouth and can easily swallow a 300
gram jig in a mouthful - or as good as - and it is caught both with a jig
and with a hanger, with or without bait, or by coarse fishing with natural
bait.<BR>
<HR><B>Other fish for the angler</B><A NAME="anchor219106"></A> <BR>
Sea-fishing always provides surprises and you never know for sure what is
biting on the other end of the line. This is also the case in the Arctic
where, in addition to the species mentioned above, other exciting duellists
are found now and again in Greenlandic waters.<BR>
<BR>
Experimental fishing in Southern Greenland has revealed, for example, that
the North Atlantic tuna stays in the waters off southern Greenland for brief
periods from time to time. The tuna often draws a long way out to sea, and
it is the calm Gulf Stream which can transport them so far north.<BR>
<BR>
The North Atlantic tuna is an exciting angling fish. It grows large - up
to 400 kilos - and is a fabulous fighter. However, the amount of knowledge
about the tuna's presence in Greenland is very modest at the present point
in time.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The porbeagle</B> or mackerel shark is another exciting angling fish
which experimental fishing has revealed is found in the waters around Greenland
- and particularly off southern Greenland. Like the tuna, it enjoys warm
water and when it comes to visit it is often because it has taken a detour
with the calm Gulf Stream. The very presence of this splendid angling fish
in southern Greenland can cause an outbreak of fishing fever in many sea-anglers
- if they don't have it already.<BR>
In certain periods large herring also come in close to land and into the
fjords. This happens particularly in southern Greenland in the late summer.
Here it is sometimes also possible to come across coley and pollack on a
detour during warm summers, but these species are rare occurrences. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The sea scorpion</B> or sculpin is very common in Greenlandic waters
and grows to a large size. There are several types and in some places the
sea scorpions are a plague like the fjord cod. Whatever you do, you can
hardly avoid these greedy fish which bite instantly. The sea scorpion is
a valued fish for eating in Greenland. Greenlanders make soup with the fish
or fry the tails.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Capelin</B>, or ammasset as it is called in Greenlandic, is one of the
basic feed fish in Greenlandic waters in the summer. The capelin may be
up to 15 cm in length, and this small salmonid is very widespread in the
shallow water along the coast. In June the fish move into the sandy coasts
in order to spawn. Then the sea is almost filled with these small, bright
fish, who practically jump onto land in their friskiness. Virtually all
the Greenlandic predatory fish follow in their wake. In earlier times the
capelin was very important to the nutrition and health of Greenlanders.
It has been determined that this little fish has a content of calcium and
oil of 18%, making it a little vitamin bomb in the Arctic environment. The
capelin or ammasset used to be so important to the eastern Greenlanders
that they called their largest town after the fish: Ammassalik.<BR>
<BR>
The sandeel is also a very widespread feed fish in the fjord systems and
is often found in relatively large numbers - often in very special places,
depending on the weather and wind.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the species mentioned, there are also a great number of very
rare deep sea fish in Greenlandic waters. However, most stay at depths which
one can hardly reach with ordinary sea tackle. In addition, there are smaller
fish - &quot;strange creations&quot; - which cannot be considered angling
fish in their current stocks. Those interested should buy the book &quot;Fish
in Greenlandic Waters&quot; by J&oslash;rgen G. Nielsen and J&oslash;rgen
Bertelsen. The book is available in Greenlandic, Danish and English and
is sold in most Greenlandic book shops.<BR>
<HR><B>Waves, wind and water</B><A NAME="anchor219408"></A> <BR>
Although the Greenlandic fjords on the west coast open up to the windswept
Davis Strait, most sea fishing takes place in sheltered waters - inside
and just outside of the fjords and skerries, where it is generally possible
to find shelter from the wind.<BR>
<BR>
However, the wind may well cause problems, particularly in connection with
tide changes when the water level changes by 3-4 metres. The waves can show
their teeth during strong &quot;Fhn&quot; storms in particular, with white
tips and frothing scum on the surface.<BR>
<BR>
Wind dust is also a very common phenomenon in the narrow fjords which are
hemmed in by high mountainsides on both sides. In the daytime hours when
the temperature over land increases, the air will rise skywards. This will
automatically result in lower pressure over land and, thus, also in wind.
These fjord winds are experienced particularly in the summer, starting at
2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon when the temperature rises. The result is
often a series of strong wind impulses which make the waves show their teeth
without warning.<BR>
<BR>
The water in Greenlandic waters is cold - often no more than a couple of
degrees above zero. If you have an accident you will cool down uncommonly
quickly, so there is more than good reason to take special care and always
to wear a survival suit, or at least a life jacket.<BR>
<BR>
Although you would think that falling into the cold yonder would cause shock,
only very few people die immediately of shock. However, the cold water makes
the body draw blood away from the outer layers of the body in order to keep
the core temperature constant. This means you lose the feeling in your fingers,
arms and legs in just a few minutes. The body begins to shake. After 5-15
minutes the body's core temperature falls to below 35 degrees C and you
become weakened mentally and apathetic, confused and irrational. As soon
as the body temperature falls below 28 degrees C, you die of hypothermia.<BR>
<HR><B>Plan your sea-fishing trip thoroughly from home</B><A NAME="anchor219691"></A>
<BR>
If you are planning a sea-fishing trip in Greenland yourself there are several
things which must be arranged before you depart - not least, booking a boat
is important. It is often advantageous to book sea-fishing trips through
a tour operator, since these trips will often have taken all the local planning
into account: accommodation, hire of boat with a skipper, meals, etc. In
addition, you can be sure that these trips will be made on boats which meet
the current rules and regulations. Often a package sea-fishing tour is also
many times cheaper than a tour which you plan yourself.<BR>
If you want to set off on a fishing adventure yourself, then contact the
local tourist offices in good time to find out what boats can be hired.
If is often advantageous to be part of a group of a certain size in order
to share the cost of the boat.<BR>
<HR><B>SALMON FISHING</B><A NAME="anchor219812"></A> <BR>
<P><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="PHOTO/FISH.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/gt/photo/fish.jpg" WIDTH=185 HEIGHT=126 BORDER=1>
</CENTER>
<P>Greenland offers battles not only for sea anglers and Arctic char enthusiasts.
There are also genuine salmon in Greenlandic waters which provide exciting
and atmospheric trolling along the coasts and in the fjords. This fishing
can be combined with sea-fishing and Arctic char fishing if you wish.<BR>
<BR>
There are several reasons why trolling is gaining in popularity in Greenland.
The reasons for this are, not least, that the distances in Greenland are
so unmanageable, and that, in principle, the salmon can be anywhere when
looking for food. And before you catch them - you have to track them down.
Trolling is the most effective method for this purpose when you want to
cover larger distances in order to track down the salmon.<BR>
<BR>
The only river containing salmon in Greenland is the Kapisilit river, which
lies at the bottom of the Godth&aring;b fjord, but its salmon stocks are
relatively small in number. The river is exciting, but it takes a relatively
long time to be transported from Nuuk to the river and, since the Kapisilit
salmon are seldom larger than 4 kilos, it is a long way to go to fish salmon.
Moreover, angling in the Kapisilit river is reserved for local fishermen.<BR>
<BR>
Apart from the Kapisilit river, there are no waters containing salmon in
Greenland. A few years ago American biologists carried out a major survey
of the potential of 73 selected rivers with a view to their ability to sustain
salmon stocks, but the survey found that none of the waters selected had
enough food for salmon fry to be able to survive. In addition, the water
temperature was below 10 degrees C in practically all the rivers, and the
salmon fry need warmer water in order to survive.<BR>
<HR><B>Greenlandic salmon have come a long way</B><A NAME="anchor220291"></A>
<BR>
The Atlantic salmon is called kapisilit in Greenlandic, but it is not &quot;real&quot;
Greenlandic salmon, which was originally born and bred in Greenland and
which is found in the Davis Strait between Greenland and northern Canada.
Instead it is salmon which comes from both sides of the Atlantic - from
the fish-rich rivers of Canada and the USA to the west, and also from a
number of western European rivers - including those in Britain, Norway,
Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Baltic, rivers in the west of Sweden and
even from as far afield as rivers in northern Spain.<BR>
<BR>
Until now it has been a mystery as to what the many salmon are doing in
Greenland. It was not until the mid 1950s that a marked salmon was caught
which brought researchers a little bit closer to solving the puzzle. It
happened near Maniitsoq on the West Coast, where a marked salmon was landed.
The salmon's mark showed that it was a fish from Scotland which had been
planted in the sea a little to the north of Aberdeen. This salmon had migrated
3,000 kilometres and across the North Atlantic to come to the dinner party
in Greenland!<BR>
<BR>
One of the many theories concerning why salmon migrate all the way to Greenland
concerns the presence of the enormous quantities of food - not least capelin,
sandeel and krill which, in the autumn, are present in such massive shoals
off Greenland that in some places the sea almost seethes with life under
the surface. In other words, here the salmon can find an extremely well-stocked
dining room.<BR>
<BR>
Another theory goes further back in the history of creation - in fact to
the last &quot;minor ice age&quot;, when the continental shelf and the sea
looked rather different to the way they do today. In the &quot;continental&quot;
period most of the North Sea was dry land and the great western European
rivers then had almost direct access to the Atlantic. As soon as a migrating
salmon hit the sea, the fish could not help but end up in Greenland if it
continued northwards for long enough. This theory is thus based on the idea
that the salmon have &quot;inherited&quot; mechanisms from their ancestors
which cause them to make the trip to Greenland to eat.<BR>
<BR>
Science has not yet been able to conclude for certain which solution is
the right one. The same is true of how the salmon find their way back to
the spawning river after the visit, because it really has been proved in
practice that they do so. Salmon caught on the Greenlandic coast have been
marked and replaced in the sea to be caught later in their home rivers.<BR>
<HR><B>The salmon season</B><A NAME="anchor220500"></A> <BR>
The salmon season starts in late summer, when large quantities of Atlantic
salmon round the southern tip of Greenland and appear along the West Coast.<BR>
<BR>
In Southern Greenland the fishing starts in August, when the first shoals
of salmon hit the Greenlandic fjord system on their eating migration. The
season continues until October, but note that the further north you go up
towards the west coast, the earlier the salmon fishing seems to stop.<BR>
<BR>
When the salmon shoals arrive in Greenlandic waters the fish quickly find
their way into the mouths of the fjords and start hunting. Often a number
of fish gather together in small or larger shoals and their actions depend
greatly on the food fish and where these are found. <BR>
<HR><B>Where are the salmon?</B><A NAME="anchor220612"></A> <BR>
Trolling mostly takes place close to the coast, often in the fjord systems
where the salmon gather. However, sometimes you can get to fish a couple
of nautical miles from the coast - but this is only advisable when the weather
is at its best.<BR>
<BR>
Catches of salmon in Southern Greenland around Narsaq and Qaqortoq, where
the fishing is most developed, show that the best fishing is experienced
when there are waves and a light to fresh wind. Good results are rarely
obtained when there is no wind. Possibly the salmon are frightened in the
crystal clear water when there are no waves - or perhaps it is because the
artificial bait takes on a more lively and alluring movement when the boat
is lifted up and down by the waves.<BR>
<BR>
The average weight of salmon caught by trolling is around 4-5 kilos - but
considerably larger fish are regularly landed by drift-net fishermen.<BR>
<BR>
By far the majority of the salmon caught by the trolling method to date
have bitten in just 5-15 metres of water.<BR>
<BR>
The fishing is best in rising water, when the salmon are almost pushed into
the fjords by the tidal water. In general, the salmon go relatively deep
in clear, still weather, whereas they are relatively high in the water when
it is grey, dark and blowy. Moreover, experience shows that morning and
evening fishing normally produce the most fish. According to local fishermen,
whether the sun is shining or the weather is grey is not that significant
for the resulting catch but, since salmon can feel even the slightest change
in pressure, the weather conditions are otherwise of great significance
for the fishing. For example, elsewhere in the world experience has shown
that the salmon can be completely uninterested in taking in food when there
is low pressure, whereas they bite very keenly when there is high pressure.<BR>
<BR>
Amongst other things, salmon choose their food migration according to the
temperature of the water and seek out the areas in which there are copious
quantities of food. The pleasant temperature in the water is often nearest
the surface, where there is generally also the most oxygen in the water.
And remember: salmon cannot bear having much water over their backs, but
like a lot under their bellies - as the old saying amongst salmon fishermen
goes.<BR>
<HR><B>Trolling</B><A NAME="anchor221244"></A> <BR>
Several biological investigations have shown that salmon often choose to
swim round peaks or underwater crags instead of going over them. It may
therefore pay to spend time trolling out areas where depth curves run close
together. The salmon use areas with peaks or crags to block off the escape
routes for the fish they eat and, in principle, the salmon shepherd them
together in a corner. For this reason, areas with varying depths are always
worth trying. Often it is an advantage to fish on the wind side (where the
wind is on land), since small fish have a tendency to gather here.<BR>
<BR>
Look out for the seagulls. Where flocks of gulls go down and nip fish on
the surface, salmon are often to be found in the neighbouring layer. Often
shoals of salmon practically force shoals of small fish to the surface from
below, and the gulls join in the meal from above. When you see this &quot;gull
play&quot; it can pay to troll around the spectacle in large circles, spiralling
in towards the middle. <BR>
<BR>
Keep an eye on the drift-nets too. The locals often known where and when
the salmon are on the move.<BR>
<BR>
Salmon often follow a spoon or wobbler and bite a couple of times before
deciding to take a mouthful. If you feel a small nip, it can pay to vary
the speed of the engine and maybe sail a little slower or a bit faster.
It is often when the artificial bait has an unusual and irregular movement
that the salmon's biting instinct is triggered.<BR>
<BR>
On some days the only salvation is to have the bait spread out in a semi-circle
in the wake; on other days you should preferably bring the bait close together,
to be reminiscent of a small shoal of fish. This luring effect has proved
to be effective in Greenland on days when the food fish are deep.<BR>
<BR>
Since the salmon are only in the sea off Greenland, where they come to eat,
it is here they must be caught. This fishing is carried out exclusively
from boats or dinghies and is based on various forms of trolling.<BR>
<BR>
Trolling in all its embodiments is an atmospheric form of fishing carried
out from a boat or dinghy, and which is practised in the beautiful fjords
where whales and seals pop up now and then, whilst icebergs of all sizes
and colours sail past on the horizon. Icebergs are only found in Southern
Greenland, Disko Bay and Eastern Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
The areas in which trolling is most well developed to date lie in Southern
Greenland, e.g. off Narsaq and Qaqortoq. Many fine catches have already
been made here, but in several fjords up along the West Coast extensive
test fishing is in progress at local level in order to chart the potential
- many places are still entirely unresearched.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Trolling with spoon-bait&quot; behind the boat, or surface trolling
as it is also called, is the traditional way of investigating larger fishing
areas. Instead of casting out and spinning in 300 times, it is easier to
troll spoon-bait 20-50 metres behind the dinghy whilst the boat is moving
at a walking pace or 1.5-4 knots. You can fish very well with two to four
rods at once; one or two on each side of the boat, each with their own spoon-bait,
e.g. a Northern King, Salmon Queen, Trolling Devil, Predator trolling spoon-bait,
Toby, Inkoo, Flutter Spoon, Diamond King, Krocodile and Rapala's spoon-bait
to name but a few, in weights from 10-30 grams. Or perhaps one or two wobblers,
e.g. Rapala Husky, Rapala Magnum, Rapala Shad Deep, Rapala Original, Rapala
Jointed, Rapala Sliver, Nils Master, Bomber, Turus, Ukko, Abu Hi-Lo Minnow,
Rebel wobbler, etc. of 7-20 cm.<BR>
<BR>
During the fishing it is important to ensure that the artificial bait is
being trolled correctly in the boat's wake. Look at the tip of the rod.
If it is nodding, the spoon-bait or wobbler is moving correctly; but if
the tip of the rod is still, the hook of the artificial bait may have caught
some growth or seaweed which needs to be removed.<BR>
<BR>
Planer board fishing is a development of traditional surface fishing. The
planer board is a kind of surface paravane which projects out from the side
of the boat just like a plough. Often you fish with two planer boards -
one on each side of the boat.<BR>
<BR>
The planer board is made of wood or plastic and is designed such that it
automatically draws out to the side. When the planer board has been placed
out alongside the boat you place out the artificial bait piece by piece
at the distance behind the boat which you want the spoon-bait or wobbler
to go.<BR>
<BR>
Before the artificial bait is put out you can, if you like, fit one of the
special depth paravanes, e.g. a Finnish Kuusamo, one and a half to two metres
in front of the artificial bait. This will ensure that spoon-bait or wobblers
are weighed down in deeper water, and it is often advantageous for each
individual rod to fish at a particular depth, since you want to cover as
many depths as possible until you have got the first salmon to show its
hand.<BR>
<BR>
It is difficult to say exactly what length line you should fish with, i.e.
how far behind the boat the artificial bait should work. Some people prefer
to use long length lines and have luck with these, whilst others say that
short lines are the only right way to do it. However, this does not mean
that the line length is of no significance, for there is no doubt that some
days you need long length lines behind the boat, and other days you need
short lengths.<BR>
<BR>
In general one can say that line lengths of around 50-60 metres behind the
boat can be recommended when the water is as bright as a mirror - not least
because the waters around Greenland are so pure and clear. Line lengths
of 20-40 metres can be recommended on windy days and when the waves have
white tips.<BR>
<BR>
When the spoon-bait or wobbler is moving correctly in the wake, fit a line-release
clip on the line between the mast and the surface paravane, holding the
fishing line in a fixed position. Having done this, allow line to be released
out towards the surface paravane and let it fish at the distance from the
side of the boat which you have decided on. This is done with all the rods
which you want to have in action.<BR>
<BR>
In this neat way planer board fishing ensures a greater spread of the bait
than with traditional surface trolling and you can investigate a much larger
area. And, bearing in mind the distances and the extent of the fjord systems
in Greenland, this is very useful.<BR>
However, it is first and foremost the introduction of downrigger fishing
which has now opened up new horizons for catches of real Atlantic salmon
and drawn the Greenlanders' attention to the opportunities and potential
which lies in salmon trolling in the regions.<BR>
<BR>
Fishing with a downrigger originates from the great lakes on the border
between Canada and the USA, where it has developed at an almost explosive
rate. In recent years this type of fishing has also caught on well in Scandinavia
and now also in Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;downrigger&quot; is the amazing little machine on which this fishing
is based. The downrigger is fixed on board the boat and consists of an arm
with a reel of wire line, at the end of which is placed a 3-7 kg lead ball.
It also has a little trip counter which shows how deep the lead ball is,
and a handle which is used to cast the wire line with the lead weight down
alongside the boat, or to reel it in. Using a trigger button, the lead ball
is cast down alongside and under the boat, whilst the counter shows how
far down the lead ball is.<BR>
<BR>
A line clip release is fitted in the lead ball in which the fishing line
from a rod and reel are fitted. There are several models of line clip releases
or line clips available. It is important to choose a model which can be
adjusted accurately so that it is triggered when the fish bites. Fishing
tackle producers Walker and Canon, for example, make some excellent line
clips for this kind of fishing. Remember to bring along a few extra from
home if you are going trolling because they are not sold in Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
Before the fishing line is fitted in the clip, the line clip must be finely
adjusted so as to give line when a fish bites but not be triggered simply
by the resistance and pressure of current from the water.<BR>
<BR>
Extra clips can be fitted above the lead weight up towards the wire if you
want to fish with more than one rod. This is advisable, since you can then
fish several depths at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
The downrigger and the lead ball are now given spoon-bait or wobblers in
order to fish at the desired depth, whilst spoon-bait and wobblers fish
10-50 metres horizontally backwards and, say, 25 foot down (1 foot = 30
cm) or perhaps 30, 40 or 50 feet. Here one must experiment with depths and
line lengths behind the boat and try things out until you have found the
right formula for that day's catch.<BR>
<BR>
Downrigger fishing is effective for several reasons. Firstly, it stops you
from constantly catching the big seaweed plants which float around at the
surface of fjords and along the coast. In some places the seaweed plants
make surface trolling difficult because lines and spoon-bait drawn behind
the boat on the surface keep getting wrapped up in the floating underwater
palms. If you use a downrigger it ensures that the fishing line does not
get caught in the floating seaweed, since the line and artificial bait are
kept below the surface by the heavy lead under the keel. <BR>
<BR>
However, the most important thing is that the downrigger equipment makes
it possible to sink several spoon-baits and wobblers down at different depths
which were difficult to fish before. Before there was the downrigger, it
was a real problem finding wobblers and spoon-bait which could investigate
depths more than 4-5 metres down, since the drag from the boat and the water
resistance automatically force the artificial bait up in the water. With
the downrigger this problem fades away like morning dew, since the lead
ball at the end ensures the spoon-bait or wobbler sinks to the depth at
which you want it to work.<BR>
<BR>
Once the spoon-bait or wobbler has been set to fish at the chosen depth
under the boat and length from the boat, the rod is placed on a rest. Ensure
that the line to the wobbler and spoon-bait is taut.<BR>
<BR>
Now sail around the desired depth at a speed of 2-4 knots. Then it is just
a matter of waiting. Suddenly the rod bends wildly: a genuine salmon has
fallen into the trap.<BR>
<BR>
After the rise, do not stop straight away but keep sailing. Salmon often
gather in small shoals and if you wait a bit after the first rise it is
not uncommon for another fish from the shoal to find its way to the hook.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime give the salmon which has already been hooked line - but
naturally you should keep a taut line to it, otherwise the fellow will have
a good chance of freeing himself from the hook.<BR>
<BR>
The salmon which has been hooked will generally go straight up to the surface
and make a proper splash. So follow it nicely if it is not to get away in
a wild escape. It varies from salmon to salmon - but only a few noble fishes
in this world are in the same category as the Greenlandic iced lightning,
which generally fights hard for every centimetre of line. Moreover, it is
a sight to behold when the bright silver beauty surfaces alongside the boat
with the spoon-bait or wobbler in its jaws, shining almost like silver paper
being torn off the roll. A splendid sight.<BR>
<BR>
Before the salmon is landed the deck should be cleared of tackle so that
nothing is in the way. As the salmon approaches the boat, it will often
attempt one more escape - a last desperate attempt to slip back to freedom.
Put even pressure on the fish and let it circle around alongside the boat
until it has worked off the worst of it. Then steer it into the landing
net head first and lift the fellow on board.<BR>
<BR>
Always clean the first salmon of the day straight away and study its stomach
contents. This will provide you with some indication of what the salmon
are eating and which tactics and artificial bait you should choose.<BR>
<HR><B>Salmon trolling equipment</B><A NAME="anchor221887"></A> <BR>
For surface fishing where you fish with a couple of rods on each side of
the boat, the species can be managed with ordinary spinner rods of 8-9 feet,
a fixed-spool reel and 0.35 mm line. However, this is not the optimal equipment;
if possible, use proper trolling rods for trolling. <BR>
<BR>
This is essential for downrigger fishing, since many ordinary spinner rods
are simply unusable; in the worst case they will break because of the load.
Trolling rods for downrigger fishing must be very soft and supple in order
to be able to be held firm in the downrigger. Only in a few places in Greenland
can these rods be hired, and in by far the majority of places they are required
to be brought from home. Contact the local tourist offices for more information
about this and to find out both which ones are available and what equipment
they are rigged up with.<BR>
<BR>
The trolling rods should be equipped with multiplier reels. This applies
both to surface trolling and downrigger fishing. This type of reel is particularly
well suited, since multiplier reels are equipped with a very good and even
brake, so that you can put even pressure on the fish after the rise. In
addition, multiplier reels can generally hold more line than fixed reels
and this is often very useful when a salmon of 4-6 kilos runs off with the
spoon-bait in its jaws - escapes of 50-75 metres or more are entirely normal.<BR>
<BR>
Multiplier reels for trolling fishing must be the size of an Ambassadeur
7000 or equivalent and, as a minimum, must be able to hold 200 metres of
0.30-0.45 mm line.<BR>
<BR>
Wobblers and spoon-bait of matt but clear colours, e.g. silver and gold,
have shown themselves to be particularly successful. The salmon's own colours
of black and bright silver are also excellent colours; the same applies
to colours which are reminiscent of capelin and sandeel. When the weather
is clear, blue wobblers or silver spoon-bait with blue strips may be the
thing. If it is cloudy, perhaps gold-coloured wobblers or spoon-bait should
be tied to the end of the line.<BR>
<BR>
The wobbler and spoon-bait models used in Scandinavian waters are largely
the same as those used in Greenland.<BR>
<BR>
Examples of spoon bait include Northern King, Salmon Queen, Trolling Devil,
Predator trolling spoon-bait, Toby, Inkoo, Flutter Spoon, Diamond King,
Krocodile and Rapala's spoon-bait in weights from 10-30 grams. The spoon-baits
must preferably be relatively large, approx. 7-20 cm long.<BR>
<BR>
Examples of wobblers for this fishing include Rapala Husky, Rapala Magnum,
Rapala Shad Deep, Rapala Original, Rapala Jointed, Rapala Sliver, Nils Master,
Bomber, Turus Ukko, Hi-Lo Minnow, Rebel wobbler, etc. Wobblers in sizes
7-15 cm are the most widely used.<BR>
<HR><B>Salmon trolling requires planning</B><A NAME="anchor222375"></A>
<BR>
Salmon trolling has great opportunities for development in Greenland but
the trip must be planned carefully. The best opportunities for salmon trolling
are found on the west coast and particularly in Southern Greenland. In Sisimiut
test fishing has been taking place in recent years using trolling equipment,
and more boats and dinghies are being rigged up for fishing in these parts.<BR>
<BR>
It is not usually far to go to the fishing sites, which are generally within
a reasonable distance of the town or village which is the starting point
for the trolling trip.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the fishing, you will always have a beautiful experience
of the coastal scenery into the bargain as you silently and calmly sail
around the fjords with salmon in your sights.<BR>
<BR>
However, Greenlandic waters are not only beautiful, they are also dangerous.
It is not advisable to go to sea without a local guide or skipper, since
wind and weather conditions can change character like a bolt of lightning
from a clear sky. In addition, in every fjord there are a large number of
hidden rocks and current areas which are not to be trifled with, so always
wear a lifejacket or survival suit on board. The water is cold and once
the accident has happened things can quickly go terribly wrong.<BR>
<BR>
You will need to be in possession of a relatively strong boat which is rigged
up for the fishing with a downrigger, planer board mast, rod rests, echo-sounder,
GPS and all the other essential trolling equipment to get the most out of
your salmon fishing.<BR>
<BR>
At the moment there are only a few suitable vessels with the right equipment,
and those which are available need to be booked in good time. Expect the
daily rate for hire of the boat and a skipper to be around DKK 4000-8000
per day, depending on the size and equipment of the boat. Most places will
give you some kind of discount if you are hiring for more than one day,
but it will still be an advantage to set off with a couple of fishing chums
to bring the trolling trip down to a reasonable price per person.<BR>
<BR>
If you are only visiting Greenland for a brief period in order to fish for
salmon or fish at sea, the most convenient way is to book the trip through
the local tourist offices or tour operators. Then you can be sure that the
boat or dinghy and any guide meet the rules in force before sailing with
passengers.<BR>
<BR>
Package solutions including travel, accommodation, boat hire and board are
often cheaper than organising the whole thing yourself - and you also save
all that planning time.<BR>
<HR><B>PRACTICAL INFORMATION</B><A NAME="anchor222873"></A> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Fishing permits</B><A NAME="anchor222987"></A> <BR>
Everyone over 18 years of age wanting to fish in Greenland must hold a valid
fishing permit. These can be obtained from the local tourist office or from
the police. Permit A costs DKK 200 and entitles you to fish for one month.
Permit B costs DKK 500 and is valid for three months.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Taking home your catch. </B><A NAME="anchor114783"></A><BR>
Sending your catch from Greenland to your home address can easily be done.<BR>
<BR>
However, always remember that the fish stocks in the Arctic environment
are vulnerable. All the species, almost without exception, have taken a
long time to grow large. These fish should be particularly respected and
treated as piece of valuable nature!<BR>
In most Greenlandic towns there are cold stores where you can have the fish
frozen. In many places this can also be done where you are staying and you
can use the old trick of pouring into the freezer bag half a glass of water
for each kilo of fish before freezing it down. The water reduces both evaporation
and drying out and keeps the fish fresh for longer - up to 50% longer. In
other words, you can have &quot;fresh fish&quot; in 4-5 months' time. Remember
that oily fish such as salmon and trout cannot tolerate being frozen for
long periods or the fat begins to go rancid.<BR>
<BR>
At several places along the coast the fish can be transported to your home
address as frozen goods. The easiest thing is to contact the local KNI office
or to get where you are staying or the tour operator to arrange transport
of the catch home. Royal Arctic Line stores and dispatches to Aalborg in Denmark,
and from there the fish is delivered by carrier.<BR>
<BR>
If you wish, salmon and trout can also be smoked locally so that you can
take your catch home in your hand luggage. Further information is available
from local tourist offices.<BR>
<BR>
The midnight sun. In Northern Greenland this means that there is sun - and
it is light - 24 hours a day in the summer. In Sisimiut there is midnight
sun in June, but you have to go up into the mountains to see it because
the sun is low in the sky. Nuuk is situated too far south to have midnight
sun, but summer nights are very short and light.<BR>
<HR><B>Safety on board. </B><A NAME="anchor116294"></A><BR>
Before a ship or dinghy can be used for sailing with passengers it must
be approved by the Danish Maritime Authority.<BR>
<BR>
The vessel must meet very high requirements with regard to the construction
of the ship, safety equipment for passengers, fire extinguishing, signal
and communication equipment and the training of the crew. There is a mandatory
annual inspection of all safety and communication equipment, and every other
year the hull and machinery must be inspected if the sailing permit is to
be renewed.<BR>
<BR>
If you arrange fishing with a local fisherman or hunter on your own initiative
from his dinghy or cutter, the requirements of the Maritime Authority will
not normally be met. The same applies to sailing in private leisure vessels.<BR>
