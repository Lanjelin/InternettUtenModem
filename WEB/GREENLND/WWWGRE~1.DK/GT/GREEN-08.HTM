<STRONG>Greenland is located in the arctic region and is thus characterized by extreme climatic conditions. The demands made of safety in the transport sector are therefore also amongst the most rigorous in the world.</STRONG><BR>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="Excursion vessels">Excursion vessels</A></H3>

Before a ship can be used to sail passengers, it must be approved by the Danish Government's Ships Inspection Service.<BR>
       <BR>
The vessel must meet stringent demands with regard to hull construction, passenger safety gear, fire extinction, signal and communication equipment as well as crew training. There is a
statutory annual inspection of all safety and communication equipment, and every second year hull and machinery must be inspected if the vessel's navigating license is to be maintained.<BR>
       <BR>
For ships plying straightforward scheduled routes, the safety requirements are further intensified, just as ships must report in to radio stations when leaving port with details of the number of passengers and expected time of arrival.<BR>

<A HREF="../GLA/DEFAULT.HTM" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/gla/default.htm">Greenlandair Inc.</A> is subject to the Danish aviation authorities' regulations and inspections, and in many areas has stipulated additionally intensified requirements of its own. The overall safety concept includes the principal elements: pilots, airplane stock and weather.<BR>
       <BR>
Greenlandair's pilots are internationally recognized for their qualifications. Every year, all pilots are sent on simulator training, where normally inconceivable situations are tested under highly realistic conditions.<BR>
       <BR>
By this means, a valuable stock of experience is accumulated, which is then incorporated in day-to-day routine flying.<BR>
       <BR>
Greenlandair's materiel or stock is among the best and most reliable ever manufactured by the aviation industry. It consists of tried and tested plane types which use the experience of its own and other airlines for continual improvements to the benefit of flying safety. Alternative navigation systems have been installed in all planes, and Greenlandair is one of the top airlines when it comes to acquiring the latest satellite navigation.<BR>
       <BR>
Even the most reliable flying stock calls for a complicated back-up structure for servicing&#59; here, Greenlandair commands a well-trained staff of flight engineers and mechanics as well as modern workshop facilities where working routines have been organized in keeping with modern quality regulations.<BR>
       <BR>
Nevertheless, engineering the weather is still beyond the power of either Greenlandair or anyone else, although they have learned to respect conditions and gained extensive familiarity in handling difficult weather situations. By far the majority of delays are due to the weather, as safety considerations are always given top priority. If, before or during the flight, the pilot judges that the demands of visibility and wind conditions are not met, then the flight is canceled - or else he turns the plane around. Safety is always given top priority.<BR><HR>

<H3><A NAME="The health services">The health services</A></H3>

Regardless of how well prepared and trained a person is, sickness and accidents can always crop up along the way. It is reassuring to know, therefore, that there are always well-run hospitals with well-trained staff in all Greenlandic towns.<BR>
      <BR>
If particularly complicated situations should arise that cannot be dealt with locally, the patient is transferred to the hospital at Nuuk or Copenhagen.<BR>
       <BR>
The largest villages have facilities staffed by a nurse. In the event of acute sickness, treatment - including dental treatment and medicine - is without cost for the patient.<BR>
       <BR>
Non-prescription medicines, e.g. headache tablets, are sold at KNI shops.<BR>
       <BR>
It is recommended that travelers bring along their own medicine and any other medication taken regularly, as special products cannot always be obtained.<BR><HR>
  <BR>
<H3><A NAME="Insurance">Insurance</A></H3>

All travelers are recommended to take out standard travel and health insurance policies as well as special policies, if necessary.<BR>
       <BR>
Contact your travel agent for further information.<BR>
       <BR>
If there are delays to flights to and from Greenland and during domestic flights within Greenland, the cost of accommodation and meals will be paid by the airlines.<BR><HR>

<H3><A NAME="Search and rescue parties">Search and rescue parties</A></H3>
Search and rescue parties are the job of the police, who call in Greenlandair's helicopters and Greenland's Command as well as their own or private ships, wherever necessary.<BR>
       <BR>
Owing to the enormous tracts of mountain and wetland, the scattered settlement and limited infrastructure, searches in Greenland are often very extensive and lengthy, and statistics show that a search can run into 5-figure sterling figures.<BR>
      <BR>
A search will always be given top priority over a scheduled flight, which may have a disruptive effect on the rest of the community, of course.<BR>
       <BR>
In order to minimize inconvenience from this source and provide better facilities for successful searching, it is important to follow the most elementary advice about moving around the countryside. Always tell someone where you are heading, when you expect to be back and then let them know once you have returned. Take along safety equipment such as an ANNA emergency kit. If any kind of mishap does occur, contact the nearest local police station as soon as possible with as detailed information as possible.<BR><HR>
<H3><A NAME="ANNA Emergency Kit">ANNA Emergency Kit</A></H3>

Greenlandair and Greenland's Home Rule have produced an excellent emergency kit called the ANNA Emergency Kit, which is available in an A5 sleeve, weighs 560 g and takes up approx. 3/4 liter. The kit contains: whistle, compass, flares (launching tube + cartridges), signaling mirror, aluminum foil wind sleeve, signal flag and a belt, so that the kit can be strapped around the waist, as well as instructions in Danish, English and Greenlandic.<BR>
       <BR>
Do bear in mind that the cartridges have a limited shelf-life.<BR>
       <BR>
ANNA Emergency Kits can be bought at KNI shops, ship's supply stores and in some towns will also be available from Greenlandair at the heliport or airport.<P>

Price: An ANNA Emergency Kit costs approx. US $75.<BR>
