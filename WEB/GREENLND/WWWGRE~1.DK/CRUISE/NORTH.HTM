A visit to DISKO BAY is a unique experience. In high summer the Midnight Sun shines for 24 hours and some of the most active glaciers in the northern hemisphere are found in the Disko Bay area, where there are icebergs of all sizes. <BR><P>

The whole area is characterized by a stable climate, and is popularly known as a &quot;high pressure halt&quot;. The itinerary includes visits to charming towns such as <A HREF="../ILULIS~1/ILULISAT.HTM" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/ilulissat-tourist/ilulisat.htm">Ilulissat</A>, Uummannaq and Sisimiut, Greenland's second-largest town.<BR><BR>An adventure Cruise with M/S DISKO is sure to be unforgettable. You'll see whales and seals, towns and villages, glaciers and bird cliffs along the way, as well as becoming acquainted with Greenlandic culture and the Arctic scenery. The ship's itinerary always includes an informative tour of each town, but it is also possible to book additional excursions. In the villages you'll be welcomed by howling sled-dogs and traditional Greenlandic hospitality, for example at a kaffemik in the village hall.<BR><BR>
Depending on which cruise you choose, you can also enjoy a quiet sail along the Kangerlussuaq fjord which, at 180 km, is one of the longest in the world. Or what about a dog-sled trip across a glacier? Or perhaps a trip in a seakayak? The possibilities are almost endless. The adventures are fantastic. Cruises last 4, 5 or 8 days.
