<B><Center><Font Size=+8 face="Univers" Color=#000000>Kangerlussuaq</Font><Font Size=+1 face="Univers" Color=#000000>  -  Experience nature north of the polar circle<P>

</B></Center><Left>Kangerlussuaq is located at the end of the 180 kilometres long Sondre Stromfiord. This location in the inland is the reason why the winter is very cold (down to minus 45 degrees C) and the summer is pleasently warm (up to plus 25 degrees C). You will find arctic tundra climate … and fine weather.<P>

The big, sturdy musk oxen is comfortable in this climate, and roam just outside the town. <Br>
Also the beautifully elegant reindeer and other smaller animals are to be seen near the town.<P>

An enormous icecap covers most of Greenland …! You can get to it if you want; either with helicopter or with   jeep from Kangerlussuaq. Experience the staggering nature and the characteristic sounds of the ice that radiates force and will-power.<Br>
The jeep-tour is not recommended for people with back problems.<Br>
  <Br>
Get a relaxing and stimulating swim in Greenland's only in-door svimming-pool after a hard day's work. <Br>
Or try playing golf on the World's northernmost 18 hole international approved golf course on a sandy area.<Br>
Or go bowling at the former American military base.<Br>
Use the newly renovated auditorium with a capability of 270 people.<Br>
