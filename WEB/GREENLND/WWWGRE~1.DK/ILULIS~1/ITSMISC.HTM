A GREENLANDIC FAMILY</A></FONT><P>

The tour for those who want to obtain an insight into the everyday life of a Greenlandic hunter’s family. Experience the local culture at first hand and try living like one of the local inhabitants. Our host families are very hospitable and you will get involved in everything from “coffee-mik” or “dance-mik” to hunting seals or picking berries. If you wish you can join a family on its summer hunting expedition and live in a tent or house in one of our deserted villages which are very much in use during the summer. All our host families speak Danish and live in one of the municipality’s four villages. <BR>
We take care of all necessities with regard to transport to and from the village, the guide will present you to the family and you are then free to enjoy your stay from 1 - 14 days.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="house">VILLAGE HOLIDAY IN YOUR
OWN HOUSE</A></FONT><P>

If you are seriously thinking of getting away from it all for a delightful holiday on your own initiative in delightful surroundings, this is for you. You will live in your own house in the now deserted village of Appat ( formerly the colony Ritenbenk ) which has a really beautiful location on the sheltered west side of Arveprinsens Ejland. Here you will have plenty of opportunities to ply all your interests: Fishing, hunting ( with guide ), botany, ornithology ( Appat is close to one of the famous bird cliffs in Greenland ), geology, hiking, sailing ( with guide ) and so on. You will also have to buy your daily necessities before leaving Ilulissat and do everything for yourself, cooking, washing and the like under rather primitive conditions. There is one permanent summer resident at Appat, the fishery supervisor, and he will naturally help you with dingy transport around the area, he is also in radio contact with the outside world.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="polar">EXPERIENCE GREENLAND DURING THE POLAR NIGHT</A></FONT><P>

A different tour to Greenland where you experience the polar night and the Northern Lights, moonshine!  The polar night at llulissat lasts from November 20th to January 13th.  But it is not dark all day long as on a clear day here there is about 4 hours of daylight in the middle of the day.<BR>
    The sun returns on January 13th and the schools close on that day as well as some shops and many people from town go out to Holms Hill where at 12.47 it is possible to see the sun for a few minutes (if not cloudy).  Naturally, the sun is welcomed with songs and delight!  As the town itself lies in the shadow of the mountains it takes several weeks before it is visible from the town itself.<BR>
  The Northern Lights are visible from September to March. It is also possible to spend New Year’s eve at Ilulissat, which is a really special experience because it is celebrated twice.  In Denmark it is celebrated at 8 p.m. (4 hours' difference of time) and then again at the Greenlandic New Year at midnight.<BR>

If you would like a specially entertaining evening at your hotel after dinner, we can arrange for 8 - 12 Greenlandic folk-dancers o perform in their beautiful national costumes. Folk-dancing originally came to Greenland with the European - and particularly Scottish - whalers as early as the 17th century. The people of Greenland adopted these entertaining dances and still dance folk-dances on special occasions. The dancers perform various dances for about an hour with a short break<BR>

Tour number:   JAV 43.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="choir">GREENLANDIC CHOIR EVENING</A></FONT><P>

This is highly entertaining and the choir has members of all ages with both men and women in national costume.<BR>

Tour number:  JAV 44.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
<A NAME="drum">MASK AND DRUM DANCE</A></FONT><P>

The drum dance was formerly of great significance in small communities, in the Thule area and in East Greenland as internal quarrels were decided with the help of drum dances and satirical songs. Today drum dances are only performances, but they are still very entertaining. Drum dances can be arranged in connection with dinner at your hotel - or in connection with other arrangements outside town. The drum dancer starts by making himself up while he talks about the significance of the drum dance.<BR>

Tour number:  JAV 45.<P>



<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="kayak">KAYAK DEMONSTRATION</A></FONT><P>

  We arrange kayak demonstrations for larger groups and in connection with docking of cruise ships. <BR>
    The Greenlandish kayak is a flimsy vessel comprising a wooden frame covered with watertight sealskin. The kayak has been of basic significance as a vessel for hunting and travelling for thousands of years. Today, the kayak is only used in the original way in a few places in Greenland, but there is a great deal of interest for maintaining the traditions and skills today, so there are  many kayak clubs in Greenland whose members enjoy giving demonstrations and the money they earn in this way is used to further the aims of their clubs.<P>


Information on arrangements.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>	Demonstration in Kirkebugten with 3-5 kayaks, duration approximately one hour.
<LI>	Five kayaks or more paddle out to meet a cruise ship, and give a demonstration around the ship.

</UL>

Tour number:  JAV46.<P>



<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="barbecue">BARBECUE</A></FONT><P>

Experience a genuine Greenlandish barbecue<BR>

There is an old tradition in Greenland for people to congregate out of doors to prepare the season’s bag. We are pleased that we can now offer our guests this very special experience in collaboration with Ilulissat Women’s Association.<BR>
    The tour starts at the tourist office or the hotel.  We then fetch our “Greenlandish cooks”  and together walk to the mountain where we find a suitable place. We help to find fuel after which the season’s specialities are prepared. Depending on the catch of the day before we can offer: seal meat, whale meat, dried meat, fresh fish, dried strips of halibut, ammasatter and so on.  Finally there is coffee or tea.<BR>
      After about three hours it is time to say goodbye to our hosts. We will be fetched by the tourist office and driven home.<BR>

Tour number:    JAV47.<P>




<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="national">GREENLAND'S NATIONAL DAY,

Greenland’s national day on 21 June is a holiday in Greenland and festivities are held in towns and villages throughout the country. The national day is the longest day of the year - here in the land of the midnight sun it is the day when the sun is highest at midnight.<BR>
