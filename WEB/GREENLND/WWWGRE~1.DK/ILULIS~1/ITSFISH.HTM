During the period when the sea outside Ilulissat is frozen and the ice is safe (normally January to April) you can experience one of the things Ilulissat is known for: fishing with a long line for halibut through holes in the ice.
The long line system was developed especially for fishing in this area and you will be surprised to see how ingenious - yet simple - it is.<BR>
You will drive with a fisherman on a dog sledge to the fishing ground close to the town. The fisherman will already have laid out his lines on the previous day and must now draw them in. This is done with a special winch as the line is several hundred metres long. Then he must tend the line and put new bait on the many books and let out the line again. This will be a question of teamwork between you and the fisherman and you will feel the excitement as the catch is drawn up from the deep. Beside halibut, catfish, dab and ray are also often caught.<BR>
      Immediately after the hooks are drawn in and the catch removed, new bait must be put on the hooks so they are ready for the line to be let out again.
      Once the lines have been laid, the catch is put on board the sledge and you return to town where you will take part in selling the fish. You will be given a couple of fish to take back to the hotel where the cook can prepare them for your dinner. The freshest fish in the world from the world’s cleanest waters!<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="visit">VISIT THE FISHING GROUNDS ON THE ICE FJORD</A></FONT><P>
     On this dog sledge tour you will obtain an insight into the everyday life of the Ilulissat fisherman. You will drive with one of our experienced sledge drivers along the fishermen’s sledge tracks towards Ilulissat Ice Fjord. The route will depend on the time of year and the condition of the ice, but the tour will typically be as follows:<BR>
        The sledge tracks pass through varying ,mountain terrain where you must get off the sledge now and the walk up the hills and the other way around you must hold on tight when you go downhill at top speed. You will probably meet fishermen on their way home, sledges loaded down with cargoes of halibut. On route there will be a halt at Kataattoq, a lookout point from where there is a magnificent view across Ilulissat Ice Fjord. The tour continues towards Aallaaniarfik where there is a hut close to the ice itself.
      Down on the ice you continue in this fantastic landscape created by frozen ice floes and icebergs until you arrive at one of the many fishing grounds. There will be a suitable rest so that you can see how the fisherman work with the long line trying for halibut and the conditions they work under.<BR>
      The tour back to town may be along the same sledge tracks or another way depending on the driver’s choice.<BR>

Tour number: JAV25.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="experience">EXPERIENCE THE ICE FJORD                    
FISHING - TWO DAY TOUR</A></FONT><P>

During the period when the sea outside Ilulissat is frozen and the ice is safe (normally January to April) you can experience one of the things llulissat is known for: fishing with a long line for halibut through holes in the ice in “the world's hardest workplace” - llulissat Ice Fiord.<BR>
You will drive with a fisherman on a dog sledge over the mountains and out onto the ice fjord itself which, although rigorous, is also a very beautiful place to work.  Before work begins the dogs must be parked, and tied to the ice.  A tent is erected over the sledge so you can go in here for a little warmth, some tea and food.<BR>
The fisherman will already have laid out his lines on the previous day and must now draw them up, tend them and put new bait on the many hooks and let them out again.  The fiord is 700 - 800  metres deep here so it takes some time to draw up the
line with a special winch.  You and the fisherman will work as a team and you will feel the excitement as the catch is drawn up from the deep. Beside halibut, catfish, dab and ray are also often caught.  You will also be able to enjoy the fantastic landscape created  by the icebergs.<BR>
After the hooks are drawn in and the catch removed, new bait must be put on the hooks so they are ready for the line to be let out again for next day's catch. The fish must now be gutted before being laid on the ice to freeze them.
When the lines have been let out again, the work is finished and it is time for dinner and more tea made on the primus.  You can play cards and tell stories in the tent until it is time to go to sleep on the reindeer skins which are on the sledge, Be prepared for the fact that there is not much room in a sledge tent, but it is cosy. lce fjord fishermen are always on the alert for noises from the ice as the ice fjord can break rapidly and someone must always stay awake. The dogs are also tied in such a way as to be ready for a move if the ice should suddenly break up.  This happens rarely, however, and if it should happen the fishermen know exactly what to do, so their orders must be followed.<BR>
Next day the lines must be tended again and then you will return home along the sledge tracks over the mountains to the town.  This is a rather rigorous tour as the sledge is now loaded so you will have to walk by the sledge up all hills.  Back in town the fish are sold - and the guest will be given a couple of fish to take back to the hotel where after a welcome hot bath - you will be able to enjoy “your” catch for dinner and enjoy looking back on the many things you experienced during the tour.<BR>

TROUT FISHING AT ILIMANAQ 
WITH LOCAL FISHERMAN</A>
</FONT><P>
<STRONG><EM>Day 1:</EM></STRONG><BR>
     Arrival at Ilulissat. Briefing from Ilulissat Tourist service at the youth hostel. Discussion of the fishing trip’s route and possibilities. Buying provisions and collecting such equipment as sleeping bags, fishing tackle, primus and tents etc. from the tourist office. You can also have a helicopter trip to the inland ice, DKK 975 per person. <BR>The helicopter trip is not included in the package price.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 2:</EM></STRONG><BR>
    You will be fetched from the place you are staying and driven by bus to the place of departure. The adventure starts here. The boat first passes the enormous icebergs in the Ice Fjord, they are of countless different shapes and sizes and really beautiful.
We sail slowly past them so that you can take photographs, or simply enjoy looking at them. On route there is a good chance of spotting seals, whales and different birds.<BR>
     Later in the afternoon we arrive at Ilimanaq where you will meet your guide for the trip to Tasiusaq. Together you sail on to Itilliup Illua where you go ashore. Walk to Tasersuaq lake. This takes roughly 1 - 1½ hours. we sail across the lake in the local community’s dinghy to the other side. from Tasersuaq we go down Kiakkusuk towards Tasiusaq and sail from here to the area where we will fish for trout. Spend the night in a tent in beautiful surroundings close to the outlet of a river.<P>
<STRONG>
<EM>Day 3:</EM></STRONG><BR>
    After breakfast we take up our fishing rods and fish up the river while listening to its peaceful murmur. Towards evening we will clean the trout, a delicious fish which can be prepared in many different ways. We spend the rest of the evening looking around for other interesting places where we can fish next day. We may smoke some of our catch.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 4:</EM></STRONG><BR>
   Today we go up towards the inland ice with our fishing rods and other necessities. You can fish for trout in most of the lakes. There is also a formidable view towards the inland ice. Fishing for trout in fantastically beautiful surroundings. We enjoy the peace and quiet, take a break and spend some time photographing some of the world’s most delightful scenery.
 Towards evening we walk back to camp.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 5:</EM></STRONG><BR>
     We put out nets early in the morning. We learn how the local fishermen catch trout and how to tend the net. While we wait for the catch we can go on fishing with rods. We clean the fish before continuing on to Ilimanaq, sailing slowly past small icebergs and enjoying the journey with its many small bays and lofty mountains. We walk past Kiakkinaq and sail over to Tasersuaq after which we go to the boat which takes you back to Ilimanaq.  Spend the night here.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 6:</EM></STRONG><BR>
     Spend the morning looking around Ilimanaq. The village’s name means “the place of expectations” and by this is meant the expectation of catches ( animals, birds, etc. ). 60 - 70 people live here by fishing and hunting. Village life is peaceful and you will find relaxing easy. This is also a good opportunity to be come aquatinted with some of the locals. Pay a visit to the shop which, like all village shops is a centre for communication. <BR>
     Later in the afternoon we return by boat to Ilulissat where you will be fetched by the Tourist Service bus and driven to the youth hostel. The rest of the day could be spent by taking a look around Ilulissat. We could also take a walk around and visit the house where Knud Rasmussen was born, now a museum, and our beautiful Zion Church or a pleasant walk out to Sermermiut,  the 4.000 year old Inuit settlement with a fantastic panorama of the Ice Fjord. You could also simply enjoy the scenery and mull over the events of the past few days.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 7:</EM></STRONG><BR>

      Transfer to the airport. Departure for Copenhagen via Kangerlussuaq. We hope that you have memories and experiences in your luggage enough to enjoy them for the rest of your life.<BR>

		
Tour number: JAV32.<P>



<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="appat">TROUT FISHING - APPAT</A></FONT><P>

Experience nature at first hand with trout fishing and hunting in this eldorado for those who love the great outdoors. We visit a deserted village where the former shop and manager's house has been turned into a camp school and is used as accommodation. There is a VHF radio, a motor boat and a local supervisor who can supply advice and guidance and there is naturally a guide throughout the tour.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 1:</EM></STRONG><BR>
	Arrival at Ilulissat	where you will be accommodated at our youth hostel.  Ilulissat Tourist Service will then introduce you to the area and show you around town and talk about old and new at Ilulissat. This includes paying a visit to the house where Knud Rasmussen was born and to our beautiful Zion Church.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 2:</EM></STRONG><BR>
You will be fetched from the youth hostel and we drive you to the harbour where the adventure begins.  You now sail in the waters of Disko Bay between icebergs, which are thousands of years old, north-wards to your destination, Appat.  You have a chance of seeing both whales and seals on the route.  You arrive at Appat after 4-6 hours - travelling time depends on whether there is any hunting or fishing on the way.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 3:</EM></STRONG><BR>
The day is spent in exploring the area and looking for suitable places to fish, you can use your own judgement or consult those who are familiar with the area.  You sail around the island studying fauna and flora and enjoying the beautiful scenery.
There will be plenty of time to do a spot of fishing today.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 4:</EM></STRONG><BR>
Now we go fishing in earnest. After breakfast you will probably be anticipating what today's programme has to offer.  We can fish for trout in a sixman boat with oars and a motor for example.  The catch must be cleaned and we hope to be able to enjoy the result of the mornings efforts at lunch. After lunch we sail over to our enormous bird cliff and enjoy the scenery while watching birds and icebergs, we may even see whales and seals. Towards evening we can go fishing again.<P>

	
<STRONG><EM>Day 5:</EM></STRONG><BR>
	Today we go seal hunting and the joy of the chase is enhanced by the delightful surroundings. We	 hunt seals between the icebergs with their many different sizes and shapes which 	reflect the sun's rays in a wonderful array of colours.	Hopefully we will bag a seal which must be skinned and prepared after the day’s hunting. So the day should be rounded off with a culinary climax. You will witness that nothing of the seal is wasted,	 everything is used. We will salt the skin and take it home and perhaps you would like to send it to be tanned. A terrific souvenir from your hunting experience 350 kilometres north of the polar circle.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 6:</EM></STRONG><BR>
You can spend the whole day fishing. We can also try long line fishing for halibut if you would like to. You will sail out on a smaller cutter, fishing and exploring. Like trout, halibut is delicious and can be prepared in many different ways. 
After fishing we return to the camp.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 7:</EM></STRONG><BR>
This is the day your boat returns you to Ilulissat, civilisation and a much-needed bath and whatever else you have given up during the past week. You can have your film developed so that you will be able to relive the journey in pictures the next day.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 8:</EM></STRONG><BR>
     The many experiences of the tour will be rounded off by an exciting helicopter trip to the Ilulissat Glacier, the eighth wonder of the world. The glacier produces about 20 million ton of ice a day, corresponding to New York’s total annual water consumption ! We fly over the ice fjord, round the icebergs and you can see for yourself  why this area is known as “the place where the mountains sail”. 
This exceptional trip lasts about an hour.<BR>
     In the afternoon we will walk to Sermermiut at the outlet of the ice fjord.
Here the “giants” lie around. the guide will talk about the 4.000 year of history of Inuit culture. We look at the remains of the former winter and the kitchen midden and ancient Inuit graves.<P>

<STRONG><EM>Day 9:</EM></STRONG><BR>
    You will be fetched and driven to the airport. We hope that you have memories and experiences in your luggage enough to enjoy them for the rest of your life.<BR>
