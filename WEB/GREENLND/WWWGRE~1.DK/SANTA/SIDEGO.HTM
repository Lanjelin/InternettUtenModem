Congratulations with a magnicifant and world class idea and award! And may I say, an apt award for an extraordinary human being, Nelson Mandela!<P>
A man who has to deliver so much in terms of of the dreams, hopes and expectations of his nation and it's newly founded democracy which places Mr. Mandela in the role of a super political Santa Claus.<P>
South Africa is indeed a country with exciting potential in very many ways but yes, we also have a sad history of broken dreams. We are now picking up the pieces and are hard at work rebuilding and reconstructing - a major challenge.<P>
I'm sure that this "Santa of the Year Award" will serve as an incentive and encouragement for our "Super Santa" and his team and our ordinary citizens back home where we are particularly concerned about the future of our millions of underprivileged children. To demonstrate his commitment to these neglected children, Mr. Mandela started a fund towards which he makes a monthly contribution from his own salary.<P>
While the first recipient of this award is a South African, the theme of the Santa Claus making dreams come true, is universal.<P>
On behalf of Mr. Mandela and all South Africans, I want to express the wish that this unique award would go a long way to renew the focus of our world on the hopes and aspirations of the underprivileged, underfed and oppresssed and their plight for a dignified life - a dream that evaded many South Africans for such a long time.<P>
Your Santa Claus Summit, attended by these white bearded ambassadors of joy (where are the ladies?) is held just at a time when the world is celebrating the 50 years of the United nations - with many questions being asked about it's effectiveness.<P>
As far as I know there has never been any doubt about the effectiveness and constructive role of Santa spirited people and organisations.<P>
<STRONG>May the gesture of this award of goodwill by the small, warm, arctic nation of Greenland be one of the greatest gifts to a world which is starving for joy and happiness.</STRONG><P>
