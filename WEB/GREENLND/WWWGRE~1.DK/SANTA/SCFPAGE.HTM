<STRONG>The mythical figure of Santa Claus is symbolic of the ideals that we strive to teach our children, the ability to give, to listen, and to care without expecting anything in return.<BR>

No one represents our hopes for peace and harmony between nature and mankind better than Santa Claus and his environment.<P>
That's why Santa Claus lives in Greenland near the North Pole. The ideals of Santa reflect the people and culture of the Greenland nation.<P>
A nation that has never been at war and whose inhabitants are open and friendly, living in close harmony with nature in one of the most unspoiled places on earth.<P>
A nation that is proud to have the responsibility of looking after Santa Claus.</STRONG><P>

The purpose of the foundation is to preserve the myth of Santa Claus and his close ties to Greenland and the arctic environment.<p>
We endeavour to promote and safeguard the positive messages and values of Santa Claus and his ties to Greenland for the entertainment and benefit of children all over the world.<p>
More than ever the welfare of children and social and environment issues are the global focus of concern for a better focus.<p>
It is the aspiration of Greenland to contribute to this future by safeguarding the ideals and values of the true Santa Claus and promoting these in a positive and entertaining way to the children. You might say, that this represents Greenlands gift for the children.<p>
The proceeds of our commercial activities are used to make Santa's dream for children in need come true. The Foundation supports charity programmes for homeless children throughout the world. Our contribution is co-ordinated with The Danish Association for International Co-operation (In Danish: Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke).<p>
