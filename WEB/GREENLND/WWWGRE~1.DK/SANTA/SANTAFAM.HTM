<STRONG>Santa Claus lives with his family and his helpers somewhere in Greenland. Nobody know exactly where. He has chosen to live in Greenland because he loves the magnificent scenery and the tranquillity of the clean and unspoilt environment in Greenland.</STRONG>


<P>One of Santa's favourites things is snow and that's why he thinks Greenland is the nicest place on earth

<P>It is very difficult to find Santa's world. It is a vast, secluded area on the inland ice-cap, which is divided from our world by an invisible, magical boundary. To enter Santa's world you have to first find this distant place. Then you have to possess the secret formula to cross the magic boundary, which keeps people who don't have the true Christmas spirit from entering and harming Santa's home. All children possess this secret formula deep inside their imagination and that is why all children can cross the boundary. A few grown-ups can too.. if they make a special effort.

<P>Santa' s world is incredibly beautiful and magical. Everything is finely balanced with nature, so in a way you could say that it was an ecological world. Santa Claus isn't interested in politics, but he is an infinitely wise man and the way that he has established his kingdom and home reflects his great wisdom and insight. The principles he lives by are everlasting principles which others could learn much from.<BR>

<P>Unfortunately Santa Claus's worst enemy, who he calls The Christmas Hater, an unsavoury character called Blackstone, has discovered the secret formula for crossing the magic boundary. Blackstone and his reckless accomplices, Slick and Wigsy, two renegade trolls, only have one thing in mind. To destroy Santa's world and steal the presents meant for the children. Santa Claus and his helpers have to be on their guard the whole time to stop Blackstone from fulfilling his dream.

<P>Even though Blackstone and his wicked henchmen who would do anything to plague Santa and his world, it never really comes to a violent confrontation between the two sides. It usually stops at annoying antics and stupid, moronic stunts which are typical of the 'bad guys', and in the end they always fall back on themselves.
<P>
<P>Santa's world is a wonderful place to live. Even though it is far in the north of Greenland, it isn't a cold place. The many inhabitants of Santa's world are all different and have their own characteristics, which time and time again cause little conflicts to arise, that have to be resolved by Santa Claus. 
<P>
<P>Deep down inside they are sincere and very kind, and they all have one thing in common. the playful imagination of a child, which makes them able to dance, play, laugh and fantasise. 
<P>
<P>Santa's family lives with him in his fantastic house, which is really more like a castle, built by Santa himself and inspired by him many journeys round the world delivering presents.

<P>Santas family consists of Maya, his wife, Julian and Julia, his children. His brother Clyde looks after Santas post-office or tries to anyway. Mostly he thinks about how he would run things if he was Santa Clyde instead of Santa Claus.
<P>
<P>Santa also has a wonderful greenhouse where Stanley the Gardener, who is Santa's uncle grow the most wonderful vegetables to eat and beautiful flowers and plants to brighten up the castle. The castle and greenhouse are heated mostly by solar energy, but isn't shining Santa has built two huge windmills which provide energy for the castle generator.
<P>
<P>Staccato is Santa's other uncle and he is totally different from Stanley. He is the toy-factory foreman and makes sure that the presents are ready in time for them to be loaded onto Santas sleigh on Christmas Eve. 
<P>
<P>There are of course many Christmas elves, who help Santa all the time. You will meet them soon. 
<P>
<P>And of course Santa and his family have many animal friends from polar bears to seals and whales and naturally Rudolph and his team of reindeer.

<P>Santa also has many friends in Greenland. He often travels round to meet them and check on all the animals. During his journeys in Greenland he is often helped by the Inuit children, who love seeing Santa and helping him.
<P>
<P>Santa Claus and his family love their life in Greenland and even though they are busy preparing for Christmas, there is always time for a little adventure and some fun and games.
