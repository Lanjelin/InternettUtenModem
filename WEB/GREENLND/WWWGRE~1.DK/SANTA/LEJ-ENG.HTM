<HR>
<EM><BR>Dear Santa Delegates
<BR>Dear fellow Greenlanders
<BR>Dear fellow citizens of the world, who have retained the inner joy of childhood and faith in the message of Christmas.</EM>

<P>It is a great joy for me as the first representative for the real Santa, who we all know lives on the icecap here in Greenland, to disclose the international humanitarian "Santa of the Year Award".

<P>It is the first time that "The Santa Claus of Greenland Foundation"  gives away this new award, which in the spirit of Christmas, has the aim in preserving and promoting the true messages and values of Santa Claus for the benefit and entertainment of the children world-wide.

<P>Christmas time is time for families to come together, and a time where children become the centre of the world. Christmas and Santa Claus belongs, first and foremost, to the child. It is in the sparkling eyes of the child that the reality of Christmas is lit.

<P>Santa Claus has therefore entrusted The Santa Claus of Greenland Foundation to help children in the world who suffer. It must help the children who - even in our modern times - must live their lives without a home.

<P>The Santa Claus of Greenland Foundation has decided through this award to find those who can ensure that the wish to help children can be suitably supported. Those awarded are those who - through their own life and example  - have proven that believing in the good nature of man and love for life itself is able to outlast anything.  Recipients who - just like Santa - believes in dedicating his life to the benefit of others and to strive to ensure children a free and secure life, regardless of the color of their skin, religion or conviction.

<P>There is one such person on this planet who especially live up to this dignified position and who have gained respect from all of us.

<P>A person who, despite suppression, abuse and endless years of incarceration have retained his faith in freedom - kept faith in the good nature of man.

<P>A person whose love for children best can be explained through his own words:


<P>"In fact, I love to play with children and chat with them; it has always 
<BR>been one of the things that makes me feel most at peace"  

<BR><EM>(Long Walk to Freedom p. 121)</EM>

<P>and whose positive relation to Christmas also can be depicted through his own words, as in the following;

<P>"What Sundays were to the rest of the week, Christmas was to the
<BR>rest of the year. It was the one day on which the authorities showed
<BR>any goodwill towards men. We did not have to go to the quarry on
<BR>Christmas Day, and we were permitted to purchase a small quantity
<BR>of sweets. We did not have a traditional Christmas meal, but we
<BR>were given an extra mug of coffee for supper."   

<BR><EM>('Long Walk to Freedom', p. 538-39)</EM>

<P>Dear friends of Christmas - on behalf of The Santa Claus of Greenland Foundation I hereby present this annual award to a person who have retained his love to both children and Christmas despite 28 years of unjust incarceration!

<P><STRONG>South African President Nelson Mandela!</STRONG><P>
