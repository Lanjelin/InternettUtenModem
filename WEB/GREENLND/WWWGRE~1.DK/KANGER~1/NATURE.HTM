There is an abundance of fauna in Kangerlussuaq, where reindeer, musk oxen, arctic foxes, alpine hare, grouse, gerfalcon and peregrine falcon can all be seen as well as a large assortment of various small birds: snow bunting, Lapland bunting, white siskin or aberdevine, Hornemann's or hoary redpoll, red-necked phalarope, wheatear, raven, white-fronted goose, mallard, great northern diver (common loon), red-throated diver and many more. The fjord is home to the fjord or Greenland cod and a type of trout called char.<P>

During your stay in Kangerlussuaq, you will most likely see both reindeer and musk oxen. Today, we have around 3,000 reindeer in the area. The reindeer is in a natural period of decline owing to a shortage of reindeer moss. Until the beginning of the 1970s, there were no fewer than 40,000 or so reindeer in the area.<P>

The countryside around Kangerlussuaq is very green during the summer, with a rich flora. More than 200 species have been recorded, for instance: the large-flowered rosebay or French willow, which is the national flower of Greenland, bluebell, arctic rhododendron, marsh tea, dryas or mountain avens, cinquefoil, thorny saxifrage, dwarf willow, birch, cotton-grass and many more. There are also crowberries, cowberries and especially many bilberries (blueberries) in August. In addition, there are many edible fungi such as field mushrooms, boletus and puffballs.<P>

<H2>Musk Oxen</H2>

Nowhere else in Greenland are the musk oxen so plentiful as in Kangerlussuaq. Today, we have about 3,500 musk oxen. The musk ox stock in the area originally stems from a stock from north-east Greenland. In 1962 and 1965, 27 yearling calves from north-east Greenland were released in Angujartorfiup Nunaa; these have since multiplied prolifically, thanks to the fine growing conditions here in the fjord.<P>

Since 1989, the stock of musk oxen has grown so large that it is safe for commercial hunters from Maniitsoq and the Municipality of Sisimiut to hunt down a number of animals annually. In 1995, the quota was 600 beasts, and that same year 38 musk oxen were awarded to trophy-hunters by Greenland's Home Rule. In recent years, calves from the stock at Kangerlussuaq have also been relocated to other areas of west Greenland.<P>

<H2>Don't get close to the Musk Oxen</H2>
<A HREF="5MOSKUS.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/kangerlussuaq/5moskus.jpg"> <IMG SRC="5MOSKUS-.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/kangerlussuaq/5moskus-.jpg" ALT="Photo of a musk oxen" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=100 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=1></A>
Musk oxen are generally very peaceable animals as long as they aren't provoked. For your own sake, you should give musk oxen a wide berth, especially a herd with small calves, as they are capable of attacking in self-defence if they feel threatened. You will normally be given a warning in the form of heavy snorting if the animal feels you are getting too close. As a final warning, the ox will rub away the hair around its eyes with one of its forelegs. Things can really go amiss if you get too close and ignore all the warning signals. The musk ox can accelerate rapidly, and can therefore attack at great speed. So don't forget that the musk ox is a wild animal, entitled to be left in peace! Keep out of its attacking distance, which is more than 30-40 metres.<P>

<H2>Climate and Temperature</H2>

Kangerlussuaq has a typical continental climate owing to its great distance from the open sea. That makes for dry, warm summers with temperatures of up to 18-20°C, but conversely cold winters with temperatures that can drop right down to -50°C. (Coming: Chart of average temperatures, etc.)<P>

From end-November to mid-June, the fjord freezes over. Not nearly as much snow falls in Kangerlussuaq as in coastal towns. The sun ducks below the horizon on November 22nd and re-emerges, radiantly, on January 22nd, after an absence of precisely 2 months. From mid-April to mid-August, it is light 24 hours a day, but because of the mountains, there is no midnight sun.<P>

<H2>Mosquitoes</H2>

It should be pointed out that during the period from roughly June 1st to August 31st there are lots of mosquitoes in Greenland, especially in Kangerlussuaq.<P>

So it's a useful idea to take along mosquito nets and similar devices. Anti-mosquito spray and mosquito repellent can also be bought in the shop.<P>
