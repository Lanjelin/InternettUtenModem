<H2>Hiking and Biking in the Kangerlussuaq area</H2>

<H3>There are many excellent alternatives for hiking and bicycle trips, as there are several kilometres of road, tarmacked and gravelled.</H3>

<HR>

<H2>The Port and Kellyville, approx. 18 km either way</H2>

From the airport area, you can walk or cycle out to the fjord estuary, where the port and the scientific Kellyville Institute are located. The road to the port is tarmacked and passes through magnificent, hilly countryside. On foot, the trip takes about 3 hours each way, or about 1 hour by bike, depending how fit you are! Kellyville was founded in 1982 with the main aim of studying the northern lights, the outer atmosphere and the ozone layer.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Lake Ferguson and The Rowing Club - approx. 5 km either way</H2>

From the airport area, you can walk or cycle to Lake Ferguson, which is the reservoir for Kangerlussuaq.
The Rowing Club is set amid very scenic surroundings, on the shores of the 7 km-long lake.
While out walking or cycling, you may be lucky enough to see reindeer and musk oxen, which often graze near the area backing onto the lake and the Rowing Club. Don't forget your camera.<P>

Following the gravel track by foot, the walk either way will take about 1 hour, by bike about 1/2 hour.<P>

The Rowing Club was founded in 1961, and from May to September the Rowing Club is generally let as a restaurant.
This is a place to enjoy the fine view and the good food.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Black Ridge - approx. 5 km either way</H2>

If you wish to see the inland ice (the ice cap), the sea and the Kangerlussuaq region from a height, you can take a walk to Black Ridge, where there is an impressive view of the entire region from the Radar House. If you're lucky, there may also be reindeer and musk oxen nearby.<P>

From the Radar House, you can follow the path that climbs to the old Tacan, a landing radar installation dating back to the American era. From there, you will also have a splendid view of the hinterland. The path is gravelled, and the walk either way takes roughly 1-2 hours.<P>

<HR>

<H2>The Golf Course - approx. 2 km either way</H2>
<A HREF="GOLFBANE.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/kangerlussuaq/golfbane.jpg"> <IMG SRC="GOLFBAN-.JPG" tppabs="http://www.greenland-guide.dk/kangerlussuaq/golfban-.jpg" ALT="Kangerlussuaq Golf Course" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=99 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=1></A>
If you feel like nothing more than a short stroll, there is one route taking approx. 1/2 hour either way. This is the walk to the golf course, the world's northernmost internationally approved 18-hole golf course, located on a sandy plain right alongside the stream.<P>
Golf equipment can be hired from the Golf Club building on a self-service basis should you want to play.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Sugar Loaf - approx. 7 km either way</H2>

If, after passing the golf course, you feel up to a longer walk, carry on along the gravel path alongside the stream, which will take you right in towards the inland ice. As the name implies, Sugar Loaf is a mountain reminiscent of an old-fashioned sugar loaf. The path inland to Sugar Loaf is a gravel track and also makes a nice bicycle trip in the summer.<P>

Once you have reached Sugar Loaf, you can walk up the mountainside until the path ends. From here, you can sit and enjoy the fine view and the peace and calm of nature. On foot, the trip will take about 1 1/2 hours either way; by bike, about 1/2 hour either way.<P>

On your stroll, a few cars will most likely pass and turn off to the left at Sugar Loaf. These are merely motorists heading for the inland ice.<P>

<HR>

<H2>The Inland Ice - approx. 25 km either way</H2>

This hike takes its toll and is a full day's walk, though it is definitely the most imposing walk of all and worth every last ounce of physical exertion. On a good summer's day, the hike to the inland ice is a manageable prospect, as the entire path is readily accessible. If you have only a short time to spare, you can make the trip back again the same day, but the walk does call for good leg muscles. However, the ideal solution is to  spend a few days there with a tent and sleeping bag, if you have the chance. Follow the path eastwards from the airport area, past Sugar Loaf on the north side. From here, follow the wheel ruts towards the inland ice. Do remember warm top clothing, as it is cooler at the inland ice.<P>

One thing is certain: you will be surprised to see the tall inland ice at a height of about 50-70 metres and the power that it radiates. The rest is up to you to experience and sense.<P>

Remember to observe the safety signs, as the inland ice can calve at any time! And whatever you do, don't walk on the wet, sandy surfaces as these may be quicksand.<P>

Don't try to cross the stream, either, because of quicksand and the strong current. On your way back, take the lower car track which passes American aircraft wrecks. People who are fit will manage the walk to the inland ice and back in about 8 hours, not counting a short stop at the ice. Apart from activities under your own steam, there are many attractive tours organized by Kangerlussuaq Tourism. See the "Programme for the Week" at Kangerlussuaq Tourism's Information Desk in the airport building.<P>

<H2>Readily accessible coastal towns</H2>

If you fancy seeing more of the towns while you are in Kangerlussuaq, you actually have a chance to broaden your knowledge of Greenland, as there are daily departures with Greenlandair throughout the summer to Nuuk, Sisimiut, Ilulissat, Maniitsoq and Kulusuk, etc.<P>
