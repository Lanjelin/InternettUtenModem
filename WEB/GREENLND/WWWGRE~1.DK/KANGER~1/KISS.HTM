<H2><A NAME="location">Location and Background</A></H2>
A new initiative has been taken by the Greenland Home Rule Government in
order to stimulate and attract international research interests in Arctic
science. This has materialised into a new facility at the Kangerlussuaq
Airport: Kangerlussuaq International Science Support, or shortened as
"KISS".<P>

Kangerlussuaq is located just north of the Arctic Circle on the Greenland
West coast. It lies at the head of the 140 km long fjord Kangerlussuaq; in
Greenlandic "big fjord". The climate is continental and quite xeric with an
annual precipitation averaging 120 mm; winter temperature reaches down to
-50 C and in summer the temperature increases to above +20 C.<P>

Kangerlussuaq is the main hub for air traffic to and within Greenland with
regular direct international connections to and from Copenhagen (Denmark),
Keflavik (Iceland), and Ottawa (Canada).<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="basis for science">Basis for Science</A></H2>
Kangerlussuaq has a long tradition as an important base for fielding
geophysical and glaciological research projects, but so far the region has
had only limited activities within the life science disciplines. The area
lies on the edge of the Polar Cap Zone and the Auroral Zone. It is
therefore of particular interest to scientists studying elements relating
to the ionosphere and the magnetosphere as well as the lower and upper
atmosphere.<P>

The Kangerlussuaq region is within the low Arctic ecozone with diverse
habitats as e.g. salt lakes, dune systems, mountain tundra and steppes with
caribou and muskox populations. Caribou are indigenous but muskoxen were
introduced from Northeast Greenland thirty years ago.<P>

The plant growing season is long, featuring 150 days without snow cover, 80
continuously frost-free days, and 150 consecutive days with maximum air
temperature continuously above freezing; (the numbers given are average
values). The climate is very stable and predictable with a monthly mean of
241 sun hours in May through August.<P>

The Kangerlussuaq region is a well exposed high grade basement terrain
forming the southern border zone of the Nagssugtoqidian orogen. The region
has a glacial landscape dating back 8,000 years.<P>

The proximity of the Inland Ice has a significant effect on the climatic
regime for the living resources and further it presents unique logistic
opportunities for studies on the Ice Sheet proper, the edge zone, and
periglacial geomorphology.<P>

KISS and the Kangerlussuaq region is thus the ideal site for field courses
in polar biology, Arctic ecology, geomorphological processes and geology.<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="the concept">The Concept</A></H2>
Scientists and students who plan to work in Greenland now have new and
improved facilities available in Kangerlussuaq. KISS offers an array of
modern facilities and possibilities to rent equipment and goods for use in
the field or in the labs of the KISS building.<P>

The KISS concept creates the general physical framework for scientific work
within the natural sciences. Only basic lab equipment will be available and
each specific project needing specialized equipment should therefore plan
to bring it along or have it shipped up on beforehand.<P>

KISS is owned by The Home Rule Government and operated by the Kangerlussuaq
Airport Management. The handling of all bookings etc. prior to the
researchers' arrival at Kangerlussuaq has been delegated to the Danish
Polar Center. The use of KISS is reserved exclusively for researchers and
research projects registered by the Danish Polar Center pending submission
to the Center of project plans.<P>

It is important to realise that KISS is a year-round facility and that the
Kangerlussuaq region offers obvious research opportunities and potentials
during the 8 winter months. This applies both to projects in biology and
geophysics and the presence of KISS now greatly improves the logistics for
performing field operations in winter and will increase the effectiveness
of your activities as compared to more primitive logistic solutions
hitherto available.<P>

When fully operational KISS will be managed by a logistics co-ordinator who
will maintain an office in the KISS-building and who will be available for
answering questions and solving problems as well as acting as a liaison to
the authorities and institutions in Kangerlussuaq and the rest of
Greenland. Furthermore, the KISS manager will be your contact when you wish
to rent equipment, vehicles, vessels, helicopters and fixed-wing aircrafts
or other services of interest to you and your project. Please request price
list from the manager.<P>

<H2><A NAME="facilities">Facilities</A></H2>
KISS offers year-round modern facilities for researchers in a comfortable
building at a daily fee of 150 DKK. This price is based on the use of own
sleeping bag, linen and towels. Room service (in part or in full) can be
supplied at an additional cost. The 700 m2 accommodation area includes 23
single or double rooms (20m2), kitchen, lounge, laundry, showers and
toilets. At the 700 m2 ground floor there will be access to wet and dry
labs, working rooms, storage rooms, drying room, lounges, kitchens,
workshop, telefax and local and long-distance telephone calls, photocopier,
laser printer, and Internet e-mail. It is possible to establish your own
phone line to existing cabling at your own expense. Use of cellular phones
is also possible. There is space available for specialized equipment or
labs in the building at a nominal cost.<P>

The road system around the airport is quite extensive - for Greenland
standard. Leading East to the edge of the Inland Ice is a 13 km dirt track
drivable for 4x4 vehicles; to the West an asphalt road leads a similar
stretch to the harbour at the fjord. It is worth noting that Kangerlussuaq
is an airport isolated from the coastal towns and hamlets. It does not hold
a traditional Greenlandic society but a population of c. 350 persons
dedicated to run the airport and associated facilities (e.g. KISS).<P>

At the KISS ground floor rooms or office space can be rented on a long-term
basis so you have the opportunity to establish your own project office. The
KISS manager can be hired to handle logistics for projects not physically
present in Kangerlussuaq but which would like to draw on the services
available here.<P>

KISS will be fully operational by summer of 1995. Living quarters, dry
labs, and working rooms, offices and storage rooms will be ready for use in
the spring of 1994 while the wet labs will be available by June 1995. The
interior of the building will have some flexibility allowing for a set-up
of specialised labs.<P>

In the KISS building all rooms and labs are equipped with both 115V and
208V/60Hz outlets.<P>

In Kangerlussuaq you can buy regular, canned or freeze-dried foods, fuels
(jet fuel/kerosene, gasoline, and field stove alcohol). There is also a
post office, an airport hotel with restaurant and cafeteria, a gym center
with swimming pool, a tennis-, badminton-, racket ball- and soft ball
court, a bowling alley, a rowing club,  a non-scientific library, - and
also a small museum with exhibitions about the history of Kangerlussuaq.<P>

Kangerlussuaq also hosts a modern conference center capable of
accommodating up to 250 people. The conference facilities and prices are
very competitive so you should consider placing your next scientific
conference or symposium in Greenland.<P>
