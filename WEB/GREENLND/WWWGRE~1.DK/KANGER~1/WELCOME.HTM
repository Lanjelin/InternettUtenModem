<H1>Welcome to Kangerlussuaq</H1>

<H2>The Gateway to Greenland</H2>

Welcome to Kangerlussuaq, which in Greenlandic means the long fjord. The fjord is 185 km long, with Kangerlussuaq Airport located at the far end, approx. 60 km north of the Polar Circle. For both international and domestic air traffic, Kangerlussuaq is an important hub.<P>

Some 90% of all travellers to, from and within Greenland pass through Kangerlussuaq. Direct connections currently available include SAS' Atlantic route to Copenhagen, FirstAir/Greenlandair's route to Ottawa, Greenlandair's route to Keflavik via Kulusuk and Greenlandair's services to Nuuk (Godth&aring;b), Ilullissat (Jakobshavn), Maniitsoq (Sukkertoppen), Sisimiut (Holsteinsborg) and Kulusuk.<P>

Kangerlussuaq is not like other towns in Greenland. It is an airport area nestling amid scenic surroundings. Administratively speaking, Kangerlussuaq Airport falls outside the municipal divisions of Greenland and is a taxfree zone.<P>
