Paamiut town was founded as a colony in 1742 and is one of Greenland's oldest towns.  About 2,300 people live in Paamiut municipality today, with 2,000 in the town and the rest in the settlement at Arsuk. For many years the economy of both the town and settlement have been based on commercial fishing, although small-scale hunting and fishing have continued to be important.<P>

Tourism in the Paamiut area is still a very new phenomenon which means that the region can offer the visitor an attractive "off the beaten track" destination, especially suited to those who would like to design their own trip with a good deal of independence and with the possibility of experiencing a part of contemporary Greenland which receives relatively little outside contact.<P>

Both Paamiut and Arsuk offer excellent opportunities for hiking or boat trips in beautiful fjord and mountain landscapes wholly untouched by human activity.  Although there is not yet a hiking map available for the area around Paamiut town, the region is readily accessible for both short and long duration hikes. A good deal of the Arsuk fjord area is included in the Ivittuut hiking map. Only a few minutes outside of the settled areas, one finds oneself in a pristine environment which you can enjoy at your own leisure and without a trace of human presence.<P>

For those interested in wildlife, the Paamiut region is well-known for the large number of whales of different species which frequent the local waters, especially in the late summer and autumn. Whale watching trips with a local boat owner are an easily arranged and exciting activity.  Paamiut is also known for the frequency with which one may sight Greenland's largest bird, the majestic Sea Eagle (White-Tailed Eagle).<P>

At the head of the Kvanefjord a few hours' boat trip from Paamiut town, one finds a magnificent glacier reaching down from the inland ice-cap.  Along the way one has an opportunity to enjoy the magnificent scenery, including waterfalls and bird cliffs. There is also a fine iceberg-calving glacier at the head of Arsuk fjord.<P>

Paamiut town has a very attractive old colonial area near the harbor, with a number of well-preserved buildings from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Some of these house the local museum.  Nearby is Paamiut's church, considered by many to be the most attractive in Greenland and somewhat reminiscent of a Norwegian stave-church.  Also worthy of mention is the fine tradition of excellence in handicrafts in the Paamiut area. Of especial note is the skin embroidery and soap-stone carving practiced by many locals.<P>
