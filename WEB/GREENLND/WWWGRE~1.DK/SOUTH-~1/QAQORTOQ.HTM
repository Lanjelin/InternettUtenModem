Originally founded in 1775, Qaqortoq is today South Greenland's largest municipality with a population of more than 3,500, of which about 3,200 live in Qaqortoq town.  The remainder live in the three small settlements Eqalugaarsuit, Qassimiut, and Saarloq, plus at a number of isolated sheep farms.  Qaqortoq town is South Greenland's unofficial capital, and the town serves as a communications, service, educational and 'cultural' center for the region.  As in other South Greenland towns commercial fishing is very important.  Other important employers include the government-owned tannery, Great Greenland, which purchases and processes skins and furs from all over Greenland, as well as producing a range of fur goods.<P>

Close to the busy and attractive harbor is the charming town square, surrounded by many well-preserved old buildings from the colonial area, the oldest of which dates from the late eighteenth century.  Nearby stands the old church, dating from 1832. Some of the old buildings continue to play an active role in the town's life and house a number of shops and offices, as well as the local muse-um.  In the town square one also finds a unique attraction - Greenland's only fountain.<P>

One of Qaqortoq town's characteristic features are the many outcrops of granite one sees all around town.  In the past few years there has been a very popular and ongoing project called "Stone and Humans" (Sten og Mennesker) in which artists from different Scandinavian countries have been transforming many of the rock surfaces into sculptures.<P>

The are good possibilities for hiking in the Qaqortoq region. One of the most popular is a several day hike from Qaqortoq town to the settlement at Igaliku, visiting the church ruin at Hvalsey on the way. Hvalsey is the best preserved of the Norse ruins in South Greenland and for many a visit there is a particularly memorable experience. One can also take a boat excursion to Hvalsey, as well as to other historical and natural attractions in the area.<P>
