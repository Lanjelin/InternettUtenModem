Nanortalik is Greenland's southernmost municipality.  It was originally established in 1797 and today has a population of around 2,700, just over half of which live in Nanortalik town.  The rest live in the small settlements of Aappilattoq, Narsaq Kujalleq, Tasiusaq, Alluitsup Paa, and Ammassivik, plus at a number of sheep farms.  Because of its location near the open sea and not far from Greenland's southernmost point, Nunaat Isua (Cape Farewell), the Nanortalik area is especially affected by the field ice in the spring and early summer, and for the visitor this is an especially spectacular and memorable sight.  Local hunters welcome the ice for the many seals it brings, not to mention the occasional polar bear.<P>

South Greenland's tallest and most impressive mountain peaks are located in Nanortalik municipality, some reaching heights of over 2,000m (6200ft), and many with sheer granite cliffs hundreds of meters high.  Not surprisingly, the region is very popular with mountain climbers, as well as those who simply wish to enjoy the magnificent mountain scenery.  At the same time, Nanortalik has some of the most sheltered and fertile regions in South Greenland, including Greenland's only forest, in Tasermiut fjord, where birch and willow grow to heights of 6m (20ft).<P>

Nanortalik town has a very picturesque old harbor area with many well-preserved nineteenth century buildings.  The museum is located here, along with a reconstructed sod-walled house.  There are also some important Norse ruins in Nanortalik municipality, especially those at Herjolfsnes where well-preserved examples of Norse garments have been found.<P>

There are good hiking possibilities in the Nanortalik region and a hikers' map is now available.  Not far from Nanortalik town is Unartoq island, a favorite destination for visitors and locals alike.  On the island there is a camping area and hikers' huts, plus many Inuit ruins.  However the main attraction is most certainly the hot springs where one can bathe in waters of 35 degrees celsius surrounded by fields of wildflowers and watch icebergs float by in the nearby fjord.<P>
