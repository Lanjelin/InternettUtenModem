Approximately 2,150 people live in Narsaq municipality, with 1,800 in Narsaq town and the rest distributed between the three smal settlements at Qassiarsuk, Igaliku, and around the airport at Narsarsuaq.  A number of people also live on the isolated sheep farms.  Narsaq town is beautifully situated on a plain at the foot of a 685m (2,150ft) mountain, with superb views across fjords to mountains and the inland ice-cap.  The town was established in 1830 as a trading post and today its economy focuses on fishing and fish processing.  In addition to this, small-scale hunting and fishing continue to be important, and there is also Greenland's only private fur workshop, Eskimo Pels, and a wool workshop, Meqqileriffik.  Igaliku (founded 1782) and Qassiarsuk (1924) are sheep farming villages, with the Narsaq region being Greenland's most important sheep-farming area.  Sheep raising takes place in the many fertile and sheltered inner-fjord districts, with meat processing taking place in Narsaq town each autumn.<P>

The visitor to Narsaq municipality is always within easy access of South Greenland's magnificent natural environment.  Boat trips in iceberg-filled fjords and to glaciers and the inland ice-cap are readily available from Narsaq town and the settlements.  The Narsaq Peninsula between Narsaq town, Qassiarsuk and Narsarsuaq is also considered some of the best hiking country in South Greenland.  There are many possibilities for several day tours or for shorter excursions using the town or settlements as a base.  Narsaq is also known as a geologist's paradise.  The mountains near Narsaq town have attracted geologists, amateur and professional, since early in the nineteenth century.  The world-famous Ilimmaasaq intrusion is located near the town and contains nearly 200 different minerals, including many rare and beautiful ones.<P>

Undoubtedly, in addition to the magnificent scenery, Narsaq's most exceptional attraction is the large number of well-preserved ruins dating from the Norse settlement period between AD985 and ca. AD1500. The heart of the Vikings' Eastern Settlement (&Oslash;sterbygden) was located in present-day Narsaq municpality. There are ruins both in and near Narsaq town, while at Qassiarsuk one finds Erik the Red's estate, Brattahlid, and at Igaliku there is the Norse bishop's residence, Gardar.  In addition there are also a good number of well-preserved Inuit sites in the area.  Local history, ancient and recent, is well-presented at the museum, which is housed in some of the well-preserved nineteenth and early twentieth century colonial buildings which are attractively situated down by the old harbor.  Next to the museum is a recently erected fine reconstruction of a traditional Green-landic sod-walled house.  Narsaq Tourist Office offers a wide range of activities and excursions which enable you to experience all that Narsaq's natural environment, history, and culture have to offer.<P>
