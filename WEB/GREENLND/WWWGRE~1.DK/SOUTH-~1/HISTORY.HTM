<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+3>The Norse and Inuit History<BR>of Southern Greenland</FONT></CENTER><BR>

South Greenland has been inhabited for at least the past 3,000 years.  There are today a large number of historic sites and archaeological remains, both Inuit ("Eskimo") and Norse (Viking), which are easy to spot.  For those with an interest in human history in Arctic regions, both indigenous and European, South Greenland has much to offer.<P>

Various Inuit hunting-based cultures settled Greenland's inhabitable areas at intervals beginning at least as early as ca.2500 BC, as these peoples moved across Arctic North America and into northern Greenland from Canada.  They then gradually spread down and around the inhabitable coastal areas of Greenland, utilizing the island's rich marine and, to a lesser extent, land resources.  The last major migration of Inuit peoples was that by members of the Thule culture, who arrived in northern Greenland ca.AD1000 and began to reach southern Greenland by ca.AD1300, at the same time as the Norse settlements were beginning to decline.  Today's Inuit population in Greenland are descendants of the Thule peoples.  Traces of Inuit oc-cupations dating from their arrival in South Greenland are readily visible, although it is recommended that you utilize the services of a local guide to help in your interpretation of them.<P>

From a European or American point of view, the most fascinating era of Greenland's history is probably that which began with the Norse (Viking) settlement of South Greenland's fjords in the late tenth century.  Erik the Red left Iceland in AD982 and spent several years exploring southern Greenland.  What he found convinced him of the value of settling the area, and in AD 985 he returned with a group of settlers with 14 ships (although 25 had originally set sail from Iceland).  Thus began the Landnama (Settlement) period in Greenland.  Erik the Red him-self settled at presentday Qassiarsuk in Narsaq municipality, situated at the head of Erik's Fjord (Tunulliarfik).  He named his farm estate Brattahlid, and it was also from here that his son, Leif Eriksson, set out around the year AD1000 to explore parts of North America nearly 500 years before Columbus.  Leif established a temporary settlement in northern Newfoundland and may well have travelled a good deal further south along the eastern seaboard of North America.<P>

In the years after the Landnama period, other settlers arrived and there was estab-lished a flourishing Norse (Viking) settlement in South Greenland.  The Norse called this area Østerbygden, the Eastern Settlement, with its heart in the Narsaq-Qaqortoq-Nanortalik area.  Another but smaller (and now less well-preserved) settlement was established in the Nuuk area, and was known as Vesterbygden, the Western Settlement.  There are also some ruins in the Ivittuut area, which are often given the name Mellembygden, the Middle Settlement.<P>

The largest and best-preserved ruins are to be found in the Eastern Settlement and visitors to South Greenland have excellent opportunities to see them.  Many of the ruins have been excavated by archaeologists such that we know a good deal about them and what they can tell us about life during the Norse era in Greenland.  Some of the most well-known sites include Erik the Red's estate at Brattahlid, the bishop's residence at Gardar (presentday Igaliku in Narsaq municipality), and the chiurch ruin at Hvalsey (near Qaqortoq).  At these and other sites there are ongoing restoration and preservation projects aimed at both protecting the ruins for the future and enhancing their worth as educational and tourist attractions.<P>
Each town also has a local museum where it is possible for the visitor to learn a good deal more about local history and culture. The local tourists offices also offer guided tours of the histo-ric sites, both Inuit and Norse, in their areas.<P>
