<b>Bamse</b><br>
The main character who gains extraordinary strength from the &quot;super-honey&quot;. Bamse was a bachelor for a long time but later married his childhood sweetheart <a href="BILDER/BRUMMEL.JPG" tppabs="http://home2.swipnet.se/~w-23761/bamse/a/bilder/brummel.jpg">Brummelisa</a>. They have four children: <a href="BILDER/BRUM.JPG" tppabs="http://home2.swipnet.se/~w-23761/bamse/a/bilder/brum.jpg">Brum</a>, <a href="BILDER/TEDDY.JPG" tppabs="http://home2.swipnet.se/~w-23761/bamse/a/bilder/teddy.jpg">Teddy</a>, <a href="BILDER/NMAJA.JPG" tppabs="http://home2.swipnet.se/~w-23761/bamse/a/bilder/nmaja.jpg">Nalle-Maja</a> and Brumma.

<b>Little Leap</b> (S:Lille Skutt)<br>
A close friend of Bamse's. Little Leap is a frightened rabbit who can run verry fast. When Bamse goes away for an adventure, Little Leap often does not want to come because he is too scared, but Bamse usually persuades him. He works as a mailman and has a dog called <a href="BILDER/LURVAS1.JPG" tppabs="http://home2.swipnet.se/~w-23761/bamse/a/bilder/lurvas1.jpg">Fuzzy</a> (S:Lurvas). Little Leap also got married. Her name is <a href="BILDER/NINA.JPG" tppabs="http://home2.swipnet.se/~w-23761/bamse/a/bilder/nina.jpg">Nina Rabbit</a> and they have a child called <a href="BILDER/MHOPP1.JPG" tppabs="http://home2.swipnet.se/~w-23761/bamse/a/bilder/mhopp1.jpg">Mini-Jump</a> (S:Mini-Hopp). </td></tr>

<tr><td>
<b>Shellman</b> (S:Skalman)<br>
The third member of the core of Bamse. Shellman is a verry wise tortoise. He carries with him almost everything in his shell and as a true tortoise he hates to rush. Words like &quot;run&quot; and &quot;hurry&quot; are curses to him. He is an inventor of many things, for example a walking wheelbarrow and his food-and-sleep-clock. This clock tells him exactly when to eat and when to sleep, and Shellman never breaks his routines, even if he is in the middle of an adventure. When he is sleeping, a hundred canons cannot wake him up. Shellman has never married and isn't likely to do so. He is too mixed up in his inventions.</td>

<td><b>Croesus Vole</b> (S:Kr&ouml;sus Sork)<br>
A millionaire with a large number of fixing-voles (S:fixaresorkar) at his service. Croesus is the worst &quot;bad guy&quot; in Bamse but there is never any proof that he is behind all the tricks. Only the fixing-voles get caught.

<b>The Wolf</b> (S:Vargen)<br>
The Wolf represents a lot of what Bamse stands for. In the early episodes The Wolf was world champion in beeing bad. Bamse however tried to be nice to him and eventually The Wolf changed. He found that if he acted nicely he got a lot of new friends. The problem with The Wolf had been that he was lonely. He had had a difficult childhood without any real friends but now he had a whole group of them. Many of the episodes in Bamse are about evil people who are turned good if you are kind to them. Though beeing the strongest bear in the world, Bamse is a sort of bringer of the christian love message - to turn the other cheek - but on the other hand there are the hopeless cases of people such as Croesus Vole...
