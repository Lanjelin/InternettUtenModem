Welcome! This page is dedicated to the Swedish cartoon character Bamse. The main part of this page is in Swedish, but I will try to briefly introduce Bamse to all you non-Swedish speakers here.<p>

Bamse is a Swedish cartoon character that gains extrordinary strength from the super-honey (S: dunderhonung) that his grandmother makes. Bamse is not only the strongest, but also the kindest bear in the world. With the help of his super-honey and his friends he stands against such evil forces as the millionaire Croesus Vole (S: Kr&ouml;sus Sork) and the Wolf-cousins. However wickedly the bad guys have behaved , Bamse never uses violence. The most extreeme he ever does is to throw them up into the top of a tree. If they fall down, Bamse always catches them. The main companions of Bamses' are Little Leap (S: Lille Skutt), a frigtened little rabbit who can run very fast, and Shellman (S: Skalman), an extremly wise tortoise with most things down his shell.<p>

Bamse is a cartoon mainly for the younger, but I find that I can still read it and enjoy it (and I am 22). The plot in Bamse is often about serious subjects as racism mobbing but there are also real adventures with dragons, monsters, treassures and stuff like that. But Bamse does have a message. Even though Bamse is verry strong it is his kindness that makes him the hero. Two characters typical for Bamse are the Wolf and Croesus Vole. The Wolf was from the begining the meanest of them all, but after a while he turned good because Bamse treated him as such. Croesus Vole however is the one character that never shows any good side. He is the brain behind an number of tricks but he is never caught. The aspect of Croesus Vole is one of the reasons that Bamse often has been regarded as a communist, something that the creator of Bamse denies.<p>

The cartoon was created by Rune Andr&eacute;asson and was first published as a magazine in 1973. Until 1990 Rune himself did all the work himself to get the magazine out, but now he has steped down to let others run the magazine. <p>
