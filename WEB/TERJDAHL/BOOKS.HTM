<H1>THE WORLD OUTSIDE </H1>

<P><B>by<BR>
TERRY DAHL</B> </P>

<P>-What was that, Frankie? Gunfire? Bruno put down the beer and looked
surprised at his friend.<BR>
- Ah, just the regular crap on the news, the cops putting away some of
those blasted `truders, Frankie mumbled uninterested without turning his
head, his eyes were glued to the topless waitress while his fat fingers
were playing with some coins on bar-desk, - yeah, those bastards are getting
more and more impudent each day. <BR>
- But the telly is not on, Frankie! Bruno pointed a tobacco-stained finger
at a large screen that was hanging unsupported in the air close to a wall
full of dusty sports-pennants and old postcards. His skinny, tall body
was a sharp contrast to his stocky mate at the bar-desk. <BR>
- What? You're kidding! Frankie forced his eyes reluctantly away from the
girl, and turned on the barstool with a deep sigh.<BR>
- You see? It's not on, somebody must be shooting outside! Bruno scratched
his sharp nose and looked a little scared.<BR>
- So turn it on, you dope, so we can see what this is all about!<BR>
- Yeah, Frankie! Good idea, Frankie! Will do! said Bruno keenly, raised
his lanky body and started to hurry across the empty floor. There were
only the two of them in the small bar besides the girl behind the desk,
who was dressed in a metallic mini-skirt and nothing else besides make-up.<BR>
- Sit down, you stupid boozo, what do we have Nicole for? Hey, Nicole,
push one of your pretty nipples on the TV-button, channel five!<BR>
- You're not supposed to tell her to do things like that, Frankie, it's
against the regulations! Bruno looked distressed from Frankie to the girl
who had climbed on to the counter behind the desk and in a most awkward
position was trying to push her breast against a small control-panel on
the wall close to the beer-tap. <BR>
- &laquo;Against the regulations, against the regulations...!&quot;, Frankie
mimicked. - What kind of sissy are you? She's a cybo, have you forgotten?<BR 
-Yeah, eh.. no, Frankie, but she is not programmed to...<BR>
- Shut up your silly trap and let's see what's going on outside!<BR>
The picture on the screen showed four-meter high waves thundering at a
huge wall of large concrete blocks.<BR>
- The sea-wall at Sandford Point is getting close to it's completion, the
news-commentator's polished voice filled the room, - and the Prime minister
has assured that there will be no more problems with floodings..&raquo;
<BR>
- That what she said last month too, just before the Birkshire sea-wall
broke, mumbled Bruno and took a large sip of his mug.<BR>
- Hey, Nicole, what's that for? I said I wanted to se what's happening
outside, not the blasted news! Frankie slammed his fist in the bar so that
both Bruno and the coins jumped in the air.<BR>
- &laquo;Hey, Nicole, push one of your pretty nipples at the TV-button,
channel five&raquo;, the coarse voice of the stocky man came from the girls
red lips, and then changed to her normal sexy voice, - you are looking
at channel five, Sir!<BR>
- Go and fry your circuits, you bloody cybo-punk! <BR>
- Can I use the microwave, Sir? The waitress turned around and tried to
put her head into what looked like a old fashioned microwave-oven from
the nineties.<BR>
- Stop it Frankie, please! Bruno's eyes were as begging as his voice, -
she will do it, you know, and then what will happened? We'll be kicked
out of here. No more beer tonight!<BR>
- OK! OK! Hey, Nicole, stop acting like a lousy stand-up comedian! Just
switch to the correct channel so we can see what's going on outside!<BR>
- The camera to the world outside is on channel fifteen, Sir, Nicole said
polite and touched the control-panel. With a long-nailed finger.<BR>
The sea-wall disappeared, and after a five seconds commercial for the beer
they were drinking they could see a close-up picture of a solid-looking
door.<BR>
- Voice-activated, please ago ahead, a polite voice from the screen invited.<BR>
- OK, turn your damned camera around so we can see what the heck is going
on! Frankie shook his head impatiently while Bruno stared motionless at
the screen with foam of beer dripping from his unkempt mustache. <BR>
The camera started to sweep slowly around. The wall besides the door was
of gray, unpainted concrete.<BR>
- Zoom out and keep it moving!<BR>
The street outside was empty. It was hard to tell if it was day or night.
It was not really dark, the streetlights were on. A kind of fog seemed
to whirl in the air, and glittered almost like snow in the beams of bright
light. <BR>
- Do you want a commentator, Sir? The polished voice cut through the sound
of wind.<BR>
- Yeah, thanks, that'd be great!, said Bruno and looked a little scared
at Frankie when he realized that he had been the one giving the order.
<BR>
- You are now looking down Runburn Road. The weather is fine with some
smog. There are however possibilities for a few poison-clouds, and we recommend
you to use Rill's all-weather-dress if you are going out. Rill's are developed
by leading scientists and tested under the toughest conditions,. They are
also on a special sale today, so just... <BR>
- For God's sake shut up!, Frankie snarled, - Skip the bloody commercials
and just zoom onto were the sound of gunfire is coming from!<BR>
The voice died away without protests, and the camera zoomed slowly in at
dark shadow a few blocks down the empty street. The smog made it hard to
see what it was, but a hundred meters or so further away they could spot
another shadow, obviously following after the first. The sound of gunfire
was a lot stronger now, amplified from the screen.<BR>
- See, Bruno, what'd I tell you? Just the cops chasing some of those `truder-bastards,
Frankie shrugged his shoulders and turned back to the bar. The girl was
now licking her lips and caressing her naked breasts while looking teasingly
at the stocky man. <BR>
- But Frankie, this is our neighborhood, Bruno protested and pulled his
left earlobe. Deep wrinkles had appeared between his bushy eyebrows, -
I have never heard that the `truders have been this far into Clintonville
before. The PM said that most of the `truders already was helped out of
the country, you know!<BR>
- For Gods sake, what are you? A miserable funk? Can't you bloody see that
the cops are taking care of the problem right now? Just like they always
do. I thought we had seen enough of this boring shit on the news?<BR>
- But why do they have to shoot the `truders, Frankie? They are people,
you know!<BR>
- &laquo;They are people you know...&raquo;, for Gods sake, Bruno, you're
giving me the creeps! Haven't you got into your stupid brain that this
is our country? Our country! They are trying to steal our country, steal
your home, steal your food and your beer! They are the bloody enemy!<BR>
- But they could not help that their country was flooded, Frankie! It was
the greenhouse effect, you know, we polluted the atmosphere so much that
the south-pole to melted and the sea-level rose more than thirty feet!
Bruno eyes ping-pong'ed from Frankie to the screen. - Their homeland was
flooded, thousands of people drowned and more than fifty millions had to
flee for their lives! How could they help that, Frankie?<BR>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that don't give them any bloody right to come here
and steal our country. We have always taken care of our own problem here
in our homeland, they should bloody well take care of their own as well!<BR>
- But where else should they go, we had already promised that we should
help them if something happened to their low-lying country? And it wasn't
their factories and cars that spewed tons and tons of carbondioxide into
the air every day for centuries! It was ours! Frankie looked a little surprised
at his bar-mate. Bruno's arguments gave away that he might be a more educated
person than his worn clothes and untidy look tried to give the impression
of.<BR>
- Yeah, they were never clever enough to become as civilized as us. They
were wasting away their time under the sun while we built our country.
We sweat for our country's development in the factories, died for our country
in the wars, while they were crawling like dirty bugs in their rice fields
and propagated like rabbits in their palm-leaf huts. Shall we take the
blame for that, eh? <BR>
- Well, we could at least... Hey, Frankie, look at that! Look at that!<BR>
Frankie pulled reluctantly his eyes away from the cybo-girls bosom and
cast an unenthusiastic glance at the screen. The first dark shadow was
much closer now, while the second still were a block away. <BR>
- See what? That bloody `truder? Don't worry, the cops will get him soon.
Can't I drink my beer without you bothering me all the time?<BR>
- But, Frankie, can't you see? Its a child, it's just a young boy!<BR>
- So what?! If the cops don't stop him he will soon be breeding more damned
`truders trying to steal our country! Come on guys, get over with its!
<BR>
The camera zoomed in on the darks shadow. It was not a boy. It was a young
girl, might be ten or eleven years old. The black hair was standing out
like a galloping horse's tail, and the her eyes were that of a wild mare
lassoed for the first time. Blood was running down her left cheek from
a small wound just above her temple. She was gasping desperately for air,
but kept on running as fast as her scrawny legs could carry her. She seemed
to be heading straight for their door.<BR>
- Hey, it is a girls, and she is coming this way! Bruno turned to Frankie
with his mouth hanging wide open.<BR>
- Yeah, guess she has seen our blasted camera moving, not much else moving
this time of the day in our part of town, Frankie said irritated and clasped
his hands together, - what the heck are the cops waiting for, they must
have had her zoomed inn for quite a while now?<BR>
- Might be they don't like to shoot a girl, Frankie! Bruno was biting on
a fingernail with a look of distress.- She is just a young girl, she have
come together with her parents, you can't blame her for that.<BR>
- Oh yeah? So you like `truder girls, do you? You ever tried one, Bruno-boy?<BR>
The girl was rushing towards their door. <BR>
- What? Tried what?<BR>
- Tried one, laid one, you know...! Bruno made an obscene gesture with
a straight index finger and two fingers on the other hand forming an O.<BR>
- Me, no, no I never... I don't... I...,why do you...? Bruno blushed and
looked away.<BR>
- Just joking, old pal! Frankie looked smugly from Bruno to the girl behind
the desk and then to the screen with growing interest. - Hey, look at her
now, they have almost scared the shit out of her! Yeah, boys, go for it!
Come on! <BR>
He laughed and slammed his fist in the bar-desk. -Come on boys! Get her!
Get her!<BR>
The girl was rushing up the steps to their door, and they could see her
heaving chest and hear the air rushing in and out of the open mouth. Then
her face filling the whole screen. Her eyes were big and black. Scared,
very scared.<BR>
- Please.... pleeease.. help...me..! The desperate words thundered out
from the screen.<BR>
- Hey, Nicole, turn that bloody volume down a bit! What are you trying
to do, blast our eardrums?<BR>
- Please....open the door..! Please... help me! <BR>
- Let's let her in Frankie! I can't look at this, they gone kill her! She
is just a girl!<BR>
- Hey, what did I hear? Frankie shook his head and looked with disbelief
at the other, - save a bloody `truder, and get a lifetime sentence for
hiding her? <BR>
- She hasn't done anything, Frankie, she's just a young girl!<BR>
- You must be hot on those dark-eyed bitches, ey? Frankie cast a fast glance
at the half-naked girl behind the bar. - Well, I can understand in a way.
With only these cyber-girlies around I wouldn't mind try some real meat
for one times sake myself... I would not mind at all, not at all... His
words died slowly away and then he looked at the screen with new interest.
<BR>
- Yeah, might be we shall let her in for a while, and then throw her out
again before the cops find out where she has g...! <BR>
The sharp bang of a gun thundered from the screen. The girls begging eyes
widened, looked at the camera with pain and disbelief, and then she slipped
slowly down and out of sight. <BR>
- Got that light-footed `truder, whoever is in there! The stout figure
of a uniformed cop filled the screen. He smiled bravely into the camera
and showed thumbs up. - Well, you can sleep well tonight, this one won't
bather you! Neither will her family. And don't worry about the mess outside,
we'll will take care of it. G'dnight folks!<BR>
- He shot her, Frankie, he shot her! Bruno cried with a shrill in his voice.<BR>
- Yeah, what did you believe the cops would do, take her down town, book
her into a hotel-room and sing her a lullaby? Bruno turned away from the
screen, emptied his mug and gave a loud belch. - Well, the show seems to
be over for tonight, and I'm getting tired of all that bloody jawing of
yours. I guess its time to hit the sack.<BR>
- But Frankie, we could have saved her, they should not have shot her,
she was just an innocent...<BR>
- `night, Bruno! Frankie sighed, bent over the desk and flicked a switch.
</P>

<P><BR>
Everything disappeared. The screen. The bar-desk. The cybo-girl behind
the bar. <BR>
A small spotlight on a naked ceiling cast a yellow beam on a skinny man.
A skinny, tall man with nicotine-stained fingers sitting in a chair in
an small, empty room in front of a tiny control-panel. The walls were glowing
lumicently for a short while and then went blank.<BR>
The man rose with a effort from the chair mumbling quietly to himself.<BR>
- Well, well, well. You can't win in these role-playing VR-games every
time.. Oh well, might be I'll give it a try again tomorrow night... </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>THE <A NAME="LAST"></A>LAST PARADISE<BR>
</FONT></B>Here is an excerpt from the book about my solo-sailing from
Norway to the most isolated atolls in the Pacific (last part of chapter
5):<BR>
</P>

<P>&quot;... The rest did not last very long. &nbsp;All too soon the wind
was singing in the stays, whipping the foam of the waves and scurrying
the sea-spray across the deck. The visibility was like zero, and the waves
were thundering against the bow. What a heck of a time for a storm, I had
no chance to take down the sails and ride with the waves! I just had to
clench my jaws together and keep on. Well, Tahiti had to be out there someplace
in front of Coco Loco! If i just hadn't been so tired, so tired to the
bones!<BR>
&quot;Come on Coco Loco, we just have to manage this bloody mess too. We
don't give up so easily, me and you!&quot; At least we moved forwards,
we were still sailing in a speed of more than four knots, with only storm-jib
and reefed main-sail set!<BR>
The wind was coming in heavier and heavier squalls now, and I noticed that
the wind-rudder was fighting desperately to keep us on the right course.
More hard work! I pulled myself together and on the feet, out into the
cockpit. Put on the harness, hooked on the safety-line and grabbed the
tiller. A wave managed to break heavily on the deck before I had put up
the hood on the rain-dress. Spitting and roaring I could feel the cold
seawater run down my back. &quot;Hey, Coco Loco, take it easy! I am fed
up of this rubbish now!&quot; No use, the water just kept on spraying over
my head. I pushed my feet as hard as I could against the cockpit-bench,
and eased out the main-sail a little. Well, not even did I have to steer
the yacht, I also had to work like a crazy with the sails! <BR>
It felt like I was sitting there for hours and hours, fighting the wind
and waves, but finally I noticed that the waves did not break as violent
against the bow as before. And a little later I found &nbsp;that I no longer
had to maintain the tiller and sails; We had to be leeward of the island
of Tahiti! <BR>
The sea-spray settled down and in front of the bow I could see glimpses
of green valleys in the dense clouds. And then, as if by magic, the wind
died totally down and the sea became almost flat. I unreefed the main-sail
and changed the storm-jib for the genoa. Not even that was enough to make
Coco Loco move in something like a respectable speed! I pulled my outboard
alive and found the map of the harbour of the capital Papeete.<BR>
<BR>
It was dark before I reached Papeete's sea-wall, but red and green lightbeacons
were twinkling comforting towards me. I pulled down the sails and maneuvered
into the harbour. Motored slowly along the moored yachts to finds a free
space.<BR>
O'boy, there was the Norwegian yacht Mot! I called out to Torkild, and
a head peeped out of the hatch on the deck. Torkild grabbed my lines and
I pulled Coco Loco long-sides. <BR>
At last; safely anchored in a harbour again! I climbed onboard Mot for
the traditional anchor-drinks, but I did not manage many glasses. Almost
asleep I climbed back to my small home and fell flat on the bed. In the
same wet clothes!<BR>
&quot;We did it,Coco Loco!&quot; I mumbled and went out like a burned down
candlelight.<BR>
