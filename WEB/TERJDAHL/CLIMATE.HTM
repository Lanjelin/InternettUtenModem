<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>This is what is happening: <BR>
</FONT></U></B>The atmosphere is getting warmer because gas-emissions from
human activities prevents the heat from the sun to reflect into space -
we are experiencing a greenhouse effect. The majority of so called greenhouse-gases
are caused by burning of fossil fuel, and the biggest troublemaker is carbondioxide,
CO2.<BR>
With a temperature-rising in the atmosphere there are now occurring several
processes that disturbs the normal state of our globe: <BR>
- The ice in the Antarctica is slowly melting, and the scientists can already
measure a rise in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;the sea-level. <BR>
- The temperature in the sea is slowly raising, changing the habitats of
fish and other living<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;beings necessary for our survival.<BR>
- The raise of the temperature in the atmosphere and sea is changing the
whole <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;meteorological situation for our planet - winds, rain and
even ocean-currents are already <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;behaving un-normal, and it will change more! </P>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>This is what we will experience in the near future:<BR>
</FONT></U></B>- the sea-level will raise from 25 to 90 centimeter. Low-laying
countries are threatened and <BR>
&nbsp; more than hundred million people will have to be moved!<BR>
- it will be a lot more extreme weather with floodings, hurricanes and
draught!<BR>
- higher temperature means spreading of tropical diseases. malaria might
increase with up to <BR>
&nbsp; 80 million a year!<BR>
- food-production will decrease in many areas of the world , in other increase!<BR>
- deserts will become larger, and the vegetation change in 1/3 of the worlds
forests!<BR>
- the mean-temperature on the earth will raise with between 1 to 4 degrees
Celsius the next<BR>
&nbsp; century! </P>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>What can we do to stop the problem?<BR>
</FONT></U></B>UN's climate-panel says that we have to reduce the emission
of greenhouse-gases - fast!<BR>
A decrease in release of CO2 to the atmosphere of at least 60 percent is
necessary just to stabilize the amount of CO2 on the present level. A level
that already is causing a harmful climate-change! </P>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Can we believe in UN's climate-panel?<BR>
</FONT></U></B>The climate-panel is made up from 1000 of the worlds leading
scientists.<BR>
If you are sick I guess you visit one doctor, and trust in what he is saying.
1000 of the leading doctors on the earth's health are telling that the
patient is seriously sick- and it would be ridiculous and highly risky
not to listen to &nbsp;what they say!<BR>
<BR>
<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Might be the earth will solve the problems itself?<BR>
</FONT></U></B>Well, might be, but is it any reason that the earth in so
case will show consideration to us humans? Isn't the best way to get rid
of a cancer to cut it away?<BR>
<BR>
<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Why don't we do anything?<BR>
</FONT></U></B>It has taken some time to realize and admit that we have
a problem, but luckily the first steps towards finding a solution to the
problems have been taken: Climate-conferences are now on the international
and national agendas and we have had three major ones; in London, Rio and
last year in Berlin.Unfortunately no binding agreements have been made
- it has been a lot of talk, but no action.<BR>
Some countries have already set up national goals to reduce their emission
of greenhouse-gases, but so far the implementations have been very weak
and no country has even discussed to reduce their emission of CO2 with
60 percent or more. The total level of CO2 in the atmosphere is rapidly
increasing and makes the percentage we will have to reduce higher and higher
each day!<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Why don't the politicians take this problem seriously?<BR>
</FONT></U></B>The politicians are in a very tricky situation, they have
too many considerations to take. <BR>
First of all; they are humans and they want to get re-elected to keep their
jobs. If they tell the inhabitants of their country that everybody will
have to reduce their standard of living &nbsp;then their political career
might be very short! They are in a &quot;Catch 22&quot;-situation.<BR>
To reduce the CO2 level in the atmosphere with more than 60 percent will
beyond doubt mean that all the inhabitants of the industrialized nations
will have to reduce their standard of living, and that the rest of the
world can forget any kind of economical development! To say it in a brutal
&nbsp;and illustrative way: If all the chinese and indians shall be allowed
to have cars then the rest of the world can throw away theirs!<BR>
It might be that some of the politicians have concluded that it is impossible
to do something, and that they might as well help the inhabitants in their
country to obtain a high standard of living - until it is all over. 
<HR><B><FONT COLOR="#800040"><FONT SIZE=+1>What a paradox it is that we
had to move to Norway!</FONT></FONT></B> </P>

<P>We had to flee from our paradise because of the climate-change with
hurricanes. <BR>
The rising sea-level will make the country impossible to live in Tuvalu
in 10-15 years due to the rising sea-level, - if not the inhabitants have
been washed on the sea before that!<BR>
Norway is today the worlds second largest oil-exporter - and oil is the
major contributor to the climate-change that made us the worlds first climate-refugees!
We have no option but to live with this fact, even if I am mighty ashamed
of &nbsp;the place where I was born! <BR>
I am even more ashamed of the fact that Norway today has left it's official
goal to reduce the emission of CO2 to 1989-level, and instead is expected
to increase its emissions with about 20 percent til year 2000! </P>

<P>It is also a bad sign that former Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland,
who was the leader of the World Commission on Environment and Development,
totally seems to have forgotten that she in the report &quot;Our Common
Future&quot; concluded that the industrialized countries have to reduce
their use of energy with 50 percent!

<P>We managed to get away and our houses are standing empty. But Emma's
family is still there, our friends are still there.<BR>
We will not be surprised if we tomorrow receive a fax telling that they
are all dead. </P>

<P>So - I have a job to do here. My homepages are a part of this job. </P>

<P>The Tuvaluan Government is aware of the problem, and they have tried
to focus the word's attention on their situation - without much luck.<BR>
It seems that Australia and New Zealand have promised to take the islanders
if they have to be evacuated, but the problem is that it might not be anybody
to evacuate after the next hurricane... Nobody will be able pick the people
of the islands if a catastrophe strikes - the nation is just too far away.

<TD><B>&quot;The greenhouse effect and sea level rise threaten the very
heart of our existence&quot;</B>, Bikenibeau Paeniu, previous Prime Minister
of Tuvalu.<BR>
<I>World Climate Conference, November 1990.</I><BR>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD><B>The inhabitants of tiny Tuvalu threatened by rising sea-levels fear
they will have to be floated in canoes over their flooded homes before
the rest of the world wakes up to their plight.<BR>
</B>Prime Minister Kamuta Lataasi said New Zealand Foreign Minister Don
McKinnon had written to him to say Tuvaluans would not be welcomed in New
Zealand, and Australia had informally advised him they would not change
their immigration policies to cope with Tuvalu's problems. <BR>
&quot;-I am disappointed, but I don't think I will take no for an answer,
I will continue to press for our needs. - It seemed, he said in the telephone
interview, - that the world did not care what happened to &nbsp;his people.
they want to see everybody floating before they respond, he said, but they
might not even be able to do that. -We might not have enough wood here
to build paopaos (canoes)&quot;<BR>
