<p><b><i><font SIZE=+2><font COLOR="#800000">The Rolls Royce Silver Wraith
was </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">announced in April 1946</font><font COLOR="#800000">;
however, a delivery date earlier than September 1946 could not be set.
Production started very slowly with only one Silver Wraith being delivered
in September and a second example in December.</font></font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font COLOR="#800000"><font SIZE=+2>The Silver Wraith differed
from the Mark VI in that, rather than being offered as a complete car,
the tradition of manufacturing a rolling-chasses only was maintained, the
body being erected by a coachbuilder.</font></font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font SIZE=+2><font COLOR="#800000">The England of the post war
era had more urgent requirements than luxury motor cars. </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">The
economy had suffered</font><font COLOR="#800000"> and production was severely
handicapped by shortages of raw materials. Further, the high priced, high
quality car had become subject to a prohibitive purchase tax. To add to
the misery </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">petrol was rationed and only available
on coupons.</font></font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font SIZE=+2><font COLOR="#FF0000">Rolls-Royce,</font><font COLOR="#800000">
therefore, approached the subject of production of the Silver Wraith with
</font><font COLOR="#FF0000">not only hesitation but great care.</font><font COLOR="#800000">
It had been decided that Rolls-Royces and Bentleys should not continue
to be built in strictly separate series. Instead, it had been agreed essential
that as many parts of the chassis, engine and gearbox should be identical
for the different makes and thus interchangeable. The fitted hydraulic
jacks shown on the chassis drawing were never fitted. In this regard the
Silver Wraith illustrated the company's new philosophy that complicated
components did not belong on a chassis, which should be </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">realiable
and easy to maintain anywhere in the world.</font></font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font SIZE=+2><font COLOR="#800000">In respect of the </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">engine</font><font COLOR="#800000">
there were </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">no notable differences between
the Silver Wraith and the Mark VI.</font><font COLOR="#800000"> A camshaft
with lower lift than that of the Bentley, and a single Stromberg carburettor
instead of twin SU carburettors were the only modifications.Thus more torque
was gained at low revolutions.</font></font></i></b><img src="WRTH-ENG.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/wrth-eng.gif" border=0 height=279 width=465 align=right></p>

<p><b><i><font SIZE=+2><font COLOR="#800000">One technical sophistication
proved to be a shortcoming. </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">The upper cyinder
liners were polished and chrome plated.</font><font COLOR="#800000"> In
theory this should have helped the engine in achieving extraordinary mileage.
</font><font COLOR="#FF0000">It was hoped that a rebore would not be necessary
before 100,000 miles</font><font COLOR="#800000"> (160,000 km) was reached,
which could then be carried out during a general overhaul. </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">In
practice the quality of chrome plating did not live up to expectations.</font><font COLOR="#800000">
Many of those engines which were used for town traffic became unserviceable
after very low mileages. After a short time this problem, which was common
to the Silver Wraith and the Mark VI, was solved. Cylinder lines of hardened
steel with a chrome content were pressed into the engine blocks.</font></font></i></b></p>

<p><b><i><font SIZE=+2><font COLOR="#800000">The price and economic conditions
prevailing at the time when the new model was launched limited the production
of the SilverWraith which, from </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">1946-59 was
only 1,783 examples.</font><font COLOR="#800000"> These were fitted with
a variety of different bodies and were the basis for new heights being
reached in the craft of coach building. In the course of </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">1955
the Silver Wraith was equipped with an engine the capacity of which was
4,887 cc.</font><font COLOR="#800000"> Mixture was provided by first a
single carburettor and then, from 1956, by twin SU carburettors. The need
for yet more power had become inevitable because the weight of the additional
equipment had eroded the car's performance. </font><font COLOR="#FF0000">By
the end of 1954 all Silver Wraiths were fitted with automatic transmission
and in late 1956 power steering became an optional extra.</font></font></i></b></p>
