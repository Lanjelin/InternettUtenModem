day in 1904 when Henry Royce's first car left the factory a total of 61
different models have been built by the company. Included amongst these
are the various Bentleys produced since the acquisition of Bentley Motors
by Rolls-Royce in 1931.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P></DIV>

produced chassis only</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">and
it was left to specialist coachbuilders to construct coachwork to the individual
requirements of customers. After the Second World War it was decided to
produce a complete car with Rolls-Royce becoming responsible for the coachwork
of the newly introduced standard steel saloon. To do this required more
extensive factory space for paint shop and assembly areas and so in 1946
motor car production was moved from Derby to a new factory at Crewe where
aero engines had been built throughout the war.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The first car to be built completely by Rolls-Royce
at Crewe was a Bentley Mk VI,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">not

its name from a 40/50 HP which Claude Johnson had built for himself. He
took the twelfth chassis built and fitted it with a 5/5 seat touring body
which was finished in aluminium paint and adorned with silver plated lamps
and fittings. A handsome silver plated brass plaque monted on the car bore
the name &quot;The Silver Ghost&quot;.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">This

7,870 were built. 1,700 of these were produced in Springfield, America

built in Britain.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
