<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The Phantom VI was launched
in the autumn of 1968 to a rather sceptical press.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The basic layout was very
nearly identical to the Phantom V. The chassis with the massive cruciform
braced frame and drum brakes was retained. The rear axle, even at high
speed or on bumpy surfaces, performed impeccably - without requiring the
Z bar axle location which the last series of &quot;small&quot; models,
fitted with similar chassis, had been equipped.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Little use was made of the
opportunity to change the coachwork. Twin headlamps similar to those of
the Silver Cloud III and Silver Shadow had replaced the single units already
on late models of the Phantom V and, thus, were standard. If a production
of some 50 examples per year at the beginning of production seems miniscule,
then the figure to which this fell of about 3 or 4 cars a year by the eighties,
was microscopic.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Under the bonnet the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">V8
engine was to be found with all the modifications which had made it easier
to maintain when installed into the Silver Shadow. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Thanks
to newly designed cylinder heads, sparking plugs were placed at the top
of the Phantom VI's engine. New was the installation of two separate air
conditioning systems. The reason for this arrangement had not been the
designer's fear that a second reserve unit should be in position in case
the first failed. Instead Rolls-Royce Phantom VI offered the luxury of
one air conditioning system for the chauffeurs's compartment and a second
for the compartment behind the division.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The dashboard was distinguished
by a new arrangement of instruments, similar to that of the Silver Shadow.
All vital units were grouped directly in front of the driver, immediately
behind the steering wheel and no longer grouped centrally. In 1978 the
capacity of the engine was increased from 6,230 cc to 6,750 cc and thus
the Phantom VI had the same power as all Rolls-Royces other models. At
the same time the end came for the long <IMG SRC="PHAN-6.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/phan-6.gif" HEIGHT=213 WIDTH=500 ALIGN=RIGHT>serving
four speed automatic gearbox. It was replaced by the torque converter three-speed
gearbox that had been used by the other models for several years. Installing
this unit into the Phantom VI occasioned some delay. The four speed gearbox
had had the brake servo attached to it which enabled it to operate the
drum brakes. The change of gearbox required comprehensive modifications
to the brakes.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The Phantom VI like its namesake
before, was the flagship of Rolls-Royce's fleet. Since 1974 Rolls-Royce
have chosen to quote no list price, which has made it even more exclusive.
The Rolls-Royce Phantom VI has differed from example to example in detail
and equipment because of the wishes of each customer - customers who can
afford to indulge their whims. Each car is likely to have attracted a price
tag that would have allowed a purchaser to buy one or even several Rolls-Royces
out of the next drawer down.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The company-owned Mulliner
Park Ward (the initials H J and the comma had been dropped) offered the
choice of limousine or landaulette. In the landaulette style of body the
rear part of the hood can be lowered. Completely disappearing were the
hoods of - at least - two Phantom VIs. One had been constructed by the
Italian coachbuilder Pietro Frua, the other was a significantly modified
Park Ward body.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The very last Phantom VIs
were delivered in 1991, shortly after which Rolls-Royce decided to close
the Mulliner Park Ward factory at Willesden. Interestingly craftsmen did
not immediately stop shaping panels for the Phantom VI because five complete
sets for each limousine and landaulette were planned for storage to be
available in case of accident.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The Rolls-Royce Phantom VI
was the very last specimen of a passenger motor car with separate chassis
to be produced by Rolls-Royce;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> production
narrowly continuing into the last decade of the century. Because no successor
of this type is planned there simply will not be a car like it available
in the next century, although it is likely a Rolls-Royce Phantom VII based
on a lengthened and raised standard running gear will see the light of
day in the not too distant future.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
