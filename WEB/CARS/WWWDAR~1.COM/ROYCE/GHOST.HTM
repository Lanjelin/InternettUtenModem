<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">At the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">London
Olympia Show</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> in November 1906 a new model
by Rolls-Royce was exhibited. C S Rolls-Royce &amp; Co. presented on their
stand in chassis-form </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">(ie chassis, engine
and gearbox) </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">the first example of the model
which would become famous as the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. While on exhibition
the model was not called the Silver Ghost in fact, but described simply
as the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rolls-Royce 40/50 hp.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
This indicated the horsepower figure for motor tax purposes (deduced from
the cylinder bore dimension using a formula known as the RAC Rating) which
came out at 40 hp, and the actual output which was given as 50 hp.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The name Silver Ghost was
a later creation of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">C G Johnson</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
and at first was used only for one demonstrator. Curiously though during
the time that the model was being produced this name found more acceptance
than the term given by the factory and in the end was in general usage
for all examples of this model.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Production in 1907 was limited
to about </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">four cars per week</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
- after the new works in Nightingale Road in Derby opened in July 1908,
a higher <IMG SRC="GHOST2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/ghost2.gif" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=320 ALIGN=RIGHT>production
rate was possible. Work in the new factory concentrated entirely on the
Silver Ghost, a decision taken because the orders for the Silver Ghost
could not be dealt with in reasonable time.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">A material increase in capacity
from 7,036 cc to 7,428cc in 1909 was attained by a longer sroke. It did
not take long for it to become obvious to both Rolls and Johnson that a
considerable number of drivers lacked even basic skills in how to handle
a motor car. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rolls-Royce opened a drivers'
<IMG SRC="GHOST4.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/ghost4.gif" HEIGHT=340 WIDTH=480 ALIGN=LEFT>school
of instruction which held its first training course in 1910.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
No other manufacturer offered the benefit of a driving school and effective
advice regarding the choice of coachwork at that time. This service was
followed up by the provision of a service which ensured the car's uninterrupted
readiness for use. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Travelling mechanics visited
the customers regularly</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> or on request and
carried out maintenance work or repairs immediately in the owner's own
motor house.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Silver Ghost dominated
the Austrian Alpine Rally in 1913 with a top speed of 80 mph, and although
the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 raised fears that the company
might have to close because of lack of orders for their class of car, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">production
was kept alive by the provision of armoured cars based on the Silver Ghost
chassis.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> The longevity of these cars is documented
by the fact that several were still in regular use at the outbrake of World
War II.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Between 1906 and 1925 at the
factories in Manchester and Derby 6,173 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghosts were
built. This motor car, more than any other, symbolised luxury and wealth.

who had chosen a Silver Ghost, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lenin</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">,
his communist successor, also chose a Rolls-Royce. The </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Emperor
of Japan</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> had taken delivery of two Silver
Ghosts in 1922 and the aristocrats and magnates who drove Silver Ghosts
were legion.</FONT></FONT></I></B><IMG SRC="GHOST3.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/ghost3.gif" HEIGHT=250 WIDTH=601 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Silver Ghost had confirmed
in the eyes of the world that Rolls-Royce really did build </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;the
best car in the world&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> and when the time
came for a replacement model to be found it was going to be a hard act
to follow.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
