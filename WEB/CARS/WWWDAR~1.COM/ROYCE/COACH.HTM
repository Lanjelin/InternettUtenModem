<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">When Mr Mulliner founded his carriage building
business in</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> eighteenth century Northampton,
England, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">he would have been much influenced
by what was one of the most fertile periods in British cultural history.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">For his was the century in which men like architect
Robert Adams, furniture designer Thomas Chippendale and potter Josiah Wedgwood
flourished.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Master craftsmen who, encouraged by wealthy
and discerning patronage, added an aesthetic and artistic dimension which
elevated the merely functional to something of supreme and lasting worth.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Mr Mulliner was of a similar kind.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">His carriages were superbly built of the finest
materials for a clientele that insisted on the best.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Succeeding generations subscribed to the same
high ideals and in due course Mr H J Mulliner was to set up his own coachbuilding
company in 1900 and apply Mulliner standard to the new horseless carriage.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The superlative chassis built by Rolls-Royce
were those most frequently specified by his distinguished customers.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The same was to be true for the high class
coachbuilding concern established by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Mr Park
and Mr Ward </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">in 1919.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In fact, the association between the two coachbuilders
and the best car in the world was to develop to the point where first,
in 1939, Park Ward and then, twenty years later, H J Mulliner became part
of the Rolls-Royce company.</FONT></B><IMG SRC="MULLINER.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/mulliner.gif" HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=55 WIDTH=174 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Today, the symbol of Mulliner Park Ward is
Mr Mulliner's carriage.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">It is entirely appropriate, because it speaks
not only of an impeccable pedigree but also of centuries old skills which,
under the aegis of the company that is now Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, are
proudly maintained and honoured still.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">At Mulliner Park Ward's London works hands

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Modern technology has its place, but as an
aid to craftsmanship, never a substitute for it.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Thus the track, along which the convertible
body shells of the Rolls-Royce and Bentley progressively take shape, has
the latest in welding equipment and the most up to date measuring devices
which ensure perfect dimensional accuracy.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">However, sub-assemblies are</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
still welded by hand.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Microscopic flaws in
panel surfaces continue to be sought out by finger-tips sensitive almost
to a micron and persuaded back into shape by a deft tap from the panel-beater's
hammer. Gaps between doors (loaded with weights to simulate their fully
assembled condition) and apertures are still hand filled to thousandths
of an inch.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The result is a body constructed to the highest
standard, seamless, entirely free of visible panel joins.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">During the course of the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">six
month long assembly process,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF"> this body will

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Hooper</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FFFF"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">became
famous during the nineteenth century as a result of their creation of exquisitely
decked-out carriages and coaches. Vehicles built by this manufacturer were
to be found in the mews of numerous royal households. The change over to
coachbuilding for motor cars was coped with with great success. The quality
of bodies by Hooper was so high that the company became one of the most
highly regarded anywhere and it was to tailor bodies for all the leading
car manufacturers in the world. One of its chief occupations was the clothing
of Rolls-Royce chassis.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The dwindling demand for hand-built bodies
was, however, to lead to the closure of this well known coachbuilder in
1959 - but here we get ahead of the story.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The beginning of the company dates back to
the year 1805. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">In this year George Hooper
founded a coachbuilding company in London. Within a short time due to the
quality of workmanship, Hooper became held in high regard. The customers'
circle widened further than London and spread to the landed gentry.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">After a reasonable time - and this could hardly
be less than a quarter of a century, going by normal British standards
- an order was placed by the Royal Household.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
His Majesty, King George IV </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">required a coach
to be built, and thus it was that Hooper became providers of carriages
by Royal Appointment. This honour, quite naturally, led to well-filled
order books. More order caused serious problems because they could not
be dealt with without reducing the standard of quality. In those days,
the extra work could not be absorbed by resorting to the employment of
machines. The work could only be done properly by skilled craftsmen whose
training lasted years. In addition there were problems with the available
materials. Painting, for example, was enormously time consuming. Paint
could only be applied during dry weather and low atmospheric humidity.
On a rainy island like Great Britain such favourable circumstances could
only be expected on about 50 of the 365 days in the year!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Royal patronage raised the London coachbuilder
to become the premier address for the finest horsedrawn carriages. It was
not England's Society alone which esteemed carriages by Hooper as the only
proper means of transport - the record of purchasers reads like a Debrett'swith
its list of noble names. Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (later His Imperial
Majesty Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany) is listed there. The names of His
Imperial Majesty Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Her Imperial Majesty the
Empress Eugenie of France follow. The number of Kings who ordered carriages
for ceremonial purposes is legion. The painstakingly listed orders in Hooper's
books also tell about unobtrusively styled carriages being delivered to
high-ranking persons for use on provate occasions.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">They chose with discernment, because at Hoopers
the finest materials were finished with the utmost care and with precision
and skill were combined by craftsmen to form an objet d'art on wheels.
Interiors were characterised by combinations of silk or brocade with leather
and the finest woods. For the external surfaces, materials varied from
exotic woods with numerous layers of paint to complete covering with gold
leaf. The quality can be measured not least by the fact that today, more
than a hundred years after their creation, horse-drawn carriages by Hooper
are still serving on ceremonial occasions, having been painstakingly cared
for at the Royal Mews in London. The secret of their durability is the
care that was invested in manufacturing each piece and checking its assembly
into the complete creation. A carriage of this class was good not just
for a lifetime, but for generations.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The English royal family, especially Queen
Victoria, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">remained faithful to Hooper. The
same can be said of the German rulers, Emperors Wilhelm I and II. This
patronage did not change upon the advent of the motor car which demanded
adaptations in the approach to the craft. In the meantime the founder's
son, George Norgate Hooper, had taken over the senior position in the company.
With great care, he began to produce bodies for motor cars, at first side
by side with, and very much echoing the design of horse-drawn carriages.
Usually a motor car was delivered by the manufacturer to the coach builder,
but on behalf of the customer in the form of a rolling-chassis complete
with engine. The body would then be built and fitted. Because the bodies
had to be finished in accordance with the special wishes of those who had
ordered them they were dealt with as single units. Although basic lines
might be shared, differences in equipment and slight alterations were always
to be found and during this period</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">rarely
ever were two bodies identical down to the last detail.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The company's workshops were full of bodies
in every state of assembly - and a remarkably high proportion was to the
order of the ruling houses. Because these families were the trend-setters
of the time, everything they did was noted and those suppliers who received
their patronage were regarded as the very best.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Many of the makers whose chassis received coachwork
by Hooper are long gone, if not entirely forgotten, such as Delauney-ellvilee,
Minerva and Napier, and rarely mentioned outside the pages of books about
motoring history. Two companies, however, with whom Hooper was connected
are still famous today:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Rolls-Royce
and Bentley.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">If coachwork came from Hooper it was sure to
be not only outstanding in quality but also of an understated and classic
style. In addition it could be certain to satisfy perfectly the demands
of the customer - even if these were somewhat eccentric. A painter, for
example, who wanted his Rolls-Royce Phantom II Limousine to be modified
to provide an artist's salon on wheels, got exactly what he had ordered;
a limousine with a very special roof which could be opened and fixed for
using as an easel.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Special interest was always taken at Hoopers
to cars of sporting character. When Henry Royce, as chief engineer of Rolls-Royce,
insisted on a lightweight body for a Rolls-Royce Phantom I to reduce loss
of acceleration, Hooper built one of the prototypes. Some stunning cabriolets
were created during the thirties when coachbuilding was at its peak. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The main reason that Hooper continued to hold
the position as favourite coachbuilder to Royality was the outstanding
quality. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">After the end of the Second World War this
special position was maintained. In addition to continuing support from
the English royal family,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">His
Serene Highness the Prince Aga Khan ruler of the Ismaili Muslims,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">was listed as a customer as was</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800080">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">His Majesty King Faisal II of Iraq.</FONT></B><IMG SRC="HOOP1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/hoop1.gif" HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=214 WIDTH=432 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Rapidly increasing labour costs and vastly
improved and better equipped standard bodies led to a decline in demand
for specially manufactured coachwork. The most significant break was the
development of unit-construction or monocoque body shells. No longer was
a chassis the foundation upon which a body was built. In its place was
a one-piece, completely welded unit consisting in one structure of the
body and frame equipped with running gear and interior.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Hooper lost more and more ground in their field
of work. With few bodies in demand, which only oriental potentates could
afford, the company couldn't survive. Three cars at the 1959 Earls Court
Motor Show represented Hooper's last exhibits before the curtain fell.
Shortly afterwardsOsmond Rivers, Hooper's chief designer, wrote his final
remark in the production book &quot;Production ceased December 1959&quot;.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">The maintenance of Hooper-bodied cars in the
Royal Mews was taken over by their rival, Park Ward, the Rolls-Royce owned
coachbuilding division. Hooper as a coachbuilder no longer existed, although
they continued in business as a garage, a coachwork repairer and agency
for Rolls-Royce and Daimler.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">After new capital had been injected and new
ideas formulated, by the middle of the nineteen eighties circumstances
had arisen which were favourable to a new start in the field of coachbuilding
following traditional methods.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0080FF">Within a few years Hooper had regained their
former position in that small circle of coachbuilding companies which manufactured
bodies to order on Rolls-Royce and Bentleys. When a brand new body was
created for the Bentley Turbo R, the company showed their ability to manufacture
once again coach work of a style and quality that elevated the finished
vehicle to an even higher plane than that occupied by the products from
Crewe.</FONT></B></P>
