<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">With the introduction of the
Speed Six in October 1928, the company went one stage further in providing
customers with a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">serious contender for motor
sports events.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> The main difference to the
standard model was the fitting of twin carburettors. Usually the Bentley
Speed Six was built with wheel bases of 138 inches. There are also a small
number of Speed Sixes with a wheelbase of 152 1/2 inches. A change of the
front springs and depending on the redesign of the front axle fixing, led
to the abandonment of the version with the 138 inch wheelbase.Only the
140 inch variant remaining. For participation in the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">24
hour race at Le Mans</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> one chassis was built
with a wheelbase of 132 inches.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">During competition in Britain,
particularly at the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Brooklands</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
Track, a weak point soon became evident. This heavy car with its powerful
engine and high running speeds would soon cause </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">problems
with tyres</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> when, even on short runs, the tread
would part company from the carcass. Soon afterwards a solution was provided
by the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Goodrich Rubber Company</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
who, after long experiments, had developed a rubber compound that was reliable
when subjected to the punishment meted out by these heavy cars. As a consequence
of Goodrich's assistance Bentleys subsequently equipped all their cars
with tyres from that company for some time. Because of the tyre problems,
several years went by before a 6 1/2 litre was listed as an entry to the
classic Le Mans event. By that time the other tyre companies had made progress,
so catching up with Goodrich's original developments. Bentley then let
his works cars run on &nbsp;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dunlop.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">In its first entry in the
24 hour Race at Le Mans the Bentley Speed Six crossed the finishing line
as victor. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Woolf Barnato,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
the main shareholder in the company by then, had contributed to this success
as co-driver with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;Tim&quot; Birkin.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
He was heir to an immense fortune which had been gained by his family from
the ownership of South African diamond mines. Woolf Barnato had widened
his business interests to England and the USA and lived mainly in these
countries. He was considered a brilliant driver by many including W O Bentley.
His belief was rewarded when Barnato achieved the victor's laurels again
at the following year's Le Man race, acting as co-driver aboard another
Bentley Speed Six, this time with </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Glen Kidston.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">During the two years in which
they were in production, the sale of Bentley Speed Sixes reached a figure
of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">182 cars</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">.
Very often, because the cars were aimed at a rareified clientele they would
be equipped with appropriately lavish coachwork. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Looking back </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Bentley
himself had no doubt</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> that the Speed Six was
his </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">masterpiece.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
There is no doubt that had it not turned up at exactly the wrong time -
the dramatic economic decline after that black Friday in October 1929 when
Wall Street crashed - the Bentley Speed Six would have been a commercially
successful, as well as a technically successful, motor car.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
