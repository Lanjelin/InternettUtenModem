<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Camargue was a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">two
door fixed head coupe</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">. Like the Corniche,
Rolls-Royce's other two door coachbuilt car, the new model's name originated
in he South of France. The choice of name was evocative as it brought back
memories of the pre-war Grand Touring era. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The coachwork had been styled
by the famous Italian </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sergio Pininfarina.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">He had previously designed one-off Rolls-Royce
and Bentley models although these had not received much recognition.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The Camargue was a dramatic
attempt to add a new coupe to the model range. The concept had originally
been planned for an earlier introduction but this was delayed by the events
of 1971.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The body of uncluttered lines
possessed </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">wide opening doors </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">giving
acess to a luxuriously equipped passenger compartment. Two front seats
and individually shaped rear seats were upholstered in </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">specially
soft Nuella-hide.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Unlike any other Rolls-Royce
model, the instruments were designed like those to be found on an aircraft's
instrument panel, the theory being that the owner of a Camargue would be
more likely to fly their own aircraft!</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The design of the Camargue
introduced important changes in Roll-Royce's working practice, because
it was the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">first vehicle built to metric measurements.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>A number of innovations made
their debut in the Camargue. For example, for the first time the windscreen
was bonded directly to the recess in the body, rather than being held in
position in the conventional way with a rubber moulding. The sidelights
were slightly curved following the shape of the coachwork. For the first
time, too, a completely automatic air conditioning system was fitted. This
allowed the driver to select a chosen temperature and then forget it. A
particular feature was its ability to give different variations of temperature
for the upper and lower parts of the interior.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">When, in 1986, the production
of the Rolls-Royce Camargue finished, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">534
cars had been built. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Four of these were prototypes
without a chassis number. Another four were test vehicles which carried
a Bentley radiator and after all tests were run had been scrapped following
Rolls-Royce's usual policy. The total figure was thus reduced to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">526
during a run of eleven years.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> All are rarities,
in that few are identicial in detail, but two are unique. One single Camargue
sported a radiator with red entwined RR, which had not been seen since
1933. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">One single Bentley Camargue</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
had been built. It was delivered to a customer who insisted that only a
Bentley could fulfil his wishes.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
