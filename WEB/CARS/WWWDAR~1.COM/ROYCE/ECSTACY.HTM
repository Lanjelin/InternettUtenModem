<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+3>The Spirit of Ecstasy</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">is certainly the most attractive and probably
the best known motor car mascot in the world. Designed by</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
Charles Robinson Sykes, she has adorned the radiators of Rolls-Royce motor
cars since 1911 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">and concealed a hidden passion.
This marvellous mascot was modelled after a woman who had bewitching beauty,
intellect and esprit - but not the social status which might have permitted
her to marry the man with whom she had fallen in love.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">This is the story of</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
Eleanor Velasco Thornton</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">, whose liaison with
John </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Walter <IMG SRC="ELEANOR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/eleanor.gif" HEIGHT=317 WIDTH=194 ALIGN=RIGHT>Edward-Scott-Montagu
(after 1905 the second Lord Montagu of Beaulieu)</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">was to remain a secret for a decade or more,
principally because both partners acted with the utmost discretion. John
Scott, heir to his father's title, was a pioneer of automobilism in England.
From 1902 he was editor of the illustrated magazine The Car. Eleanor V
Thornton was employed as his secretary. Friends of the pair knew of their
close relationship but they were sufficiently understanding as to overlook
it.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">A member of this circle of
friends was the sculptor Charles S Sykes. To Lord Montagu's order he created
a special mascot for his</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Rolls-Royce
Silver Ghost. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">The small statue illustrated
a young woman in fluttering robes having placed one forefinger to her lips.
The sculptor had chosen Eleanor Thornton as model for this figurine, which
was christened </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;The Whisper&quot;.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+2>Lord Montagu had, with a certain
amount of flair, taken up an idea of his time, to put a mascot on top of
the radiator, and it had become a fashion. Rolls-Royce had noted other
owners of their cars following the new vogue, but doing so with less style
by choosing mundane or even risque and vulgar subjects.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">Following th Lord Montagu
commission, Charles Sykes was asked to create a mascot which in future
would adorn every Rolls-Royce. In</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">February
1911 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">he presented to Rolls-Royce the &quot;Spirit
of Ecstasy&quot;, which was easily recognisable as being a variation on
the theme of &quot;The Whisper&quot;. The similarity was hardly coincidental
because the model for both had been the lovely Miss Thornton.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">The Spirit of Ecstasy was
now delivered by the Company with every Rolls-Royce. Each was done using
the technique which was thousands of years old and known as the</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
lost-wax method. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">This practice results in
the mould's being destroyed to reveal the casting, which explains why no
two figures are exactly alike. Sykes, assisted by his daughter Jo, remained
responsible for manufacturing the Spirit of Ecstasy for many years. Likewise,
each of the unique creations bore his signature on the plinth. The sculptures
are either </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">signed &quot;Charles Sykes, February
1911&quot; or sometimes &quot;Feb 6, 1911&quot; or &quot;6.2.11&quot;.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">Even afte Rolls-Royce took over the casting
of the figures in 1948 each Spirit of Ectasy continued to receive this
inscription until 1951.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">From</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
1911 to 1914 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">the Spirit of Ectasy was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">silver-plated
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">and thus many thought it a massive piece of
precious metal - one reason for the frequent thefts. In smaller versions,
and now made from highly polished nickel alloy, the radiator decoration
has stood its ground on every Rolls-Royce, including those in the present
range.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">Over the years various alterations
have been made. Those mascots for Rolls-Royce motor cars at the Springfield
plant in the USA were modified. Bowing a little more forward no longer
were they a danger to the bonnet. The original version had touched the
bonnet sides when these were opened without the precaution having been
taken of turning the figure sideways</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000">.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">No enthusiasm for the Spririt
of Ecstasy was shown by Royce,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">who
judged her to be but a</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> fashionable bauble</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">and carped that she</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
spoiled the clear line of the car's bow. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">The
order to create the sculpture was given during the chief engineer's illness
and had been absent. Thus it became a habit that Rolls-Royce cars used
by Royce were rarely driven with a mascot in place.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">When, towards the end of the
twenties and the new body line of Sports Saloons had reduced the height
of the coachwork, Royce was prompted to think about a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">lower
variation </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">of the Spirit of Ecstasy, by which
alteration a driver might benefit from clear vision even with the windscren
lower and his seating position reduced in turn.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Sykes created a kneeling version </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">of
the mascot, whih fulfiled this demand.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Signed
&quot;C. Sykes, 26.1.34&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080"> the inscription
on the plinth revealed the day when the first piece had been finished.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">The kneeling version remained
after the Second World War for the new </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Silver
Wraith and Silver Dawn.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080"> All following models,
however, sported a standing mascot, although this has now been reduced
in size considerably compared to the old one.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">rarely, however, is the correct
term </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Spirit of Ecstasy&quot; </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">used
- detractors remark this was only done at the factory in Crewe. The nickname
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Emily&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">is</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">widespread and Americans speak of the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Silver
Lady&quot;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">or
the &quot;Flying Lady&quot;.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">In 1920 Rolls-Royce had taken
part in a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">competition in Paris </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">for
the most apposite mascot in the world. This they did with a</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">gold-plated </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">Spirit
of Ecstasy, which secured Rolls-Royce</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> first
place. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">From then on gold-plated versions of
the Spirit of Ecstasy were available from the company - at an extra charge.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">Safety regulations in some
countries turned out to be a stumbling block to the fitting of the Spirit
of Ecstasy. She qualified as a sharp-edged piece of metal jutting from
the coachwork, which </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">might injure a victim
in an accident. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">because of this, in Switzerland
during the second half of the seventies, the installation of mascots on
Rolls-Royces was forbidden and purchasers of a new Rolls-Royce delivered
to that country found their mascot in the glove compartment. The problem
was solved with the Silver Spirit and Silver Spur; at the merest knock
the Spirit of Ecstasy</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> sank into the radiator
surround and vanished out of harm;s way.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">Thus
were the safety regulations satisfied.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000080">The woman who had been the
model for the radiator decoration, was not to appreciate its success. Eleanor
Thornton lost her life when, on</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> 30 December
1915, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000080">the SS Persia, whilst on her way to
India, was torpedoed off Crete by a German submarine. She had been accompanying
Lord Montagu who had been directed to take over a command in India. He
was thought to have been killed, too, but survived and was rescued a few
days later by another ship. On his return to England he read the obituary
articles in the newspapers about his own demise.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
