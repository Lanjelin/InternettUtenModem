<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>An explanation of why production of the 4 1/2 litre
Bentley was started is not easy to find. The 3 litre Bentley sold at a
stable level and collected victory after victory on various racing tracks.
Beside this stood the 6 1/2 litre, a model that fulfilled a highly demanding
client's expectations as regards performance and smoothness. At first the
newcomer might be judged as in-house competition to established products.
Some insight into the thinking that precipitated launching a new model
may be had from its first public appearance. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">A prototype
4 1/2 litre Bentley completed the company's team at the 24hr race at Le
Mans in 1927, in support of two 3 litres.</FONT> Quite a lot can be said
for the idea that the creation of the 4 1/2 litre came about because the
3 litre didn't offer promises of further tuning and the 6 1/2 litre couldn't
fit the bill as Bentley's premier model on the race track due to the tyre
problems.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>In the first entry at the 24 hr race the prototype
of the 4 1/2 litre won approval immediately. It was tipped favourite to
win, but had to retire early due to severe damage in the famous White House
accident.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>Around the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">end of 1927</FONT>
series production of the 4 1/2 litre began and the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">first
cars were delivered that year.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>The new model was manufactured in batches of 25
cars each, modifications being incorporated at the beginning of each series
only. These were only minor changes, such as alteration to the radiator
or the use of better balanced crankshafts, because the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">fundamental
construction of the 4 1/2 litre was remarkably sound.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2>It was <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Woolf Barnato's financial
injection</FONT> into Bentley that gave him a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">major
say in the company affairs</FONT> and one of the 'Bentley Boys', Tim Birkin,
won him over to the idea of of achieving more output from the 4 1/2 litre
by fitting a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">supercharger</FONT> and W O Bentley's
opposition to the idea was overruled. Within less than a year four 4 1/2
Bentley's were fitted with <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Roots twin-rotor superchargers.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">A change in the cylinder block, crankshaft,
pistons and gudgeon pins, and oil pump took place.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">On the testbed an output of
some 175 bhp was measured about 45 bhp more than the basic engine. It was
clear on the race track, however, after only a short time, that the extra
power had been gained only at the expense of reliability. Chiefly this
was caused by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">lubrication and cooling problems
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">which often led to the breakdown of the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Blower
Bentleys</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">. It became common place to see cars
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">retiring with damaged engines</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
after having raced through a few laps in record time.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Sales of the 4 1/2 litre Blower
Bentley began in April 1930, at a time when the world economic crisis had
reached an ominous state.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
