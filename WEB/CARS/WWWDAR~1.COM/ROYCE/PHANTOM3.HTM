<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">In October 1935 the new Rolls-Royce
Phantom III complete with V12 engine, was seen for the first time at the
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">London Olympia Motor Show.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
On the Rolls-Royce stand and on the stands of leading coachbuilders no
less than 9 Phantom III's were displayed. Visitors to the show were not
to know that eight of these were dummy chassis, with no engines fitted.
Production of other than experimental cars was such that no production
cars reached the road until May 1936.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>With the production of the
new car, the highest position in the top level of motor car manufacture
was achieved once again. This position was to be as dominant as it had
been during the era of the Silver Ghost.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Almost inaudible and free
from vibrations,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> the engine revved up from
any level and accelerated with an energy that seemed to be unimpaired by
the weight and dimensions of the big automobile. At a time when most other
companies fought a constant battle against blithe unconcern demonstrated
by demanding designers, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rolls-Royce continued
to let theirs work regardless of expense.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">It was not long after delivery
of the first Phantom IIIs that </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">complaints
started to be received from owners</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> who were
using their cars as serious high speed tourers. The new German autobahnen
and Italian autostrade offered stretches of road which permitted any driver
to travel at top speed for long distances and for extended periods. These
conditions were ones that could not have been visualised by designers when
they were planning the new cars of the time, and they resulted in </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">heat-related
failure of the engines. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Rolls-Royce could not avoid
facing the problem because many of these new cars had been exported to
the mainland of Europe and owners from Great Britain also drove on these
new highways during their continental tours. As a result </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">owners
were strictly advised that the Phantom III allowed a top speed of no more
than 75-80 mph</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> to be maintained continuously
without risk of engine failure, higher speeds would only be tolerated for
shorter distances. The response to the solicitous warning was not received
in the spirit in which it was given. Several quarters reproached Rolls-Royce
for admitting that the car publicised as the best car in the world was
technically imperfect. To overcome this probelm, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">in
1938 a modification was introduced</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> in the
form of what was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">referred to as an overdrive</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
- in fact only a fourth gear of higher ratio than hitherto - which reduced
engine speed to less damaging levels.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Despite their best efforts,
the Phantom III remained dogged by stories of technical complications.
Repair after failure cost such enormous amounts that even wealthy owners
noticed the expenditure. This is undoubtedly why Rolls-Royce did not achieve
the hoped for success for the model, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">only
727 Phantom IIIs being manufactured. Outside the United Kingdom only 173
of these were sold. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Of these 65 examples went
to what should have been a large American market; this was twice as much
as France, where 32 Phantom IIIs were sent, although not all of these remained
in that country.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">A check through the chassis
cards of the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts' Club shows that customers for Phantom
III were usually elderly; </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">the buyers' average
age was more than sixty.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> Those cars which
were ordered for use at official state occasions, as State Limousines,
for example, are not included. Beside the shortcomings mentioned above,
a further reason for the sluggish sales might have been that the big Rolls-Royce
built up a reputation as a proper means of transport only for the old and
the rich.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Today, the earlier view has
been replaced, the Phantom III being held in very great esteem as an engineering
creation. More than 80 per cent of the Phantom IIIs built have survived
and this car is </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">considered amongst the most
sought after of all the Rolls-Royces. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Thanks
to the activities of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd in England and the USA&nbsp;based
Rolls-Royce Phantom III Technical Society continued use of these cars in
the intended manner is now assured. Needless to say, as was the case when
the cars were new, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Phantom III owners need
to be amongst the better heeled!</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
