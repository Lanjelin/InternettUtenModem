<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">In 1949 the Rolls-Royce Silver
Dawn appeared. It was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">only for export </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">and
only available in left-hand drive. Its main task was to raise Rolls-Royce's
export sales. This was necessary because the still short raw materials
were allocated to manufacturers in a deal that required them to satisfy
a certain number of export orders first - an arrangement so unwieldy that
it could only have been invented by a bureaucrat!</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Silver Dawn's left hand
drive revealed straight away that it was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">principally
destined for the US car market. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Its chances
of success were better than for the Silver Wraith with its coachbuilt body
or the Bentley Mark VI.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Infact, the Silver Dawn was
nothing more than a badge-engineered Mark VI.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
The standard Steel saloon body was equipped with a Rolls-Royce radiator
and instead of emblems with a winged B, those with the entwined RR were
attached. Minor modifications under the bonnet - and to the bonnet, as
this was shaped to conform with the wings' edges - completed the alterations.
The engine was the one that served in the Silver Wraith, i.e. the version
with a single carburettor and a camshaft profile resulting in a slightly
lower powered output than that of the Mark VI.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>For the American car market
the Silver Wraith was not as attractive as a car which was tailored to
be driven by the owner - it had been designed to be driven by a chauffeur.
This was not the case with the Silver Dawn. Nevertheless this badge-engineered
car still did not successfully fulfil the wishes of American buyers because
it had a four speed gearbox which was manually operated via a lever at
the steering wheel. In motor cars of the luxury class an automatic gearbox
had become common in the USA earlier than in other parts of the world.
Rolls-Royce started to offer this feature in 1952.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Several variants of the Silver
Dawn do exist, distinguishable partly because of their noticeable technical
modifications. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The original model from 1949
had a capacity of 4,257 cc and was always left hand drive</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">;
right hand drive later became available strictly to special order only.
From 1951 the Silver Dawn was available with body unchanged but fitted
with the bigger engine of 4,566 cc. This version was to become referred
to as &quot;Big Bore - Small Boot&quot;. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The early models of the Mark
VI and the Silver Dawn were both extremely prone to rusting. This was the
first attempt by Rolls-Royce in the field of producing a complete car.
The necessity for careful precautions against later corrosion had not been
understood. This problem was exacerbated by the quality of material - particularly
sheet steel - in the early post-war period which was considerably below
the usual Rolls-Royce standard.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">There are more Silver Dawns
about today than might be expected</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> - usually
extensively restored, but some still in original condition. The latter
group are, more often than not, guaranteed to be in need of ground-up restoration,
with the most expensive part being the body repairs.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
