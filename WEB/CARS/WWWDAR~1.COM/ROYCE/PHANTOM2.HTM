<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Through an announcement in
the September 1929 issue of the magazine The Autocar, it was confirmed
that </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">production of the Phantom I had come
to an end.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> It made room for the Rolls-Royce
Phantom II which made its </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">debut at the London
Olympia Motor Show in October 1929.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The chassis offered some up
to date innovations. Notable was the use of half elliptic springs for both
axles. In the case of the rear axle these were underslung which, used in
conjunction with a lower frame, created a considerable reduction in height
to the order of some 9 inches.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Engine, clutch and gearbox
were combined into one unit</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> and instead of
a sub frame being employed the engine was bolted directly to the chassis.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>To shorten the delay between
order and delivery of a Phantom II, a subframe was provided which was mounted
on rubber. This allowed erection of the coachwork separately on the subframe
during the time that the chassis and engine were still in the course of
production or testing.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The engine's power potential
was stretched almost to the limit.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> In spite
of this a direct comparison of competitors showed a considerable amount
of difference in performance.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Rolls-Royce had deliberately
cultivated the image of elegance and supreme quality for their motor cars
and the characteristics thought most desirable were not top speed and acceleration,
but perfect driving manners and reliable operation. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">These
characteristics had achieved for them a safe position in the home and export
markets</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> amongst purchasers who shared these
values. Inevitably sales were lost to the competition when a prospective
purchaser felt that high performance was of paramount importance, and by
progressively increasing the output of their engines, Rolls-Royce were
tacitly admitting the problem.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">In comparison with the Silver
Ghost and even the Phantom I, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">the loaded engine
was no longer wholly inaudible.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> Some sound
could be detected although at a very low level and through frequencies
transmitted to the chassis.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">An innovation in the Phantom
II was the use of a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">synchromesh gearbox</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
for the first time, a change that didn't however cause any difficulties.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The closing of the US subsidiary
at Springfield wasn't followed by the entire loss of the American market.
Making best use of the experience which had been gained in the USA, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">two
series of left hand drive Phantom IIs were produced.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
Beside several modifications to fit the chassis for American conditions
these motor cars were fitted with central gear change and handbrake levers.
</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Rolls-Royce's desire to remain
in the USA even after the closing of the factory there is highlighted by
the endurance tests run at Chateauroux. During production of the Phantom
II from 1929 until 1935 a total of eleven experimental cars were tested
with extreme care in France. Of these only two were left hand drive.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The initiative for the development
of a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">special model,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
the Phantom II Continental, was taken by Royce who was fascinated by the
sports saloon bodies which had begun to appear on other chassis. Although
considerably shorter than other bodies they offered four doors and seated
four to five passengers. the rear seat was not above, but in front of,
the rear axel. This didn't offer as much space as usual but without the
division found on limousines rear seat passengers found more than enough
foot room. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">After detailed inspection
of one car of this new generation a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Riley
Nine Monaco,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> Royce submitted a plan to create
a Phantom II of a special sporting lay-out to be fitted with a sports saloon
body. The sales department frankly disapproved of this idea. This didn't
discourage Royce, of course. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Following a detailed sketch
from </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Evernden</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
striking coachwork was built by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Barker.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
The bodywork's attractiveness was enhanced by paintwork in light blue with
mother of pearl effect. Royce inspected the car and send Evernden on a
demonstration run to France and Spain. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">At
a Concours d'Elegance in fashionable Biarritz the Rolls-Royce Phantom II
was placed first,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> thus generating much interest
in the style. More interest followed after the car had caused a sensation
in Madrid. At this stage customers began approaching the London sales office.
When Everneden returned to England he was surprised to discover that the
coleagues from the sales office who had been so reserved in the beginning
had already arranged for a brochure to be produced and had christened the
model the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Phantom II Continental.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
