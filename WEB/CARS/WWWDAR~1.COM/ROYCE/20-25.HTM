<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>1929 saw the debut of the
further development in the small Rolls-Royce concept, when the 20/25 was
introduced, initially as an alternative but, in reality, as the successor
to the 20 hp.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The significant change was
to the engine.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> A bigger bore had increased
the capacity to 3,669 c which, in conjunction with a higher compression
ratio of 4.6:1, now gave a more satisfactory power output. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The
20/25 could exceed without any problem the 60 mph mark (100 km/h) </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">and,
when fitted with a body of low wind resistance, in excess of 75 mph (120
km/h) might be expected.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The increase in power had
not changed the highly esteemed qualities of the model : the engine still
ran inaudibly and the usual technique of changing into top gear soon after
moving off and remaining there, suited the 20/25 because of its even greater
torque.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The earliest 20/25s were identical
in chassis to the final production of the Twenty, the larger capacity engine
with new cross-flow cyinder head being the only distinguishing feature,
and the two models were produced side by side during 1929. The Twenty had
by then received </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">vertical radiator shutters</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
like those of the Phantoms, and the 20/25 followed suit. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The chassis design teams worked
conitnuously to make improvements. Already in the first year the new model
was modified by being given a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">longer chassis.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
Flexible wheel mountings were introduced and the exhaust system and charging
system were improved. An increase in the compression to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">5.25:1</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
resulted in more engine power and more efficient use of the higher octane
petrol that was becoming available. During 1932 the compression was raised
yet again to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">5.75:1.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">A considerable improvement
in roadholding and passenger comfort was promoted by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">modified
shock absorbers, which were fitted from 1932 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">onwards.
They didn't come up to expectastions completely, however, and in </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">1934
adjustable shock absorbers were fitted</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">. These
permitted adjustment via a lever on the steering wheel and ensured appropriate
settings for low and high-speed drive conditions.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The series of &quot;small&quot;
Rolls Royces which had begun with the the Rolls-Royce 20 hp, found a most
successful continuation in the 20/25. With a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">production
figure of 3,827</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> this model turned out to have
the highest sales in the period between the wars.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Since 1922 the &quot;small&quot;
Rolls-Royce had been priced at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&pound;1,100;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
although a small increase had occurred on the lauch of the 20/25 this had
later been reduced and thus increased production costs which had taken
place in the meantime, and costs accrued as a result of the model change,
had not been passed to the customer. The critics did not precipitate immediate
changes to reduce production overheads or increase chassis prices. Even
for the the following model, the 1936 25/30 hp the company asked an unchanged
price of &pound;1,100.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The problem of high production
costs resulted in Rolls-Royce's first attempts to economise. In the past
the purchase of parts from outside suppliers had been limited to electrical
components - and even then the company had laid down strict standards of
quality. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">In the last series of the 20/25 model,
use was made for the first time of components from independent suppliers
for mechanical parts. Thus the clutch was supplied by Borg &amp; Beck and
the steering box manufactured by Marles.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> These
were clearly economy measures for Rolls-Royce. Nevertheless, the suppliers
charged higher prices to Rolls-Royce than to other car manufacturers because
of the short production runs involved - and Rolls-Royce could not be isolated
from the effects of asking suppliers for high quality standards.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
