<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>At the top of the Rolls-Royce
hierachy was placed the biggest ever Rolls-Royce; the Phantom V.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Although its name implies
that it was the natural successor to the Phantom IV, it is more probable
that it was intended to replace the Silver Wraith.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Phantom V was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">based
on the Silver Cloud II</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">, sharing its newly
developed V8 engine and the four speed automatic gearbox based on the General
Motors Hydramatic design. Coupled to the gearbox was the brake servo. The
chassis clearly followed the Silver Cloud's layout, but was lengthened
and strengthened considerably by massive reinforcements and front and rear
track were of greater dimensions. A final drive of particularly low gear
permitted unfussy progress at a speed only slightly above walking pace.
This was provided for use during, for example, ceremonial occasions.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Although the Phantom V had
the same wheelbase as the Phantom IV, the overall length measured some
10 inches more for the new model. It should be remembered however, that
a comparison with the Silver Wraith makes better sense. In this context
the increase cannot be described as other than enormous because the wheelbase
of the Phantom V was 145 inches whereas the Silver Wriath, in its later,
long wheelbase version measured 133 inches.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">A curious side to this is
that the sales catalogue and all other press information published an </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">incorrect
wheelbase figure of 144 inches</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> - this was
corrected some thirty years later in 1989.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Vast motor cars built to be
driven by chauffeurs and fitted with unique coachwork to the customer's
specification were not in great demand by 1959. The Phantom V, therefore,
was manufactured to fill a highly specialised niche, a niche nonetheless
profitable for its smallness. the series achieved overall production of
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">516 examples.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">By this time the number of
independent coachbuilders had dwindled to very few companies indeed. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The
Phantom V was Hooper's swansong.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> After completing
the body for the experimental Phantom V </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">(chassis
no 44EX), </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">which had been clothed before production
of the series started, Hooper were to build only one body for the type.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">In December 1959 Hooper ceased production.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
Following a design by Hooper and supervised by their chief designer, Osmond
Rivers, a body was built by </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Chapron in France</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">,
to be followed some time later by a second of similar layout. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">H
J Mulliner </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">recorded nine bodies of their production
before this company, with its fine tradition, was taken over by Rolls-Royce.
Park Ward, with 156 bodies and H J Mulliner, Park Ward, after the merger
of both companies in 1962, with 152 bodies, were responsible for the greater
share of coachwork for this ceremonial car.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">As a moderately successful
indpendent company </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">James Young</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
maintained themselves with 195 bodies, some of these being finished as
sedanca de villes. By 1960 this form of coachwork was so antiquated that
these james Young sedancas are very likely to remain the last of the type
to be built.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
