<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">At the London showrooms, 14/15
Conduit Street, in May 1925, the Silver Ghost replacement was launched
with the name </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Rolls-Royce New Phantom.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">To a large degree the chassis
was identical to that of the Silver Ghost. There was a choice of two wheelbases,
143 1/2 inches or 150 1/2 inches. The power came from a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">six
cylinder in line engine of 7,668 cc.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Fortuitously the new model
was launched in time to stabilise the falling sales figures. Rolls-Royce
advertising at this time made the point that more orders existed than could
be fulfilled and therefore a waiting list was unavoidable. In the face
of almost 300 unsold Silver Ghosts - the better part of one year's production
- such an observation was less than the whole truth.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Scrapping was thus inevitable
although Rolls-Royce used the term &quot;reduced to produce&quot; to disguise
an embarrassing situation. To take such a radical measure could have been
avoided. The new Phantom was offered in addition to the Silver Ghost and
it was particularly emphasised that the latter still remained obtainable.
This offer was taken up however in only one or two cars. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">The new Phantom sold very
well and in specific reference to the new model the statement about demand
exceeding supply was true. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The success was
remarkable </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">because the competition in the
luxury class had become more fierce.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>The new Phantom had not been
launched long when speed tests at Brooklands provided an unwelcome surprise.
Timekeepers certified that the new model when carrying an average open
tourer coachwork was capable of a top speed lower than that reached in
1911 by the Silver Ghost London-Edinburgh version.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">C G Johnson insisted on an
immediate remedy.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> His idea was to offer a
mildly tuned alternative in addition to the standard type. It was argued
that instead of achieving a higher top speed by finding increased power
from changes to the engine it also might be gained by reducing the weight
of the coachwork.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>Johnson capitulated and to
his order a New Phantom was fitted by Barker with a light tourer body -
but again it failed to satisfy his requirements during a speed test at
Brooklands. Barker then created a tourer following strictly a design by
H I F Evernden which did not compromise on lightweight construction. The
Lightweight achieved more than 89 mph (143 km/h). Following the same design,
further new Phantoms for trials were fitted with lightweight bodies by
Hooper and Jarvis.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Changes to the characteristic
shape of the radiator which had been suggested by Royce as a means of reducing
drag was opposed by Johnson. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">Without any question
the radiator caused a noticeable absence of streamlining but it was worth
its weight in gold as a trade mark. In the Rolls-Royce development department
the lightweight tourer built at C G Johnson's was called the Claude Johnson
Special but sadly he was to have no further influence in development -
in April 1926 he died after a short illness.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+2>By this time the New Phantom
was already known as the Phantom I. The model had become rechristened to
distinguish it from its successor, the Phantom II.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
