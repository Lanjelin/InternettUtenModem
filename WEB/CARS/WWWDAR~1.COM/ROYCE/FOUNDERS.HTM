<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Royce was the son of an impoverished
miller</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> from Alwalton near Peterborough and
he had, by any standards, a difficult start in life. He began work at the
age of 10, selling newspapers for W H Smith at Bishopsgate and Clapham
Junction.But he soon left that to find his first real job working as an
apprentice for the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Great Northern Railway</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">in Peterborough. It was while he was there
that he learnt most of the basics of engineering,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
and it is also obvious that even at that age, Royce was determined to do
well because he set about teaching himself foreign languages, algebra and
the fundamentals of electricity. Three years later, he moved to a firm
of machine tool makers in Leeds where he worked a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">54
hour week for just 11 shillings (55p).</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> His
next move was to London where his self taught knowledge of electricity
enabled him to get a job with one of the pioneer electric light companies.
From there, at the age of 19, he went to Liverpool as technical advisor
to the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lancashire Maxim and Western Electric
Company.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> And then, just three years later,
he and a partner, A E Claremont, set up in business in cooke Street, Manchester,
<IMG SRC="COOKE-ST.GIF" tppabs="http://www.darkforce.com/royce/cooke-st.gif" BORDER=2 HEIGHT=300 WIDTH=351 ALIGN=RIGHT>making
electric light fittings, dynamos and cranes. Such was Royce's determination
that by the turn of the century the order books were full and the business
was going from strength to strength.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">All this, of course, was quite
an achievement for someone who had started almost literally with nothing.
But the real turning point was yet to come. This happened in 1903 when
Royce bought himself a second hand </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">French
Decauville car</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> for the journey between his
home and the factory. The car, he found, was difficult to start, it overheated
with depressing regularity, it vibrated, it was unreliable and the ignition
system was hopelessly inefficient. (This may be the point which annoyed
Royce the most. He was, after all, quite an expert in electricity in his
own right ). Royce eventually became so disillusioned with the car that
he decided, in characteristic style, that he could do better himself. And
just a few days later, he announced to his colleagues that he was going
to build three 2 cylinder motor cars of his own design. The first of these,
designed and built almost completely by Royce himself, rolled out of the
factory gates in the spring of 1904. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">The first
car was a success in almost every way; </FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">it
started easily, ran smoothly and quickly was very reliable, something which
never failed to impress everyone who saw or rode in the car.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">About the same time, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Charles
Rolls</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> was also in business for himself (like
Royce, very successfully). But achieving this had been rather less of a
struggle for Rolls than it was for his future partner. Rolls was born into
the aristocracy, being the third son of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Lord
and Lady Llangattock.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> The landed gentry, of
course, were never expected to work in those days and Rolls, like most
young men in similar families, was groomed for a life of ease and luxury.
he was educated at </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Eton and Cambridge University
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">where his natural flair for engineering work
enabled him to gain a degree in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Sciences.
It was while he was still at Cambridge that he began to take an interest
in the fledgling motor industry. He went to France with his father and
on his return bought himself a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">3 3/4hp Peugeot,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
a car which soon made a name for itself with Rolls at the wheel. It was
the first car ever seen at Cambridge and when he drove it to the family
home at Monmouth, the journey took him two days including many hours spent
working on the car at the roadside to keep it going. By the time Rolls
left Cambridge University, he was probably the most skilful driver in the
country. And he proved his skill by winning the first 1000 mile (1600 km)
reliability trial promoted by Sir Alfred Harmsworth so convincingly that
a special gold medal was struck in his honour. Later, in 1903, Rolls set
a new world record of 93 mph (150 km/h) driving an 80 HP Mors at Phoenix
Park in Dublin.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Meanwhile in 1902, Rolls had
gone into business for himself selling motor cars and the firm, known as
C&nbsp;S&nbsp;Rolls and Co. quickly became a leading motor car distributor.
A few months after its formation Rolls persuaded </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Claude
Johnson</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> to join the firm as a partner. Johnson
had built up a reputation as a brilliant organiser of motoring events and
was the first secretary of what is now the RAC. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Often
known as the &quot;hyphen&quot; in Rolls-Royce,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
he was responsible for much of the growth of the Rolls-Royce company, especially
after Rolls' death in 1910 and Royce's breakdown shortly afterwards. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Rolls, however, still had
two major ambitions. First he wanted his name to be associated with cars
in the same way as Chubb's was with safes and Steinway's was with pianos.
And, secondly, he wanted to find a British car as good or preferably better
that the foreign cars he was then selling. But he very nearly missed his
chance to achieve both these aims at once because when </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Henry
Edmunds,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000"> a shareholder in Royce Ltd, told
Rolls about Henry Royce's new 2 cylinder car, Rolls assumed that it would
be as noisy and inefficient as all the other 2 cylinder cars on the road.
He was, of course, wrong and Henry Edmunds persuaded Rolls to make the
trip up to Manchester to see the car. Rolls, Edmunds and Royce met at the
Midland Hotel in Manchester and the meeting was an immediate success. Rolls
tried the car and became a wholehearted enthusiast and he said afterwards
that Royce </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">&quot;was the man I have been looking
for for years&quot;. </FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">An agreement was quickly reached
giving Rolls exclusive sales rights for all the cars Royce could produce
and the two men really got down to work. A 10 HP car, a 10 HP chassis and
engine, a 15 HP chassis, a 20 HP car and a 30 HP 6 cylinder engine were
all exhibited at the Paris Salon in early December 1904. And then, on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">December
23rd, a contract between the two companies was signed, including a clause
stipulating that all the cars should be called &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot;.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">The company which would soon be building &quot;the
best cars in the world&quot; was in business.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#800000">Unfortunately, Rolls was only
to enjoy the success of the company which bore his name for a few more
years because on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">12th July 1910</FONT><FONT COLOR="#800000">
he tragically met his death in a flying accident at Bournemouth. In contrast,
Royce was to spend many more years at the head of the company stamping
his unique personality on Rolls-Royce motor cars right up to his death
on </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">22nd April 1933.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
