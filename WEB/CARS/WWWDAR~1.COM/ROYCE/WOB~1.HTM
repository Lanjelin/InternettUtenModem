the dimensions were 80 by 149 mm, a long stroke even for those days. At

to horsepower. However the RAC horsepower rating of 15.9 would have made
the engine seem smaller than it was, for the rating system was calculated
on the bore and took no account of Bentley's unusually long stroke. The
rest of the car was conventional, with a four speed gearbox controlled
by a right handgear lever, semi-elliptic leaf springs all round and brakes
on the rearwheels only (until 1924). It was announced in The Autocar in
May 1919, the description being accompanied by a drawing by the famous

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">was born named after the Mulsanne straight
at Le Mans, harking back to the days of the Bentley Boys, while the Rolls-Royce
was the Silver Spirit. The new cars were styled by the Austrian-born Fritz
Feller and had a heavier look than that of the T Series, giving the</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
impression of more car for the money.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
spring of 1982 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">came a high-performance model
which was to begin the process of distancing Bentley from Rolls-Royce.
This was the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Mulsanne Turbo,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">which used a Garrett AiResearch turbo-charger
to give a boost in power of about 50 per cent, from 200 to300 bhp. Top
speed was limited to 135 mph (217 km/h) by a sensor which restricted turbo
boost but acceleration from</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> 0 to 60 mph took
only 7.5seconds,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> no mean feat for a car which
weighed 4950 pounds (2245 kg). TheTurbo's body was similar to that of the
Mulsanne, but it could be easily identified by the radiator shell, which
was painted in the same colour as the rest of the body, instead of silver.
The makers were adamant that the Turbo would never carry a Rolls-Royce
radiator, and it has been calculated that if it did it would need an additional
35 bhp to achieve the same performance, because of the drag imposed by
the square radiator shell.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+2><FONT COLOR="#000000">The sporting image of the
new Bentleys resulted in a dramatic improvement in sales. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">In
1986,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> when the group sold 2603 cars, the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ratio
between Rolls and Bentley was 60:40</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">and</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">

by a new and more individual coupe, the</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Continental
R. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">The letter designation was chosen as an
evocation of the R-type Continental of the 1950s and the new car is in
the same spirit, a limited production, higher-performance car sold at a
price considerably above that of the saloons. The four-seater coupe body
was designed by Ken Greenley and John Heffernan and was derived from a
show car of 1985 called the Project 90. The engine was slightly tweaked
to give greater power and torque, output now being an estimated 333 bhp.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Two years' production had already been sold
before the examples were delivered, and some orders were placed only on
sight of photographs.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
September 1992 there arrived a new variant called the Brooklands. Priced
at £91,489, it replaced the Eight and the Mulsanne S and featured
a new bonnet and green badge harking back to the vintage GreenLabel Bentleys,
new air dam and alloy wheels. Inside the electric column-mounted gearchange
was moved to the floor.</FONT></FONT></I></B></P>
