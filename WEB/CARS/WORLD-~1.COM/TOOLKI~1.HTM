The best words I've found on this subject came from
<B>jonm@duncan.intel.com</B> in response to my inquiry to
<b>wetleather@mom.isc-br.com</b>:

<blockquote>"Each scoots tool kit will be somewhat different, although many items will crossover.  
The contents of the toolkit are determined by asking the question: "What repair jobs can I do on the 
road and what tools are needed?"  An easy way to do this is to use the toolkit for the regular 
work/maintenance on the bike and if you need a special tool add it to the kit."</blockquote>

The following is a list I compiled mostly from <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#86" tppabs="http://mom.isc-br.com/WetLeather/">Wetleather</a>
