My <I>FXDS Dyna Convertible</I> finally arrived on March 13th 1996.  I am absolutely in love with her.
I had no idea just how amazing she would be.  I really love the changes the Motor Company made to the
Dyna chassis for '96.  The new stepped seat is almost a full inch lower and the hand controls were
finally updated.  I had figured that it would be just like my old sporty, only bigger.  It ain't.  The
big twins are a completely different animal.  <p>

I had a list of immediate mods planned for the Dyna Glide, but many of them have changed now that
the bike is in my garage.  The biggest change is the suspension.  The stock suspension isn't bad at
all.  The front forks have a much better feel than I expected.  Diving is not the problem it was
on my Sporty.  And I can't believe that the rear shocks actually feel good.  The Dyna Convertible
comes with the longest shocks available and the difference is really noticable.  She still bottoms
out when I'm riding two-up, so I still plan to upgrade to a set of Works Performance shocks.
Here's my current list of mods:<P>
