Naw, nicht, not. I don't know where these misconceptions about
gasoline grades comes from, but let me assure you, all unleaded
gasolines burn at the same temperature, regardless of octane rating.
The only exception to this would be gasahol.<p>

Gasoline octane numbers are adjusted by two methods: adding anti-knock
compounds such as tetraethyl lead (now illegal in many states) OR
using higher refining temperatures and pressures to reform the hydro-
carbon molecules into more knock resistant compounds. Obviously,
unleaded gas uses the second method, which is why unleaded gas costs
more than leaded.<p>

Let it be known to all, that regardless of the octane, there is more or
less the SAME amount of energy (about 115,000 btu/gal) in gasoline grades.
Octane numbers are adjusted by tweeking the proportion of about a hundred
different hydrocarbon compounds that form gasoline. This adjustment does
not effect the combustion temperture, just the fuel's resistance to knock.<p>

There IS a big difference in the blending of fuel depending on the
climate and season. One of the big things they control is vapor pressure.
This is to reduce hydrocarbon pollution from evaporation in the summer.
Also, they add a lot of butane to the gas in winter to allow the engine
to start.<p>
 
Also, in many areas, they now add oxygenates to the gasoline to lean
the mixture in the winter, which also reduces hydrocarbon pollution.
These oxygenates (MTBE, Ethanol, and sometimes Methanol) will definately
affect engine performance, most notably fuel economy. In *theory*, there
is only 2-3% less energy in oxygenated fuel, but I sure as hell notice
more than a 3% drop in fuel economy with oxy-gas. Here in the Bay Area
of California, there has been a very noticable drop in smog in the winter,
so I guess the oxy-gas deal is working.<p>

Back to carb farts and octane, there has to be something else going
on, as the combustion temp theory is boloney. Gas companies often add
other compounds, such as deposit control and anti-icing agents to the
high octane grades, mainly as a sales gimick to get you buy the high
priced gas whether you need it or not. It is *possible* that this might
be causing the farts in cold weather. I tend to use 87 octane MOST the
time, and run a tank of 92 octane thru every fourth tank or so to clean
out deposits.<p>

It is also possible that in the winter, you might need to tweek the
idle mixture screw a little to help cure the carb farts. Air temperature
can also affect the burn *rate* in the combustion chamber, and thus
require tweeking the ignition timing. This again has to do with gasoline
volitility in the winter. Oh well, who the fuck knows? I've rambled
too long on this thread, don't ya think? ;^)<p>
