Couple of things:<p>

1)  Flow:  you want to be able to flow as much exhaust gas as is practical.  This means
low-restriction.<p>

2)  Scavenging:  you want the flow to have as high a velocity as possible so that it properly scavenges
the exhaust gases out of the head when the exhaust valve opens.  This places a practical limit on the
inner diameter of the pipe that can be used with a given engine.<p>

3)  Reversion:  when the pressure wave from the exhaust pulse reaches the end of the pipe, it will be
reflected.  At certain engine speeds at which the whole system (exhaust AND induction) are in the
proper resonance, this pressure wave (reflected as a pulse of rarefied air), will reach the head at the
precise moment of overlap in which both the exhaust valve and the intake valve are open, producing
a partial vacuum that helps to draw air into the cylinder.  In general, this will only happen over a
narrow rpm range.  For a Harley, there will only be one such range on the safe side of redline.  At all
other engine speeds, a compression pulse blows through to the carburetor and is carbureted once on
the way out, and again on the way in, producing a rich stumble and a resultant loss of power at that
rpm range.  In general, the "sweet spot" where the reversion pulse helps will be well over 5000rpm,
so pure straight pipes do NO GOOD AT ALL on street machines.<p>
     
Generally, you will want some mechanical device (usually baffles of some sort) to break up the
reversion pulse so that the rich stumble goes away.  You trade off the high end power to gain low end
and midrange since you do not want multiple carburetion of the exhaust pulse when it blows through
the carb and gets sucked back in.  The way to prevent this is by using baffles of some kind.  This
"breaking up of the reversion pulse" is often confused with "backpressure."<p>

Repeat after me, folks:  BACKPRESSURE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING.  We are dealing with an acoustic 
phenomenon here, as well as pure wave mechanics.  The purpose of the baffles, besides keeping the bike 
quiet, is to break up the reversion pulse so that it doesn't screw up your carburetion.  Period.<p>

In general, flow and scavenging should be matched to the capabilities of the induction end of the
system, as you have wave mechanical difficulties if one end of the system can flow more than the
other. Generally, you should pick the pipe AFTER you've picked the carb, cam, and headwork.  Just
slapping on a pipe because you like the sound will hurt overall performance rather than help it.<p>

Ideally, you'd have laminar flow through the system, except for the turbulence you need in the
combustion cycle to get a complete burn.  By matching the capabilities of induction, head, cam, and
exhaust, you will most closely approximate laminar flow (laminar meaning "ordered". As an example,
when people line up, they can get through a doorway much faster and more easily than when a crowd
tries to push through the door.  The lined up crowd is laminar flow; the pushy crowd is turbulent
flow).<p>

<h1>Some performance data:</h1>
<B>From Seth Zirin:</B><BR>
Here is some pipe data I got from Dennis at Bub Enterprises on 6/2/92.  I forget the year bike but think it was a 1990 FXR.  It had a stock carb, stock ignition with rev limiter disabled (Screaming Eagle), and an Andrews EV-3 cam.<p>

They set the bike up on a DynoJet dyno and tested the following sets of pipes under the exact same conditions.  The pipes tested were:<p>

<PRE>HD Stock			The stock HD exhaust system with the
				crossover as it left the factory.
HD Off Road			HD "slit fit" off-road mufflers on
				the stock header pipes with the
				crossover.
Python I			The original Python Pipes.
Super Trapp 2->1 (18 disks)	A SuperTrapp 2 into 1 system with
				18 disks installed.  He didn't mention
				the type of end cap.
Rich 2 into 1			The Rich Products ThunderHeader that
				has been the topic of recent discussion.
Bub Bad Dog			Bub Enterprises Bad Dog pipes.  This is
				their product.  I have these on my bike.
<p>
				Rear Wheel HP at RPM
			2500	3000	4000	5000	6000
			------------------------------------
HD Stock		17	26	40	42	41
HD Off Road		19	33	49	57	54
Python I		20	32	46	55	38
Super Trapp 2->1
(18 disks)		19	34	46	52	56
Rich 2 into 1		18	30	50	58	60
Bub Bad Dog		21	35	50	60	71</PRE>

<p>

During their testing, they found that the engine produced 2 HP more at 6000 RPM with a full tank than with a half tank.  They compared results with S&S and Jerry Branch and they also have seen this.  A fuller tank probably keeps the float bowl at the full line a larger percentage of the time.<P>

I don't remember how the following noise measurements were taken.  The actual method isn't really important since all measurements were taken under the exact same conditions and are meant to be compared, not judged as absolute values.<p>

<PRE>				Noise (dB) at RPM
			2500	3000	4000	5000	6000
			------------------------------------
HD Stock		80	80	81	82	84
HD Off Road		86	88	92	94	96
Python I		87	89	91	94	96
Super Trapp 2->1
(18 disks)		82	82	87	96	93
Rich 2 into 1		88	90	92	96	99
Bub Bad Dog		83	84	90	93	93</PRE><p>
