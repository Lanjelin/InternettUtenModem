<b>Heck no, dude!  If you disassemble a EVO motor, and disassemble  
a Knucklehead motor, and put the two in boxes, and asked a blind 
man to tell you which was which...  Do you see *my* point? ;^)  
HD BT motor topology has not changed since 1936.  Where shall we 
start?
<ul>
<li>V twin
<li>Air cooled
<li>45 degree included angle
<li>common crank pin on two flywheels
<li>Siamesed connecting rods
<li>Highly undersquare bore/stroke
<li>Roller bearing crank/rods
<li>Single cam driven from crank pinion
<li>oil pump on rear driven by worm gear on crank
<li>pushrod actuated overhead valves
<li>single carburetor (well, except for the new EFI!)</ul>
The only things that have really changed are the materials they 
are made from, the head designs, and the alternator/generator 
location, and the types of peripherals i.e. carbs, ignitions.
That's the beauty of HD! That's why we love 'em all!

I can see it now, in 50 years, when were all a bunch of old gray 
limp-dicks, we'll be setting around in the nursing home arguing 
how Blockheads were the last of the true Harleys, and that the new 
[insert catchy name here]-head Harleys are only for Rubs/posers/
wannabes. Funny how the more things change, the more they stay
the same, huh? ;^)

Later,
