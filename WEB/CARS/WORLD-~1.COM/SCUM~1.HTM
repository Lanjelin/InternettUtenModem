<I>A couple quotes from our favorite lawyers:</I><P>

<blockquote>"...some starry eyed individuals who access the Net think of Cyberspace as a community, with rules, 
regulations and codes of behaviour.  Don't you believe it!  There is no community. Perhaps there was some 
truth in that concept in the past, when the Internet was used exclusively by a small, homogeneous group 
of academics and corporate technical researchers.  Today, with Internet access available to everyone, 
Iway travellers reflect every heterogeneous nuance of the world population. <P> 

Along your journey, someone may try to tell you that in order to be a good Net "citizen", you must follow 
the rules of the Cyberspace community.  Don't listen.  The only laws and rules with which you should 
concern yourself are those passed by the country, state and city in which you live.  The only ethics 
you should adopt as you pursue wealth on the Iway are those dictated by the religious faith you have 
chosen to follow and your own good conscience."<br>
<i>  - Laurence Canter & Martha Siegel ("the Green Card 
Lawyers"), from an early review copy of their book, "How To Make a Fortune on the Information 
Superhighway," 1994.</i></blockquote>

<P>

<blockquote>Martha Siegel, part of the legal duo that caused an uproar last April by sending e-mail messages 
advertising their "green card" services to 6,000 Usenet groups, thinks the Internet is prime for 
regulation:  "(T)here's no great difference between communications through the computer and other 
media.  That's why we believe the FCC should officially take control of the Internet, just as it has 
all other communications media.<P>

The Internet is too big and powerful to go without official regulation.  The public needs to be 
protected, and we have no doubt it will be.  In a very short time, the dust will settle, and the 
mainstreaming of the Internet will be  complete."<br>
<i> - (Inc. Technology, Summer '95 p.44)</i></blockquote>

<H2>So let me get this straight...</H2>

We are to ignore the rules and etiquette established on the Net, but the wide open freedom of the 
Net is too scary and must be regulated by the government?  Do you want rules or don't you?  Excuse 
me?  It's hard to understand you with your head up your ass.<P>

It's amazing that even in America, freedom scares some people.  "<I>The public needs to be protected</I>"
 is just a weasel's way of saying "I won't take responsibility for my own freedom.  I want government to 
control it.  That way, I will never have to take the blame."  This kind of spineless scum doesn't 
deserve to live in a free country, and I guess if they have their way, they won't.  <P>

I've said it before and I'll say it again: <B>Freedom=Responsibility.</B><P>  Or as the <B>Big B. 
Franklin</B> put it, so many, many years ago:<p>

<I><b>"They that will sacrifice liberty in exchange for temporary safety deserve neither liberty or 
safety."</b></I><p>
