# ----------------- 
# In a unique and unprecedented move into the hospitality business,</PRE>

<B>read: in an attempt to grub more money</B>

<PRE># Harley-Davidson has enlisted New York restauranteur Marc Packer to open
# the first Harley-Davidson Cafe this fall in New York City.</PRE>

<B>Something tells me that a restauranteur shouldn't be involved in anything H-D does. What they need is some old Army cook that smokes large, smelly cigars.</B>

<PRE># According to Packer, who was chosen from hundreds of restauranteurs
# around the world, the HDC will be the world's first interactive
# restaurant</PRE>

<B>Interactive restaurant?  As opposed to what?</B>

<PRE>#  to immortalize 90 years of Harley-Davidson history.  The
# Harley-Davidson Cafe was created in response to the rapidly growing
# number of motorcycle enthusiasts across the United States and the
# public's greater understanding that motorcycles are driven by people
# from all walks of life.</PRE>

<B>read: this is a great way to squeeze more money out of the Japanese and European tourists.</B>

<PRE>#   "To me, and to millions around the world,
# Harley-Davidson represents a piece of Americana, " Packer said.
# Located at the southeast corner of 56th Street and Avenue of the
# Americas (convenient to the 57th Street corridor and some of New York's
# top hotels), the Harley-Davidson Cafe will be run by some of the top
# designers, culinary wizards, set designers and businessmen.
# 
# The kitchen will be headed by renowned chef Drew Nieporent (Montrachet
# and Tribeca Grill) and will offer a varied menu of moderately priced
# and sophisticated cuisine.</PRE>

<B>Somehow, I don't quite picture a chef making Harley food.<P>

Hey, who's gonna supply the designer drugs? Ya gotta have drugs at a Harley place. (that last sentence was brought to you by the Committee to Preserve Old Stereotypes)</B>

<PRE>#   Architect/designer Tony Chi (Va Bene in
# Hong Kong, Sichuan Court in Jakarta, the Hyatt Regency in Osaka [and
# Cafe Society and Tina's in NYC - ed])</PRE>

<B>No no no.  They need a guy that designs and builds (forget that architect crap) garages and machine shops. Oh yeah, he's gotta be union too.</B>

<PRE>#   will be designing the magnificent
# interior and exterior which will merge the disparate worlds of sports,
# music, film, television, and politics in one grand showplace.</PRE>

<B>God, this is sounding more and more like Dollywood.</B>

<PRE>#   Allen
# Bank (Walt Disney, Radio City Music Hall, Studio 54) will create
# special effects that will dazzle the masses and rival some of
# Hollywood's most extravagant sci-fi films.</PRE>

<B>Just what I want, a dazzling laser light show while I'm choking down a 1/3 lb grease bomb.</B>

<PRE># The Harley-Davidson Cafe will use the latest video technology,
# theatrical lighting, set designs and special effects to blur the
# boundaries between fantasy and reality.</PRE>

<B>"...what you see infront of you is not really a burger but a close simulation of one. On the other hand, the check just handed to you is real."</B>

<PRE>#    Diners will fully experience
# the Harley-Davidson life-style and its impact on American pop culture
# in an environment that titillates through constant movement and change
# in perspective.</PRE>

<B>What a bunch of crap.<P>

This is like T.G.I.F.'s meets Harley-Davidson.<P>

Who ever wrote this marketdroid crap should shot.</B>

<PRE>#   Patrons will be able to touch, ride and live the way
# of Harley.  Plumes of smoke and light will effuse from the floor below
# and welcome the customer to the world of Harley-Davidson.  Patrons will
# be able to cruise down Route 66 and relive scenes from their favorite
# Harley movies such as "Easy Rider"</PRE>

<B>Cool.<P>

Does that mean they are going to recreate the part where that guy drives that car into that train and blows up?</B>

<PRE>#   as 38-foot American flag with
# illuminated stars wavers overhead.  Or they can hop on an authentic
# vibrating "hog", rev it up, feeling the power of the open road with</PRE>

<B>Neat-o. <P>

Are people gonna be able to get their ass kicked for no apparent reason for looking wrong as some Harley guy?<P></B>

<PRE># James Dean by their side, as they try to escape from the
# larger-than-life bald eagle who keeps a watchful eye over the
# excitement.
# 
# Patrons can wander around the Harley-Davidson Cafe and see the
# evolution of Harley starting from the first Harley-Davidson bike built
# back in 1903</PRE>

<B>Ok, that's cool. Seriously.</B>

<PRE>#   to the bikes of the future.</PRE>

<B>Oh god. Concept bikes.<P>

"Hi, I'm Harvey Harley and I'll be your animated guide through the world of Harley-Davidson...."</B>

<PRE>#   Video screens throughout the
# establishment will present the many famous personalities that helped
# mold Harley into an American institution and the impact and changing
# faces it has had through the years.</PRE>

<B>I hope they've got video of Gary Busey dumping his bike and slamming his head into the pavement.</B>

<PRE>#   An extensive collection of
# Harley-Davidson memorabilia in addition to possessions from sports
# figures, corporate leaders, politicians, television, music and film
# stars who all share a love of Harleys will be on display.  These
# include: The Captain America Bike from the movie "Easy Rider" with a
# realistic replica figure of Peter Fonda perched on the seat; never
# before seen photographs from the Harley-Davidson archive of Jane
# Powell, Jerry Lewis, Marlon Brando and others on their Harleys;</PRE>

<B>Just what Harley wants to help their image: a picture of Jerry Lewis on a Harley.<P>

Again I ask, who is the idiot that thinks this crap up?!</B>

<PRE># replicas of legendary sports figures riding in formation on the open
# road;</PRE>

<B>What about the Shriners? They've got this cool drill team thing where they ride these neat-o little motorcycles around. I think they're Harleys. Are they gonna be there too?</B>

<PRE>#   and a replica of a world-renowned rock star doing a 3-stage
# wheelie as his Harley shoots sparks and smoke from the tailpipes --
# wind blowing through his hair and armed with a Stratocaster guitar.
# 
# After being transformed into Harley fans and aficionados, diners will
# be able to locate important points of interest to bikers and
# Harley-Davidson by using the huge map of the United States under the
# canopy outside the restaurant.  The key locations will be illuminated
# with points of light.  This three-level, multimedia restaurant will
# seat 450.  Its first two floors will be open to public dining and will
# feature a raised dining area and "Hollywood booths".  The lower level
# will feature a stage with state-of-the-art theatrical lighting and an
# extensive sound system for live performances.</PRE>

<B>Whatta ya wanna bet that "real" Harley owners aren't allowed in or won't be able to afford the cover/drinks/food.<P>

The only Harley owners in that place will be the bankers and accountants and lawyers that ride Harleys once a month. "Panhead?  What the hell's a panhead?"</B>

<PRE># The HDC will be available for parties of 10 to 800.  A lavish and
# intimate VIP room will be available for special affairs.  For those who
# enjoy dining outside during the warmer summer months, the HDC will
# offer a wrap-around outdoor cafe.  The HDC will also feature a
# merchandise shop offering various HDC and Harley-Davidson signature
# 
# The Harley-Davidson Cafe is scheduled to open October 1993.  It is
# located at 1370 Avenue of the Americas (at 56th Street) and will be
# open 7 days from 12 noon to 2AM.  Take-out facilities and catering will
# also be available.</PRE>

<B>Personally, I'd get a gun and find out who came up with this wonderful idea and then stick the gun up this guy's....

                           the last wheeling dealing, kiss stealing,
                           limousine riding, jet plane flying sun of
jewell@halcyon.com         a gun."  --  The Nature Boy, Ric Flair</PRE></B><BR>
