<small>This section is intended as a useful list of aftermarket company addresses and phone numbers.  Most
of these you can find in any Harley-related magazine, but I'd also like to add opinions on each
company.<p>

<ul>
<li>Who has given you great service?
<li>Who make shitty merchandise?
<li>Which company bent over backwards to make things right for you? <p>
</ul>

Well, you get the idea.  If you have an opinion on any of these companies or want to add new
ones, drop me a line: <a href="mailto:aftermarket@world-wide-glide.com">aftermarket@world-wide-glide.com</a></small><p>

<i>I had the occasion to adapt a late model Harley FL for disabled riding.
During this period, I consulted with Pat, one of the managers at Performance
Machine.  You gotta remember, these folks are busy!  Pat took the time to
work with me on several configurations, provided invaluable advice and
assistance, all by phone or mail.<p>

I don't suggest every rider doing work on his/her ride's brakes pester this
company with questions a dealer or shop can handle.  Otherwise, none of us
will get any brake parts, since they'll be buried in phone calls.  But, if
you have a situation needing special expertise, you'll get straight talk
from this firm.</i>

<i>I currently race a Buell, which had a CV Carb.  Nothing but problems!
Dead spots, Roll the throttle slow.  Even spent $400.00 to have it
tuned.  No help!!!! <p>

I went to see Red Edmundson at QuickSilver and his crew installed the
QuickSilver II 40MM. I am impressed, this Carb works.  It has no accelerator
pump and one jet.  The Carb is slid action and works off vacum.  When air
crosses the jet, fuel is mixed in.  With the air filter off you can see
nothing but a mist in the mouth of the Carb when you hit the throttle. <p>

I am currently using a K&amp;N 3 inch air filter for max air intake.  The Carb
comes with several dif jets, air filter and new cables.  You can also
install an aftermarket airfilter if you like.  Thunder Alley December 1995
issue has a article on installation which is basically simple.  As far
as rejetting: I compete at Willow Springs, Ca., Las Vegas, NV, and Phonix
and have not had to change the jet.  Overall the performance increase was
magnificient.</i>

adds:</B><p>

<I>"I have had my suspension mods on fer a coupla weeks now and wanted to report on them.  I went to
<B>Works Fork Springs</B> in the front with 1/2" over spacer. These are actually made by
<B>Progressive</B> FWIW.<p>

In tha rear I installed <B>Works Street Shockers</B>. These are alum bodied shocks with two black springs
which provide a progressive rate. They have fully adjustable dampning and preload. I went 3/4 over
in tha rear. These are custom built for each order with the riders weight (225 lbs) and riding style
(aggressive) used as variables in tha manf. process.<p>

Also, mine is the first Dyna with these shocks so my Poser value just shot through tha roof!<p>

These are some mahvelous components. The Supersickle is very confidence inspiring and, while I
have scraped tha pegs, I have not slammed the frame as I did three times w/stock suspension. I have
jumped (small) the sled twice now, something I would have never attempted stock.<p>

There is a section of road in tha Oakland Hills out here that consists of 5, 10, and 15 mph turns
seperated by small straights. This road is now fun instead of scary. Leaned over hitting tha gas tha
Supersickle fishtails telling me that I don't need much more power for my application."</I></blockquote>

for the price quoted, but the performance was exceptional.  I went back
to the shop to thank them and ask just what they did.  The mechanic that
worked on my bike said that he noticed that the carb wasn't jetted

<i>"I recently (christmas 95) bought myself a new dyna superglide.
After the first service, I noticed that there was a rattling in my pipes, which
the dealer said was 'standard'.  After taking it to Big-Twin Evolution Industries
for a performance tune-up, they told me that they had found a 3/16th washer floating
around in the header pipes.  The funny thing was that I never even mentioned to them
about the noise, they said they noticed it on a test ride of my bike and fixed it up
for free.  Their mechanic is probably the best in Australia as he does the Harley
