Before my <A HREF="MYBIKE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://world-wide-glide.com/mybike.html">'96 Dyna Glide arrived on March 13th</A>, I tried to educate myself 
about the bikes.  As it turns out, there is a weakness with regard to the new chassis that is of some 
concern if you plan to significantly hop-up your scoot.  Though I have been assured that minor 
performance mods prove no problem for the frame. <P>

Free enterprise being the wonder that it is, an aftermarket company has come up with what they think 
is the solution.  It's called a "<B>Torque Arm</B>."  I spoke with the makers of the arm and here's 
what they told me about it:<P>

<UL>
<LI>It "unitizes" the drive train to alleviate torsion loading on the primary case.  These loads are 
caused by both cornering and high output engines. 
<LI>It weighs 1.5 lbs. 
<LI>It is available in chrome, glossy black and crinkle black.
<LI>$299.95 
<LI>There is only one place to buy them:<P>

	Highway Art Corporation<BR>
	17516 Von Karmen Avenue<BR>
	Irvine, CA  92714<BR>
	(800) 398-0222<P>
</UL>

BTW, they said there is an excellent photo of it on page 25 of the Summer '95 edition of "Big Twin" 
magazine.

<I>Here is some added information that were answers to my Dyna-related questions (via the Harley 
Digest):</I><P>

<B>Mark Cronenweth (<I>conehead+@pitt.edu</I>) tells me:</B><BR>

<blockquote>Take a close look at the Dyna frame and you'll see that the only way in which the engine and tranny 
are directly connected is through the primary.  Twisting of the motor on the mounts (through large 
torque inputs) can cause the inner primary to crack.  Or the front motor mount can split or wear quickly.  The Carlini Torsion Bar attaches the tranny front door to the nosecone and is said to reduce or eliminate this tendancy, and also reduce vibration, by reinforcing the engine-tranny attachment. I believe it does this.  <P>

They're available from Rivera Eng. <I>[ED. NOTE: Actually that's not true.  Revera Eng. does not sell 
them]</I> or direct from Carlini (remember Tank Savers?)  Unfortuately the Carlini brace is a "billet, 
chromed" item so it's essentially functional nature is masked by it's high price and accessory 
styling.  Current Hot Bike ad says $289.<P>

BTW, Mitch Herzog has one of these Carlini braces on his 110 HP Dyna stroker and swears by it.  I 
would like to have one on my own 75 HP ride but $289 is too much.  While the brace  is not strictly 
necessary on most streetbikes, I'm certain any Dyna will benefit from the extra rigidity - just look 
at how the swingarm is attached! </blockquote><P>

<B>Lyons Lynne M (<I>Lynne.Lyons@Colorado.EDU</I>) adds:</B><BR>

<blockquote>Contact Steve Lyons at <I>High Country Harley-Davidson</I> in Longmont, Colorado (303) 772-5252.  
He is the technician who installed the torque arm on Mitch Herzog's 98" Dyna and he'll be happy to 
answer all your questions!</blockquote>
