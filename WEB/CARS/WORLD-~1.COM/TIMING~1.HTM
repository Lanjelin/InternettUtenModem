When you time your vehicle, you have 4 things to consider: Altitude, ambient
engine temperature, octane rating of your fuel, and ambient air temperature. 
Remember this: In a higher altitude, you can get away with a lower octane gas. 
In colder temperatures, you can use a lower octane gas.<P>

In fact, I consider a lower octane gas *better* for my bike in the winter
time.  Why?  High octane gas promotes cooler running of your engine.  In the
winter, when your bike may *never* reach proper running temp (190 degrees)
*all* season, it's better to use a gas that may make your bike run at 160
degrees as opposed to a higher octane gas that will only allow your bike to
reach 130 degrees.  That's waaaay too cold an engine temp to travel on
IMHO.<P>

If you travel, you will note that Denver sells fuels as low as 84.5 octane. 
You'll never see that in Dallas, because the lower altitude promotes a quicker
burn in your car.  High octane gas has a slower "more controlled" burn. 
Soooo...you can regularly find 94 octane gas in Dallas, because at sea-level,
where gas burns faster than 1 mile high, 94 octane will keep your car from
"pinging".  Pinging is when the spark happens too quickly in relation to the
position of the piston.  If your car pings on 88 octane in Dallas, chances are
you can fill her up with 94 octane, and the pinging will magically go away.<P>

Also, a hotter engine will be more likely to ping than a cooler one because
fuel burns faster in a hotter atmosphere.  You can start your car, drive
around the block, and she won't ping.  The motor is still cold.  However, when
the car warms up, you may develop a  pinging condition due to the hotter
burning atmosphere created in your cylinder.  On a Harley, where the engine
runs anywhere from 130 degrees to 290 degrees, you have to give ambient engine
temperature waaaaay more consideration than a car that will run at 210 degrees
all day long come winter or summer.<P>

So we have:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Hotter air temp = hotter HD engine = quicker burn
<LI>Lower altitude = quicker burn
<LI>Lower octane = quicker burn.
<P>
<LI>Cooler air temp = cooler HD engine = slower burn
<LI>Higher altitude = slower burn
<LI>Higher octane = slower burn
</UL>

Pinging is caused by too quick/advanced of a burn.<P>

Now, based on this formula, I will give you the easy, easy, easy accurate,
accurate, accurate way to time your bike.  A fringe  benefit of my timing
method, is it considers *all* factors.  Using a light and a timing mark barely
comes close.<P>

Set your timing close enough to TDC that you can start your bike and ride
around for a while.  Let the bike warm up to 160 degrees if possible.  If it's
really cold outside (below 40 degrees), you may never get above 130 degrees
operating temp.<P>  

If the ambient temperature stays below 60 degrees outside, use regular
unleaded.  If it the ambient temp hovers around 70 degrees, use medium grade
fuel.  If it stays over 80 all the time, use premium gas.  I do not use octane
ratings here as I don't know what altitude you live in.  I wouldn't go below
86 octane.  If you are at 5,000+ ft. above sea-level, anything over 91 octane
will be a waste of money.<P>

Once your Harley has reached it's maximum running temp, get on a straightaway
that's *not* downhill.  Flat is okay and up hill is okay.  Do 50 mph in 5th
gear and accelerate using 1/2-1/4 throttle.  Your bike's motor should be
running *around* 2,200 rpm at that speed in 5th gear I believe.<P>

Does your motor ping?  If it pings *slightly*, you're right on the mark.  If
she pings horribly, you need to retard your timing (rotate timing plate same
direction as engine rotation).  You can pull over and do this by the side of
the road.  If she doesn't ping at all, advance your timing a little.  Now I'm
talking about 1 degree intervals here.  That would be about 1/16th of an inch
as you look at your timing mark.  If you have no timing marks on your timing
plate or the inside of your nose-cone, make some.  Just scratch them in.<P>

With this method, if you use low-octane gas when it's cold outside, and high
octane gas when it's hot outside, your timing will be as close to perfect as
present-day mechanical timing advance mechanisms will allow it to be.<P>

If you travel to a different, lower altitude, pinging will get worse.  Use 94
octane gas.  If you still continue to ping really bad, pull over and retard
your timing just 1 degree.  Remember, too much pinging is bad for your motor
and *could* damage it if you continue to let the motor ping all the time.  A
*little* pinging is okay and actually tells you that you have reached your
optimum timing.  <P>

What I like about this method is it allows for *all* factors as you are
listening to what *your* engine is telling you, and not what a book is telling
you.  And for cars, this method will allow for a "sloppy" timing chain whereas
a timing light won't.  If you have any questions, please feel free to email me
privately.  If you post to the net, I'm about 4 or 5 daze behind on digests
and am desperately trying to catch up!!
