Those two boxes do have different curves....the "P" curve HDI box is new to 
all 1996 1340 domestic models and it is different than the "F" SE curve box.  
The "F" SE 8K rev-limit curve is the same curve as the 1995 and earlier 1340 
domestic stock type 5200 rev-limit "D" curve box.  Both the "F" and "D" curve 
boxes have a more aggressive curve than the "P" curve box.  All domestic bikes 
for 1996 have the new HDI box in them (with different curves for different 
models) and it is supposed to be the hot set-up (according to HD) for all 
pre-1995 bikes...don't understand why he wanted to change it...I'd have left 
that "P" box in it and maybe done something else such as carb work.<p>

Couple of things to note for this "P" curve box is that they are now timed 
AT IDLE using a different timing mark that is located 20 degrees BTDC....so 
this means that all bikes previous to 1995 (because most of the 1995 models 
already have this 20 degree timing mark) will have to have a mark put on 
the flywheel IF a "P" curve box is used.<p>

It would run different for sure...not a figment of your imagination. ;-)<p>
