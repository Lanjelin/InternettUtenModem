<h3>XL Sportster 883</h3>
<ul>
<li>Price:  $5095
<li>Engine: ohv, 2-valve, V-Twin
<li>Bore x stroke: 76.2 x 96.8
<li>Displacement: 883cc
<li>Carburetion:  40mm Keihin CV
<li>Transmission:  5-speed
<li>Wheelbase: 60.2 in.
<li>Seat height: 28 in.
<li>Fuel capacity: 2.25 gal.
<li>Claimed dry weight: 488 lbs.</ul>

With 13 spoke cast aluminum rims standard and laced wheels
as a $320 option, the sportster returns virtually unchanged for 1996,
which is good news for Harley-Davidson dealers, who could barely keep the
venerable 883 in stock. The 883 has retained strong sales by being the
closest thing to an entry level bike that Milwaukee offers. <p>

<h3>XL Sportster 883 Hugger</h3>
<ul>
<li>Price:  $5760
<li>Engine: ohv, 2-valve, V-Twin
<li>Bore x stroke: 76.2 x 96.8
<li>Displacement: 883cc
<li>Carburetion:  40mm Keihin CV
<li>Transmission:  5-speed
<li>Wheelbase: 59.0 in.
<li>Seat height: 27.12 in.
<li>Fuel capacity: 2.25 gal.
<li>Claimed dry weight: 485 lbs.
</ul>

Slightly different than the standard Sportster, the Hugger model
is distinguished by a shorter wheelbase and lower seat height, which is an
appealing feature to a new group of Harley riders, professional women. The
Hugger is also available with optional laced rims. Don't worry, it still
has the same masculine V-twin rumble of it's more expensive relatives.<p>

<h3>XL Sportster 1200</h3>
<ul>
<li>Price:  $7360
<li>Engine: ohv, 2-valve, V-Twin
<li>Bore x stroke: 88.8 x 96.8
<li>Displacement: 1200cc
<li>Carburetion:  40mm Keihin CV
<li>Transmission:  5-speed
<li>Wheelbase: 60.2 in.
<li>Seat height: 28.9 in.
<li>Fuel capacity: 3.3 gal.
<li>Claimed dry weight: 490 lbs.
</ul>

With it's buckhorn handlebar, cast aluminum rims, dual
instruments, and two up seat, you can share the Harley Davidson experience
with a friend. Our hunch is that it won't be difficult to find a willing
passenger when you are exploring the torquey characteristics and ample
power of the larger evolution motor. The best part is that you get the
extra 317 cc worth of power and torque and only an extra 2 pounds, so it
remains easily maneuverable in tight spots. <p>

<h3>XL1200C Sportster 1200 Custom</h3>
<ul>
<li>Price:  $8360
<li>Engine: ohv, 2-valve, V-Twin
<li>Bore x stroke: 88.8 x 96.8
<li>Displacement: 1200cc
<li>Carburetion:  40mm Keihin CV
<li>Transmission:  5-speed
<li>Wheelbase: 59.0 in.
<li>Seat height: 27.12 in.
<li>Fuel capacity: 3.3 gal.
<li>Claimed dry weight: 483 lbs.
</ul>

The Sportster 1200 Custom has the look of a custom cruiser. A
distinctive chrome and black engine, low-rise handlebar, chrome headlamp
and electronic speedometer set this new model apart from the other 1200
Sportster models, as do the short stroke front and rear shocks, and the
custom graphics and the cloisonn 3D tank emblem. <p>

<h3>XL1200S Sportster 1200 Sport</h3>
<ul>
<li>Price:  $7910
<li>Engine: ohv, 2-valve, V-Twin
<li>Bore x stroke: 88.8 x 96.8

<li>Carburetion:  40mm Keihin CV
<li>Transmission:  5-speed
<li>Wheelbase: 60.2 in.
<li>Seat height: 28.9 in.
<li>Fuel capacity: 3.3 gal.
<li>Claimed dry weight: 497 lbs.
</ul>

Brand new for 1996 the Sportster Sport is the most capable
sportster yet. Fully adjustable sport suspension at the front, as well as
fully adjustable twin rear shocks help the Sport live up to the racy
pretenses that the checkered flag tank graphics set. To get the whole
package stopped there are full floating dual disc brakes up front. <p>

to the springer is the "floating" front fender, which moves 
with the motion of the tire.<p>

could have been used in the spate of mid-'80s karate movies
or as Steven Segal's ride, the Bad Boy exudes a "tough guys 
wear black" look and feel, and backs it up with 1340cc 
worth of big twin. This bike could have made your parents cool 
when you were a teen.<p>
