The <A HREF="../TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#221" tppabs="http://www.thinkage.on.ca/~hoglist/">Harley Digest</A> is <B>the</B> source for Harley information on internet.  Think of it as rec.motorcycles.harley without the massive flame wars.  Lots of 
useful information served up with a healthy dollop mayhem.  When you join, ask them about your INA 
bearing...<P>

Ken does a great job dealing with the us unruly Harley riders.  If you've seen the Harley 90th anniversary video, you've seen Ken.  He's right at the beginning where they are asking "typical" Harley riders what they do for a living.  He said "computer programmer."  I think he is wearing a <I>Metallica</I> shirt (that's his other listserver).<P>

And for you Euro-centric riders there is an established subset of the digest call the 
"<a href="../TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#222" tppabs="http://metallica.prakinf.tu-ilmenau.de/aedsthom.html">Annual European Digest Subscribers 
Tour</a>."  As the name implies, they get together every year for a tour.  They also maintain a 
separate digest that focuses on European-unique H-D stuff. 

The following are some images offered up by some of the list members.<p>
