<P>
<H4>Spa 1991</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 7th
<B>R :</B> DNF (clutch)
<P>
After qualifying an amazing 7th for his his first grand prix, leaped up to 5th at the
start, only to be taken around the outside by Piquet at the La Source. Only
made it to Eau Rouge before the clutch gave out.
<P>
<H4>Monza 1991</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 7th
<B>R :</B> 5th
<P>
In his efforts to outqualify Schumacher, Piquet had a crash during
qualifying. Stayed in 7th at the start, moving up to 6th when a move by
Alesi on Patrese failed, forcing Alesi to make an early pit stop. Was up
as high as 4th mid to late race, but was passed by Senna moving through
the field after a pit stop, leaving Michael to finish 5th.
<P>
<H4>Estoril 1991</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 10th
<B>R :</B> 6th
<P>
Moved up to 8th at start, but was soon passed by Capelli in the Leyton
House, dropping down to 9th. Was 8th after Mansell's tyre stop, and gained
two further places when Prost and Berger retired mid-race, although one 
position was lost to teammate Piquet at the tyre stops. Would've finished 
7th, but a mistake by Capelli as Capelli was being lapped by leader Patrese
saw Capelli damage the nose of his car against the guard rail, allowing 
Michael to move up a spot and finish 6th.
<P>
<H4>Barcelona 1991</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> 6th
<P>
On a damp track, Michael gained a place at the start. Passed Mansell for
3rd on lap 1, then soon after caught Senna, but was unable to pass. This
was soon followed by Mansell regaining 3rd by passing Michael around the
outside. Changing to slicks from wets on lap 6, Michael was again right
behind Mansell, when Senna spun in the slightly damp conditions, moving
Michael back in to 3rd. After Mansell passed Berger for the lead, Michael
moved up on to Berger. While he was following Berger, Michael hit a damp
patch, sending him into a spin, stopping just short of the barrier,
rejoining the race in 6th place. After a further tyre stop dropped him to
7th, Berger's retirement allowed Michael to score points for the second
time in his first 3 races.
<P>
<H4>Suzuka 1991</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 9th
<B>R :</B> DNF (engine)
<P>
Had a big off at 130R in qualifying (200 km/h plus). Gained one place at
the start, gained another as Alesi's Ferrari blew an engine on the first
lap. Mansell's sandy exit at the 1st corner moved Michael up another place,
but he was not to finish, as an engine failure put him out of the race.
<P>
<H4>Adelaide 1991</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 6th
<B>R :</B> DNF (crash with Alesi)
<P>
Gained one place at the start (again!), but spun early on, allowing Piquet
through. Had pulled out to pass Piquet, when Alesi attempted to pass both
Benettons, resulting in a collision with Alesi and subsequent retirement.
<P>
<A NAME="1992"><H3>1992</H3></A>
<H4>Kyalami 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 6th
<B>R :</B> 4th
<P>
Stayed 6th at start, then 5th at 2nd corner as he passed Berger. Remained
in 5th, catching Alesi in 4th, who Michael eventually passed on lap 39
after many laps behind him. On lap 40 Alesi's engine blew... Michael
finished in that 4th place, just one place away from the podium.
<P>
<H4>Mexico 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
After being outqualified only be the Williams team, made a bad start,
losing positions to Brundle, Senna and Berger by the 1st corner, down to
6th. Repassed Berger on the opening lap, then Brundle on lap 2, then closed
in on Senna, who made things easier by retiring when his transmission broke
on lap 12, moving up to 3rd, where he finished, scoring his first ever
podium finish.
<P>
<H4>Interlagos 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
Moved up a place to 4th at the start, behind Senna. During the time he was
behind Senna, Senna's McLaren developed an intermittent engine problem,
which frustrated not only Senna, but Michael as well, as he attempted to
pass a car which was often slow through the turns but quick on the
straights - at one time Michael got past coming on to the pit straight only
to be passed back going into the 1st corner. Eventually moved up to 3rd on
lap 13 when the problem got really bad, where Michael stayed to score his
second podium finish in two races.
<P>
<H4>Barcelona 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 2nd
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
Scored his first ever front row start, despite a high speed off during
qualifying. Starting on wets on a damp track, Michael lost a place to both
Patrese and Alesi. Passed Alesi on lap 7, moving up to 3rd. When Patrese
spun on lap 20, Michael moved up to 2nd. With the weather getting worse as
the race went on, heavy rain falling halfway through the race, he actually
started to close the gap to Mansell, with it getting to less than 10
seconds around lap 50, but Mansell pulled away again, leaving Michael to
finish 2nd, a tremendous result in the situation.
<P>
<H4>Imola 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> DNF (spin)
<P>
Lost a place on the run down to Tosa on the 1st lap. Was trailing Brundle
when he spun at the 2nd part of Rivazza, hitting the armco and damaging the
rear suspension, putting hin out of the race.
<P>
<H4>Monaco 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 6th
<B>R :</B> 4th
<P>
Gained a place on the run to St Devote, moving up to 5th. Trailed Alesi for
several laps, looking for a way through. Took an opportunity to make a move
at Loews hairpin, resulting in contact between the nose of the Benetton and
the sidepod of Alesi, damaging both, though not significantly. As the race
wore on, Michael began to catch Patrese, only to have trouble with 1st
gear in the gearbox as well as the damaged front wing, allowing Patrese to
pull away again, leaving Michael in 4th position at the end.
<P>
<H4>Canada 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
Stayed 5th at the start, but moved up to 4th when Mansell retired after
making a move on Senna at the Esses just before the startline on lap 14.
Moved up to 3rd when Senna's electronics failed on lap 38, and 2nd when
Patrese's gearbox failed on lap 44. At about this stage, Brundle, who was
right behind Michael, managed to pass him as Morbidelli moved across on
Michael as he was trying to lap him. However, a lap later Brundle was out
as his gearbox failed, leaving Michael to finish 2nd.
<P>
<H4>Magny-Cours 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> DNF (crash with Senna, then Modena)
<P>
Stayed in 5th at start, but at Adelaide hairpin on opening lap, made a move
on Senna which resulted in a collision that put Senna out and left Michael
with a broken front wing, which he pitted to have replaced. After rain
caused the race to be stopped, at the 2nd start (which took place on a dry
track!), made another unsuccessful move, this time on Modena, this time
breaking his front suspension.
<P>
<H4>Silverstone 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 4th
<B>R :</B> 4th
<P>
Kept 4th at the start, made a move on Brundle at Becketts on lap 1, which was 
unsuccessful, and led him to running over some gravel, as well as slightly
damaging the suspension. On the run down Hangar straight, still on lap 1,
Michael was passed by both Berger and Senna, dropping down to 6th. Soon
managed to repass Berger, and closed on Senna, but lost downforce when
right behind him, causing Michael to lock the rear wheels under braking,
leading to a tyre stop, at which he dropped down to 6th place. On lap 40,
as he attempted to lap Modena, the two had a wheel-banging session,
bringing Michael almost to a stop, losing another position. Moved up to 6th
on lap 52 when Senna's gearbox failed, passed H&auml;kkinen soon after and
made it up to 4th where he finished when Berger's engine failed on the very
last lap.
<P>
<H4>Hockenheim 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 6th
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
His first race at home saw Michael have several off-track excursions in 
practice and qualifying as he went all-out for his fans. Moved up one spot
at the start, but ran over a kerb at the 1st chicane on lap 1 which damaged
a radiator, spraying fluid on his left rear tyre for the rest of the race. 
Moved past Berger and Patrese when they both stopped for tyres. Patrese on
his new tyres closed in, and they fought for 8 laps until Patrese eventually
found a way past. Seemed destined to finish 4th until Patrese, who had spent
several laps trying to take 2nd from Senna, spun on the last lap as he made
one last attempt to take the place, promoting Michael up to 3rd, thereby
finishing on the podium at his home Grand Prix.
<P>
<H4>Hungary 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 4th
<B>R :</B> DNF (rear wing)
<P>
Stayed in 5th at the start (and for most of the race). During the race,
Brundle had tapped the rear of Michael's car when Michael drifted wide just
behind Berger. Had moved up to 3rd when rear wing fell off coming down pit
straight on lap 64, causing a spin as Michael lost rear downforce.
<P>
<H4>Spa 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
Lost 2 places at the start, moving up to 4th on lap 2 as it started to
rain. Stopped for wet tyres on lap 3, and had dropped two spots as everyone
(except Senna) stopped for wets by lap 6. Moved up to 5th as Alesi and
Mansell collided on lap 7, causing Alesi to retire there and then. Passed
Herbert soon after to move in to 4th. Senna, still on slicks in the damp to
wet conditions, was caught by the pack, with Michael passing him on lap 13,
dragging Brundle through with him. At this stage the rain got harder, but
then it began to ease and stop. On lap 30, Michael understeered off onto
the grass at Stavelot, Brundle nipping past to 3rd. As Michael regained the
track, he noticed that Brundle's wets were blistering, so he came in for
slicks at the end of that lap. Still 4th as he exited the pits, he took a
reasonable lead as the other drivers stopped in the next couple of laps.
Mansell, the leader before the stops, was now charging again towards
Michael, and was within 5 seconds of Michael when he had a problem with the
exhaust system, losing top-end power and allowing Michael to take a
comfortable victory, the first in his career.
<P>
<H4>Monza 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 6th
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
Despite Berger starting from pit lane (Michael now having only 4 cars in
front), still fell to 7th. Collided with Boutsen on lap 1, damaging the
nose of the car in the process, pitting at the end of lap 1 for a new nose.
Made a charge back through the field as follows - lap 2 : 25th; lap 5 : 22nd;
lap 6 : 20th; lap 7 : 19th; lap 8 : 18th; lap 9 : 16th; lap 11 : 15th; lap 12 :
14th; lap 13 : 11th; lap 14 : 10th; lap 15 : 9th; lap 18 : 7th; lap 19 : 6th;
lap 27 : 5th; lap 42 : 4th and finally, lap 50 : 3rd, an unlikely result
one would have thought considering his position at the end of lap 1!
<P>
<H4>Estoril 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> 7th
<P>
Engine problems before the start caused Michael to start from the bank
(memories of Monza!) Moved through the field, and was up to 7th when
Patrese collided with the back of Berger's McLaren on pit straight. As
Michael went down the pit straight, he ran over some of the debris, leading
to a puncture and some damage to the nose of the car, preventing any
further improvement (after the tyre stop for the puncture) than 7th again.
<P>
<H4>Suzuka 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> DNF (gearbox)
<P>
Stayed 5th at the start, moving up to 4th when Senna's engine seized on lap
3 at Honda's home race. This didn't prove to be a great help when the
gearbox failed, causing Michael to retire.
<P>
<H4>Adelaide 1992</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
Gained a place at the start, up to 4th. Berger then passed Michael on lap 3,
demoting Michael back to 5th. When Mansell and Senna argued over the same
bit of road on lap 19, he moved up to 3rd, still a few seconds behind
Berger. Moved up to 2nd when Berger pitted for tyres on lap 35, but Berger
passed him and pulled away, dropping Michael back to 3rd. When the leader, 
Patrese, had the electronics fail in his Williams on lap 51, Michael moved
back to 2nd, but 25 seconds away from the new leader Berger, Michael having 
stopped later than he wanted to for new tyres. As leader Berger tried to
conserve fuel, Michael set a string of fastest laps, forcing Berger to
increase his speed to keep the lead, which he managed to do all the way to
the end ... just! Berger managing to hold on by less than a second.
<P>
<A NAME="1993"><H3>1993</H3></A>
<P>
<H4>Kyalami 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> DNF (collision with Senna)
<P>
Stayed in 4th at start, but then move up to 2nd at the Esses om lap 1 as
Prost avoided Hill's car during a spin. However, Prost passed Michael on
lap 3, who then caught Senna and took the lead. Michael also caught Senna,
and passed him too, moving up to 2nd. Unfortunately, when the two of them
pitted at the tyre stops, nose to tail, the McLaren crew got Senna back
past Michael. Was on Senna's tail, when he attempted to pass Senna, got
along side, but had the door shut on him, causing Michael to spin and
could not rejoin.
<P>
<H4>Interlagos 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 4th
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
Lost 2 places at the start, but moved up a spot on lap 1. Passed Senna on
lap 24, moving up to 3rd. Lost a lot of time after a disastrous pit stop.
Rained halfway through the race, causing the safety car to come out for
several laps. Given stop-go penalty for passing under yellow, losing more
time. As the track dried out, Michael moved back up through the field,
catching Herbert on lap 65, whom he diced with for several laps, and
eventually passed, taking 3rd position.
<P>
<H4>Donington 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> DNF (spin)
<P>
The race started on a wet track, which at various times during the race it
was and wasn't, as the rain fell and then stopped several times. Lost 2
places at the start, passed by Senna and Wendlinger. Lost another place to
Andretti at McLeans, but then gained two placed up to 4th when
Andretti and Wendlinger tried to be in the same place at the same time ...
they both went off, still on lap 1. Before the end of lap 1, Michael
dropped back to 5th as he was passed by Alesi before Melbourne hairpin.
Michael's race ended when he spun off on lap 24 on slicks on the wet track.
<P>
<H4>Imola 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
A damp track at the start, Michael lost a place. Ran in 4th until Hill
understeered off at Tosa when he moved off-line to lap Zanardi, and moved
up again when Senna had hydraulic problem on lap 43. Although not a
spectacular race, it was a very good result nonetheless.
<P>
<H4>Barcelona 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 4th
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
Didn't lose a place at the start, and like Imola, ran in that position
until Hill's engine expired on lap 42. Closed in on Senna towards end of
race, getting to within a couple of seconds, until lap 63 when Zanardi's
Lotus had an engine let go. Zanardi decided that staying on the track would
be much more fun than pulling off, thankfully dropping oil on the racing
line, which Michael slid wide on (and temporarily on to the dirt) as he
entered the main straight. Despite this, and suffering tyre vibrations for 
the second half of the race (which caused some unprompted gear changes),
Michael finished 3rd.
<P>
<H4>Monaco 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 2nd
<B>R :</B> DNF (hydraulics)
<P>
Had several spins in qualifying, but still qualified 2nd. Remained in 2nd
at the start, and took the lead when Prost was called in for a stop-go
penalty for jumping the start. Was in a commanding lead when forced to
retire on lap 33 with hydraulic failure.
<P>
<H4>Canada 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
A terrible start (caused by the traction control system) meant that by the
1st corner, Michael had dropped to 11th, although was 9th after the next
corner, and 8th going into the corner after that. By the end of lap 1, he
had moved up another place to 7th, and overtook Patrese on lap 2 to move up
to 6th. By the end of lap 3 he had moved past Alesi to 5th, and followed
this by passing Berger a few laps later, moving up to 4th. Gained another
place (back to 3rd where he started!) when Williams botched Hill's tyre
stop. Chased and caught Senna, who eventually retired on lap 63. As Senna
pulled off the track, Michael moved to the right to avoid the slowing
McLaren ... just as Senna pulled off to the right, although thankfully
there was no collision. This moved Michael up to 2nd, where he finished.
<P>
<H4>Magny-Cours 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 7th
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
Gained a place at the start, and moved up again when Blundell was forced
off the road attempting to lap a backmarker on lap 21. After having stopped
twice for tyres during the race, Michael was flying, and caught Senna (who
had stopped once) towards the end of race, passing him around the outside
as they entered the first corner after the pit straight. Finished in 3rd
position.
<P>
<H4>Silverstone 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
Had a high speed off in qualifying at Copse. After Patrese had qualified,
took over Patrese's car and did a time nearly 2 seconds quicker than
Patrese had managed, netting Michael 3rd position on the grid. Lost a place
at the start, but moved up towards Senna after Prost passed Senna on lap 7.
Passed Senna on lap 10, moving up to 3rd. The safety car came out just
after halfway through the race, thanks to a car that had stopped near the
edge of the track (many observers believed the safety car was sent out to
bunch the field up to provide a more exciting race!). After the restart,
Michael stayed close to the front, when the leader Hill had the engine of
his Williams call it a day on lap 42, allowing Michael to move up and
finish 2nd.
<P>
<H4>Hockenheim 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
Gained a place at the start, but was passed by Prost on lap 6. However,
Michael regained 2nd on lap 10 when Prost took a stop-go penalty, given for
taking a shortcut while Prost avoided a spinning Brundle. Lost a position
to Prost at tyre stop on lap 16, but when Hill suffered a flat on the
second last lap, moved back in to 2nd position where he finished.
<P>
<H4>Hungary 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> DNF (engine)
<P>
After Prost stalled at start of warm-up lap, Michael now had only 1 car in
front of him. Stayed 2nd at the start, but went too deep into the 1st
corner, dropping down to 5th. Passed Patrese for 4th on lap 2, and then
Berger for 3rd a few laps later. Followed this with a spin a couple of laps
later, dropping to 10th. Moved back up to 7th by lap 10, then 6th, and was
in 5th by lap 17. Moved up to 3rd on lap 18 as he passed Patrese (again)
and Senna, who had retired. Moved up to 2nd briefly after tyre stops until
he retired on lap 26 with engine problems.
<P>
<H4>Spa 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
Traction control system caused another dreadful start, falling to 10th by
La Source. Moved up past Brundle to 9th at the end of lap 1, past Warwick, 
Lehto and Herbert to move up to 6th by the end of lap 2, then passed Suzuki 
on lap 3, and Alesi on lap 4 to be in 4th position after 4 laps. Closed in
on Senna, whom he passed (on the grass) after Michael had stopped for tyres
a lap before Senna did, with Senna drifting wide as he exited them in front 
of an on-the-move Michael, who had the choice of taking to the grass (and 
take what comes), colliding with Senna or slowing down to let Senna continue
ahead of him. Now in 3rd, he maintained the gap to the leaders until after
the 2nd round of tyre stops, when he managed to get close to Prost after
Prost had some trouble with traffic. On lap 32, Michael passed Prost at Les
Combes, but was unable to make up all the distance between himself and
Hill, finishing 2nd. If only he'd had a decent start...
<P>
<H4>Monza 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 5th
<B>R :</B> DNF (engine)
<P>
Stayed 5th, but moved up to 3rd when Senna and Hill collide at 1st chicane.
Passed Alesi for 2nd position on lap 4. Not far away from leader Prost when
engine expired on lap 23.
<P>
<H4>Estoril 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 6th
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
Had several spins during practice and qualifying. After Hill stalled at
start of warm-up lap, Michael had 4 cars in front of him. Remained 5th at
the start. Gained a place when Senna's engine expired on lap 20. After
making an early stop, he moved up through the field, with H&auml;kkinen getting
friendly with the guard rail. Moved up to 1st when Prost stopped, and this
led to Michael abandoning his planned 2nd stop, Prost catching Michael
after his stop, but was unable to pass him, leaving Michael to take the 2nd
victory of his career.
<P>
<H4>Suzuka 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 4th
<B>R :</B> DNF (collision with Hill)
<P>
Lost one place at the start, then another when Irvine passed him around the
outside at turn 1 on lap 1. Passed Irvine back on lap 3, only for Hill to
pass Michael a few laps later, back to 6th again. Collided with Hill as
Hill attempted to pass Berger at the chicane on lap 11.
<P>
<H4>Adelaide 1993</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 4th
<B>R :</B> DNF (engine)
<P>
Stayed 4th at the start. Made an early stop for tyres, which seemed to pay
off, until the engine expired on lap 20. Not a very good end to the
season.
<P>
<A NAME="1994"><H3>1994</H3></A>
<P>
<H4>Interlagos 1994</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 2nd
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
Lost a place at the start to Alesi, regaining 2nd on lap 2. Closed to
within 2 seconds of Senna by lap 10. Trailed Senna in to the pits on lap
21, taking the lead as the Benetton crew beat the Williams crew. Led
the rest of the way, with Senna less than 10 seconds behind until he spun
out of the race on lap 56. With Senna out of the race, Michael had lapped
every other driver.
<P>
<H4>Aida 1994</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 2nd
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
Took the lead from Senna at the start, who was nudged into a slow spin at
the 1st corner by H&auml;kkinen, Larini colliding with Senna as Senna spun.
Led every lap, winning easily as the rest of the field floundered in his
wake.
<P>
<H4>Imola 1994</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 2nd
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
After Rubens Barrichello's crash at Variante Bassa on the Friday, then Roland
Ratzenberger's fatal accident on the Saturday, Formula 1 had had its
blackest weekend in man years. No one was to know that it was only going to
get worse... Michael held 2nd at the start, which was marred by Pedro Lamy
colliding with a stalled Lehto, who had just returned after recovering from
a huge testing accident. This accident led to the safety car being sent out
on to the track. The safety car set the cars loose again as the cars
started their 6th lap. Senna maintained a small gap over Michael until at
Tamburello on lap 7, when inexplicably, Senna's car went straight ahead
halfway around the corner, crashing into the concrete wall and fatally
injuring Ayrton. At the restart, Berger took the on-the-road lead from 
Michael (who started the restart from "pole"), although Michael led on
aggregate. Michael passed Berger on lap 13, then pitted, losing 1st on
aggregate as well as on the road. Passed Katayama on lap 20, having
regained the lead on aggregate on lap 19. Continued on to take an easy win,
a race that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons.

Kept the lead at the start, pulling away from the field easily. However on

corner after, it stayed there - for the rest of the race. Pitting for his
first stop at the end of lap 21, he made it a few corners round lap 22
before being passed by cars that were unlapping themselves! H&auml;kkinen
passed Michael for the lead on lap 23, while Hill passed Michael for 2nd on

and even led for 5 laps after Hill's 2nd stop. Dropping to 2nd after his
2nd stop, Michael finished there, after a charging H&auml;kkinen in 3rd had
another Peugeot engine failure. Despite being stuck in 5th gear, Michael
lapped for most of the race at almost exactly the same pace as Damon Hill,
who had 6 gears at his disposal as well as the Renault V10.

Dire wet conditions, with Michael keeping the lead at the start. Safety car
came out at start of lap 4, after many cars had already crashed or spun
out of the race. The safety car then pulled off at the end of laps 10, only for
the race to be red-flagged on lap 15 after another spate of incidents. Led
from rolling restart, but pitted early on lap 18. Fell to 2nd on aggregate
after the stop, and was passed by Alesi on aggregate on lap 22. Regained
2nd on aggregate when Alesi pitted on lap 29. On the road in this same
period, Michael couldn't find a way past H&auml;kkinen, let alone Alesi and
Mansell who were behind him on aggregate but ahead on the road. He passed
H&auml;kkinen on the road on lap 26, and Alesi and Mansell pitted before
they got in the way. By lap 30 he was now 2nd on the road and also on aggregate.
Catching Hill, on lap 36 he took the lead on aggregate, building up a lead
as he closed on Hill on the road. At the end of lap 40, Michael went in for
his second stop, remaining 2nd on the road but losing the aggregate lead.
Could he catch Hill on aggregate? It was a tough ask but it seemed remotely

2nd to Hill.

through into 2nd place. Hounded by Hill, who pitted at the same time as
Michael, neither losing nor gaining time. Michael had just started to pull
out a gap, when he lost the rear end over a bump turning in to the first
left handed 90 degree corner, leading to him running wide and over the
grass. Made contact with the wall, damaging the rear suspension, when Hill
attempted to pass. The two cars collided, with Michael out of the race on
the spot and Hill out with broken suspension in pit-lane, making Michael
World Champion, although not in the circumstances he would have liked to
have done it in.

During Friday qualifying, Michael suffered steering failure, causing a very
big accident, reminding people how dangerous Formula 1 can be. At the start
of the race, Michael grabbed the lead, but he was hounded by Hill until his
1st stop on lap 18, dropping to 5th after the stop. He regained 4th when he
passed Berger on lap 20, and up to 2nd after the rest of the stops, with
Hill now leading, and edging away. However, on lap 31 Hill's rear
suspension failed, allowing Michael to take over the lead again. Led until
his 2nd stop on lap 35, handing the lead to Coulthard for 11 laps until
Coulthard's 2nd and final stop. Despite stopping again, Michael led the
rest of the way, taking the victory. Hours after the race finished, Michael
and Coulthard were disqualified over fuel irregularities, however their
placings were reinstated soon after.

caused by a spinning Alesi led to a restart. At the 2nd start, Michael
moved up to 2nd, and took the lead when leader Coulthard suffered an
electrical problem coming on to the main straight on lap 6. However, he had
been hounded by Hill since the start, and was passed by Hill at the end of
the start/finish straight at the start of lap 11, Coulthard repeating the
move 5 laps later, dropping Michael to 3rd. Moved back up to 1st as
Coulthard retired for good when the engine stopped again, and Hill had just
made his 1st stop. This lead only lasted until his own stop on lap 17,
dropping to 3rd behind Alesi and Hill after the stops, where he remained
for the rest of the race, thanks to inconsistent tyre performance - the 1st
set were so-so, the 2nd set good, the 3rd set were dreadful while the last

mobile roadblock, with Michael trailing him until Alesi stopped on lap 18,
moving Michael up to 2nd, and took the lead when Hill stopped on lap 22.
Michael then made his one and only stop on lap 31, dropping to 2nd, and
hoped that in the time he hadn't been following Alesi, that he had been
able to build up a lead that would prevent Hill from exiting from his 2nd 
stop ahead of him. When Hill left the pits after his 2nd stop on lap 41, he
resumed just a couple of seconds behind Michael, reducing this gap to
nothing almost immediately. On lap 46, Hill made an ambitious move on
Michael at Priory, resulting in both finishing their race playing in the

In qualifying, Michael did a lap that included a 360 degree spin as he

Herbert's best effort. At the start, Michael kept 3rd, stuck behind
Coulthard. Passed Coulthard for 2nd on lap 13 when he ran wide at the
chicane at the back of the circuit, where Michael remained until his 1st
stop. At this stop, however, the refuelling rig malfunctioned,
shortchanging him fuel, leading to an early 2nd stop just 9 laps later.
Stayed in 2nd, but was forced to run further on last 2 sets of tyres
because of the fuel rig problem, costing him any chance of catching Hill,
when it all came to nothing as a fuel pump failed on lap 74.

Crashed at Malmedy on Saturday morning on a damp track when he hit the
inside kerb. Qualified 16th after having to wait for car to be repaired for
the, quicker (as it turned out) 2nd qualifying session, setting a time on a
fairly damp but drying track, improving on his Friday best. On his 2nd run,
which would've been quicker, the gearbox changed down 6th from 5th twice
without prompting, one of these occurring at maximum revs on the main
straight, buzzing the engine to over 19000 rpm ... one well-used engine,
meaning no further run could be taken. At the start of the race, Michael
had moved up to 14th by La Source on lap 1, 13th by the end of lap 1, 10th
by the end of lap 2, 8th by the end of lap 3, 7th by the end of lap 4 and
5th by the end of lap 6, these last two places gained thanks to Herbert
spinning at the Bus Stop, and inadvertantly blocking Blundell, with Michael
passing them both. Followed Irvine for several laps until passing him at
Bus Stop on lap 11. Moved to 3rd when Coulthard had gearbox failure on lap
13, and took the lead when Hill and Berger pitted on lap 15. Fell to 2nd
behind Hill when Michael himself stopped on lap 18. At this point it began
to rain, and by lap 21 it was heavy enough for Hill to change to wets,
handing the lead back. By the start of lap 23, Hill had moved right onto
Michael's tail. The two of them headed up through Eau Rouge, with Hill
pulling alongside as they headed towards Les Combes. Despite being on
slicks to Hill's wets on a wet track, Michael hung around on the outside to
keep the lead! During the remainder of lap 23, Hill made a couple more
unsuccessful attempts to wrest the lead from Michael. At Les Combes on lap
24, Hill made it through, Michael oversteering before heading over the
grass and rejoining the track. By now the rain had stopped and the track
was drying out again, which led to Michael catching Hill, whom he passed on
lap 25 when Hill ran wide at Stavelot. At the end of lap 26 Hill changed to
slicks ... just as it started to rain again. However, Hill reduced the gap
to nothing after the Safety Car came out on lap 29, with both drivers
stopping for wets and fuel on lap 30. At the start of lap 33, the race
resumed, Michael leading with Hill right behind, but Hill's hopes were
dashed when he received a stop-go penalty for speeding in pit lane, as well
as a spin at La Source, leaving Michael well clear to take the win. A
protest by Williams led to Michael receiving a 1 race ban, suspended for 4
races.

After Coulthard spun off at Variante Ascari on the formation lap, Michael had

lap. At the 2nd start, with Coulthard on pole this time, he dropped to 3rd
behind Berger, moving up to 2nd when Coulthard spun off again on lap 14.
Michael was still only a couple of seconds behind Berger, and just ahead of
Hill. On lap 24, Michael and 3rd placed Hill came up to lap Inoue, Michael
doing it successfully, and so did Hill, only for Hill to slam into the back

making an attempt to pass on lap 11. On lap 19, Alesi, Hill and Michael all
made their 1st stops. Thanks to Benetton's pit work, Michael pulled out
first, managing to retain 4th place, moving up to 2nd after Berger's and
Herbert's stops. Pursued leader Coulthard, catching him just before Michael
took his 2nd stop on lap 37. Returned to the track still in 2nd, and set
off after Coulthard again. Took the lead when Coulthard made his final stop
on lap 49, but Michael still had a stop to go, so he piled on the speed as
he attempted to pull out enough time to leave the pit in the lead. He
suceeded in doing so, taking a win which clinched Michael's 2nd World

by himself, but when he exited the pits, he was following Coulthard who had
not yet stopped and was in no mood to make things easy. When Villeneuve
came out after his stop he was still in the lead. Although Michael caught
him again, he still couldn't find a way throught, finishing an extremely
close 2nd.

<H4>Imola 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 1st
<B>R :</B> 2nd
<P>
Fell to 3rd at start, before passing Hill at Tamburello on lap 2. Moved up
onto Coulthard's tail, where he remained until Coulthard's 1st stop on lap
20, when Michael took the lead until his own stop a lap later. Rejoined
5th, with Hill now leading as he was yet to stop. Moved up to 2nd as other
drivers made their 1st stops. When Hill came out after his 1st stop on lap
29, he was only just in front of Michael, but Michael was unable to move
past Hill. After his 2nd stop on lap 39, Michael returned to 2nd after
Coulthard's stop a lap later. Michael then lost about 15 seconds behind the
dicing H&auml;kkinen and Diniz, who baulked him for several laps as he
tried to lap them. Hill made his final stop on lap 50, emerging clearly in
the lead, Michael unable to improve his 2nd place, especially when on the
last lap the front left brake disc exploded, locking the wheel solid. He
was very lucky it didn't happen earlier.

<H4>Monaco 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 1st
<B>R :</B> DNF (crash)
<P>
Dropped to 2nd at wet start. Had a wild slide exiting Casino Square, before
hitting the barriers at the right hander after Loews. Probably Michael's
worst race performance of his career.
<P>
<H4>Barcelona 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
Dropped to at least 9th at the start, which was very wet. Had hauled his
way up to 6th by the end of lap 1, passed teammate Irvine for 5th on lap
2, moving up to 4th past a rallycrossing Hill on lap 4, and passed Berger
on lap 5. Now he closed quickly on Alesi, reeling him in almost
immediately. Passed Alesi at SEAT on lap 9, moving in to 2nd, and repeated
the move on Villeneuve on lap 12. At this point, Michael pulled away,
opening the gap by between 4 and 5 seconds a lap for several laps, allowing
him to make his 1st stop on lap 24 without losing the lead. Despite a 2nd
stop on lap 42, and engine problems during the 2nd half of the race,
Michael won easily. What a difference two weeks can make.
<P>
<H4>Canada 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> DNF (driveshaft fell off)
<P>
Started in last position on grid after engine failed to fire at start of
formation lap. Moved up to 17th by end of lap 1, 15th by the end of lap 2,
and was 14th by the end of lap 4. From this point on, an ever changing
front-rear brake bias, as well as an engine problem, meant that he was
unable to pass cars, gaining places when others retired. Michael did this
himself when exiting the pits on lap 40, as a driveshaft fell off.
<P>
<H4>Magny-Cours 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 1st
<B>R :</B> DNS (engine failure)
<P>
Not much to say. Engine detonated just after Adelaide hairpin on formation 
lap.
<P>
<H4>Silverstone 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> DNF (stuck in 6th gear)
<P>
Dropped to 4th at start. Was in the middle of a pack of cars when hydraulic
failure led to the gearbox being stuck in 6th gear at the end of Hangar
straight on lap 3.
<P>
<H4>Hockenheim 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 4th
<P>
Dropped to 4th at the start, with Coulthard and Villeneuve just behind,
staying that way until Coulthard's 1st stop. On lap 22, both Michael and
the following Villeneuve stopped, almost colliding as they exited the pits,
with Villeneuve sneaking past Michael at the next chicane as Michael
suffered brake problems. This pass dropped Michael to 6th, which became 5th
when Coulthard made his 2nd stop on lap 32. However, Coulthard was soon on
Michael;s tail again, pressuring him right to the finish, where Michael
took 4th after leader Berger's engine detonated on lap 43.
<P>
<H4>Hungary 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 1st
<B>R :</B> 9th (not running - sticking throttle)
<P>
Led away from start, just clear of Villeneuve, which is how it stayed until
the 1st round of stops, when Michael fell to 2nd, dropping away from
Villeneueve. This continued until Michael's 3rd stop, when he was passed by
Hill, and although Michael was losing time, he looked like he would finish
3rd. However a sticking throttle led to Michael's retirement from the race
on lap 71.
<P>
<H4>Spa 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
Had a high-speed crash during practice for the 2nd year running, this time
on Friday at Fagnes. Moved up to 2nd after making a good start. Followed
leader Villeneuve closely, and was still right behind him when Verstappen
had a huge crash at Stavelot on lap 11, causing the Safety Car to come out
soon after. Michael ducked into the pits on lap 14 before the other leaders,
moving up to 3rd behind the two McLarens who were running a one stop
strategy. When the race restarted on lap 18, he stayed in the wheel tracks
of the McLarens, with Villeneuve soon following Michael. Michael took the
lead on lap 24, after both McLarens had stopped. Still with Villeneuve on
his tail, Michael made his 2nd stop on lap 30, resuming the race in 2nd,
handing the lead to Villeneuve, who stopped on lap 32. As Villeneuve exited
the pits, Michael rounded La Source, with Michael flying past into the lead
as Villeneuve got up to speed. Led the rest of the way, keeping his good
record at Spa intact.

<H4>Monza 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd
<B>R :</B> 1st
<P>
Dropped to 6th at the start, but moved up to 4th on lap 2 with Coulthard's
demise and passing Villeneuve. Moved to 3rd on lap 4 when H&auml;kkinen's
damaged front wing caused him to pit, and moved up to 2nd when Hill
collided with the tyres on lap 6. Now Michael closed in on new leader
Alesi, and although he caught him, he couldn't find a way past. Alesi
stopped on lap 31, handing Michael the lead. With a clear track, Michael
flew around the track as he extended his lead over Alesi before his own
stop on lap 33. Rejoined the race in the lead, pulling steadily away for
the rest of the race, taking the win in front of the famous <I>tifosi</I>,
despite clipping the tyres at the 1st chicane on lap 40.
<P>
<H4>Estoril 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 4th
<B>R :</B> 3rd
<P>
Moved up to 3rd at start, following Alesi, with Villeneuve right behind.
The order stayed this way until lap 15, when Villeneuve passed Michael
around the outside, demoting Michael to 4th. Resumed in 3rd after the 1st
round of stops, then dropping to 4th after his 2nd stop. Michael now began
to catch Alesi, eventually catching him. Both Michael and Alesi made their
final stop on lap 44, with Michael getting the Ferrari out of the pits
before Alesi, moving Michael to 3rd where he finished.

<H4>Suzuka 1996</H4>
<B>Q :</B> 3rd

1st start was aborted when Coulthard stalled. Fell to 4th at the 2nd start,
moving to 3rd on lap 4 after Berger had made a ridiculous move to pass Hill
at the chicane on lap 3, damaging his front wing. Followed H&auml;kkinen to
1st round of stops, where he moved up to 2nd ahead of him. Remained in 2nd
for the rest of the race, even after his 2nd stop, although H&auml;kkinen
didn't give up without a fight, pushing right until the end.

<B>R :</B> 2nd

Qualified 3rd, behind both Williams. Lost 4 places by the entry of turn 1,
but was 3rd by the exit of it due to a multi-car collision. Shadowed Coulthard,
moving up to 2nd when leader Frentzen made his 1st stop. Dropped down to 5th
temporarily after stop around half-distance. Lost any chance of getting ahead
of Coulthard as he came out of the pits right behind traffic. Moved back to 3rd
after other drivers' stops, soon shadowing Coulthard again. Moved up to 2nd when
Frentzen stopped on lap 40. Had Frentzen closing in on him when forced to make a
stop for a splash of fuel on lap 51, dropping to 3rd. Regained 2nd when Frentzen
spun off with brake problems, remaining there until the finish.
