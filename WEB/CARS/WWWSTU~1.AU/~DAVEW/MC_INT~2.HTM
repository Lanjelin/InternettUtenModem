<H2>Interview With Michael - Jackie Stewart</H2>
<P>
Broadcast on the Channel 9 telecast of the Australian Grand Prix, 12 November 1995. The
interviewer is 3 times World Champion, Jackie Stewart.
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "2 times World Champion. Which was the most satisfying : the first, or the
second?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "I have to say the second one was more satisfying during the season. In
terms of feeling, myself, it was the first one because I remember well, after this race
in Australia last year, I went to bed at about 9 o'clock, just to have a little relax
before I went to the big party. And there came this amazing feeling up to me, and I
felt myself: "I think I'm World Champion now," which I didn't have so much in this
year because I was drunken before I actually went to bed and I didn't have the
possibility to get this kind of feeling, but in terms of racing, and the way the
championship has gone this year, it's certainly much more nice when you can
participate each race and show each race how competitive you are.
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "Well, sitting behind you there are the trophies of the two last Grand
Prixs you were successful in. What was your most satisfying Grand Prix of 1995?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "There were two actually. The 1st one was Hockenheim, definitely that was
my biggest target for this year, to win a German Grand Prix. In terms of racing, after
that it is certainly N&uuml;rburgring, and winning both home grand Grand Prixs is the
most satisfying thing you can have, particularly in the way I won N&uuml;rburgring; it
made a lot of fun to myself."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "Now the number of confrontations that you had, the two of you, because it
was basically the two of you. How has that affected your year, and any relationship
that you might have had with your closest rival of this time?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "It has always been a strange relationship in my view. We had certain
numbers of meetings where we saw each other and we spoken each other, and I mean, Damon
is this sort of person who sometimes tells you how nice the day was and what's the time,
and the next time you see him, he wouldn't even look at you. So it's difficult to come
along with such a person, but I mean we are competitors, and we never have been best
friends, and I don't need to expect him to be my best friend. I need to expect on the
race circuit to fight with him, to fight fair with him, which I have to say most of the
time he has done, and everything else doesn't matter to me - if he doesn't want to be
my friend, I don't need to be his friend, and I don't need him as my friend. There are
other persons I can do this with; I can have a very good battle on the circuit but
after the race we can have good fun, so."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "Now, you've had 2 championship years with Benetton, fantastic success,
particularly this one. Now you're leaving the most successful team. You're going to a
team that's got a very poor record, haven't won the World Championship for a driver for
16 years, 250 Grand Prixs. And the only people who have won there, Michael, is a
very tough, white South African called Jody Scheckter who kicked ass all the time; Niki
Lauda, 2 championships, who was a tough guy and really moved them around; way back
Fangio, a man who loved them and left them, after only one Championshup. That's not a
very good track record to be going to. Now, what takes you away from this fantastic
success pattern that you've got and relationship, to a team,with, so far in modern
times, not a very good history?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "Exactly what you've just explained. I think I don't need to explain
anything more, because you've just said what kind of a challenge this is gonna be to me,
and that's what I'm looking for."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "But are you comfortable? You're a strong man, but you're very young. The
history of young drivers going to Ferrari is not particularly good."
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "That's true. So let's change it."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "You think they're willing to change, do you think they're there and
receptive?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "I think that's the point. It's in my view, it's the right time to join
Ferrari to have success with them. They are very close to make this last step, they
are really willing to do this last step, and trying any effort they need to win the
Championship, they're willing to. I am willing to, so what is wrong at this
combination between me and them. And I'm pretty much look forward. I know it will not
be troublefree; but even in Benetton it wasn't troublefree, the point is that the
attention to the outside is a bit more in Ferrari, that's why it looks a bit more
difficult in Ferrari than it is in Benetton. Whether it is or not I'm gonna find out,
but I'm going to try my best. And, I'm pretty sure were going to have success, I'm
pretty sure it takes a bit of time, but once we know each other and we work the way we
should work we're going to have success."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "They're going to have to listen to you."
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "I have to listen to them, they have to listen to me."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "Not many years ago, you arrived, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed. Young and
inexperienced and somewhat naive. You're now 2 time World Champion not very many
years later. How's it changed your life?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "To be honest, except I'm married now, a married man, it hasn't changed
much. I'm still probably naive, as you just said. I believe in certain things, but
I think you have to. And you have to be naive to follow up what you want to achieve."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "There must be a lot more in the case of media attention, because it's
taken us 3 days to get this interview."
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "(laughs) That's true. I mean, in this respect, certainly there's a lot
more attention towards me being twice World Champion compared to, may have finished
once on the podium, is certainly different attention to the outside. But, at the end of
the day you still have your private time, or you sit in a racing car, and that's the
things you love to do, and that's where you rate yourself what has changed. And in this
respect nothing has changed. If you speak about the things around you have to do, sure,
there have been many changes."
<P>
<B>JS :</B> "Well, the best of luck tomorrow, best of luck for a 10th victory and
congratulations on the championship."
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "Thank you very much."
