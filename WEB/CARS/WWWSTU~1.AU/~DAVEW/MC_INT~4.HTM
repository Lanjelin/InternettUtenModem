<H2>Interview With Michael - Tony Jardine</H2>
<P>
Broadcast on the Channel 9 telecast of the Spanish Grand Prix, 2 June 1996. The
interviewer is Tony Jardine.
<P>
<B>TJ :</B> "A chance to reflect after Monte Carlo. Did you have a chance to think
about it afterwards, what had happened?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "There was not much to think about it, to be honest. It was quite clear
and straightforward what happened, and that's it. I mean, I know what I have to do,
and I have no personal problems with it. It's obviously a shame, and very hard if you
do yourself a mistake, but those things happen."
<P>
<B>TJ :</B> "Very rare for you to make a mistake, but are you happy to be in Barcelona
because it is more of a power circuit, and more opportunities to overtake here?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "For sure, in terms of overtaking, it's nicer to be here. But to be honest,
you have a very quick corner before the long straight, that means you have to stay a
certain gap behind the car in front of you, and you will not make up this gap in this
straight. So therefore, the circuits with very quick corners in front of a long
straight don't suit our situation for good overtaking."
<P>
<B>TJ :</B> "You happy with the power from the Ferrari engine now?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "Yeah, I've always been happy with it; there's always room to improve but
I've always been happy and so I am now."
<P>
<B>TJ :</B> "Also, you happy now Damon Hill is asking for more power from the Renault
engine to try and cope with the Ferrari threat, so you are getting under their skin at
the moment."
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "Is he? Yeah?" (chuckle)
<P>
<B>TJ :</B> "Yes he is. And also, Mercedes are catching up a bit, aren't they?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "Yeah, all are very close. I mean, don't forget Peugeot, they have
very close as well, but, as I have said many times, Ferrari have done a great job
in the engine department, and as well in car development. I'm very satisfied with
the progress we do, and we're not at the end yet."
<P>
<B>TJ :</B> "They said last year, a lot of the drivers, there were a lot of ripples on
this track which had an effect on you during your lap. Is it a bit better this year?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "No, it is exactly the same, and that's where aerodynamics very
important of the car, and obviously which suits the Williams very well. Doesn't suit us
so good at the moment, but we're working on it."
<P>
<B>TJ :</B> "Is it important to get pole here?"
<P>
<B>MS :</B> "I think it's always good. It's probably not as important as in Monte Carlo,
but still, overtaking in these days is difficult anywhere, and therefore a good grid
position is always good."
