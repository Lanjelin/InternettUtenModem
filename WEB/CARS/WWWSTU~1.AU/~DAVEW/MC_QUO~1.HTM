<H5>Mexico 1992</H5>
<!-- MOTOR -- >
"It was a hard race because I had Berger chasing me the whole way. I knew
he would be quick at the end, but when he started to push I was able to
respond even though I had a slight problem with my right front tyre. The
car was great otherwise and I am absolutely delighted to have taken my
first finish on the podium, I didn't think it would come this soon."
<HR>
<H5>Interlagos 1992</H5>
<!-- MOTOR -- >
"I got ahead of him, but then he came back on the outside. We touched
wheels a bit and then he went ahead again.

I got by him once, and then he slipstreamed past me on the straight the
next time around and got past me again. Then he started playing some sort
of game. He was accelerating and slowing down and creating an abnormal
situation. I got the feeling he was just playing with us. I don't know what
sort of game it was, but it was not a nice one. For a three times World
Champion it is not necessary to do something like this."
<HR>
<H5>Monaco 1992</H5>
<!-- MOTOR -- >
"It was getting stuck in first gear and in the end I thought it better not
to use first to make sure I got to the finish"
<HR>
<H5>Canada 1992</H5>
<!-- MOTOR -- >
"At the start of the race it was difficult with everyone so close together.
I was quicker than Berger in the opening laps, but as his fuel load
lightened he was a little bit quicker than me and I couldn't hold him. I
had been thinking about changing tyres, but with only 20 seconds gap to
Alesi I thought it wasn't a good idea. There wasn't any grip in the last 20
laps, but then I am sure it was the same for everyone else. After that I
just concentrated on finishing second which was great for me and the team."
<HR>
<H5>Spain 1993</H5>
<!-- MOTOR -- >
"I am really happy to have taken third place with the troubles I had today.
It was quite tricky." Michael commenting after taking third place, despite
tyre vibration causing the gearbox to select gears by itself towards the
end of the race.
<HR>
<H5>Spa 1993</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"When I released the clutch, the revs just died - in fact, at first I
thought the engine had stalled. It was like starting a road car in top
gear. Crazy. Fortunately, though, the car was absolutely fantastic today,
and I was able to get through the traffic quite well"
<P>
"And that was after passing some people!" Michael's remark about being in
ninth place at the end of lap one after an appalling start, thanks to a
malfunctioning automatic start system.
<P>
"As soon as he saw me, he turned left, right across in front of me. It was
completely ... unnecessary. I had to go across the grass, because otherwise
I would have crashed into him. It made me angry, but I didn't lift, and I
was still able to overtake him." Michael commenting on Senna's <I>wide</I>
exit from his pit stop on the run up to Eau Rouge.
<HR>
<H5>Interlagos 1994</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"We knew our car was fantastic, and we were hoping for a lot of success
this season, but not straight away."
<P>
"I never felt under pressure, to be honest, because I could control the gap
when necessary, just by pushing a bit harder. Everything felt so easy."
<P>
"I felt sorry for the spectators. I know they'd come here to see Senna win,
but, you know, I wanted something different."
<HR>
<H5>Barcelona 1995</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"I must admit I'm surprised at the gap between myself and the rest" Michael
commenting on the large time gap between himself on pole and the rest of
the field.
<P>
"My car is not handling as well as last year's, but in Imola I was just
pushing a bit too hard. It would be wrong to say that it was pressure."
<P>
"What encourages me is that we've made the car so much better with only
small changes, because we've got bigger changes coming. I think this is a
good sign for the rest of the year."
<HR>
<H5>Between Magny-Cours and Silverstone 1995</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"I think most of them realise now that I deserved the championship last
year - and the best proof of that is that I am leading again this season."
<P>
"I've never raced such a well-balanced car. It seems that the Williams goes
better than us in qualifying, but our car is better with a heavier fuel
load in the race."
<P>
"I only look at things from race to race. I want to do my best everytime -
and that's it. As long as I get the next corner right, I'm happy."
<P>
"Fortunately I had quick reactions. I expected him to close me down on one
side, which is allowed - I myself have done it in the past. But I wasn't
expecting him to slow down. He lifted off, which in an F1 car is the same
as going for the brakes on a road car - and you all know what happens when
somebody brakes suddenly in front of you on the road.
<P>
I am not happy about it. It is not what you expect. You know, there are a
few tricks, but some of these should not be done again. I will make sure of
that and so will the FIA. In the race, it made me more motivated - it made
me furious." Michael talking about the 1995 French GP.
<HR>
<H5>Monza 1995</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"I'm pleased with second and didn't really expect it. I thought third or
fourth would be the limit. I was miles off on my first run." (qualifying)
<P>
"I don't know what happened. I turned into the corner, not expecting
anything, and suddenly felt a big bang. It wasn't a small touch - Damon
really crashed into me. I'm very upset, because it's the second time that
this has happened now, and he's taken away more points from me, which I
could've gained by finishing in front of him."
<P>
"As a racing driver, even if there is somebody to overtake, you have to
judge it correctly. I don't understand why I have a four race suspended
sentence for a case which was nothing in the eyes of many people, not only
me, and Damon has a one race suspension for driving me right off the
track."
<P>
"I will never want to tangle deliberately or have an accident like that
because it just ruins the race." - Damon Hill
<HR>
<H5>F310 launch, February 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"I am quite comfortable inside Ferrari, but if something goes well or
badly, the faults in a marriage are always half and half. For example, I am
responsible for a spin, but sometimes you spin because of the car, and it
is up to me to create a situation in which the technical people are able to
correct the mistakes."
<P>
"I have been racing since I was four years old in karts. I started to race
for fun, and I still enjoy myself a lot in racing. Money is a strong
component, but it is not the most important one. I have not come to Ferrari
only for this, because I had another offer that was better."
<HR>
<H5>Melbourne 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"Williams has a clear advantage of about 0.5 - 0.75s a lap. But that is not
too far, and I think it is possible for us to make that time up by the
middle of the season.

I am surprised we were able to stay in front of Benetton, and that shows a
big step already. But the car is still not there, although it improved a
lot this weekend. This race was more or less a test.

Nevertheless, I'm confident. The car was much better during the race, and I
am very happy."
<HR>
<H5>Interlagos 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"So bad you would not believe it" Michael's comments on the Ferrari's
handling in Brazil.
<HR>
<H5>Argentina 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"Oh, I think this press conference is too short..."
<P>
"Well, I think I'm quite well trained..."
<P>
"I saw something black flying towards me, and instinctively ducked, because
I thought it was going to hit me in the face. Soon afterwards the car got
so loose that I realised something was wrong."
<HR>
<H5>Nurburgring 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"I made a mistake, and got too sideways at the previous corner, and that
was that. The Williams was better on acceleration, anyway, so there was
nothing I could do."
<P>
"All the time I was thinking about last year's race, when I was catching
Alesi in the last few laps, and I was hoping that maybe a situation would
come in which I could get past Jacques, as I did Jean. But Jacques drove a
fantastic race, and he also had the edge on top speed, so there was no way
for me to pass him."
<P>
"I thought this might be my one chance, but he judged all the moves
perfectly."
<HR>
<H5>Imola 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"It's difficult if you have two drivers fighting for position, because if
the marshals show them a blue flag, they probably think it is for the car
they are racing against." Michael commenting about the situation where he
was caught behind Hakkinen and Diniz for five laps while attempting to lap
them
<HR>
<H5>Monaco 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"It was entirely my own fault."
<P>
"I am very angry with myself."
<P>
"I made a mistake at the start, and I made a mistake here, too. I'm very
sorry for the team, and very angry with myself."
<HR>
<H5>Barcelona 1996</H5>
<!-- F1 Racing -- >
"In Brazil the car didn't handle and it hadn't felt very good in the wet
warm-up at Monaco, without a certain someone putting it into the wall on
lap one!"
<HR>
<H5>During mid-season 1996</H5>
<!-- F1 Racing -- >
"Last year's car had a very good base in terms of stability. It was easy to
drive at the limit. The new car was completely different and that was
unexpected. Basically, we had a worse car."
<HR>
<H4>Personal quotes</H4>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"You know, in F1, you can learn in one year what you might take 10 years to
learn in another career. It is so intense. You have to cope with the
pressure from everyone and the work. It is very hard. It has been hard for
me and for my family, but I love it and I work very hard to succeed. My
family remain very close with me too."
<P>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"It is impossible for us to be friends. I find it difficult to understand
him. Sometimes I see him and he reacts normally and says 'Hello', and the
next time he could be completely different. His mood is difficult to judge
and seems to change very often, while my mood stays more or less the same.
I get on fine with David Coulthard, who always treats me the same. I never
have a problem with him, and we can have a laugh together..." Michael on
Damon Hill
<P>
<H5>His motor racing hero</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"I was at a kart race in 1980 when I saw an outstanding driver - Ayrton
Senna. Since then he has been a hero for me."
<HR>
<H4>By other people</H4>
<HR>
<H5>During 1990 or 1991</H5>
<!-- Collings -- >
"He drove very fast, on these snowy roads, with only the wheel ruts to
drive in. I was nervous, very nervous, because we were going so fast. I
mean we were driving at very high speeds indeed and I felt quite frightened.
We were going faster than I felt was safe. When we got to the clinic, we
went in for our check-ups and we had our pulses tested. They took my pulse
and it was 100 or 120 or something and they said 'Hey, are you all right,
and what have you been doing?' and I said I had been a little excited, but
I would be better soon. I suggested they took Michael's pulse to see what
I meant after the drive we had just had and when they took his pulse it was
normal. I mean it was only 60 or 70 or something. It was just incredible."
 - Heinz-Harald Frentzen, travelling with Michael to have a physical.
<HR>
<H5>Late 1991/early 1992</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"When he started in Formula 1, he reminded me in many ways of Ayrton Senna.
He is the same type of person, has similar characteristics, and the same
ability to impose his will. When he gets over the learning period, he will
certainly belong to the highest level in Formula 1" - Bernie Ecclestone
<HR>
<H5>Adelaide 1991</H5>
<!-- Wheels -- >
"At 22, he is already the best prospect from his country in a generation,
one of those rare young drivers instantly at home in Formula One, neither
over-awed nor over-confident. The Australian Grand Prix will be only the
sixth of his life, yet already he feels free - and able - to sit it out into
a corner with the likes of Senna and Mansell." - Nigel Roebuck.
<HR>
<H5>End of 1992</H5>
<!-- Collings -- >
"Michael seems to be able to extract time out of various set-ups. When you
have a driver like that, it is sometimes a little more difficult to find the
optimum. He can drive round a problem, but what we have to find is the
set-up which is best for the race. Michael, because of his ability, will not
have a problem if a car oversteers a lot - even in the fast corners." - Ross
Brawn
<HR>
<H5>Spa 1993</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"Herbert was third early on in his Lotus but he would be bounced back when
the Senna and Schumacher Show came on after 20 minutes, but they were
nowhere near the pace, although there was barely a lift between them
through Eau Rouge." - Joe Saward
<HR>
<H5>Start of 1994 season</H5>
<!-- Wheels -- >
"Equally beyond doubt though, is that Schumacher has a degree of talent
seen only once or twice in a generation." - Nigel Roebuck
<HR>
<H5>End of 1994 season</H5>
<!-- Collings -- >
"Most drivers perform well for 90-95 percent of the time. But occasionally
they have the odd day during testing where you wonder what's happening and
you end up making no progress at all. But Michael is amazing. You never
question anything in terms of driver performance. If the car is going
slower, it is because you have done something to make it slower, and not
because he is having a bad day." - Ross Brawn
<P>
"He adapts his style to try various things. You cannot pigeonhole his style
because I've seen him do them all. Look at the way he uses a throttle. There
was a marked difference between Prost and Mansell in that Prost never jumped
on the throttle like Nigel, but I've seen Schumacher do it both ways,
depending on the circumstances. He will, if necessary, go back to his
go-kart techniques. But he won't do so if he upsets the car too much." -
Frank Dernie
<HR>
<H5>Between Magny-Cours and Silverstone 1995</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"Without being unfair to Damon or Benetton - because he is a fine and
outstanding driver and Benetton are a very good team - I think Schumacher
makes Benetton look very good, just as Ayrton Senna made McLaren look very
good. He is a consumate racer, who also helps the team to make very good
decisions." - Patrick Head
<HR>
<H5>During the off-season 1995-6</H5>
<!-- Autosport Review 95 -- >
"He works hard and, like all the greats - Senna, Prost Lauda whoever - he's
not only fast, he's also extremely intelligent. But the biggest benefit he
has is his speed, his ability, his confidence, and his physical fitness,
which allows him to use that speed every lap. He can drive 100 percent flat
out all day every day, and that's why even with a slower car sometimes, he's
won races." - Martin Brundle
<HR>
<H5>Before Melbourne 1996</H5>
<!-- Auto Action -- >
"I have to say that his driving style is very different to what we are used
to. Of course, if he is happy to drive it like that, we are happy to set it
up like that. But from what I understand of his driving style, it would
require a lot of concentration from the driver to maintain that fine
balance."
<P>
"The main difference which we have seen is his way of balancing the car on
the throttle...and that requires concentration. Picking up and getting on
the throttle so early in the corner is something you don't often see."

"For me, the Benetton situation (in beating Williams) was a clear
illustration of driver superiority." - John Barnard
<HR>
<H5>Melbourne 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"Before the race Michael said if he got ahead of me and I was running
faster he'd move over. The two of us have got to work together.

There's no point in fighting within the team, because then the team loses.
We've got to fight with everyone else and not ourselves." - Eddie Irvine
<HR>
<H5>Argentina 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"It was very exciting, wasn't it? Reminded me of rallying..." - Patrick
Head, on Michael's practice & qualifying efforts
<HR>
<H5>Monaco 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"Michael accepts errors from others, but not from himself." - Jean Todt
<HR>
<H5>Barcelona 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"Watching the Ferrari, I don't think the car was that brilliant. It looked
like it was on ice. The guy is just something else. Four seconds a lap
quicker than we were." - James Robinson, Williams engineer
<!-- F1 Racing -- >
<P>
"It was not a race. It was a demonstration of brilliance. The man is in a
class of his own; there's no one in the world anywhere near him." - Stirling
Moss
<HR>
<H5>Mid-season 1996</H5>
<!-- F1 Racing -- >
"He never lets up either. If he's not testing, he's training, or driving
a kart. He's a sad case. I don't know what's wrong with him. Maybe he was
an ugly kid, nobody would talk to him and he's getting his own back. There's
definitely something wrong!" - Eddie Irvine on his team-mate...in jest (we
hope!)
<P>
"It's a bit like having God in the number one car." - A Ferrari mechanic
commenting on how some other Ferrari workers see having Michael in
the team.
<P>

<HR>
<H5>Between Magny-Cours and Silverstone 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"How Michael does these things, I just don't know, because the car is just
so wrong it's unreal." - Eddie Irvine
<P>
"Sometimes you look at data and think 'that guy couldn't drive sheep.'
Another day you look at it, and it happens to be one M Schumacher, and you
think it's not possible to go that fast through that corner." - Martin
Brundle
<HR>
<H5>Hockenheim 1996</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"We're so firmly locked into the Ferrari contract, that if Michael drives
for Williams next year, I'll have to drive the Ferrari." - Willi Weber,
Michael's manager, on silly season rumours that Michael would drive a
Williams in 1997.
<HR>
<H5>Late in 1996 season</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"I really don't think that there has ever been a time when one driver had
such an edge over the rest." - Stirling Moss
<HR>
<H5>Post 1996 season</H5>
<!-- Autosport -- >
"You're never sure with the other guys. When he is driving another car, it
really needles you, because you're not sure whether the opposition has a
better car than yours. Or whether it's him!" - John Barnard
