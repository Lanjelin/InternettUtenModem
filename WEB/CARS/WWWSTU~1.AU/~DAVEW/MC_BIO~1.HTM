<H3>A Biography</H3>
<P>
On the 3rd of January 1969, Rolf and Elisabeth Schumacher became
the proud parents of a baby boy, Michael. Little did they know at
the time what lay ahead for the Schumacher family.
<P>
When Michael was four, he was given a pedal kart. His father,
Rolf decided to install an old motorcycle engine in the kart for
some more speed for his son. Michael enjoyed driving the now
faster kart, but unfortunately (or fortunately as it turned out)
he collided with a lamp post. This lead to the decision that
Michael would be far safer driving on the local kart track at
Kerpen-Horrem (as there were no lamp posts to hit!)
<P>
At the age of four he was the youngest member and driver at the
kart club. When Michael was five, Rolf built him the 'cheapest
go-kart ever built,' made from second-hand equipment which others
had discarded. He was probably still using this kart when he won
the club championship for the first time at the age of six. This
was despite his rivals being older and generally having better
equipment.
<P>
Although karting is comparatively cheap, it does still cost
money. Rolf soon realised that his son's karting career was
costing more money than he could afford, and eventually Michael
was faced with the prospect of the end to his karting career,
despite his obvious talent. However, this talent led local
business people, as well as friends of the family, to sponsor
him, allowing him to continue.
<P>
Jurgen Dilk helped Michael when he was ten by buying him a new
kart, and realising the driving ability that Michael had,
continued to support him, only asking for the trophies that
Michael won in return. He also helped to find other sponsors for
Michael.
<P>
Michael had a successful time karting in the mid-eighties. In
1984 he was German Junior Champion, repeating the feat in 1985 as
well as finishing runner-up in the Junior World Championship. In
1986 he finished third in the German Senior and European Senior
Championships, while in 1987 he won both the German Senior and
European Senior Championships.
<P>
Although karting was a large part of Michael's childhood, he did
go to school just like every other child. He showed ability in
several subjects, including mathematics and English, as well as
sports such as judo and soccer. When Michael was eleven, he had
the choice between taking part in a go-kart race or a judo
competition. Choosing the latter, he came third and immediately
realised he had made the wrong choice. However, racing was only a
hobby.
<P>
After completing his schooling, Michael took up an apprenticeship
as a mechanic at a local garage. At worst, he would have some
qualifications if his driving career failed. Actually, the
apprenticeship helped him greatly, as it helped him to understand
better how a car worked. Michael changed garages after one year
of his apprenticeship, working at Willy Bergmeister's garage;
Willy was a racer too. He completed his apprenticeship early
while working at Willy's garage.
<P>
In 1988, with sponsorship help from Jurgen Dilk, Michael took his
first step from karting into single seaters, that being Formula
K&ouml;nig. Although the cars have a small engine, the cars have
adjustable wings, making them the first step in single-seaters.
Michael won nine of the ten rounds, finishing second in the other
to become the clear champion at season's end. At the same time,
he also competed in the German Formula Ford series, finishing
sixth overall, as well as the European Formula Ford series,
finishing second overall. In fact, the European Formula Ford
Champion in 1988 was Mika Salo, a future Formula One competitor.
<P>
In 1989, Michael moved up to German Formula Three, driving for
WTS. WTS was Michael's introduction to Willi Weber, who has been
a part of Michael's career ever since. Michael was in contention
for the championship throughout the season, the two other
contenders being the Austrian Karl Wendlinger and fellow German
Heinz-Harald Frentzen. With one round remaining, Karl led the
championship, needing a very poor result to let either Michael or
Heinz-Harald through to win the championship. Despite finishing
fourteenth in the final round, Karl won the championship, beating
both Michael and Heinz-Harald by an agonising one point.
<P>
Michael went to Macau in 1989, winning the first heat after a
first-corner crash involving several cars. He again lead the
second heat but retired with mechanical problems.
<P>
In 1990, Michael returned to German Formula 3, winning the
championship despite not finishing in either of the first two
rounds of it. More importantly, he formed part of the new
Mercedes Junior Team (along with Karl and Heinz-Harald) in the
World Sports-Prototype Championship. Driving the Group C cars was
not easy, with turbocharged 5-litre V8 engines producing 700hp,
but this taught the drivers how to conserve tyres and fuel as
tyres could be trashed easily with 700hp under the right foot, as
well as having to make too many pitstops if excessive amounts of
fuel was used. The 'junior' drivers did well, with Michael
winning the final round with co-driver Jochen Mass in Mexico City
despite his dislike for the notoriously dangerous circuit.
<P>
Michael returned to Macau in 1990, taking second position on the
grid behind Mika H&auml;kkinen. Mika won the first heat, Michael
finishing second,and Mika again took the early lead in the
second. However, Michael passed Mika, although Mika trailed close
behind, close enough for the overall win as it was based on
aggregate time. Mika made a lunge for the lead on the final lap,
which Michael resisted, resulting in Mika's exit from the race.
Michael went on to win the heat and the race overall, despite
having to complete the remainder of the final lap without a rear
wing after his altercation with Mika.
<P>
In 1991, Michael again drove for Mercedes in the World Sports-
Prototype Championship, teaming up with Karl Wendlinger. However,
the Mercedes was outclassed for most of the year, with poor
reliability and lack of speed causing the greatest problems.
Michael again won the last round of the season, this time at
Autopolis. By the time he won at Autopolis though, he had
competed in five Formula One Grand Prix, one for Jordan and four
for Benetton, as well as one Formula 3000 race in Japan.
<P>
Michael made a spectacular debut in Formula One. Having driven a
Formula One car for the first time on the Tuesday before the
race, his qualifying position of seventh was remarkable. It was
even more remarkable if you consider it was the first time he had
visited the track! Although he retired in the race on lap one
with a clutch problem, he had made a significant impression on
the Formula One circus. So much so, that by the next race he was
now driving for Benetton.
<P>
Many discussions took place between Spa and the next race, which
was at Monza over where Michael would be driving for the rest of
the 1991 season and subsequent seasons, with both Jordan and
Benetton claiming that he would be driving for them. Eventually
things were sorted in Benetton's favour, with Michael signed up
for the remainder of 1991 and several subsequent seasons. Again
he impressed, outqualifying triple World Champion Nelson Piquet,
and scoring his first points as he finished fifth. A couple of
sixth places topped off the remainder of the season.
<P>
1992 was a learning year - learning to cope with a new team mate,
learning to drive new circuits, and learning to cope with new
expectations from others in terms of results. He learned well,
and managed to score a podium finish in only his eighth race, as
well as a front row grid position in only his tenth race, only
Nigel Mansell's dominant Williams-Renault faster. He was involved
in an incident with Ayrton Senna during a test at Hockenheim just
before the German Grand Prix. A misunderstanding occurred between
them on the track, leading to Michael brake-testing Senna. Ayrton
apparently didn't like this too much and grabbed Michael by the
throat when he returned to the pits in front of a group of
journalists. McLaren mechanics prised Senna off, with Michael
saying that maybe Ayrton wanted to give his neck a massage!
Michael's first win in Formula One came in only his eighteenth
race, involving both skill and a bit of luck as he understeered
off the circuit, but avoiding the barriers, continued on, and as
he saw the condition of team mate Martin Brundle's tyres, decided
a change to slicks was the right thing to do. This allowed him to
build up a lead which no-one was able to conquer. After a close
second in the final race of the season in Adelaide, he finished
third in the World Championship, a tremendous achievement in only
his first full year of Formula One.
<P>
1993 was a disappointing year in many ways, with many good
qualifying performances thwarted by a lack of reliability with
the car. He was set to win in Monaco when a '50 cent' part
failed, causing hydraulic failure. Also, a problem with
the traction control system led to lost places at the start
of at least two races, possibly costing him victory in the
Belgian Grand Prix. A string of podium finishes, as well as
another win offset that to an extent, bringing him fourth
in the World Championship.
<P>
1994 was a tumultuous and tragic year. Tragic, with the deaths of
the rookie Roland Ratzenberger and the brilliant triple World
Champion Ayrton Senna at Imola, as well as the crash of Karl
Wendlinger at Monaco. Tumultuous, as allegations of traction
control were levelled at the Benetton team, the passing of Damon
Hill on the warm-up lap at Silverstone and then not responding to
the black flag, Verstappen's pit-stop fire at Hockenheim, the
'too-thin' plank at Spa and finally the collision with Hill at
the final race of the season at Adelaide topped off a season full
of ups and downs as he won 8 races and became World Champion. It
was a year that many thought would be dominated by Senna, but it
was not to be. Michael himself believed that this may well have
occurred, with a statement made during a post-race interview at
Adelaide saying he would like to give the World Championship to
Senna. In Barcelona, Michael finished second in what was probably
his best ever drive, as for three-quarters of the race the car
was stuck in 5th gear. It was only the combination of the
flexibility of the Zetec-R engine, Michael's skill as well as
some of the techniques he had learned in Sports-Prototype racing
to maximize corner speed that allowed him to finish the race so
well.
<P>
1995 started off controversially when both Michael and David
Coulthard were disqualified from the Brazilian Grand Prix over
fuel irregularities. The FIA's subsequent decision over the
appeal confused the teams as the drivers got their points back
while the constructors didn't! When Michael crashed at Imola,
speculation from the press said he had 'cracked' under pressure.
The next few races certainly did not provide any more evidence of
this being the case. Another collision with Hill at Silverstone
lead to speculation of a bitter feud between Michael and Damon,
which both parties denied. A wet and dry race at Spa led to more
sparks as a minor clash between the cars when Hill on wets tried
to pass Michael on slicks in wet conditions at Les Combes, as
well as claims of blocking only led to further claims of a feud,
not helped at Monza when Hill and Schumacher went off again
together. The remainder of the season was reasonably
uncontroversial, as Michael took 3 wins, including one at the
N&uuml;rburgring where he charged from 40+ seconds behind to win the
race, after passing Alesi around the outside with just 2 laps to
go. Winning 9 races for the season, equalling Nigel Mansell's
1992 record, becoming World Champion for a second time, (the
youngest double champion), as well as helping Benetton secure
their first Constructors' Championship, in a car many
acknowledged was not as good as the Williams, made the
achievements even more meritorious. In fact, it will be a year
that he may well find hard (if not impossible) to beat.
<P>
1996 was an interesting year. Could Michael retain the title and
make it three in a row for only the second time in the history
of Formula 1? How well would 'rookie' (though 1995 IndyCar World
Series Champion) Jacques Villeneuve, and more importantly, how
well would Damon Hill do? Would he win the championship? Would
he keep his Williams drive? There seemed to be more worries during
the season off the track than on it! Despite little pre-season testing,
the two Ferraris occupied the second row in Melbourne, with Eddie
Irvine becoming only the third driver to outqualify Michael (each doing
so only once). However, the car was not fully sorted and ran several
of the early races with parts from the '95 car in the interests of
reliability. Still, Michael ran remarkably close to the lead in Argentina,
N&uuml;rburgring and Imola, with N&uuml;rburgring being a highlight as he
pushed Villeneuve hard for 2/3 of the race. Then came Monaco and the
meeting with the Armco... Barcelona was the exact opposite, as Michael
absolutely demolished the opposition, with a fastest lap more than <I>2</I>
seconds faster than anyone elses! Unfortunately this was followed by a
period of unreliability, the worst being the engine detonating on the warm-up
lap of the French Grand Prix, after Michael had managed to set pole!
Finally at Spa and Monza things turned better, as he won both races, with
the tifosi going beserk for the first Ferrari victory at Monza since 1988.
A third, and then second at the final race rounded off a reasonably
successful year - not as successful as some hoped, but as successful as could
be expeccted in the circumstances. Will the improved late season form continue
into 1997? Will Barnard design a better car for 1997, and has Ferrari solved
their reliability problems? Only time will tell.
