<H2>The Team Behind Michael</H2>
<H3>Luca di Montezemolo - Ferrari  President / Team Principal</H3>
<P>
This is not di Montezemolo's first reign at Ferrari. At the age of 25,
Luca was put in charge of Ferrari's Formula 1 team by Fiat chief Gianni
Agnelli in the mid 70's. In his time there, Niki Lauda won the drivers'
championship in 1975 and 1977 (and narrowly missed out on the 1976 title).
Since his return (after running the Italy 90 World Cup) he has rebuilt the
team, with results improving steadily year by year.
<P>
<H3>Jean Todt - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Sporting Director</H3>
<P>
Joined Ferrari after a successful career at Peugeot, most recently in
Sportscar racing, winning the title in 1992. Responsible for Peugeot's
motor sport activities from 1981 to 1992, he was also involved in
the winning of 2 World Rally Championships, 4 wins in the Paris-Dakar
epic and 2 Le Mans 24 Hours wins. He joined Ferrari after being
"head-hunted" by them, especially as Peugeot had confirmed during 1992
they weren't entering Formula 1 in 1993 (and then they did in 1994!).
Seen as the person to bring people together within the team, to stop
the previous infighting and politics within the team.
<P>
<H3>Ross Brawn - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Technical Director</H3>

<P>
Was responsible for the design of the awesome Jaguar XJR14 for TWR in 1991.
His time at Benetton began in the European summer of 1991, just before
Michael's time at the team began. He held the position of Technical Director
at Benetton until his departure at the end of the 1996 season. Masterminded
many of Michael's successes at Benetton.
<P>
<H3>Stefano Domenicali - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Team Manager</H3>
<P>
<H3>Rory Byrne - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Chief Designer</H3>
<P>
Has spent virtually all his life in Formula 1 at one team. He began his F1
life with Toleman, when they moved up to Formula 1 in 1981. Responsible for
the design of most of the F1 Tolemans and Benettons since then except for
the period when John Barnard was with Benetton. Byrne's work included the
B194 and B195, both Championship winning cars.
<P>
<H3>Gustav Brunner - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Research and Development Chief</H3>
<P>
<H3>Willem Toet - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Chief Aerodynamicist</H3>
<P>
Formerly of Benetton, including working on the Championship winning B194.
Moved to Ferrari at the start of 1995.
<P>
<H3>Paolo Martinelli - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Engine Design Chief</H3>
Joined Ferrari in 1995.
<P>
<H3>Giorgio Ascanelli - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Senior Race Engineer</H3>
<P>
Joined from McLaren in 1995, worked with Ayrton Senna during 1992 and 1993,
including his last win in Adelaide.
<P>
<H3>Nigel Stepney - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Chief Mechanic</H3>
<P>
Used to work for Benetton as their chief mechanic. Apparently a big fan of
Italian food (literally!)
<P>
<H3>Niki Lauda - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva adviser</H3>
<P>
Triple world champion (1975, 1977 and 1984). Supremely talented driver
who has advised the Ferrari team for the last couple of years. Rumoured
to be leaving the team.
<P>
<H3>Ignazio Lunetta - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Race Engineer (Schumacher)</H3>
<P>
Worked with Jean Alesi for the last five years. Finds Michael totally
concentrated, and is not "up and down" emotionally like Alesi was.
<P>
<H3>Claudio Berro - Ferrari Gestione Sportiva Press Officer</H3>
