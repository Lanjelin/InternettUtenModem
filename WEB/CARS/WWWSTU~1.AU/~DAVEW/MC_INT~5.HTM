<H2>TV Interviews</H2>
<P>
These are transcripts of interview with Michael that I have seen. 3 of these have only
been seen on Australian television (as far as I know), so they will be new to you.
I have deliberately not corrected any errors made during the interviews, so don't
say "Michael won 2 races for Mercedes" because I know that, but I decided to leave
them as they were presented for accuracy (to what was broadcast). Enjoy!
<P>
