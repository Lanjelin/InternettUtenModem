Schumacher with a flying lap to snatch pole in the closing minutes of qualifying</B><BR>He

1.30.812 in his Ferrari and then improving it to 1.30.598.<BR>Hill brought his

(1.30.907) will be on the second row, alongside Jean Alesi`s Benetton.<BR>Damon
Hill admitted he had &quot;left it very late&quot; before claiming pole position
for Sunday`s race.<BR>&quot;I was biting my nails as much as I could through my
gloves while waiting in the car wondering how it would go.&quot;<BR>&quot;I was
always going to ba a battle. There was a lot of traffic when I was out there,
but it was vital to get a clear lap and we finally managed it.&quot;<BR>&quot;We
need pole position here as it is so difficult to overtake.&quot; Hill will
become only the eihght person to ever win four successive race if he is
victorious in Sunday`s race.</CITE></P>
