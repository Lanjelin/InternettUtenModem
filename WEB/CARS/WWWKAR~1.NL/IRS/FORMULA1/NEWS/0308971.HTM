<p>Damon Hill qualified for the season opener by the smallest of margins. The world champion, dumped by the Williams team last season, scraped through after gearbox problems in his first outing with his new Arrows team. He will start his title defence on the back row unlike his former team-mate Jacques Villeneuve, who took pole position with a qualifying lap record. The Canadian's new team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen joined him on the front row while Michael Schumacher was third.</p>
