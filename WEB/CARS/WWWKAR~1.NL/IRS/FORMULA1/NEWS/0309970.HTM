<p>Scotland's David Coulthard produced a flawless performance to earn the second win of his Formula One career. The 25-year-old came home well clear of Michael Schumacher and teammate Mika Hakkinen to give McLaren their first victory for four years. Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who twice led the race, spun off with three laps to go when poised to challenge Coulthard. Damon Hill failed to start after his car broke down on the parade lap and Jacques Villeneuve exited early on.</p>

<p>David Coulthard got his tactics absolutely right as an immaculate drive gave him victory at Albert Park. McLaren's one-stop strategy paid off as Coulthard won for the first time since Portugal in 1995. He inherited the lead when Heinz-Harald Frentzen went into the pits after lap 17 and stayed out unitl making his own stop 16 laps later. Coulthard regained the lead when the German pitted again with ten laps left and drove superbly for a deserved win.</p>

<p>Super Scot David Coulthard savoured the best moment of his F1 career following his tremendous win at Albert Park. <em>"It's an absolutly fantastic start to the year. It's a better feeling than when I won my first Grand Prix for Williams in 1995. When you see Michael Schumacher in your mirrors, you have to concentrate and he pushed me very hard."</em></p>
