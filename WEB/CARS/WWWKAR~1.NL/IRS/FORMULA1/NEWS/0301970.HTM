<p>Organisers of next week's Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne have reacted angrily after several barrels of diesel oil were dumped on the track. The vandalism at Albert Park is seen as an attempt to stop the race going ahead but Grand Prix Corporation chairman Ron Walker said: <em>"It will be on time and it will be a great event."</em> The oil slick was four metres wide in parts and Walker added: <em>"This is an act of violence against all Australians with Australia on show next week."</em></p>
