Damon Hill has suffered an embarrassing start to his racing career with TWR Arrows when the seat for his car failed to arrive in Melbourne. Team technicians hurriedly built him a new one just in case the original fails to arrive ahead of initial practice. <em>"It's one of the most important parts,"</em> said technical director Frank Dernie. <em>"We are not sure where it is. Damon cannot race without one, that is for sure. When you make a new one, you never get it right first time."</em>
