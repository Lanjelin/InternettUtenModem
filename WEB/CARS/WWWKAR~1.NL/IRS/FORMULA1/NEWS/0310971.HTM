<p>Damon Hill has vowed to keep faith with the Arrows team despite his nightmare weekend at the Australian Grand Prix. The reigning world champion, who is on a £4,5m deal with Arrows, failed to start the race after his car broke down on the parade lap in Melbourne. But Hill said: <em>"knew the moment I did not have the opportunity of going with a top team, my life would be difficult. There will be a new champion this season. I know that. But I'm not one to walk away from a difficult situation."</em></p>
