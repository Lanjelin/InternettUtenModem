<p>World champion Damon Hill suffered a nightmare start to the new Formula One season when he went out of the race before it had even started. The luckless Briton, who qualified only 20th on the grid, failed to finish the parade lap in his Arrows-Yamaha. He was hit by a throttle problem and had to park at the side of the circuit. Hill did not have time to get back to the pits for his spare car before the race, which was eventually won by David Coulthard got under way.</p>

<p>Damon Hill was left shaking his head in disbelief after going out of the race on the warm-up lap. <em>"I'm very dissappointed. The team has got greater potential than we have seen this weekend. It's shame we didn't get to now that in the race. We'll have to go away and do a lot more testing,"</em> said Hill. <em>"I didn't have any throttle. It's operated hydraulically, but I only had tick-over revs and didn't have any power to accelerate,"</em> he added.</p>
