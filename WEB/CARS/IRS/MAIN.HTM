The 25-year-old came home well clear of Michael Schumacher and teammate Mika Hakkinen to give McLaren their first victory for four years. Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who twice led the race, spun off with three laps to go when poised to challenge Coulthard. Damon Hill failed to start after his car broke down on the parade lap and Jacques Villeneuve exited early on.

The Canadian was outpaced off the grid by Heinz-Harald Frentzen and eventual winner David Coulthard. He was then clipped from behind by Eddie Irvine's Ferrari at the opening left-hander and slid off, taking the Sauber of Johnny Herbert with him. Irvine did not much further as a damaged front wheel forced him to call it a day.
