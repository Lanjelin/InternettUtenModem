The online version of the International Racing Site is version 4.0. There were lay-out changes in version 2.0 and 4.0. Version 3.0 was an improvement on 2.0 because of the low-space we had available. Currently, with help of our sponsors, we have more space available, and with this space we had the possibility to improve the lay-out again. We started the International Racing Site on 20 March 1996 without any announcement in April. So the page was available for public on 28 April 1996. Let's see what the latest changes are:</td></tr>
