<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Start of
the season</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">This year the
starting grid will have 24 cars with 2 brand new teams: Stewart
Grand Prix and Lola Grand Prix Engineering. Jacky Stewart
build-up a team along with his son Paul Stewart. They signed
Brazilian Rubens Barrichello and Danish Jan Magnussen. Magnussen
has already driven a Grand Prix with McLaren and he looks forward
to drive for a team a whole season. Barrichello coimes from
Jordan-Peugeot and wants to have a new challenge.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Pre-season
testing</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last week's changes to the Ferrari
F310B were aerodynamic. Aerodynamic improvements at the front of
the car helped improve the handling of the F310B, but Schumacher
reiterated his claims that he will not yet be able to challenge
at the front of the field, and that he will be battling for
points and only able to get on the podium through luck. A
spokesman added: <em>&quot;The team knows progress has been made,
but whether it is enough is in doubt. Many other teams showed
last week in Estoril they have made significant progress. The new
Ferrari is quicker than the old one, but so are the other
teams.&quot;</em> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All the improvements, in contrast
to what Schumacher and the team said, will contribute to Michael
Schumacher's 3rd World Championship title, whereupon 49% of the
German fans are guessing likely to happen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All teams presented their car to
public in winter, where McLaren firmly stood out. They launched
the chassis before they presented the West McLaren Mercedes
colors. Lola had just one week to shake down their car, but
nevertheless they are hoping to have their own V10 engine before
the Grand Prix of England. Tyrrell were very optimistic about
their Dutch driver Jos Verstappen, who will get another chance
after last years terrible year with the unreliable Arrows-Hart.
Team chief Tom Walkinshaw and Damon Hill, who have to defend his
world title, are hoping to finish in first position for 3 or 4
times this year. Pre-season testing shows something else, while
the team had a lot of trouble with the Gearbox. All the time
other small defects showed up. Damon has to prove he is a winner
in all cars he drives.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>GoodYear
vs Bridgestone</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Jos Verstappen
tested the Bridgestone tyres in Japan during the 1996 season. The
results were very impressive and five teams will leave the pits
on Friday with Bridgestone tyres. GoodYear had to improve what
was possible. In the latest part of pre-season testing there were
a lot of track record improvements on Estoril and Barcelona. It's
very impressive to see that the fight started be the start of the
season. There are rumours about Michelin (partnership with Prost
Grand Prix) and Pirelli (Schuderia Ferrari) to enter Formula One
in the very near future.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Ayrton
Senna trial</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">It's very sad that
this happens in Formula One, but it's the jurisdiction in Italy.
Lawyers for Newey and Bruynseraede had argued when the trial
opened two weeks ago that much of the case built up against their
clients over the past three years should be ignored because they
had not been warned they were under investigation. Costanzo
rejected the submissions as unfounded. He also threw out a
separate challenge on territorial jurisdiction from Newey's
counsel, which told the court on Friday that the trial should be
moved to the city of Bologna, where Senna was declared dead in
hospital. The trial is likely to last several months, with only
one or two sessions a week scheduled for the makeshift courtroom.
The accused face a maximum five years in jail if found guilty of
the charges. Prosecution and defence have automatic rights of
appeal against any sentence.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Ready,
set.... Go!</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The FIA Formula
One World Championship 1997 will start on Friday March 7. The IRS
will cover all Grands Prix this year and present you the latest
news on Formula One. Let's see what it will be this year...</font></p>

Grand Prix, Melbourne</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Damon Hill opens
the defence of his title at the start of what promises to be one
of the most intriguing Formula One seasons for some time. Jacques
Villeneuve is favourite to succeed Hill, but the step up from
rookie to champion is no formality. He is sure to be pressed hard
by German Michael Schumacher, providing Ferrari can give him the
package he needs. Their prospects and those of Hill's Arrows and
the new Stewart team should keep fans enthralled over the
weekend.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Britain's Damon
Hill has no intention of being kept out of the timelight for long
despite joining Arrows following his surprise release by
Williams. He acknowledged that he is unlikely to be spraying
champagne from the podium during the 1997 campaign. But he said: <em>&quot;I
want to make progress with Arrows this season and there is room
and potential to do so. Then I can start thinking about winning
again. The will is still there to win.&quot;</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Title favourite
Jacques Villeneuve is intent on taking the fast track to success
this season. <em>&quot;It's vital to get a good start and build
up points as quickly as possible. These first few races are the
most important,&quot; </em>the Canadian said.<em> &quot;If you
can put points in the bag, then you can have a race strategy and
play on that lead,&quot; </em>he added. Villeneuve led for 53
laps at Albert Park 12 months ago before oil problems handed
victory to Damon Hill.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">German
Heinz-Harald Frentzen is aware that the weight of expectation
will be on him when he makes his competitive debut for Williams
this weekend. He was head-hunted by the team after champion Damon
Hill learnt that his services were no longer required. <em>&quot;This
season will be the biggest challenge of my life. Everybody in the
world will be looking at me and analysing any mistakes,&quot; </em>said
Frentzen. <em>&quot;The air at the top is very thin, it's going
to be interesting for everyone.&quot;</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">David Coulthard
believes he has the car and the ability to give McLaren their
first win since 1993 this season. <em>&quot;We are much better
prepared for this season than we were for the last one,&quot; </em>the
Monaco based Scot commented. <em>&quot;It's difficult to tell
just how good the car is from testing, but it is looking a lot
better for us. My target is to win a few races and finish as high
up the championship as I can. I still believe I can win the title
one day,&quot; </em>he added.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Irishman Eddie
Irvine believes Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher will be the
man to beat in this seaon's battle for the driver's title. They
have a lot of ground to make up after Williams won 12 of the 16
races last season. <em>&quot;I would certainly tip Michael. If
more teams win races then you do not need to win many to take the
championship. The thing about Michael is that he does not make
mistakes,&quot; </em>said Irvine, who was third in Australia last
year.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Jackie Stewart is
on tenterhooks ahead of Sunday's race when the gap between his
new F1 outfit and the leading teams will finally be revealed. <em>&quot;This
is the single most important race of my life,&quot; </em>said
Stewart. <em>&quot;It's a bigger challenge than any I faced as a
driver - sometimes I think winning those three competitions
seemed very easy by comparison. It took Frank Williams about ten
years to get the top. I hope it will take us a few years
less.&quot;</em></font></p>
