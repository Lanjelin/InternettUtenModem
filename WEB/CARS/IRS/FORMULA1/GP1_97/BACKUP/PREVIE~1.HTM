Grand Prix, Melbourne</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Damon Hill opens
the defence of his title at the start of what promises to be one
of the most intriguing Formula One seasons for some time. Jacques
Villeneuve is favourite to succeed Hill, but the step up from
rookie to champion is no formality. He is sure to be pressed hard
by German Michael Schumacher, providing Ferrari can give him the
package he needs. Their prospects and those of Hill's Arrows and
the new Stewart team should keep fans enthralled over the
weekend.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Britain's Damon
Hill has no intention of being kept out of the timelight for long
despite joining Arrows following his surprise release by
Williams. He acknowledged that he is unlikely to be spraying
champagne from the podium during the 1997 campaign. But he said: <em>&quot;I
want to make progress with Arrows this season and there is room
and potential to do so. Then I can start thinking about winning
again. The will is still there to win.&quot;</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Title favourite
Jacques Villeneuve is intent on taking the fast track to success
this season. <em>&quot;It's vital to get a good start and build
up points as quickly as possible. These first few races are the
most important,&quot; </em>the Canadian said.<em> &quot;If you
can put points in the bag, then you can have a race strategy and
play on that lead,&quot; </em>he added. Villeneuve led for 53
laps at Albert Park 12 months ago before oil problems handed
victory to Damon Hill.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">German
Heinz-Harald Frentzen is aware that the weight of expectation
will be on him when he makes his competitive debut for Williams
this weekend. He was head-hunted by the team after champion Damon
Hill learnt that his services were no longer required. <em>&quot;This
season will be the biggest challenge of my life. Everybody in the
world will be looking at me and analysing any mistakes,&quot; </em>said
Frentzen. <em>&quot;The air at the top is very thin, it's going
to be interesting for everyone.&quot;</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">David Coulthard
believes he has the car and the ability to give McLaren their
first win since 1993 this season. <em>&quot;We are much better
prepared for this season than we were for the last one,&quot; </em>the
Monaco based Scot commented. <em>&quot;It's difficult to tell
just how good the car is from testing, but it is looking a lot
better for us. My target is to win a few races and finish as high
up the championship as I can. I still believe I can win the title
one day,&quot; </em>he added.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Irishman Eddie
Irvine believes Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher will be the
man to beat in this seaon's battle for the driver's title. They
have a lot of ground to make up after Williams won 12 of the 16
races last season. <em>&quot;I would certainly tip Michael. If
more teams win races then you do not need to win many to take the
championship. The thing about Michael is that he does not make
mistakes,&quot; </em>said Irvine, who was third in Australia last
year.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Jackie Stewart is
on tenterhooks ahead of Sunday's race when the gap between his
new F1 outfit and the leading teams will finally be revealed. <em>&quot;This
is the single most important race of my life,&quot; </em>said
Stewart. <em>&quot;It's a bigger challenge than any I faced as a
driver - sometimes I think winning those three competitions
seemed very easy by comparison. It took Frank Williams about ten
years to get the top. I hope it will take us a few years
less.&quot;</em></font></p>
