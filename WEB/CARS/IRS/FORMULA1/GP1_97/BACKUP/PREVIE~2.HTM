<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Start of
the season</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">This year the
starting grid will have 24 cars with 2 brand new teams: Stewart
Grand Prix and Lola Grand Prix Engineering. Jacky Stewart
build-up a team along with his son Paul Stewart. They signed
Brazilian Rubens Barrichello and Danish Jan Magnussen. Magnussen
has already driven a Grand Prix with McLaren and he looks forward
to drive for a team a whole season. Barrichello coimes from
Jordan-Peugeot and wants to have a new challenge.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Pre-season
testing</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Last week's changes to the Ferrari
F310B were aerodynamic. Aerodynamic improvements at the front of
the car helped improve the handling of the F310B, but Schumacher
reiterated his claims that he will not yet be able to challenge
at the front of the field, and that he will be battling for
points and only able to get on the podium through luck. A
spokesman added: <em>&quot;The team knows progress has been made,
but whether it is enough is in doubt. Many other teams showed
last week in Estoril they have made significant progress. The new
Ferrari is quicker than the old one, but so are the other
teams.&quot;</em> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All the improvements, in contrast
to what Schumacher and the team said, will contribute to Michael
Schumacher's 3rd World Championship title, whereupon 49% of the
German fans are guessing likely to happen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All teams presented their car to
public in winter, where McLaren firmly stood out. They launched
the chassis before they presented the West McLaren Mercedes
colors. Lola had just one week to shake down their car, but
nevertheless they are hoping to have their own V10 engine before
the Grand Prix of England. Tyrrell were very optimistic about
their Dutch driver Jos Verstappen, who will get another chance
after last years terrible year with the unreliable Arrows-Hart.
Team chief Tom Walkinshaw and Damon Hill, who have to defend his
world title, are hoping to finish in first position for 3 or 4
times this year. Pre-season testing shows something else, while
the team had a lot of trouble with the Gearbox. All the time
other small defects showed up. Damon has to prove he is a winner
in all cars he drives.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>GoodYear
vs Bridgestone</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Jos Verstappen
tested the Bridgestone tyres in Japan during the 1996 season. The
results were very impressive and five teams will leave the pits
on Friday with Bridgestone tyres. GoodYear had to improve what
was possible. In the latest part of pre-season testing there were
a lot of track record improvements on Estoril and Barcelona. It's
very impressive to see that the fight started be the start of the
season. There are rumours about Michelin (partnership with Prost
Grand Prix) and Pirelli (Schuderia Ferrari) to enter Formula One
in the very near future.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Ayrton
Senna trial</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">It's very sad that
this happens in Formula One, but it's the jurisdiction in Italy.
Lawyers for Newey and Bruynseraede had argued when the trial
opened two weeks ago that much of the case built up against their
clients over the past three years should be ignored because they
had not been warned they were under investigation. Costanzo
rejected the submissions as unfounded. He also threw out a
separate challenge on territorial jurisdiction from Newey's
counsel, which told the court on Friday that the trial should be
moved to the city of Bologna, where Senna was declared dead in
hospital. The trial is likely to last several months, with only
one or two sessions a week scheduled for the makeshift courtroom.
The accused face a maximum five years in jail if found guilty of
the charges. Prosecution and defence have automatic rights of
appeal against any sentence.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Arial"><strong>Ready,
set.... Go!</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The FIA Formula
One World Championship 1997 will start on Friday March 7. The IRS
will cover all Grands Prix this year and present you the latest
news on Formula One. Let's see what it will be this year...</font></p>
