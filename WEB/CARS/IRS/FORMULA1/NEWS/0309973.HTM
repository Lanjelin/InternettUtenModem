<p>Michael Schumacher launched his season with a actipically polished drive to finish second behind David Coulthard. He looked set for third place after being forced to make a second pit-stop but Heinz-Harald Frentzen's exit gave him the runner-up position. <em>"The podium was the best I was hoping for so second is a good start to the season,"</em> the German said. <em>"The good thing is Jacques (Villeneuve) didn't score but he will score many points this year, in my view."</em></p>

<p>Heinz-Harald Frentzen looked forward to future success with Williams despite seeing his hopes of victory ended by brake problems with three laps to go. <em>"We knew this circuit was going to be hard on the brakes, but I think we didn't realise how hard it would be and in the end they went off. I pushed in the middle section of the race, but knew this would be hard on the brakes so I backed off,"</em> he said. <em>"I'm looking ahead to the next race and we will be ready there."</em></p>
