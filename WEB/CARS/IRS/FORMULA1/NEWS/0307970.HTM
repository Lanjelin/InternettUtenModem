<p>Damon Hill lasted just seven laps in the first practice session in his new TWR Arrows. His car had to be winched off the track after grinding to a halt with suspected transmission failure. He recovered in the second session as Hill completed 26 laps and was 13th quickest, with arch-rival Michael Schumacher's Ferrari leading the way. Hill used a replacement seat in his car after the original was lost in transit, contrary to early reports from Arrows. Damon Hill was putting a brave face on things as he looked back on a tough first practice session with Arrows.</p>

<p>The world champion said: <em>"I think that was a success, we had some gearbox problems but I am pleased to be only two and a half seconds of the front. If I can qualify two and a half seconds away from the front of the grid that will be a really good result for us right now. To muscle ourselves into the top 10th of qualifying would be really pleasing."</p>

<p>Damon Hill admitted to allowing his mind to wander back to the good old days in Friday's first practice. He said: <em>"I had a relatively trouble free-session. I was on my own so much I could fantasise I was out front again. When I was going round I saw a picture on the big screen of a Williams and naturally assumed it was me before realising it wasn't"</em>. Hill finished the afternoon session 13th fastest, with arch-rival Michael Schumacher setting the early pace.</p>
