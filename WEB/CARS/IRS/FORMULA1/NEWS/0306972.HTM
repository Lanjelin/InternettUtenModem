Damon Hill has predicted he will surprise his rivals this season even though it may take him some time to get into his stride with Arrows. There are cars Hill may falter in Australia but he said: <em>"After this race we can start to look ahead. There are certain things about the car which I don't believe anyone else has access to. Hopefully that will give us a benefit later in the season. I have not done many laps in the car but that will change this weekend.</em>
