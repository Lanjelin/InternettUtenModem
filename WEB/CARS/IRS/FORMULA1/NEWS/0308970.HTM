<p>Damon Hill suffered more problems in qualifying for Sunday's race when his car ground to a halt in Australia. The world champion had just returned to the circuit after free practice had been halted when his Arrows-Yamaha car suffered fresh problems. Hill was forced to partk the car on the sidelines for the second day running after a similar incident on Friday. This time Hill had managed only nine laps before seeing his session forced to a premature end.</p>
