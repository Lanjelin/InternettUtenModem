<p>German Michael Schumacher on Thursday predicted his Ferrari would make a slow start to the season after ruling himself out as a contender in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. <em>"We won't be able to win races in my view, not right from the beginning anyhow,"</em> Schumacher said of his prospects on Sunday at the Albert Park street circuit.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old double world champion has set his sights on earning enough points during the early rounds to stay within touch of the leaders in the hope of mounting a challenge later in the year. <em>"We should be able to get on the podium in the first couple of races,"</em> said Schumacher, regarded as the main challenger to title favourite Jacques Villeneuve of Canada this weekend. <em>"I am sure that we will be competitive at certain times and I am hoping that we won't have lost too many points (by then),"</em> said Schumacher, who dominated the sport in 1994 and 1995 with Benetton before finishing third in the drivers' championship with Ferrari last year. Speaking to reporters at a news conference at the circuit, Schumacher said: <em>"My aim is to be in a position to fight for the championship -- I don't care how many victories I get as long as I am in a position to fight for it."</em>

<p>Villeneuve has emerged as the driver to beat after the all-conquering Williams-Renault team gave him promotion after dumping world champion Damon Hill for the 1997 season. Villeneuve, runner-up to Hill last year, said he hoped other drivers would also emerge as potential rivals. <em>"I hope it's going to be head-to-head with many more drivers than just Michael, because it's more fun,"</em> said the 25-year-old Villeneuve, who finished second behind Hill in last year's Australian grand prix on his debut in Formula One. <em>"I'm really looking forward to this race and to start at least one place better than last year,"</em> Villeneuve said. The former IndyCar champion said he had gained valuable experience during his debut season in Formula One last year. <em>"I know the basics now. Last year here, I had everything to discover."</em></p>

<p>After losing his berth at Williams, Hill joined the Arrows team but the 36-year-old Briton has admitted he has no chance of winning Sunday's race or the title. <em>"We have a lot of ground to make up and there is no good in treading water -- so it is hard work for everyone at the team,"</em> he said. Hill said the team's Yamaha engine needed particularly strong development work to bring it up to scratch and warned that would take months to achieve.</p>
