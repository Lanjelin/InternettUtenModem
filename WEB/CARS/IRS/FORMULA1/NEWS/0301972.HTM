<p>The latest session of the Senna trial took place on Friday February 28. The judge at the Ayrton Senna manslaughter trial rejected challenges from two of the defendants and ruled that proceedings against all six accused should move ahead. The judge, Antonio Costanzo, adjourned the trial until March 5, when the prosecution is due to present its case. Williams team chief Frank Williams, technical director Patrick Head, designer Adrian Newey, race director Roland Bruynseraede and Imola track officials Federico Bendinelli and Giorgio Poggi all deny charges of manslaughter.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Newey and Bruynseraede had argued when the trial opened last week that much of the case built up against their clients over the past three years should be ignored because they had not been warned they were under investigation. Costanzo rejected the submissions as unfounded. He also threw out a separate challenge on territorial jurisdiction from Newey's counsel, which told the court on Friday that the trial should be moved to the city of Bologna, where Senna was declared dead in hospital.</p>

<p>Chief public prosecutor Maurizio Passarini alleges Senna lost control of his car because the steering column snapped as a result of poor welding. He also alleges that race officials allowed the Grand Prix to take place on a dangerous track. The Williams team says the steering column snapped after the crash.</p>

<p>Frank Williams is expected to attend the March 5 session when Passarini presents his case, according to one of his lawyers. The trial is likely to last several months, with only one or two sessions a week scheduled for the makeshift courtroom. The accused face a maximum five years in jail if found guilty of the charges. Prosecution and defence have automatic rights of appeal against any sentence.</p>
