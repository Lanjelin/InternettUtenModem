<p>Title favourite Jacques Villeneuve went out of the race at the first corner in a dramatic start to the race. The Canadian was outpaced off the grid by Heinz-Harald Frentzen and eventual winner David Coulthard. He was then clipped from behind by Eddie Irvine's Ferrari at the opening left-hander and slid off, taking the Sauber of Johnny Herbert with him. Irvine did not much further as a damaged front wheel forced him to call it a day.</p>

<p>Frustrated Jacques Villeneuve accused Eddie Irvine of attempting a "kamikaze pass" following his first corner exit. <em>"It's enormously frustrating for me, especially after dominating qualifying by more than a second and a half. Approaching the turn, I was on the inside of (Johnny) Herbert and suddenly Irvine went on the dirt and tried a kamikaze pass,"</em> the Canadian said. <em>"It's not the first time he's done something like that. It doesn't surprise me, coming from him."</em></p>

<p>Johnny Herbert stammed Irishman Eddie Irvine following his first lap exit from the season's opening race. Herbert made an excellent start in his Ferrari-powered Sauber but was taken off by Jacques Villeneuve after Irvine had clipped the rear of his car. <em>"As we went into the corner I could see he (Villeneuve) wasn't turning. We just interlocked wheels and that was it. Eddie has got to think a little bit more about what he is doing at the start,"</em> Herbert commented.</p>
