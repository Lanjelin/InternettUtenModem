<p>He sat in the sunshine at the back of the Jordan motor home and smiled. He was surrounded by a mass of heaving reporters, thrusting tape-recorders into his face. But he was not bothered. 21-year-old Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of double world champion Michael, had just scorched into fifth-fastest time on his first day as a Grand Prix driver in the first free practice for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. <em>"Look, Eddie,"</em> said one reporter to his team boss Eddie Jordan. <em>"That guy is going to be a star." "He is already,"</em> responded Jordan, the Irish owner of the Jordan team which, after six years in Formula One, is in dire need of a first victory.</p>

<p>Jordan also was smiling. <em>"People kept telling me before the start of the season that there was not enough experience in my 
driver line-up,"</em> he said. <em>"Well, they were right. Youth is faster, isn't it?"</em> Ralf himself sat and enjoyed it all. A former German Formula Three championship contender and a winner of the Macau Formula Three race, he was enjoying making his mark in the big time. But at only 21, he was exhibiting remarkable coolness. <em>"I slept perfectly last night, as usual,"</em> he said. <em>"I was 
not nervous at all today. I just did my job as usual. I tried to improve myself and to learn the track and to make the car better...That was all."</em></p>

<p>As he spoke, the wide smile remained intact. Older brother Michael may have taken fastest time and top place for Ferrari, but he was not allowing that to interfer with his own satisfaction. <em>"He is Mr Cool,"</em> said a German reporter. <em>"He just cruises through life. He is going to be just as big a star as his brother. Maybe bigger."</em> Jordan added more: <em>"To achieve what he has today in his first session in Formula One, on his first visit to this track, it is an exceptional achievement.  <em>"But today is only practice. Tomorrow is qualifying and that is what really matters."</em> Schumacher junior agreed. <em>"Of course, I am pleased, but I have always tried to enjoy myself right from the start of my racing career. So, I am not nervous about anything like this."</em> It was a day for the Germans. Michael Schumacher was quickest, just ahead of Heinz-Harald Frentzen in his first run with Williams. <em>"But it was not a day to celebrate,"</em> said Schumacher. <em>"Maybe we will do some of that on Sunday or Monday...I don't know. But I have learned a few things already and I am going to enjoy myself this year."</em></p>

<p>Older brother Michael warned of what lay ahead. <em>"We have been on holiday for a few days before this race and he was not 
worried at all, he hardly mentioned this weekend. "With him that is normal...But I am sure he will have his bad days as well as his good ones."</em></p>
