<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">First race of the IRS
Grand Prix 2 World Championship 1997. Interlagos is a circuit
which demands a lot from the gearbox, you have to shift
continually. Curva 2 is a very though corner for the drivers, the
pressure on the body is very high. The cars have less wing on the
rear, because of the long straights. This makes racing on this
circuit more difficult, because there are a lot of slow corners
too.</font></p>

        though, you can drive fast but watch out for the grass on
        the left side of the track by accelerating out of the
        corner.</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Accelerate
        on straight and then a very difficult corner, because it
        goes deep. You can't see what's in front of you. Because
        you can't see the curve stones, it's difficult to know
        how fast you can go. You need practice to drive fast
        through this corner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Easy corner, but don't go
        too fast. Then Feradura, where you have to brake, and
        then accelerate out of the corner, and almost immediately
        brake again. Pinheirinho is very though too. Take the
        corner in a good line, so you are planning the right way
        for the next corner(s).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After Pinheirinho almost
        the same sort of corner, keep on the track otherwise you
        will lose a lot of time, because most of the time you
        will spin.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Accelerate and go through
        the next corner, easy braking or no throttle. Subida in
        first or second gear, accelerate out of the corner off
        the curve stones.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Staight, just keep driving
        but watch out for the grass on the left side of the track
        at the pits-in.</font></p>
