SEVILLE, Spain (March 1) - After a week of intense mental, physical and
emotional trials here, two young Americans have been named to the 1996
U.S. Camel Trophy team. Ken Cameron, 26, from Eagle, Colo., and Fred
Hoess, 29, of Stanhope, N.J., will now have less than a month to prepare
themselves for the adventure of a lifetime. On April 1, they will join
nineteen other two-person teams from around the world in driving Land
Rover Discoverys on the first-ever east-west vehicle crossing of the
Indonesian province of Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo.

"The International Selections have been exciting and exhausting at the
same time," said Cameron, a carpenter whose months of exhaustive
training for Camel Trophy included the creation of an orienteering
course in his backyard. lt's a great feeling to be able to work as a
team with people from so many different countries," he continued, "and
I'm looking forward to the challenges that Kalimantan will hold."
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR>

Hoess, a champion motorcycle racer, who has spent the last few months
practicing his four-wheel drive skills, echoed his partner's thoughts,
saying, "Camel Trophy is an incredibly unique event. We've put in a lot
of hard work and long hours, but we've made a lot of friends and had fun
at the same time. I think we are well prepared for the event itself."
<BR><BR>

Four candidates from each of 20 nations came here this week to vie for
the chance to represent their respective homelands in the "Olympics of
Four-Wheel Drive." Working in groups that ranged in size from two to
eighty members and communicating across as many as fifteen language
barriers, the competitors were trained and assessed over five non-stop
days and nights by Land Rover off-road driving instructors and former
Camel Trophy participants.

Sleeping only three to four hours a night and living out of their Land
Rover Discoverys, the candidates were running, driving, winching and
navigating around the clock. Severe rains in December and January
created a layer of knee deep mud on the Andalucian Hills outside of
Seville that challenged even the most highly skilled off-road
drivers.
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR>

Cameron and Hoess narrowly edged out Jeff Brandner, 31, of Chester,
N.J., while the fourth U.S. candidate, Greg Oberst, 36 of Seal Beach,
Calif., dropped out of the competition early in the week, after
realizing he could not bear to be parted from his newborn daughter.
<BR><BR>

Participating journalist Lou Sapienza of Red Bank, N.J., stepped in to
fill Oberst's place during the team trials. He also will travel with the
team as a member of the convoy in Kalimantan.

The event winners in April will be the pair with the best combination of
attitude and ability. A Special Tasks Award will be given to the team
with the highest empirical score in a series of competitive challenges,
while a Team Spirit Award will go to the pair judged by their fellow
participants to have the best blend of camaraderie and capability. And a
new award has been announced this year - the Land Rover Award. This
trophy will be presented to the team that demonstrates outstanding
four-wheel drive skills based on proper technical expertise and
attention to personal and vehicle safety. The Camel Trophy itself will
be awarded to the team with the highest overall scores.

France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Norway/Denmark,
Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the United
Kingdom and the United States.
