LAND ROVER DEDICATES UNIQUE DEMONSTRATION COURSE

</B> (continued)</FONT COLOR="#084221">
<P><BR>

<B>A trip on the Land Rover Demonstration Course at Lanham Creek</B>
<P>

The demonstration course boasts more than a dozen specially-designed areas to showcase the capabilities of the British-built Range Rover, Discovery and Defender 90.  Total driving length of the course in 1,729 feet, plus 245 feet of "expert only" features.   A six-tenths of a kilometer (approximately 1,960 feet) jogging trail follows a portion of the site's perimeter; eight and one-third laps of the course equals a 5K run.
<P>

<B>Bridge Out</B>  This feature takes the vehicle down a series of natural rock stairs approximately 9.5 feet.  The approach angle to the water is between 28 degrees and 30 degrees, depending on the driver's line.  The water level can be regulated to 27 inches in depth;  normal water level in the pool is maintained at 14 inches.  Length of the water hazard is 60-70 feet.
<P>

<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=0 SRC="GIFS/LRNA_C~2.JPG" tppabs="http://www.landrover.com/news/gifs/LRNA_climb.jpg" WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=137>

<B>Hill Climb</B>  Constructed of natural stone and recycled concrete, the feature's overall height is 13 feet (4 meters).  The angle of approach running from the north to the south is 29 degrees to 30 degrees, depending on the driver's line.  The crown is 10 feet in length, and the angle of descent is  29 degrees to 30 degrees.  A vehicle rises and descends four meters (13 feet) in 10.36 meters (34 feet).
<P>

<B>Side Tilt</B>  This feature, which is also installed at Land Rover Centres, has approach, side tilt and exit angles of 30 degrees.  The overall height is two meters (6.5 feet).
<P>

<B>Air Bridge at the Creek</B>  Built of recycled timbers and switch ties, the bridge's highest elevation is 4.5 feet.
<P>

<B>The Circle of Stones</B>   The outer natural stone circle is 90 feet in diameter; the inner circle, site of the dedication rock, is 15 feet in diameter.  Two rock articulation displays are located on the outer circle.
<P>

<B>The Balance Bridge</B>   Built of pressure-treated lumber and mounted in concrete, this feature challenges the driver to balance a vehicle atop the bridge, which rocks like a teeter-totter.  (The fastest balance time to date is nine seconds.)  It is estimated the feature weights 12,500 lbs.
<P>

<B>Sweeper Side Tilt</B>  Upon leaving the Circle of Stones, travelling south, the vehicle climbs 20 feet to this 27 degrees side tilt.  Exiting the Sweeper is a gravel run to the Double Ditch Crossing.
<P>

Just after the Double Ditch Crossing is a left turn into a 35 degrees downhill; alternately, the driver can proceed straight to the Rocky Road, a very long side tilt that averages 28 degrees to 30 degrees.
<P>

The bottom of the Rocky Road contains a small air bridge of recycled switch ties and bridge timbers.  
<P>

Upon exiting the small air bridge, the driver travels through Wooded Run, then turns left to  return to Bridge Out.
<P>

<B>BLACK DIAMOND (for experts only) FEATURES</B>
<P>

<B>Stair Climb</B>  This challenge is built of twenty-six twelve- to sixteen-foot switch ties, set at a gradual slope which reaches 20 degrees approximately halfway up.  The spacing of the timbers is approximately 14 inches, with a seven- to nine-inch rise on each.  The stairs rise 19 feet in 60 running feet.
<P>

<B>Boulder Run</B>  Sixty tons of quarry rock and glacier boulders were used, with each boulder hand-selected and placed.  There are at least four driving lines in each direction uphill or downhill.  The intent is that the driver study the paths to choose and then execute the crossing.  A ground guide can also be used to negotiate the run; the teamwork aspect of doing so is an added benefit.  
<P>

<B>Slide Tilt</B>  During construction of the twelve-foot Hill Climb, it was determined that the hill's geometry, if altered slightly, could produce a fairly dramatic side tilt.  Approaching from the south and steering as high as possible to the crest, vehicles can achieve a side tilt in excess of 40 degrees.  If the vehicle is kept high on the course, a 12-to 24-inch downhill slide is almost always experienced!  Exciting, even for experts.
