<FONT COLOR="#084221"><STRONG>INTRODUCTION</STRONG></FONT><br>

This report contains information compiled on Pre-Scout between 
August 7th and September 4th 1995 covering the proposed route for Camel
Trophy Kalimantan '96 from Balikpapan to Pontianak on the island of Borneo
in Indonesia.
<P>

In accordance with the overall marketing brief for Camel Trophy and a
brief from the President of WBI, the instruction for the pre-scout team
for CT '96 was to establish a feasible route which would provide a
physically tough, challenging and demanding event whether the conditions
be wet or dry. This has undoubtedly been achieved.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#084221"><STRONG>THE START</STRONG></FONT><BR>

The event will start at the picturesque Dusit Inn in Balikpapan and
commence with a crossing by ferry of Balikpapan Bay to the start of the
first special tasks. The majority of the special tasks will be located
near a village called Pamaluan approximately 70 kms in to the jungle.

<FONT COLOR="#084221"><STRONG>THE ROUTE</STRONG></FONT><BR>

The route from the 1st Special Tasks on the east coast of Kalimantan to
the location of the 2nd set on the west coast approx. 100km north of
Pontianak is some 1850 kms in total. Comprising of 90% jungle driving
and 10% river crossings the '96 route by comparison to CT Mundo Maya '95
will see a return to the real traditional Camel Trophy conditions. The
physical element will be to the fore with 10 major river crossings to be
overcome using a variety of techniques from bridge building to rafting
to ferry / pontoon crossings. The condition of the trails in the
interior are in many places in total disrepair adding considerably to
the work element required to negotiate the numerous obstacles. Part of
the route includes a 200km section of the proposed Trans-Borneo road
which was cut several years ago across the island but never developed
nor completed from coast to coast.
<P>

Since then this track has deteriorated and has never been driven. It is
therefore the intention for CT '96 for the convoy to make the first
recorded crossing of Kalimantan from coast to coast.
<P>

The culture and local color of Kalimantan will be experienced by the
teams as they pass through the many Dayak villages along the route. Due
to the lack of roads and vehicular transport there are very few tourists
in Kalimantan which adds to the feeling of remoteness and
isolation.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#084221"><STRONG>FINISH</STRONG></FONT><BR>

The end of the Event will be at Pantai Gosong on conclusion of the 2nd
set of Special Tasks. Pantai Gosong is a picturesque beach location with
white sandy beaches and palm trees. The winners of the event will be
announced at the end of the last task, with the official award ceremony
taking place in the hotel at Pontianak the following night.
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#084221"><STRONG>SUMMARY</STRONG></FONT><BR>

CT '96 represents a return to the classic images portrayed in events
such as Brazil '89 and earlier. Kalimantan '96 is an incredibly bold
challenge to be undertaken during the rainy season, representing,
potentially the first recorded vehicular crossing of Kalimantan.
There is no doubt that this event will be a real expedition, a real
adventure, and a real challenge to all participating on CT '96.
