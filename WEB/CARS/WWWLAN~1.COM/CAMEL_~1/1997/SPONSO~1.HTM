<B>WORLDWIDE BRANDS INC. (WBI)</B>
<P>

WBI is a wholly owned subsidiary of RJR Nabisco, an international consumer packaged goods company. Formed in 1981, the company is responsible for the diversification of certain RJR Nabisco trademarks. 
<P>

One of the most important factors in this diversification responsibility is leveraging the Camel Trophy brand name, which is the trademark for a range of clothes, boots, watches and other items for those who enjoy outdoor life. These products are directly related to the Camel Trophy Event itself, as all products are used on Event, which in turn creates the image of rugged adventure that is reflected in the style of the products. 
<P>

While the diversification is concentrated on lifestyle products, and although the emphasis still remains on the original three cornerstones of clothing, watches and boots, the range now includes luggage, expedition accessories and much more. In most European countries Camel Trophy Adventure Wear, Boots and Watches are leaders in the adventure wear market segment.

<B>LAND ROVER</B>
<P>

Camel Trophy is an event of immense stature and demands a vehicle to match. That is why Land Rover products have been used on Camel Trophy for the last 16 years. While the marque of vehicle may change, the quality of design and craftsmanship remains at the highest of British standards.
<P>

In 1997, the diesel-powered Land Rover Discovery Tdi will be the official team vehicle for the eighth consecutive year on Camel Trophy, chosen once more for it's reliability and suitability to the rigors of such an event. It has been praised by competitors and support mechanics alike for its ease of maintenance and its responsive handling on the grueling routes of Camel Trophy over the years.
<P>

Built in the Land Rover factory in Solihull, England, the Discovery has won numerous awards for its design and 4x4 capability. It is the most popular vehicle in the Land Rover fleet, combining the rugged reliability of the Defender with the style and technology of the Range Rover.
<P>

The Discovery is famous for its adaptability, allowing the team vehicles to carry extra equipment that is crucial to the successful completion of Camel Trophy. The adaptability is well demonstrated by the modifications incorporated into some of the vehicles to provide mobile workshops, communications, rafts and medical support.
<P>

Land Rover North America, Inc. (LRNA) is a member of the Rover Group of Companies, importing vehicles manufactured by Land Rover, Solihull, England. The Rover Group is a fully owned subsidiary of BMW AG. Through a network of 97 U.S. retailers, LRNA distributes the Range Rover 4.6 HSE, Range Rover 4.0 SE, Land Rover Discovery and Land Rover Defender 90. All Land Rover products sold in the U.S. feature a V-8 gasoline engine.
