The eighteenth annual Camel Trophy Adventure will take place May 13-31, 1997,
in Mongolia, where two-person teams from around the world will participate in the ultimate
quest for adventure.
<P>

Open to anyone with a sense of adventure and a willingness to explore the
unknown, Camel Trophy is a three-week journey of personal challenges, international
camaraderie and cultural exploration. More than 1.5 million applicants vie each year for
the chance to take part in "The Legend in Adventure."
<P>

Unlike many past events, Camel Trophy '97 will travel to a temperate, rather than
tropical, climate. Teams will drive identically-prepared Land Rover Discoverys through
approximately 2,400 kms (1,440 miles) of rugged, unpredictable terrain, ranging from the
heavily forested mountainous region in the north, to the sand dunes of the Gobi Desert in
the south. The variation will be extreme, from the frozen Lake Khovsgol with temperatures
of -10 degrees C (14 degrees F), to the Gobi where temperatures will soar to 40 degrees C (104 degrees F).
<P>

The relatively uninhabited countryside of this landlocked Central Asian nation is
unspoiled with breathtaking scenery and a blend of contrasts. Bordered by China, Russia
and Kazakhstan, Mongolia's landmass is three times the size of France, with a population
of only 2.4 million -- 25% of whom live in the capital city of Ulaan Baatar.
<P>

Starting and finishing in Ulaan Baatar, the event will also visit eight competition
sites which have been established along the route. Teams will be given GPS coordinates
for each of the eight sites and, traveling in small groups of at least three vehicles, will plot
their own way from point to point along existing tracks and trails, stopping whenever
possible to meet the local people, experience Mongolian hospitality and appreciate the
natural beauty of this expansive land.
<P>

<P>

Competitions will take place every two to three days during the event, and will be
based on four disciplines: Driving, Orienteering, Mountain Biking and Kayaking. Teams
will be awarded points based on their results in each competition (20 points for 1st place,
19 points for 2nd,...1 point for 20th), and at the conclusion of the event, the team with the
highest point total will be awarded the overall Camel Trophy Award.
<P>

Trophies will also be presented to the winning teams in each of the individual
disciplines. The most coveted of all prizes, however, is the Team Spirit Award, which will
be won by the team that is judged by participants to have the best combination of
capability and compatibility. The Award Ceremony will take place in Genghis Khan's
ancient capital city of Karakorum.
<P>

In 1997, the men and women of the twenty participating Camel Trophy teams will
represent Austria, the Canary Islands, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece,
Holland, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Scandinavia, South Africa,
Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the U.K. and the U.S.
