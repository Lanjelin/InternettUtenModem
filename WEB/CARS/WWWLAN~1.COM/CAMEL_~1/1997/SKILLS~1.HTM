Camel Trophy is a physically and mentally challenging four-wheel drive endurance
adventure. The event demands a lot from each of the forty team members on the convoy,
which is why it takes a team of two to do well. Both team members must be able to
perform all of the tasks they are assigned. Following is a list of the basic skills that must
be coupled with quick, precise thinking in order to succeed on the event:
<P>

<DL><B>Knots:</B>
<DD>Team members must be able to tie a bowline, sheepshank, timber hitch, clove hitch, square lashing and shears lashing.
</DL>

<DL><B>Winching:</B>
<DD>Winch safety is all important. Neatness with the cable - it must be laid on the drum so the cable is not damaged - and the ability to rig the winch for recovery very quickly and safely are essential.
</DL>

<DL><B>Driving:</B>
<DD>Camel Trophy demands excellent drivers in all off-pavement conditions. (Most successful applicants have been driving 4x4's and motorcycles off-pavement since they began driving.)
</DL>

<DL><B>Medical:</B>
<DD>All candidates are tested on CPR and first aid.
</DL>

<DL><B>Physical:</B>
<DD>Team members must be in the best physical condition possible.
During the International Selections, candidates run a 10K course
that is a combination of orienteering, obstacles and rope-climbing
exercises. No one has found this easy - not even professional
mountain climbers. Knees must be in excellent condition.
Individuals must also be strong, fast swimmers.
</DL>

<DL><B>Orienteering:</B>
<DD>Familiarity with maps, compass and GPS is essential.
</DL>

<DL><B>Rally Math:</B>
<DD>The ability to follow "tulip" charts and calculate time/speed/distance
with a stopwatch, odometer and scientific calculator under stressful
conditions can make the difference between a candidate and a
team member.
</DL>

<DL><B>Teamwork:</B>
<DD>Camel Trophy is 100 people from a number of different nations
living together and cooperating under stressful conditions for up to
three weeks. The ability to communicate one's thoughts in a
concise, precise manner is a must.
</DL>

<DL><B>Mechanical:</B>
<DD>Teams must be able to change front and rear axles, shocks,
alternators, starters and clutches and trouble shoot engine
problems with minimal assistance from mechanics accompanying
the convoy.
</DL>

<DL><B>Engineering:</B>
<DD>The ever-changing demands of the event require teams to solve
road building problems quickly, construct bridges from logs and
ladders and know how to use an ax or chainsaw properly.
</DL>

<DL><B>Attitude:</B>
<DD>Team members are expected to lead without being pushy and to
join in the spirit of camaraderie with their fellow teams.
</DL>
