<B>GENERAL INFORMATION</B>
<P>
    Land Rover recommends a vehicle equipped with a front mounted WARN battery electric winch. This two way winch in - winch out model has an automatic brake, a free spooling clutch, and a remote control with a 12 foot
lead. An accessory kit is also included. This kit contains a tree strap, snatch block pulley, 2 D ring shackles, winching gloves and an anchor chain.
<P>
<B>REMOTE CONTROL SWITCH:</B>
<P>
The control switch, when engaged in the receptacle is used to power in or
power out wire rope. The toggle switch activates the winch motor. There are three
positions for the switch, the middle position being "OFF", and the other two positions
are "power in" and "power out" as indicated on the control. The switch must be held in
the power positions as the switch is spring loaded and will automatically return to the
"OFF" position.
<P>
<B>CLUTCH OPERATION:</B>
<P>
The clutch is located on the gear housing. To engage, rotate the clutch
clockwise. To free spool, rotate the clutch counter clockwise. Be certain the indicator
is completely at the "ENGAGED" or "FREE SPOOL" positions before using. If the
clutch does not engage easily, rotate the drum to align gears.
<P>
<B>AUTOMATIC BRAKE:</B>
<P>
Anytime the control switch is in the neutral or off position, the brake will
automatically activate against a load. When powering "IN" the brake will hold the
load as soon as the switch is released. When powering "OUT" the load will not stop as
quickly. Inertia in the gear train can cause several feet of wire rope to spool out after
the switch is released. The heavier the load, the quicker the brake will lock.
<P>
<B>OVERLOADING - OVERHEATING</B>
<P>
This winch is rated for intermittent duty It should not be operated with the motor
lugged down to a low RPM. When the motor approaches stall speed, a very rapid heat
buildup occurs which could cause permanent motor damage. The best way to judge
safe running time is to stop winching and lay your hand on the motor occasionally.
When it reaches the point that is uncomfortable to leave your hand there, shut down
and let the motor cool for a while. The cool down period can be used to advantage to
recharge the battery. Double lining with a snatch block substantially reduces
amperage draw which in turn will allow longer "on time".
<P>
<B>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:</B> 

Careless winch operation can result in serious injury or property damage.
When used improperly a winch can be very DANGEROUS tool. Please read and
follow the following precautions.

<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
	<LI>Never step over the wire rope. 
	<LI>Never touch the wire rope or hook while they are in tension or under load. Even at rest, the winch may have the wire rope in tension.
	<LI>While the remote control lead is plugged into the winch, always keep clear of the drum, fairlead area, the wire rope, and rigging.
	<LI>Never handle the wire rope or rigging while anyone else is at the control switch or during the winching operation.
	<LI>Always stand clear of the wire rope and load during the winching operation. Keep helpers and spectators at a safe distance. If a wire rope pulls loose or breaks under load, it can lash back with tremendous force.
	<LI>Before winching, inspect the remote control lead for cracks, pinched spots, frayed wire, or loose connections. A damaged, shorted lead could cause the winch to run as soon as it is plugged in. When using the remote control inside a vehicle, always pass it through a window to avoid pinching the lead in the door. Always store the remote control lead in a clean dry area where it will not be damaged.
	<LI>Always be certain that the anchor you intend to use is capable of withstanding the load. Always use a choker chain, wire choker rope, or tree trunk protector on the anchor. Never put the winch wire rope around an object and hook back to it; this will cause damage to the wire rope.
	<LI>Never winch with less than five wraps of wire rope around the winch drum. With less wraps, the wire rope could break loose from the drum under heavy load.
	<LI>The wire rope must always spool off of the drum as indicated by the drum rotation decal. The automatic BRAKE WILL NOT FUNCTION if the wire rope spools off in the opposite direction. The wire rope spooling can be accidentally reversed by running the wire rope all the way out and respooling in with the control switch in the "power in" mode.
	<LI>Never exceed the rated capacity for winching. Double line with a snatch block to reduce the load on the winch and wire rope by almost half.
	<LI>Use the switch intermittently to take up wire rope slack to avoid shock loads which can momentarily far exceed the winch and wire rope rating.
	<LI>Always unspool as much wire rope as possible when preparing rigging. Double line with a snatch block or pick an anchor as far away as practical. This will minimize wire rope damage, such as mashing and kinking, caused from top layers pulling down into the bottom layers when short pulls are made. The greatest pulling power is available at the FIRST LAYER on the drum, decreasing with each successive layer.
	<LI>Always pull as straight as possible to minimize the buildup of wire rope on only one end of the drum. Always inspect and carefully rewind the wire rope after use. Mashed, pinched, or frayed areas severely reduce the original tensile strength. For safety's sake, replace wire rope when damaged.
	<LI>The life of the wire rope is directly related to care and use it received. The wire rope on a new winch, and any replacement ropes, MUST BE STRETCHED AND RESPOOLED UNDER LOAD before using the winch. Failure to do this will result in wire rope damage.
	<LI>At times it may be necessary to temporarily respool the wire rope under no load after use. The correct procedure is to hold the remote control lead in one hand and the wire rope in the other. Start as far from the vehicle as the remote control will allow, activate the switch, walk in several feet of rope and release the switch. Repeat the process. ALWAYS release the switch when you are AT LEAST FOUR FEET from the fairlead. Always wear heavy GLOVES when handling wire rope.
	<LI>Do not let wire rope slide through your hands. Even when wearing gloves.
	<LI>ALWAYS RELEASE THE SWITCH WHEN THE HOOK IS A MINIMUM OF FOUR FEET FROM THE FAIRLEAD. Place the hook on a suitable spot on the mounting kit. Then keeping your hands completely clear of the hook, the wire rope, and the fairlead, jog the switch intermittently to take u p the slack. Do not overtighten or damage may occur to the wire rope.
	<LI>Put a blanket or coat on the middle of the wire rope when winching. This will help slow the wire rope down if it breaks and prevent injury or damage.
	<LI>When anchoring the pulling vehicle, set the parking brake and block the wheels. Place automatic and manual transmissions in neutral.
	<LI>When retrieving or spooling in wire rope, be sure to distribute the wire rope evenly and tightly on the drum. This prevents the top layers of wire rope from being drawn into the bottom layers of wire rope and creating a "bind". If the wire rope binds on the drum, the winch and / or the wire rope may be damaged.
</OL>
A "bound" wire rope will reel out only a short distance and then will reel back in
even though the remote control is held in the "out" position. Should the wire
rope become "bound" connect the hook to a load. By alternately powering "in"
and "out", the wire rope will usually work itself free. In any event, DO NOT PUT
YOUR HANDS ANYWHERE NEAR THE WIRE ROPE WHEN WORKING A
"BIND" FREE.
<P>
<B>METHODS OF RIGGING:</B>
<P>
Take your time when rigging and include a reasonable factor for safety. Sloppy
rigging can result in damage to the vehicle, equipment, or injury.
<P>
In all rigging a chain or strap is used around the anchor and the wire rope is
attached to it. The wire rope should never be wrapped around the anchor and hooked
back onto itself, as the tensile strength would be greatly reduced.
<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/07WINC~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.landrover.com/adventures/greatdivide/tips/gifs/07winch-5.gif""400""156" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=156><P>
FIGURE "A" illustrates a method of rigging commonly used to obtain a mechanical
advantage which will almost double your pulling capacity. This is a preferred method
of rigging for several reasons. For example, if you are pulling a maximum load the line
speed will be slow and the amperage draw will be high. Rigging the same load with a
pulley block will reduce the load on the line and winch by approximately one-half.
This in turn will allow the motor to run faster and reduces the amperage draw.
<P>
<B>POINTS TO NOTE:</B>
<P>
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
	<LI>DON'T use the winch wire rope as a tow rope. The brake is not designed for this and a sudden jerk pull can snap the wire rope. A wire rope breaking under tension can whip back and take a man's leg off.
	<LI>DON'T take the wire rope around an anchor and then hook it back onto itself. It will damage the strands and weaken the wire rope.
	<LI>DON'T let the wire rope wind on to the drum unevenly. This can cause the rope to get trapped, release suddenly and then we are back to a jerk pull again. Now we have lost another leg.
	<LI>When stuck in mud - 1 ) lay out the winch cable and secure to an anchor and secure to an anchor, 2) take up the slack, 3) select a higher gear, 4) winch and drive steadily WITHOUT letting the driving wheels spin. Spinning wheels look spectacular, but achieves nothing except to dig the wheels in deeper.
	<LI>Snatch blocks can be used for changing the direction of the pull as well as increasing the mechanical advantage.
	<LI>REMEMBER the winch will only pull 8000 pounds on the first wrap of the wire rope on the drum. It reduces with each succeeding wrap.
	<LI>NEVER STEP OVER A WINCH ROPE.
	<LI>Always use a tree strap when anchoring to a tree. Wire rope and chains can severely damage a tree. Never use a nylon strap to anchor around rocks.
</OL>
<B>ANCHORS:</B>
<P>
    Natural anchors such as trees, stumps, and rocks are the handiest when
available. Always select your anchor carefully to be sure it is strong enough to
withstand the load. Hook the wire rope as low as possible on the anchor to avoid
pulling the anchor down. If several possible anchors are available, but they are not
strong enough, it may be practical to attach a wire rope, tree strap, or chain to several
of them to form a strong collective anchor point.
<P>
Constructed anchors are used when there are no natural anchors available.
They can be made from items you carry with you or whatever may be picked up at
hand.<P>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/FIG_B.GIF" tppabs="http://www.landrover.com/adventures/greatdivide/tips/gifs/fig_b.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=124><P>
Figure "B" illustrates a popular method of using stakes. This is very effective
where soil conditions allow their use. If you anticipate a need for this type of anchor,
carry 3 or 4 sharpened stakes with you. They should be driven at an angle to increase
holding power.
<P><IMG SRC="GIFS/FIG_C.GIF" tppabs="http://www.landrover.com/adventures/greatdivide/tips/gifs/fig_c.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=136><P>
Figure "C" shows how to make use of items carried with you. A spare tire works
well in sandy soil.
<P><IMG SRC="GIFS/FIG_D.GIF" tppabs="http://www.landrover.com/adventures/greatdivide/tips/gifs/fig_d.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=136><P>
Figure "D" illustrates a typical log deadman. This can be made into a very
strong anchor. A wide variety of materials can be substituted for the log if necessary,
such as a piece of culvert, a steel beam or pipe, a bundle of small poles, a section of
guard rail, or even a 55 gallon drum.
<P><IMG SRC="GIFS/FIG_E.GIF" tppabs="http://www.landrover.com/adventures/greatdivide/tips/gifs/fig_e.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=114><P>
Figure "E" shows the most versatile portable anchor you can carry is a Danforth
type boat anchor. Home made or modified versions have been used by some four -
wheelers in the west for many years with great success. An anchor around twenty
pounds can hold well enough to get you out of almost any predicament. They hold in
most terrain including mud, wet and dry sand, and hard ground. It is usually necessary
to close the angle between the shank and flukes by one - half to improve the burying
and holding characteristics of the anchor. The buried anchor can be easily retrieved
by driving over it. This anchor has a definite advantage when winching through areas
where several pulls are required to get you through. You can always spool out the
amount of wire rope you want and put the anchor in the most suitable location.
<P>
<B>SIGNALLING AND COMMUNICATION:</B>
<P>
Not all winching activities can be accomplished alone; sometimes an assistant
can prove invaluable in the operation so it is important that instructions can be
communicated clearly to each other. A series of hand signals has been developed for
this purpose and are in general usage.
<P>
It is important that the signaler should stand in a secure position where he can
see exactly what is happening during the winching operation and be in no immediate
danger should things go wrong. He should be able to clearly see the load and be
seen by the winch operator. He should face the winch operator if possible and each
signal should be distinct and clear. When winching at night, use a flashlight to convey
your instructions in the same way as for hand signals and use a whistle to stop the
winching operation in an emergency.
<P>
See FIGURE "F" For The Signals.<P>
