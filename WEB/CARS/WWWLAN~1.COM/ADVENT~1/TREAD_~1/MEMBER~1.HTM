<b><FONT COLOR=#003300>Mandate</FONT></b> 
<P>

Since the pursuit of outdoor recreation is a cherished activity in America,
all outdoor enthusiasts share a fundamental mandate to care for our natural
resources and educate others to do so.  Every year, millions of us enjoy
outdoor recreational experiences on our nation's public and private lands. 
And simply put, our presence has an environmental impact.  That is why a
membership in Tread Lightly! is so vital.  Patterned after the successful
<I>Smoky Bear</I> and <I>Woodsy Owl</I> programs, Tread Lightly! seeks to
balance the increase in backcountry travel with conservation of the land.  All
backcountry users - from sport utility vehicle owners to hikers to riders on
horseback - need to learn how to behave responsibly and apply low-impact
principles to their particular outdoor activity.  To ensure that these
opportunities are protected for the future, we must learn how to minimize our
environmental impact today.  The good news is that land ethics can be learned
at an early age.  If we teach our children to be environmentally responsible,
the actions of generations to come will be affected.

<P>

How do we protect the over 500,000 miles of backcountry roads and trails when
more and more people are discovering the thrill of outdoor recreation?  That's
where the Tread Lightly! program fits in.  Dedicated to increasing awareness
on how to properly enjoy public and private lands, Tread Lightly! emphasizes
responsible use of Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) and other forms of
backcountry travel while also encouraging low-impact principles that apply to
all outdoor recreational activities.  Tread Lightly!, Inc. unites federal and
state land management agencies with manufacturers, publishers, environmental
and user groups, and individuals who share a basic commitment to care for our
valuable natural resources.  We achieve our goals in three ways: developing
and distributing educational materials to teachers, youngsters, and outdoor
recreationists; coordinating media coverage that helps get the Tread Lightly!
message out to the public; and working with both industry and public service
agencies to help promote advertising that demonstrates responsible use of SUVs
and other forms of backcountry travel.  But Tread Lightly! can only accomplish
this with your help!
<P>

<b><FONT COLOR=#003300>Message</FONT></b>
<P>

Spreading the Tread Lightly! message is key to educating more outdoor
recreationists on how to preserve our environment.  Being environmentally
responsible isn't difficult, but it does mean making a commitment to follow
these basic principles:  Travel only where you are permitted to travel.  Do
not stray off trails and routes designated for your use.  Respect and be
courteous to other drivers, bikers, hikers, and horseback riders on the
trails.  Pull to the side, turn off your engine, and let traffic pass. 
Educate yourself by stopping and talking with land managers at their offices. 
They can best tell you what trails and routes would be suitable.  Avoid
sensitive areas - stream banks, meadows, and lakeshores - at all times.  cross
streams and water only at designated fording areas.  And lastly, drive and
travel responsibly.
