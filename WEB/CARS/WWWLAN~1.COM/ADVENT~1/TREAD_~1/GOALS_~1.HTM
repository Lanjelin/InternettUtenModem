<P>

The first and foremost goal of the Tread Lightly! program is to encourage
recreationists to be responsible as they enjoy their off-highway vehicle or
other forms of backcountry travel. They should also apply low impact
principles to all outdoor recreation activities. Being environmentally
responsible isn't difficult, but it does involve making a commitment to
remember to follow some basic principles. These principles are easily
summarized and even easier to do. They are outlined in the Tread Lightly!
pledge.

<P>

The principles of the Tread Lightly! program are summarized with the word
TREAD. A more detailed description of how we can use these principles to
Tread Lightly! are summarized as follows: <P>

<B>T</B> 
<P>

Travel only on trails, roads, or land areas that are open to vehicles or
other forms of travel. 
<P>

Make sure the trail you plan to use is available for your type of vehicle.
Wide vehicles on narrow trails can damage both the trail and your vehicle.
<P>

Cutting switchbacks or taking shortcuts can destroy vegetation and cause
others to use the unauthorized route. 
<P>

Most trails and routes designated for OHV use are constructed to withstand
the effects of use. Staying on these trails reduces the impacts from OHV
use. 
<P>

<B>R</B> 
<P>

Respect and be courteous to other users who also want to enjoy the lands
you are using for your travels. Be considerate and honor their desire for
solitude and a peaceful backcountry experience. Loud motors and noisy
behavior are not acceptable and detract from a quiet outdoor setting. 
<P>

Give other recreationists the space and quiet you would appreciate. Driving
near or around someone's camp site is not appreciated. 
<P>

When driving, be especially cautious around horses or hikers.  Pull off to
the side of the trail, shut off your engine, and let the horses or hikers
pass. 
<P>

In and around campgrounds, be sensitive to campers' need for a peaceful
atmosphere. By law, you are permitted to exit and enter campgrounds, but
not to play on ATV's and dirt bikes within a campground. If your muffler is
not quiet, push your machine into and out of a campground, with the engine
shut off. 
<P>

<B>E</B> 
<P>

Educate yourself by stopping in and talking with land managers at their
office. Or, if you see them in the field, stop and ask questions. They can
tell you what areas and routes are open for your kind of OHV activity.
Travel Maps are usually available at most offices. 
<P>

On private lands, be sure to obtain the owner or land manager's permission
to cross or use their lands. 
<P>

As you travel the backcountry, comply with trail and road signs. Honor all
gates, fences and barriers that are there to protect the natural resources,
wildlife and livestock. 
<P>

<B>A</B> 
<P>

Avoid sensitive areas at all times. In early spring and fall, rains and
snow typically saturate the ground making soil surfaces soft. Improper
vehicle use can cause damage to vegetation and ground surface. 
<P>

Stay on designated roadways and trails so that new scars are not
established. Especially sensitive areas susceptible to scarring are
streambanks, lakeshores and meadows. Cross streams only at fords where the
road or trail intersects the stream. Traveling in a stream channel is
unacceptable and causes damage to aquatic life. 
<P>

Hillside climbing may be a challenge, but once vehicle scars are
established, other vehicles follow the same ruts and do long lasting
damage. Rains cause further damage by washing deep gullies in tire ruts.
Permanent and unsightly scars result. 
<P>

While operating your OHV, be sensitive to the life sustaining needs of
wildlife and livestock. In deep snow, stay clear of game, so that vehicle
noise and close proximity does not add stress to animals struggling to
survive. 
<P>

<B>D</B> 
<P>

Drive and travel responsibly to protect the forests, lands and waters that
you enjoy. You enjoy the outdoors for a number of good reasons...the
backcountry is beautiful; you have freedom to roam vast scenic areas; you
see clear flowing streams and rivers; you see wild game and birds; you
breathe clean air; you see and smell fragrant and colorful vegetation,
trees, flowers and brush; you develop a sense of being a part of this great
and expansive outdoors! 
<P>

These and others are reasons enough for you to do all you can to help
protect the lands that mean so much to you. Help preserve the beauty and
the inspiring attributes of our lands for yourself and new generations to
follow. Everyone benefits by <B>Treading Lightly!</B>
