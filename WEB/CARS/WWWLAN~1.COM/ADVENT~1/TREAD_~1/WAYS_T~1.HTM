<FONT COLOR=#003300><B>Planning an OHV trip</B></FONT> 

<P>

Consider the following as you prepare for an enjoyable and safe trip:
<P>

1. Prepare your provisions checklist: food, first aid, water, fuel etc. 
<P>

2. Plan well in advance ( 30 days prior to the trip is not too early) 
<P>

3. Where are you going? (Get a travel map and determine which areas are open for
OHV use. Check to see if there are any special rules or regulations for OHV use.)
Find a destination point and mark it on the map. Determine how to get there. 
<P>

4. How will the weather affect your destination during the season you travel? If
roads are often wet and muddy or still snow-covered, should you consider another
area to visit? 
<P>

5. How difficult are the roads and trails in the area you have chosen? What are
the skill levels of each of your drivers? 
<P>

6. Are wildlife species in the area especially sensitive to OHV's? How can you
avoid disturbing them? Should you choose another area? 
<P>

7. Know state laws for operating an OHV. Do you need any special equipment or a
license for the driver or vehicle? Do you need to be safety-certified? 
<P>

8. Keep your vehicle well maintained and tuned. Excessive emissions., leaking
fuel, and dripping oil are expensive problems. They also pollute the environment.

<P><BR>



<FONT COLOR=#003300><B>While On Your Trip</B></FONT>
<P>

1. Do not chase or intentionally disturb wildlife. 
<P>

2. Don't gun the engine - save money, fuel and your vehicle 
<P>

3. Be courteous to others! Remember, many people are not fond of OHV's.
Don't be a nuisance by creating excessive noise and dust. (Wildlife don't
enjoy it either.) 
<P>

4. Many other people may also enjoy your special place. Don't ruin their
experience. <B>STAY ON THE ROADS AND TRAILS.</B> 
<P>

5. Visual scarring can destroy scenery and habitat while starting an
erosion problem. Don't shortcut switchbacks or create unnecessary trails.
The ruts are still visible from the covered wagons of the 1800's. 
<P>

6. Pack it in - pack it out. Don't leave any litter, including human waste.
<P>

7. Respect private property and closed areas. Don't make a new trail to get
around locked gates. 
<P>

8. Be courteous on the trail. Yield to horses, slow down for hikers,
maintain a cheerful attitude. 
<P>

9. Today's degraded trail or road is tomorrow's "closed" area. Stay off wet
roads and trails, wetlands and meadows. 
<P>

10. Wilderness areas are closed to all types of motorized and mechanized
equipment. 
<P>

11. Don't run over young trees and shrubs. 
<P>

12. Be prepared for vehicle breakdowns. Travel with someone, pack emergency
kits, let others know your travel routes in and out of the areas. Stick
with your plan. 
<P>

13. Be safe, protect the environment, have fun the Tread Lightly! way.

<FONT COLOR=#003300><B>Using Travel Map Designations</B></FONT>
<P>

Travel maps are available from land managers to explain which roads, areas, and
trails are open, closed, or restricted seasonally or year-long. The following is a
brief overview of the designations and the reasons for them: 
<P>

<B>Open Most of the Time:</B> 
<P>

Main roads, unless wet and soft. Most of the damage done on backcountry roads and
trails occur during the wet fall and spring seasons. 
<P>

Unused logging and other high clearance roads when dry. These roads, when
designated open, offer challenges sought by OHV's 
<P>

Trails outside Wildernesses.  Some are open only to foot or horse traffic. Others
are open to OHV's. 
<P>

<B>ClosedPartTime:</B> 
<P>

Wildlife rearing areas. Specific areas may be closed in spring when disturbances
can drive animals from important habitat. 
<P>

Wet, soft trails or roads. Sometimes fall snow storms and spring thaws will be
reason to close some routes to vehicles to prevent damage and costly repair. When
roads and trails dry, they will be reopened. 
<P>

Wildlife winter habitat. Late in the season, food is scarce. OHV's may disturb
weakened animals, forcing them to use limited energy reserves to escape the
intruders. Snowmobiles may easily intrude into sensitive habitat. To protect a
healthy herd of game, stay away from wildlife winter habitat. Winter habitat is
usually found in foothills and lowlands below snow level where game seek easier
travel and food. 
<P>

Resource roads. Logging, mining, and oil drilling roads are often closed to the
public where collisions could occur with heavy trucks. Some primitive roads,
requiring high clearance vehicles, may be open to OHVs. Refer to your travel map
and current road status. 
<P>

<B>Closed Year-Round</B> 
<P>

Wilderness. Law forbids motorized or mechanized vehicles from entering wilderness.
Foot or horseback travel affords a frontier experience. 
<P>

Meadows, new forest, steep hillsides, streambanks and lakeshores. Sensitive land
areas may be closed to protect delicate, fragile meadow plants and young trees,
grasses and shrubs and to prevent soil erosion, scars and water pollution. These
areas may be opened when snow is deepenough to allow for oversnow use. 
<P>

Roads and trails no longer open for use. Some steep roads and trails have been
replaced by better quality ones. Some old mining or logging operations have shut
down and their roads closed. These are illustrated on the travel map or with signs.
<P>

Habitat for endangered wildlife. An area may be closed to the public to prevent
disturbance and help endangered or threatened species. Vehicles may disturb these
unique creature and hinder their survival.
