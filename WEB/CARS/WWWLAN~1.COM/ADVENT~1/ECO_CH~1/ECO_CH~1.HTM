<b><FONT COLOR=#003300>What is the Eco-Challenge?</FONT></b> 
<P>
Eco-Challenge is an Expedition-Competition for teams of five adventurers, men and women combined. The teams will race 200 miles non-stop, using canoes, mountain bikes, white water rafts, horses, and trekking across huge icefields - for 24 hours a day. They will sleep when they dare and move while they can, all the while quenching their thirst for competition and discovery. The Eco-Challenge competitors will follow in the footsteps of the Salish and Gold Rush pioneers. They will search for their limits in a beautiful but untamed and sometimes harsh landscape relying on their teamwork, wits and stamina. Their friends are the map, the compass, the full moon and each other. Their enemy - time. The first complete team to reach the finish line is the official winner, but any team that finishes with 5 teammates can consider themselves winners.
<P>

<b><FONT COLOR=#003300>What is its Mission?</FONT></b> 
<P>
The mission of the Eco-Challenge is to provide a "fun" way to promote responsible use of back country lands.<P>

The event serves as a catalyst to bring into public view some of the positive actions that can be taken by people to better commune with nature.  By using the venues of television and print we are able to promote environmental education, awareness and responsibility to a mass audience of both young and old.<P>

On a local level, before each race the participants of the Eco-Challenge -- organizers, competitors, media and volunteers -- take part in an environmental service project.  The purpose is to give something back to the community.<P>

<B>Goal:</B> To educate by example.<P>

<B>Philosophy:</B> To leave the land better than we found it.<P>

<b><FONT COLOR=#003300>Where And When Will It Take Place?</FONT></b> 
<P>
The third Eco-Challenge competition will take place between August 24 and September 1st, 1996 in British Columbia. The exact race course will be revealed to the competitors just prior to the start. For future Eco-Challenge races, a new and unique natural environment will be selected from the hundreds of locations available in North America.
<P>

<b><FONT COLOR=#003300>Who can compete?</FONT></b> 
<P>
Anyone from anywhere in the world can compete as long as they have an adventurous heart and are at least 18 years old. All contestants must be part of a team of five plus a two-person assistance crew, and there must be a minimum of one man or woman in each team. Certain competency requirements must be met, but persistence, common sense and teamwork are the key Eco-Challenge traits.
