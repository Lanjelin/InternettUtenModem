<B><FONT COLOR="#003300">Innovative Retailer Competition 

Developed By Land Rover</FONT></B><P>

	<B>ATLANTA, GA</B> -- The folks at Land Rover North America have devised a rigorous new program to make all dealer personnel true product experts.  Called TReK '96, the inaugural event set the standard for the automotive industry as the premier showcase of vehicle capability and employee motivation.<P>

	The objectives of TReK '96 reach far beyond the competition itself.  It was intended to create higher levels of product knowledge as well as exposure to the "Land Rover lifestyle" for the company's retail employees.  The result: a higher level of enthusiasm toward Land Rover products and the legend that surrounds them.  In turn, customers will receive a better education on Land Rover vehicles and four-wheel driving techniques in general.<P>

	Charles R. Hughes, president, Land Rover North America, Inc., said, "We couldn't be more enthusiastic about the results of TReK '96.  The months of preparation really have paid off.  Our retail partners are attaining new levels of hands-on  knowledge while participating in an event not available anywhere else in the industry."<P>

	Land Rover TReK '96 regional teams tested the limits of the Land Rover Discovery XD on the specially designed courses at Little Creek Farms outside  Atlanta.  Modeled after the international Camel Trophy courses, competitors got "down and dirty" and put the vehicles through exercises many never dreamed were possible.  Combining driving with highly physical activities, such as orienteering and a triathlon of running, biking and rope climbing, the variety of individual and team activities made for an unforgettable competition.  <P>

	Of the 31 teams that gave it their all in the territorial trials, five advanced to the championship:  Land Rover North Point of Alpharetta, Georgia; Land Rover Glen Cove of Glen Cove, New York; Pioneer Centres of San Diego, California; Land Rover Denver East of Aurora, Colorado; and Lawrence Park Motors of Toronto, Ontario.  In the end, it was <B>Land Rover North Point</B>, the local favorite, taking home the win.  Coming in second and winning the TReK '96 team spirit award was <B>Land Rover Denver East</B>.<P>

	"Working with Land Rovers is great, but until you have the opportunity to pound one into the ground you really can't fully develop the respect for the vehicles that they deserve," said Brian Adams, Land Rover North Point.  "The obstacles we overcame and the things we put our Discovery through are rarely encountered by most four-wheel drive vehicle owners."

	Thanks to a fantastic organizing effort, TReK '96 went off without a hitch.  The competitors went home exhausted and excited to tell their cohorts about the event and the many stories of teamwork and camaraderie typical of Land Rover employees.  Tracye Carter of Land Rover Dallas added, "The entire event has been first class.  Hopefully, I'll have an opportunity to do it again next year."<P>

	Following the retailer TReK, teams of automotive journalists including AutoWeek, Automobile, Four Wheeler and freelancers from the U.S., UK and Canada took the TReK challenge in pursuit of a $5000 first prize donation to the charity of their choice.  After 12 hours of non-stop driving, running, mountain biking, swimming and canoeing, with only minor interruptions for meals, the trio from Four Wheeler emerged on top in the point standings.<P>

	Editorial director of Four Wheeler, John Stewart, immediately designated Tread Lightly! as the recipient of the cash prize.<P>

	"This was a great event, proving once again that Land Rover is always out there setting an example for others to follow," said Stewart.<P>

	Land Rover North America's Bill Baker, vice president, Corporate Communications, said, "Tread Lightly has been an important concept for us ever since we helped found the organization in 1988.  We're pleased Four Wheeler has chosen to contribute its prize to this worthy educational cause."<P>

	The final chapter for TReK '96 comes on Sunday, November 3 when the championship round is broadcast on espn2, 7-8 pm est.  Land Rover sets its sights on TReK '97, when dealer employees from all over the U.S. and Canada again test themselves against the challenges that make up the Land Rover lifestyle. <P>

	Land Rover North America, Inc. is a member of the Rover Group of Companies, importing vehicles manufactured by Land Rover, Solihull, England.  The Rover Group is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMW AG.<P>
