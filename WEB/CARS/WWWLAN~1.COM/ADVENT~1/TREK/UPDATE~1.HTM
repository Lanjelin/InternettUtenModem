	<B>ATLANTA, October 5, 1996</B> -- The three-member team from <B>Land Rover North Point of Alpharetta, Georgia</B> topped 30 other teams from the U.S. and Canada to win the inaugural Land Rover TReK '96.  <P>

	Through a combination of Land Rover product knowledge, mental and physical agility and four-wheel driving skills, Land Rover North Point teammates <B>David Croot, 28; Brian Adams, 22;</B> and <B>Paul Zeman, 27</B>, each won a pair of round-trip tickets to London on Virgin Atlantic Airlines, an event co-sponsor, and unique polished jade trophies specially made for TReK '96. <P>

	The victory came in the third heat of the final driving event when second place Land Rover Denver East lost the lead due to a one-minute penalty in the thrilling obstacle course finale to the day-long competition.  Land Rover Glen Cove of New York; Pioneer Centres of San Diego, California; and Lawrence Park Motors of Toronto, Ontario took home third, fourth and fifth respectively.<P>
	
	Commenting on his team's victory, Brian Adams, a parts clerk, said, "Overall, TReK was awesome.  Our team did well in most of the events, especially the triathlon, but we have to give credit to the crew who organized the event.  They did an excellent job."<P>

	The team from Land Rover Denver East of Aurora, CO chalked up a second place finish and the team spirit award.  Land Rover Denver East team members include Greg Weiler, Greg Winch, and Craig Dennis.<P>
	
	Land Rover Denver East team member Craig Dennis summed up winning the team spirit award by saying, "We tried to stay loose throughout the day and have fun with the events.  The entire competition is about teamwork.  When the North Point team dropped their lug wrench in the lake, we loaned them ours so they could complete the event.  That's the kind of spirit TReK is all about."<P>

	Coverage of the TReK finals will appear in a one hour TV-special on <B>espn2</B> on <B>Sunday, November 3rd</B> from <B>7-8 p.m. EST</B>.  Land Rover TReK was held at Little Creek Farms, an off-road training complex 50 miles east of Atlanta, developed by Atlanta Land Rover retailer Mark Hennessy.<P>

	The three top teams all came from Land Rover Centres, exclusive four-wheel drive retail locations that sell only British-built Land Rover products, clothing and adventure accessories.<P>

	"The thirty-one Land Rover retailers who participated in TReK '96 have proven that their staff are true Land Rover enthusiasts and experts," said Charles R. Hughes, president, Land Rover North America, Inc.  "Their knowledge of the product and personal involvement in the four-wheel drive lifestyle reflect our customers' interests."<P>

	Teams from Land Rover retailers across the U.S. and Canada competed in grueling 12-hour trials that included running, driving, canoeing and mountain biking as well as a ropes course designed by world-renowned alpinists.  TReK '96 was a competitive field event designed to allow Land Rover's retail associates to experience four-wheel drive adventure while testing their off-road skills and brand knowledge.  <P>

	Land Rover TReK '96 was organized by Land Rover North America, Lanham, Maryland which sells the Range Rover, Discovery and Defender four-wheel drive vehicles.
