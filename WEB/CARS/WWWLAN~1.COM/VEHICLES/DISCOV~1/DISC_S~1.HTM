Discovery's boxed-steel perimeter frame is literally the foundation of its safety engineering. This 14 gauge structure is seam-welded along its entire length. Four of its five crossmembers are also seam-welded. A welded steel inner body cage is mounted to this impressive frame. "Robust" is an understatement.
<P>

All of Discovery's outer panels are made from corrosion-resistant aluminum except the roof, which is formed from sheet steel for greater stiffness and strength. Side-impact beams within each of the four doors further increase Discovery's structural strength.
<P>

Yet, for optimal occupant protection, this highly rigid structure also has scientifically engineered front crumple zones to help absorb collision energy while keeping the passenger compartment intact.

	and Rover can rightfully claim leadership in safety engineering. After all, the first sport-utility vehicle with dual airbags was a Discovery. In fact, our engineers believe the development of this system encompassed the most rigorous testing of airbags ever undertaken by any four-wheel-drive vehicle manufacturer. And this level of safety engineering is apparent throughout the Discovery. From a switch that turns off the fuel pump after an impact to 4-channel anti-lock disc brakes, Discovery is engineered for your peace of mind.

Of course, Discovery has a dual airbag Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) with gold-plated electrical terminals -- indeed, it was the first sport-utility to feature this safety device.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Please remember that the seatbelts in the Discovery constitute the primary protection system for passengers in collisions. The airbag Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) is a supplement to the seatbelts. Although airbags provide additional protection, airbags alone are not sufficient. Always wear your seatbelts.</FONT>
<P>

Discovery's front seatbelts attach to the seat frame for proper positioning, and the belts' upper mounts are height-adjustable.

</TABLE>

To make it easy to secure a child safety seat, outboard seatbelts can be fully extended and released to supply constant tension on the child seat's frame. Both rear doors and the "fifth" door feature child locks.
<P>

Even Discovery's electrical system plays a role in passenger protection. A serious impact activates a switch that unlocks the doors, shuts off the fuel pump and turns on the hazard warning lights.
<P>

There is much more to safety than simple crashworthiness. Discovery is engineered with advanced systems to help you stay out of harm's way.  Discovery's permanent four-wheel-drive system and all-terrain anti-lock brakes help you retain control, even on rain-slick or snow-covered pavement.

</TABLE>

The braking system bears elaboration. There's a large disc brake at each wheel. Anti-lock brakes are, as you would expect from Land Rover, standard. But unlike some competitors, this system operates each wheel independently, and it works in all drive modes, including Low Range. This sophisticated, all-terrain anti-lock system receives wheel-speed signals up to 250 times a second, and responds more precisely than humanly possible.
<P>

Discovery's most appealing attribute for many families is the security derived from its permanent four-wheel-drive system. Where many simpler systems work only part-time and force you to decide when to engage all four wheels, Discovery's system is permanently engaged, ready to provide traction the instant it is needed. 
<P>

Unlike a passenger car, Discovery gives you a high seating position for a commanding view of the road ahead for more time to react to road hazards. Plus, it features such standard conveniences as an auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated exterior mirrors and powerful headlamp washers.

In fact, every system in the Discovery has been selected and tested to help ensure it meets the primary objective of protecting you and your passengers.
