<p align="center">Network Computing Ranks HP Above 3Com in
Port-switching Comparison </p>

<p>PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 14, 1997 -- Hewlett-Packard Company,
the leader in networked systems for workgroups, today announced
that its AdvanceStack switching hubs were rated No. 1 in a
comparison of port switches in the Feb. 1, 1997 issue of
&quot;Network Computing&quot; magazine. HP received the Editor's
Choice award over other port-switch manufacturers, including
3Com, LANart and Transition. </p>

<p>Port switching is a dynamic technology that allows ports to be
moved, via software, to different segments on the network. The
comparison evaluated port-switching hubs based on ease of use,
configuration, price, overall features, scaleability and
manageability. The HP AdvanceStack switching hub was the only
product to score an &quot;A&quot; rating in Network Computing's
product report card.</p>

<p>&quot;This award recognizes HP's leadership in
high-performance, easily managed networking,&quot; said Gary
McAnally, general manager of HP's Workgroup Networks Division.
&quot;HP provides the best solution for upgrading from shared to
switched environments. As end users require more bandwidth for
Internet and intranet applications, HP AdvanceStack switching
hubs provide an easy, low-cost way to keep up with demand for
improved network performance.&quot;</p>

<p>HP's port-switching hub was the only product in the evaluation
that could move nodes across network segments without using an
additional external switch. HP's switching hubs also provide four
additional switched ports for dedicated access to servers and
network backbones.</p>

<p>The HP AdvanceStack switching hub is a 10Base-T hub capable of
having ports assigned to any one of four internal segments. This
feature provides four times the throughput found in
single-segment 10Base-T hubs. The </p>

<p>HP AdvanceStack switching hubs come bundled with management
and switch modules, enabling management and port-switching
capabilities.</p>

<p>Automatic load-balancing was cited by the Network Computing
article as one of the features that makes the HP AdvanceStack
switching hub easy to configure and manage. This feature spreads
network traffic automatically across all four segments in order
to maximize network performance. Done with a simple click of a
button, automatic load-balancing takes all the guesswork out of
optimizing the network. </p>

Award to the HP AdvanceStack switching hub can be found on the
