FROM KEY PC-SERVER-INDUSTRY INFLUENCERS</strong></font><br>

<br>
<br>
PALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 22, 1997 -- Hewlett-Packard Company today
announced that 1996 brought the company's HP NetServer systems
more than 15 top honors from the computer industry's leading
publications -- more awards than were received by key competitors
Compaq and IBM combined. Honors were given across <br>
the full PC-server line, from enterprise, to departmental, to
self-supported-workgroup servers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Highlights include the following:<br>
<br>
o &quot;Best Product of the Year&quot; for file servers from PC
Magazine for the HP NetServer LH systems (second consecutive
year); <br>
<br>
o &quot;Best Products of the Year,&quot; MVP award for network
servers from PC Computing for the innovative new HP NetServer E
30 system; and <br>
<br>
o Best performance from Computerworld for the HP NetServer LX
Pro. <br>
<br>
<br>
In recognition of its strength among computer value-added
resellers (VARs), dealers, integrators and throughout the
channel, HP, with its NetServer systems, received for the third
consecutive year the &quot;Channel Champion Award&quot; from
Computer Reseller News. HP also received the highest marks from
VARs in the &quot;Annual Report Card&quot; from VARBusiness.<br>
<br>
<br>
In 1996, HP reached its goal for that year to be the No. 2
PC-server vendor, moving from No. 3 to No. 2 in the third-quarter
PC-Server Results report by International Data Corporation (IDC).<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;HP is very customer-focused and continues to design
best-in-class solutions that are targeted to meet the specific
needs of our customers and their markets,&quot; said Duncan
Campbell, worldwide marketing manager of HP's Network Server
Division. &quot;It is clear from all these accolades that HP
NetServer systems are hitting the target and that they are a PC
server of choice with customers, in the channel and with top
computer-industry influencers.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
In its December 1996 issue, VARBusiness said, &quot;In a near
clean sweep, HP wins over Digital, Compaq and IBM with seven out
of eight top scores.&quot; PC Magazine said, &quot;With excellent
design, performance, functionality and a mature management
solution in its NetServer Navigator, the HP NetServer 5/133 LH is
a network administrator's dream.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Computerworld said, &quot;HP designed its NetServer LX Pro with
attention to the details necessary to enable ready management and
configuration of the server.&quot; PC World said, &quot;Once
again, an HP server proves a super performer.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
In addition to the numerous awards and honors bestowed on HP
NetServer systems last year, the servers also repeatedly won the
PC-server product-review roundups conducted by leading computing
publications.<br>

to include Pentium Pro in its midrange and high-end systems and
introduced the HP NetServer E Series, which was created
specifically for self-supported workgroups.<br>
<br>
<br>
HP's complete family of NetServer systems consists of two
distinct lines of PC servers, as well as a fully pre-configured
Internet solution available in North America, the HP NetServer
Web Master. The HP NetServer E 30 is the first of the E Series
servers designed for small to midsized businesses or remote
corporate sites with little or no MIS support. The award-winning
L Series spans from the entry-level HP NetServer LD Pro corporate
workgroup server to the departmental HP NetServer LH servers
through the enterprise-level HP NetServer LXe and LX Pro
application servers. All HP NetServers come equipped with an HP
NetServer Navigator CD-ROM, which features easy-to-use tools to
configure, install and manage the servers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Customer-voted, Award-winning, Worldwide Service and Support<br>
<br>
HP's L Series servers are backed by a standard three-year,
next-day, limited warranty, which is available from HP service
technicians or authorized resellers. HP NetServer systems also
are covered by a wide range of HP SupportPack services, which
provide three-year same-day or 24 X 7 hardware support, server
installation and network configuration, and network
operating-system support. HP SupportPack services are sold by
resellers and delivered by HP.<br>
