<h1>Info About the Images at Spanky</h1>
<p>
	The images at SPANKY come from a variety of sources. Many I have
created myself, but others I have gathered from diverse locations 
on the internet. The image directories usually contain an index file or
short document containing attributions. If it isn't there or a image reference
is missing in the index, it just means I don't remember where the image came 
from. If it's your's, please feel free to email me and I will add your name.
Spanky's root image directory 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1709" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/">
[pub.fractals.images] </a> can be reached from here. <p>
	The fractal images found here in the 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1713" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/noel/">
[pub.fractals.images.noel]
</a>
directory were created by me using the FRACTINT formula system. I would
like to take this opportunity to thank <a
href="FRACTINT/STONE_~1.HTM" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/stone_soup.html">
<b> The Stone Soup Group</b> </a> who 
put together<a href="FRACTINT/FRACTI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/fractint.html">
 <b>FRACTINT</b> </a> for donating their time and programming
skills in creating such a wonderfully versatile fractal generator.
The formulae I used in the creation of these images are from a series 
of fractal formula that I have
been exploring which I refer to as <b>Inductive Fractals</b>. There will soon 
be an html document here on this subject. Look at the page on
<a href="QUARTE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/quartet-info.html"> The Quartet Fractal</a>
to get an idea of what I'm talking about. 
	There are also the mini-series found  in 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1714" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/mini/">
[pub.fractals.images.mini]</a>, which contain some scaled down versions of my
favourites, and the 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1715" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/big/">
[pub.fractals.images.big] </a>
directory which contains oversized 2048 x 1536 pixel renditions. The "BIG"
series can be very large (in excess of 3 megabytes for a few), so download 
them only if you really want to see that fine fractal detail and can 
handle the resolution. Anything that I have 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1716" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/new/"> created recently, 
</a> usually spends some time in a separate directory until I have decided 
what to do with it. There is also a directory where I keep any 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1717" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/noel/mandel/">
<img ALT="[NEW]" SRC="NEW.GIF" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/new.gif">
mandelbrots and julia's </a> that I have created. Some of them have
rather unusual initializations and mappings.

My images and formulae can be freely distributed, but I would appreciate a
reference tag. This is especially true if it's published in any way.  Money is
always a nice gesture at times like that, or at least a copy or two for
posterity. 
<p>
The wonderful Mandelbrot images found under the 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1718" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/mandel/">
[pub.fractals.images.mandel]
</a>
directory were created by Uwe Krueger at University of Karlsruhe in Germany
using the <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1719" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/programs/mandtool/">
Mandtool program</a> developed there. 
<p> 
The fractals in the 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1720" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/others/">
[pub.fractals.images.others]
</a>
 directory are
those that I have archived from the alt.binaries.pictures.fractals newsgroup. I
haven't spoken to the posters on the subject of reuse, but I'm sure they would
feel as I do. Their names are given in the index file in that directory. 
<p>
Other image directories contain submissions from individuals who I thought
had something unique to offer or are reserved for specific fractal types such 
as 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1721" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/ifs/">
IFS 
</a>
or 
<a 
href="../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1722" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/images/lyapunov/">
Lyapunov 
</a>
fractals.
<p>
I have tried to avoid storing anything that was copyrighted such as software or
images where the poster claimed an exclusive right of any kind. If you see
something here that is yours and you don't want it here, then please email me
and I will remove it. This is not a complete archive or is it intended to be. 
I don't see all the images posted and I only keep the ones I like, so I'm sorry
if i've overlooked some of your favourites.
