<h1>General Info About the Database </h1>
<h2> Getting the Files </h2>
SPANKY is a DEC Microvax 3400 computer running the VMS operating system, 
and if you've had trouble getting ftp transfers to work, this is why.
VMS is much different than Unix and the syntax it expects from ftp
is non-standard in this Unix centred universe of the net. I like to
think of Spanky as a lone Mammal swimming in a reptilian sea. Unfortunately,
this time around, it looks like the dinosaurs are winning. Anyway, 
Lynx 2.3 is able to correctly parse the VMS filenames, and spawn programs to
view the images as well as NETSCAPE and the NCSA Mosaic client. You can use FTP
to transfer the files but you will have to learn the VAX/VMS directory and
filename syntax. Get the README.DOC file in the 
<a href="../PUB/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/"> [pub] directory</a>.

<h2>A Note to <i>NETSCAPE</I> users</h2>

Netscape is a great program and it is quickly becoming one of the more 
popular web-browsers due to its capabilities and extensions. However
there are some drawbacks and issues that I have with it when viewing
fractals. In it's default settings, Netscape typically converts and
compresses inline images and either dithers them to a colour cube
or takes a closest approximation to colours within a fixed palette. 
Neither of these techniques are really acceptable when studying
fractal images. I understand the issues and the necessity when dealing
with multiple inline images, but I want the user to be aware that they
are often viewing an image with less than optimum resolution or with
a significantly altered and reduced colour palette. If you really want
to see what the artist intended you will have to save the image locally
and look at it with another viewer. Other browsers may also be guilty
of this. I'm not sure. I certainly haven't tried them all.
<p>
<h2>Info on What's There </h2>

    I've started to accumulate a reasonable selection of fractal related 
programs and documents as well as images. It's all stuff that is or was
available on the net but I thought it might be convenient if you could find it
all in one place. If you know of worthwhile programs or articles that I haven't
included and that are freely available then you could EMAIL me and tell me what
it is and where I could find it. My address is noel@reg.triumf.ca 
I'll try and keep things reasonably up-to-date. I've put them all in
associated sub-directories under the [PUB.FRACTALS]  heading. <p>

	There is more Information on Spanky's 
<a href="IMAGE-~1.HTM" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/image-info.html">
image archive </a> available, as well as some more detailed background
information<a href="DEEP-B~1.HTM" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/deep-back.html">
about this server</a>.
<p> 
	Get the <a href="../PUB/INDEX.DOC" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/index.doc">
INDEX.DOC </a>file in the [pub] directory for a complete and nearly
up-to-date listing of what's available on this site. This document contains
file sizes in blocks (512 bytes) as well as file modification dates.<p>

<h2> Problems? </h2> <p>
	As much as I'd like everything to work perfectly, the world is too
complex a place and chaos will take over if conditions are favourable. If you
are having trouble transfering files or decoding files or viewing images and
have exhausted all possible solutions and fixes from your end then try 
contacting me and maybe I can help. It might be a problem here. Sometimes
files are stored or transfered here in the wrong format and I am not aware 
of it or sometimes the httpd server doesn't understand the file-type. I know
that there are some incompatibilities with the httpd server I am running
and at least one other version out there. I may not be able to solve your
problem either but I will try to sort it out when I have time.
