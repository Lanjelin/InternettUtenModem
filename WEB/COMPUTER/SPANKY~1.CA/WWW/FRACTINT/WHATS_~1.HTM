<h1>New Features in Version 19.5</h1>
<ul>

<p>
<p>
  Version 19.5 is a bug-fix release for version 19.4 based on the
    developer's version 19.40 patch 11. As always, we added a few new
    features along with the bug fixes.

<p>
<li>
<p>
  New 
<a href=
"../../../tppmsgs/msgs22.htm#2290" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/startup_params.html#comment_anchor">
Comment= command </a>. You can automatically set any of the four
    PAR comments, and can include variables in the comments such as the
    much-requested $calctime$ and $date$. Fractint now writes ';;' for
    empty comments above the last comment from the comment= command. This
    prevents comments from moving positions when the PAR is reloaded.

<li>
<p>
  New 
<a href=
"../../../tppmsgs/msgs22.htm#2294" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/color_params.html#record_colors_anchor">
recordcolors= command </a>. If you place recordcolors=y in your
    SSTOOLS.INI, compressed colors will always be written in your PARS. If
    you want to remember what the map file was (assuming the colors were
    loaded from one), try recordcolors=c. This is exactly like
    recordcolors=y except that the map file (if any) is written to a
    parfile comment.

<li>
<p>
  Added new parser constants:
<pre>
    1. whitesq parser constant = (row+col)&1
    2. scrnpix parser constant = (col,row)
    3. scrnmax parser constant = (xdots, ydots)
    4. maxit   parser constant = (maxit,0)
</pre>

<li>
<p>
  Added &quot;\&quot; linewrap for formula files.

<li>
<p>
  Made the round function consistent in all modes. Now round(z) is always
    (floor(x+.5)+i*floor(y+.5)). In version 19.4, in floating point mode
    with type=formula, round() used the coprocessor "nearest or even"
    rounding. Version 19.5 always rounds xxx.5 up.

<li>
<p>
  Fixed a bug that caused a crash when zooming out with certain functions
    in integer mode.

<li>
<p>
  Fixed a bug that caused a crash when attempting 3d=overlay without a
    filename in batch mode.

<li>
<p>
  Fixed a bug that caused part of the video table to not show when
    compiled by Borland.

<li>
<p>
  Fixed a bug that kept the last image browsed from showing up when you
    regenerate an image and then start the browser again.

<li>
<p>
  Fixed a bug that loaded images with the wrong aspect ratio when using
    the browser with the view window turned on, and the file image size
    was not the same as the screen image size.
</ul>

<h1>Changes from Version 19.3 to 19.4</h1>

<ul>
<p>
Version 19.4 is a bug-fix release for version 19.3 based on the
developer's version 19.30 patch 18. But a few new features did slip in
when we weren't looking.
 
<p>
<li>
New functions are now available for type=formula and general function
variable use. They are the rounding functions: floor(), ceil(),
trunc(), and round()

<li>
New larger showdot &quot;turtle&quot; to enable better seeing which pixel is
 currently being calculated. The syntax is showdot=&lt;color&gt;/&lt;size&gt;
, but the color parameter can now be one of auto, bright, medium, and dark
in addition to the previously-supported color number value.

<li>
 The <b>[g]</b> command now remembers the last command.

<li>
Added the ability to load images into a view window.  This can be used
with the browser to browse images larger than the current image.

<li>
Added George Martin's new integrated entry-finding code. Fractint is now
more tolerant of text between entries, and the internal code is much
cleaner than before.

<li>
Added Bert Tyler's new VESA truecolor video drivers. These don't do
anything yet; we've just added the video drivers for testing. Work
goes on ... <br>
To test out the new modes, try fractint debug=500 type=test and select
a new truecolor mode. They only work with video boards having VESA
truecolor support. Some &quot;non-standard VESA&quot; modes (an unfortunate
oxymoron if there ever was one) can also be supported by editing
FRACTINT.CFG. These vendor-specific &quot;VESA&quot; modes tend to make Bert,
our video expert, real grumpy ...
</ul>
<p>
<h2>
   Now for the squashed bugs report:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Ranges is working again.

<li>
Fixed a browser bug that caused a crash when the browser cross-hairs
become too small.

<li>
Fixed a bug which put the browser into an infinite loop if the history
feature was used to try and access a deleted or renamed image that was
still in the history stack.

<li>
Fixed bug that caused any command with greater than 16 parameters to
fail, most notably textcolors and ranges.

<li>
Fixed a center-mag&lt;-&gt;corners conversion bug that occurred with rotated
images.  arbitrary precision also (test with debug=3200).

<li>
Fixed bug that allowed the matherr debugging file to grow arbitrarily
large.  Matherr file is limited to 100 messages for each fractal.

<li>
Fixed bug that affected some Icons3d types, which were broken due to a
very subtle bug in apparently good code caused compiler optimizer.
 
</ul>
<p>
<h2> Version 19.3 release changes</h2>

<p>
Version 19.3 is a bug-fix release for version 19.2 based on the
developer's version 19.21 patch 30.
<p>
The biggest changes from 19.2 to 19.3 are the fixing of the color logmap
function for maximum iterations greater than 32K, and a large increase
in the maximum size of an individual formula and the maximum number of
entries in formula, parameter, ifs, and lsystem files.


<h2>Changes from 19.2 to 19.3 include:</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added better math function error trapping for the formula parser. This
can change the rendering of some PAR files using type=formula. If
reset=1920 is included in the PAR file, the new error trapping is
disabled.

<li>
Fixed an old, rare, but nasty bug that stripped trailing zeros from the
exponents of floating point numbers written to PAR files.

<li>
Ctrl-ins and Ctrl-Del now change the browser frame colors.

<li>
Fixed bug that occurred when writing PAR files containing a video= line
with a four character video mode.

<li>
Added batch facility to copy fractal information and color in GIFs to
PAR format.

<li>
Added current column to the &lt;tab&gt; screen.

<li>
Removed support for reading Targa files.

<li>
Added backwards compatibility for the fractal type fn(z*z).

<li>
Added support for expanded and extended memory to the browser.  Use
expanded memory if you don't have at least 4 MB of extended memory.

<li>
Added pi and e to constants that the formula parser recognizes.  Fixed
parser so that constants are recognized correctly.

<li>
Added docs for freestyle mode in the colour editor.

<li>
Fixed bug involving comments between formula entries.

<li>
Allow renaming Fractint.exe without losing access to fractint's help
files.

<li>
Center-mag is now the default method for storing coordinates in PAR
files.

<li>
Increased limit on number of operations in a formula entry from 250 to
over 2000. In most cases memory use is actually less than before
because of use of existing memory arrays.



<li>
Fixed a bug that caused the image to regenerate when the &lt;y&gt; screen was
accessed, but nothing was changed (or color cycle range was changed).

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused saved partial images that used logmap to use the
incorrect logmap routine when restored (GIFs & PARs).

<li>
Made the solid guessing stop pass parameter save to GIFs and PARS.

<li>
Added truecolor=yes command. This causes the iterations for each point
to be written to a 24-bit Targa truecolor file called iterates.tga.
Maxiter is also written to the file. This allows a simple outboard
program to assign truecolors to iterations. Passes=1 is forced, but
symmetry works.  (This function may go away in the future when real
truecolor support is implemented.)

<li>
Fixed bug that caused PARs to have incorrect number of parameters when a
formula based GIF was loaded and a PAR made immediately.

<li>
Added additional bailout tests manh and manr.  See 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs22.htm#2299" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/bailout.html"> Bailout Test </a>
.

<li>
Fixed &lt;Z&gt; screen so bailout test can be changed when potential is being
used.

<li>
Fixed bug that caused large filename numbers to increment incorrectly.

<li>
Added new guessing options g1, g2, etc. that cause guessing to terminate
before the last pass.

<li>
Added new orbitsave=sound option that causes orbits with sound on to
write to a file sound.txt. The values written are the Hertz values for
each orbit point. The time is written out in milliseconds once per
pixel.

<li>
Added documentation for making demm images to match ones made prior to
version 16.

<li>
Added key pressed check to autologmap so it is possible to bailout with
a high maxit value.

<li>
Made all floating point types capable of zooming out past (32,32).

<li>
Added the formula parameters p1, p2, and p3 to the &lt;tab&gt; screen.

<li>
Added stereo pair feature to stereo options menu.

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused julia_inverse to continue after completed.

<li>
Bignumber library rearranged. DOS midnight bug fix, so total time of
images run overnight is now correct.

<li>
Added logmap backwards compatibility for pre-version 19.2 images.

<li>
Browser problem with flipped images fixed.

<li>
Changed default corners to 4:3 aspect for types sierpinski, popcorn,
pickover, popcornjul, tim's_error, martin, and halley.

<li>
Added a range check for type=ants numants parameter.

<li>
RDS save command is no longer case sensitive.

<li>
Added the color number to the status area in the palette editor.

<li>
Changed logmap and distest to a long variable to accomodate the version
19.0 change to long maxit.

<li>
Added a pixel-at-a-time routine to calculate the logmap values on the
fly when memory is low or maxit &gt; 32767.  Use logmode=fly to use with
maxit &lt; 32767.  Note: ranges still doesn't work with maxit &gt; 32767.

<li>
Extended error checking to set the overflow variable when a zero
denominator is found.  Added checking of overflow in a few places
where it is needed.

<li>
Added backwards compatibility for the old &quot;broken&quot; integer parser mod
function.

<li>
Fixed the maximum zoom out of the integer type fn(z*z) (and others) so
the user doesn't get thrown out to DOS.

<li>
Fixed writing of olddemmcolors variable to PAR file.

</ul>
<p>
  Version 19.2 is a bug-fix release for version 19.1. Changes from 19.1 to
    19.2 include:
<ul>

<li>
  Fixed the 3D function, which was broken in 19.1 due to a side-effect of
    a repair of a minor bug in 19.0. Arrgghh! This is the main reason for
    the release of this version so quickly.

<li>
Fixed a bug that caused the Julia inverse window and the orbits window to lose
their place after loading a color map.


<li>
  Fixed a bug that causes corners to be lost when too many digits are
  entered.

<li>
  Added an enhanced ants automaton by Luciano Genero and Fulvio Cappelli.

<li>
  New showorbit command allows orbits-during-generation feature to be
    turned on by default. Expanded limits of Hertz command to 20 to 15000.

<li>
  Targa 3D files are now correctly written to workdir rather than tempdir.

<li>
  Uncommented garbage between file entries is now ignored. (But note that
    &quot;{&quot; must be on same line as entry name.)

<li>
  Fixed savename update logic.
</ul>
<h2> Version 19.1 release changes </h2>
<p>
  Version 19.1 is a bug-fix release for version 19.0. Changes from 19.0 to
    19.1 include:

<ul>
<li>
  Disabled the F6 (corners) key when in the parameters screen <b>[z]</b> for
    arbitrary precision.

<li>
  IFS formulas now show in <b>[z]</b> screen.

<li>
  Allow RDS image maps of arbitrary dimensions.

<li>
  Touched up Mandelbrot/Julia <b>[Space]</b> toggle logic.

<li>
  Fractint now remembers map name, and uses the mapfile path correctly,
    and now allows periods in directory names.

<li>
  Fixed tab bug that caused problems when interrupting a restore of an
    arbitrary precision image.

<li>
  Repaired savename logic. No longer show (usually truncated) full path of
    the saved file in the screen.

<li>
  Fixed double to arbitrary precision transition with 90 degree images.
    (This only failed before when the image was rotated exactly 90
    degrees.)

<li>
  Corrected docs directory errors that reported several commands such as
    PARDIR= that were not implemented. Documented the color cycling HOME
    function.

<li>
  Fixed Mandelbrot/Julia types with bailout less than 4 (try it, results
    are interesting!)

<li>
  Fixed browser delete feature which left a box on the screen after
    deleting and exiting browser feature.

<li>
  More changes in filename processing logic.  &quot;.\&quot; is now recognized as
    the current directory and is expanded to its full path name.  It is
    now possible, although not recommended, to designate the root
    directory of a disk as the desired search directory.

<li>
  Fixed integer math Mandelbrot bug for 286 or lower machines.

<li>
  Fixed problem of reading some Lsys files incorrectly (distribution
    PENROSE.L file was broken unless first line was commented.)

<li>
  Fixed problem that caused endless loop in RDS with bad input values.

<li>
  Made reading the current directory first optional, added the new
    curdir=yes command for times when you want to use current directory
    files.

<li>
  Fixed problem with complexpower() function (&quot;x^y&quot; formula operator) in
    the case where x == 0. (Note that formulas where 0^0 appears for every
    every pixel are considered broken and no promises made.)

<li>
  Prevented aspect ratio drift as you zoom. If you want to make tiny
    adjustments, use new ASPECTDRIFT=0 command.

<li>
  Inside=bof60 and bof61 options now work correctly with the formula
  parser.

<li>
  We discovered the calculation time is no good after 24 days, so instead
    of the time you will now get the message &quot;A Really Long Time!!! (<b>
 &gt</b> 24.855 days)&quot;.  We thought you'd like to know ... A prize for the
    first person who actually *sees* this message!

</ul>
<h2> Version 19.0 release changes </h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
  New arbitrary precision math allows types mandelbrot, julia, manzpower,
    and julzpower to zoom to 10^1600. See 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs21.htm#2183" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/deep_zoom.html">
Arbitrary Precision and Deep Zooming</a>

<li>
  New Random Dot Stereogram feature using <b>[Ctrl]</b>-<b>[S]</b>. Thanks to 
Paul De Leeuw for contributing this feature. For more, see

Random Dot Stereograms (RDS).</a>

<li>
  New browser invoked by the <b>[l]</b> command allows you to see the
    relationships of a family of images within the current corners values.
    See 
<a href="COMMAN~1.HTM#browse_anchor" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/commands.html#browse_anchor">

Browser Parameters </a>. Thanks
    to Robin Bussell for contributing this feature.

<li>
  Added four 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs22.htm#2299" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/bailout.html">
Bailout Tests, </a> real, imag, or, and.  These are set
    on the <b>[Z]</b> screen of the fractal types for which they work.  The
    default is still mod.

<li>
  New asin, asinh, acos, acosh, atan, atanh, sqrt, abs (abs(x)+i*abs(y)),
    and cabs (sqrt(x*x + y*y)) functions added to function variables and
    parser.

<li>
  New fractal types types chip, quadruptwo, threeply, phoenixcplx,
    mandphoenixclx, and ant automaton.

<li>
  Increased maximum iterations to 2,147,483,647 and maximum bailout to
     2,100,000,000 when using floating point math.

<li>
  New path/directory management. Fractint now remembers the pathname of
    command-line filenames. This means that you can specifiy directories
    where your files reside in SSTOOLS.INI. In what follows, <b>[path]</b>
 can be a directory, a filename, or a full path.
</ul>
<listing>
    File                      SSTOOLS.INI Command       Comments

    ===============================================================
    PAR directory                parmfile=<path>
    GIF files for reading        filename=<path>
    MAP files                    map=<path>
    Autokey files                autokeyname=<path>
    GIF files for saving         savename=<path>
    Print file                   printfile=<path>
    Formula files                formulafile=<path>

    IFS file                     ifsfile=<path>
    Miscellaneous files          workdir=<path>           new command
    Temporary files              tempdir=<path>           new command
</listing>
<ul>

<li>
    If the directories do not exist, Fractint gives an error message on
    runup with the option to continue.

<li>
  Fractint now searches all FRM, IFS, LSYS, and PAR files in the
    designated directory for entries. The number of entries in files has
    been greatly increased from 200 to 2000. Comment support in these
    files is improved.

<li>
  Parameters shown in <b>[z]</b> screen now match those used in a formula.

<li>
  Distance estimator logic has been overhauled, with the variable
    olddemmcolors added for backward compatibility.

<li>
  New floating point code for Lsystems from Nick Wilt greatly speeds up
     image generation.

<li>
  Enhanced fast parser from Chuck Ebbert makes floating point formula
    fractals faster than built-in types.

<li>
  Enhanced the history command to include all parameters, colors, and even
    .frm, .l, and .ifs file names and entries. Number of history sets
    remembered can be set with the maxhistory=<b>[nnn]</b> command to save
    memory.

<li>
  Enhanced center-mag coordinates to support rotated/stretched/skewed zoom
    boxes.

<li>
  Added new parameter to built-in Halley for comparison with formula type,
    also added new parameter to Frothybasin type.

<li>
  Added color number to orbits numbers <b>[n]</b> display.

<li>
  Added two new parameters to distest= to allow specifying resolution.
    This allows making resolution-independent distance estimator images.

<li>
  Fixed bug that caused the &quot;big red switch&quot; bug if '(' appeared in random
    uncommented formula file text, but fair warning, we don't officially
    support uncommented text in FRM files.

<li>
  Symmetry now works for the Marksjulia type and Marksmandel types.

<li>
  Full path no longer written in PAR files with <b>[b]</b> command.

<li>
  Fixed fractal type fn(z*z) so that zooming out will no longer dump you
    out to DOS, affecting zoomed out integer images made with this type.

<li>
  Fixed a float to fudged integer conversion that affects integer fractal
    types fn(z*z) and fn*fn.  This has only a minor impact on integer
    images made with these types.

<li>
  Default drive and directory restored after dropping to DOS, in case you
    changed it while under DOS.

<li>
  Added support for inversion to the formula parser (type=formula).

<li>
  Increased maximum number of files listed by <b>[r]</b> command to 2977 from
  300.

<li>
  Added outside=atan option.
