Other Fractal Products
</h1>
<HR>
<p>
  (Forgive us, but we just *have* to begin this section with a plug for
  *our* fractal products...)

<p>
  Several of Fractint's programmers have written books about fractals,
  Fractint, and Winfract (the Windows version of Fractint).  The book
  about Fractint is <a href=
"../../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1755" tppabs="http://www.dnai.com/waite/books.new/Fractal_Creations._2ED/html/fc2ecov.html">
Fractal Creations Second Edition </a>(1994 Waite Group
  Press, ISBN # 1-878739-34-4).  The book about Winfract is The Waite
  Group's Fractals for Windows (1992 Waite Group Press, ISBN # 1-878739-
  25-5).  These books are now very hard to find, so if you see one, better
  get it!


<p>
  Fractal Creations Second Edition includes:
<ul>
   <li>A guided tour of Fractint.
   <li>A detailed manual and reference section of commands.
   <li>A tutorial on fractals.
   <li>A reference containing tips, explanations, and examples of parameters
     for all the Fractals generated by Fractint/Winfract.
   <li>Secrets on how the programs work internally.
   <li>Spectacular color plate section.
   <li>A CD containing Fractint and Xfract source and executable, and over a
     thousand spectacular fractal images.
   <li>A complete copy of the source code with a chapter explaining how the
     program works.
</ul>

  compatibles, distributed on 3.5&quot; HD disk, published by Jon Horner.

  Several Fractint enthusiasts are selling Fractal CDs.  Two of the best
  are called 
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS24.HTM#2447" tppabs="http://www.cdrom.com/titles/fractal.html">
&quot;Fractal Frenzy&quot; </a> by Lee Skinner, and &quot;Fractography&quot; by Caren
  Park.  Highly recommended original artwork in a variety of graphics
  formats.

<p>
  You can receive the &quot;Fractal Frenzy CD&quot; by sending $39.95US + $5.00 S&H
     to:
<pre>
     Walnut Creek CDROM
     1537 Palos Verdes Mall, Suite 260
     Walnut Creek, CA 94596

<p>
  and the &quot;Fractography&quot; CD by sending $30.00US + $5.00 S&H (in US/Canada)
  to:

  Michael Peters and Randall Scott have written a
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS18.HTM#1854" tppabs="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/mpeters/hop.htm">
  fractal program called HOP </a> based on the Martin orbit fractals. This
  program is much narrower than Fractint in the kind of thing that it
  does, but has many more animation effects and makes a great screen
  saver. Michael sent us the algorithms for the chip, quadruptwo, and
  threeply fractal types to give us a taste. The file is called HOPZIP.EXE
  in LIB 4 of CompuServe's GRAPHDEV forum.
<p>
  Michael has also written a handy utility called PARTOBAT which creates a
  batch file for generating all the images in a Fractint PAR file.

<p>

  George Martin has written a useful formula file organizing
  program, distributed as 
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS17.HTM#1726" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/pub/fractals/programs/ibmpc/orgfrm.zip">
<b> ORGFRM.ZIP </b> </a> along with a comprehensive collection
  of formulas. Thousands of parser formulas have been written by Fractint
  users. A compilation of this formula output is contained in the file
  ORGFRM.ZIP, which is available at the CompuServe site, and which
  constitutes an encyclopedia of formulas written for Fractint. The
  compilation includes more than 4,500 formulas, arranged alphabetically
  by name, and with the original source file shown in each formula by
  comment. The package includes a utility program, orgform.exe, which
  copies the formulas of &quot;.frm&quot; files into the compilation, 
  skipping those formulas which are already included in the compilation. 
  Formula writers are urged to consult this compilation in order to avoid 
  giving a new formula an existing formula name. George can be reached at 
  [76440,1143], or 76440.1143@compuserve.com.
