<h1>CONTACTING THE AUTHORS</h1>
<p>
  Communication between the authors for development of the next version of
  Fractint takes place in a CompuServe (CIS) GO GRAPHICS GROUP (GGG)
  forum.  This forum changes from time to time as as the GGG grows. You
  can always find it using the CompuServe GO GRAPHICS command. Currently
  we are located in GRAPHDEV (Graphics Developers) forum, Section 4
  (Fractal Sources).
<p>

  Most of the authors have never met except on CompuServe. Access to the
  GRAPHDEV forum is open to any and all interested in computer generated
  fractals. New members are always welcome! Stop on by if you have any
  questions or just want to take a peek at what's getting tossed into the
  soup.  This is by far the best way to have your questions answered or
  participate in discussion. Also, you'll find many GIF image files
  generated by fellow Fractint fans and many fractal programs as well in
  the GRAPHDEV forum's data library 5.
<p>

  If you're not a CompuServe subscriber, but wish to get more information
  about CompuServe and its graphics forums, feel free to call their 800
  number (800-848-8199) and ask for operator number 229.
<p>

  The following authors have agreed to the distribution of their
  addresses.  Usenet/Internet/Bitnet/Whatevernet users can reach CIS users
  directly if they know the user ID (i.e., Bert Tyler's ID is
  73477.433@compuserve.com).
<p>

  Just remember that CIS charges by the minute, so it costs us a little
  bit to read a message -- don't kill us with kindness. And don't send all
  your mail to Bert -- spread it around a little! Postal addresses are
  listed below so that you have a way to send bug reports and ideas to the
  Stone Soup team.

<p>
  Please understand that we receive a lot of mail, and because of the
  demands of volunteer work on Fractint as well as our professional
  responsibilities, we are generally unable to answer it all.  Several of
  us have reached the point where we can't answer any conventional mail.
  We *do* read and enjoy all the mail we receive, however. If you need a
  reply, the best thing to do is use email, which we are generally able to
  answer, or better yet, leave a message in CompuServe's GRAPHDEV.
<p>

  (This address list is getting seriously out of date. We have updated
  information from those folks who have contacted us. The next release of
  Fractint will contain the addresses of *only* those people who have
  explicitly told us that their address is correct and they want it
  listed. Please contact one of the main authors with this information.)
