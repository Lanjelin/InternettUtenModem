<h1>Fractint Bibliography</h1>

<p>
  BARNSLEY, Michael: &quot;Fractals Everywhere,&quot; Academic Press, 1988.

<p>
  DAVENPORT, Clyde: &quot;A Hypercomplex Calculus with Applications to
     Relativity&quot;, ISBN 0-9623837-0-8. This self-published expansion of Mr.
     Davenport's Master's thesis makes the case for using hypercomplex
     numbers rather than quaternions. This book provided the background
     for Fractint's implementation of hypercomplex fractals.

<p>
  DEWDNEY, A. K., &quot;Computer Recreations&quot; 
  columns in &quot;Scientific American&quot;
     -- 8/85, 7/87, 11/87, 12/88, 7/89.

<p>
  FEDER, Jens: &quot;Fractals,&quot; Plenum, 1988.
     Quite technical, with good coverage of applications in fluid
     percolation, game theory, and other areas.

<p>
  GLEICK, James: &quot;Chaos: Making a New Science,&quot; Viking Press, 1987.
     The best non-technical account of the revolution in our understanding
     of dynamical systems and its connections with fractal geometry.

<p>
  MANDELBROT, Benoit: &quot;The Fractal Geometry of Nature,&quot; 
	W. H. Freeman &amp Co., 1982.
     An even more revised and expanded version of the 1977 work. A rich
     and sometimes confusing stew of formal and informal mathematics, the
     prehistory of fractal geometry, and everything else. Best taken in
     small doses.

<p>
  MANDELBROT, Benoit: &quot;Fractals: Form, Chance, and Dimension,&quot; W. H.
     Freeman &amp Co., 1977.
     A much revised translation of &quot;Les objets fractals: forme, hasard, et
     dimension,&quot; Flammarion, 1975.

<p>
  PEITGEN, Heinz-Otto &amp RICHTER, Peter: &quot;The Beauty of Fractals,&quot;
     Springer-Verlag, 1986.
     THE coffee-table book of fractal images, knowledgeable on computer
     graphics as well as the mathematics they portray.

<p>
  PEITGEN, Heinz-Otto &amp SAUPE, Ditmar: 
     &quot;The Science of Fractal Images,&quot; Springer-Verlag, 1988.
     A fantastic work, with a few nice pictures, but mostly filled with
     *equations*!!!

<p>
  PICKOVER, Clifford: &quot;Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty,&quot; St.
     Martin's Press, 1990.

<p>
  SCHROEDER, Manfred: 
  &quot;Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws,&quot; W. H. Freeman &amp Co., 1991.

<p>
  WEGNER, Timothy: 
     &quot;Image Lab, Second Edition&quot;, Waite Group Press, 1995. 
     Learn how to create fractal animations, fractal RDS stereo images, and 
     how to use Fractint with other image creation and processing tools such 
     as Piclab, POV-Ray and Polyray ray tracers.

<p>
  WEGNER, Timothy &amp TYLER, Bert: 
     &quot;Fractal Creations, Second Edition&quot; Waite
     Group Press, 1993
     This is the definitive Fractint book. Spectacular color plate
     section, totally new and expanded fractal type descriptions,
     annotated PAR files, source code secrets, and a CD filled to the brim
     with spectacular fractals.

<p>
  WEGNER, Timothy, TYLER, Bert, PETERSON, Mark, and Branderhorst, Pieter:
     &quot;Fractals for Windows,&quot; Waite Group Press, 1992.
     This book is to Winfract (the Windows version of Fractint) what
     &quot;Fractal Creations&quot; is to Fractint.
