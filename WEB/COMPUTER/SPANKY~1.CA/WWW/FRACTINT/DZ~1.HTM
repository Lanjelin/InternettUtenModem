<h1>
Deepzooming with Fractint
</h1>
<hr>
<p>
	Fractint now has this amazing capability to zoom into unbelievable
depths with precision up to 1600 decimal digits. So you can now look for 
new and unique fractal regions at previously unheard of scale. The trick
is not to get carried away with just zooming in, where you can get lost
in infinite whorls of self-similarity, but to carefully step from minibrot
to minibrot, looking for new levels of complexity and detail. I took a
shot at it and produced this image. I thought that the fine filigree 
structure was fascinating.

<p>
The region is in a spiral, but not
too deeply and the precision is about 18 decimal digits. It is not even
seriously testing the arbitrary precision math, but the full size image
still managed to take about 3 weeks to compute on my 486DX/66 computer. This is
primarily due to the high iteration limit and the image resolution of 1024x768
for the full-size image.
It was my first attempt to achieve the dubious honour of watching fractint
inform me that my image took too long to compute. I didn't quite succeed. I was
about three days short of the required lapsed time, but I seriously taxed my
own limits in creating it. That's a long time to wait for one image. Hat's off
to those with the personal fortitude to explore deeper and wait longer.

Wes Loewer, <i>loewer@tenet.edu</i> the one who programmed the

arbitrary precision math </a>
routines into fractint, has sent me his deepest zooming
effort. It is a 1.0e1500 zoom into a self similar region at the very
top of the mset in the region of (0.0, 1.0)

This version is a gif87a format and I use it here as it is a much smaller
file due to a better compression with a reduced palette than 
the <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS21.HTM#2119" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/dz/top1500.gif">
original gif89a version</a> that contains the fractint information. The
two images are almost identical and the only reason to download the gif89a
version would be to load it into fractint and keep zooming or to actually
see fractint report an image that took 7 weeks, 2 days, 8 hours, 15 minutes, 
33.50 seconds of actual running time to compute on a 486sx/25 system.
It was calculated using a boundary trace mode that help reduce the calculation
time. Only about 20% of the pixels in this image needed to be computed using 
this algorithm The fractint .par entry is:

ALT="Horiz-hold Image:"> Horizontal-hold image</a> to generate
this fractal. It caused a reasonable amount of consternation on
the <b> sci.fractals</b> usenet newsgroup. Noone had seen anything
quite like this before and some people thought that <b> Fractint's
</b> deepzooming feature was broken. This was modified slightly from
the original. It uses 1-pass mode with periodicity turned off and has
a different palette, but it should give you an idea why we were all
concerned.

Bengt M&aring;nsson <i>bengtmn@algonet.se</i> backed out a little bit and

Kerry Mitchell, <i> lkmitch@primenet.com </i> created a deepzoom fractal
from this area as well. I'll include the text and the parfile that he sent
me along with the image. <p>

<p>
Here is my first attempt at a deepzoom fractal.  It is a Mandelbrot 
midget on the spike (negative real axis), that was carefully chosen.  If 
you look at the midget at -1.75, you'll see that it is associated with 
the number 3.  That is, this midget causes the band of dwell = 3 to dip 
down toward the axis, and the main cardioid for this midget has 
periodicity = 3.  In a similar fashion, the midget in this deepzoom is 
associated with 256.  It took over 37 hours to compute on a 486DX50, at 
320x240 resolution and single pass mode (although the image is symmetric).

The thumbnail leads to a 1024x768x256 image of 195 kbytes. <br>
The maximum iteration count was set to 65535. <br> The calculation time to
completion was: <br>
2413 hrs, 22 min, 56.14 seconds. <br> The approximate location
of the image is: <br>
(x = -0.03905562293721000) <br>
(y = 0.58680201260632834) <br>
The magnification factor is 4.4x10^58 <br clear=all>

Dewey Odhner <i> dewey@mipg.upenn.edu </i> started this fractal and posted 
the partial image on the net when it was 2/3 completed after 
expending approximately 2343 hours of calculation time on a 486/33 computer. 
Charles Crocker <i> chasc@ccsnet.com </i> picked up the image and finished it 
in about 70 hrs on a Pentium 90 system and sent it on to me. This is about
a factor of 20 increase in performance. Not insignificant! It turns a 
calculation that was going to take hundreds of days into something tolerable.
<p> Both Charles and I were a little curious as to how Dewey found this
minibrot. When calculation times are this long, random zooming is no
longer a workable method. He must have some technique for isolating the buds.
I queried him on this and here is his reply:
<blockquote>
&quot;
I found the spidrweb minibrot by looking at areas around larger minibrots
and learning to recognize where they occur, what the areas tend to look like
as you look on smaller buds and closer to the tip of the bud.  I tried to
find the largest minibrot within that distance of the bud tip.
&quot;
