<h1>  A WORD ABOUT THE AUTHORS</h1>
<HR>
<p>
  Fractint is the result of a synergy between the main authors, many
  contributors, and published sources.  All four of the main authors have
  had a hand in many aspects of the code.  However, each author has
  certain areas of greater contribution and creativity.  Since there is
  not room in the credits screen for the contributions of the main
  authors, we list these here to facilitate those who would like to
  communicate with us on particular subjects.
<p>
<h2>
  Main Authors of Version 19.
</h2>
<p>
  <h3>BERT TYLER </h3> is the original author of Fractint.  
He wrote the &quot;blindingly
fast&quot; 386-specific 32 bit integer math code and the original video mode
logic. Bert made Stone Soup possible, and provides a sense of direction
when we need it. His forte is writing fast 80x86 assembler, his
knowledge of a variety of video hardware, and his skill at hacking up
the code we send him!
<p>

  Bert has a BA in mathematics from Cornell University.  He has been in
  programming since he got a job at the computer center in his sophomore
  year at college - in other words, he hasn't done an honest day's work in
  his life.  He has been known to pass himself off as a PC expert, a UNIX
  expert, a statistician, and even a financial modeling expert.  He is
  currently masquerading as an independent PC consultant, supporting the
  PC-to-Mainframe communications environment at NIH.  If you sent mail
  from the Internet to an NIH staffer on his 3+Mail system, it was
  probably Bert's code that mangled it during the Internet-to-3+Mail
  conversion.  He also claims to support the MS-Kermit environment at NIH.
  Fractint is Bert's first effort at building a graphics program.
<p>

  <h3>TIM WEGNER </h3> contributed the original implementation of palette 
animation, and is responsible for most of the 3D mechanisms.  He provided the
main outlines of the &quot;StandardFractal&quot; engine and data structures, and is
accused by his cohorts of being &quot;obsessed with options&quot;. One of Tim's main
interests is the use of four dimensional algebras to produce fractals.  Tim
served as team coordinator for version 19, and integrated Wes Loewer's
arbitrary precision library into Fractint.

<p>
  Tim has BA and MA degrees in mathematics from Carleton College and the
  University of California Berkeley.  He worked for 7 years overseas as a
  volunteer, doing things like working with Egyptian villagers building
  water systems. Since returning to the US in 1982, he has written shuttle
  navigation software, a software support environment prototype, and
  supported strategic information planning, all at NASA's Johnson Space
  Center. After a two-year stint at full-time writing, he's back at NASA
  developing shuttle navigation software.<p>

<h3>JONATHAN OSUCH </h3> started throwing pebbles into the soup around version
15.0 with a method for simulating an if-then-else structure using the formula
parser.  He has contributed the fn||fn fractal types, the built-
in bailout tests, the increase in both the maximum iteration count and bailout
value, and bug fixes too numerous to count. Jonathan worked closely with Robin
Bussell to implement Robin's browser mechanism in Fractint.
<p>

Jonathan has a B.S. in Physics from the University of Dubuque and a B.S. in
Computer Science from Mount Mercy College, both in Iowa.  He is currently
working as a consultant in the nuclear power industry.
<p>

<h3>WES LOEWER </h3> first got his foot in the Stone Soup door by writing fast
floating point assembler routines for Mandelbrot, Julia, and Lyapunov
fractals.  He also rewrote the boundary trace algorithms and added the
frothybasin fractal.  His most significant contribution is the addition of the
arbitrary precision library which allows Fractint to perform incredibly deep
zooms.
<p>

Wes has a B.S. in Physics from Wheaton College in Illinois.  He also holds an
M.S. in Physics and an M.Ed. in Education from Texas A&ampM University.  Wes
teaches physics and math at McCullough High School in The Woodlands, Texas
where his pupils inspire him to keep that sense of amazement that students get
when they understand a physical or mathematical principle for the first time. 
Since he uses Fractint to help teach certain mathematical principles, he's one
of the few folks who actually gets to use Fractint on the job.  Besides his
involvement with Fractint, Wes is the author of WL-Plot, an equation graphing
program, and MatCalc, a matrix calculator program.
