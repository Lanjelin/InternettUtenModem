<h1>Introduction to Fractint</h1>
 
<p>
  FRACTINT plots and manipulates images of &quot;objects&quot; -- actually, sets of
  mathematical points -- that have fractal dimension.  See 
  <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS23.HTM#2358" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/fractal_history.html">
  Fractals and the PC </a> for some historical and mathematical background on
  fractal geometry, a discipline named and popularized by mathematician
  Benoit Mandelbrot. For now, these sets of points have three important
  properties:
<ul>
<li>
  1) They are generated by relatively simple calculations repeated over
  and over, feeding the results of each step back into the next --
  something computers can do very rapidly.

<li>
  2) They are, quite literally, infinitely complex: they reveal more and
  more detail without limit as you plot smaller and smaller areas.
  Fractint lets you &quot;zoom in&quot; by positioning a small box and hitting
 &quot;Enter&quot;to redraw the boxed area at full-screen size; its maximum linear
  &quot;magnification&quot; is over a trillionfold.

<li>
  3) They can be astonishingly beautiful, especially using PC color
  displays' ability to assign colors to selected points, and (with VGA
  displays or EGA in 640x350x16 mode) to &quot;animate&quot; the images by quickly
  shifting those color assignments.

</ul>
<p>
  For a demonstration of some of Fractint's features, run the
  demonstration file included with this release (DEMO.BAT) by typing
  &quot;demo&quot; at the DOS prompt. You can stop the demonstration at any time by
  pressing &quot;Esc&quot;.
<p>
  The name FRACTINT was chosen because the program generates many of its
  images using INTeger math, rather than the floating point calculations
  used by most such programs. That means that you don't need a math co-
  processor chip (aka floating point unit or FPU), although for a few
  fractal types where floating point math is faster, the program
  recognizes and automatically uses an 80x87 chip if it's present. It's
  even faster on systems using Intel's 80386 and 80486 microprocessors,
  where the integer math can be executed in their native 32-bit mode.
<p>
  Fractint works with many adapters and graphics modes from CGA to the
  1024x768, 256-color XGA mode. Even &quot;larger&quot; images, up to 2048x2048x256,
  can be plotted to expanded memory, extended memory, or disk: this
  bypasses the screen and allows you to create images with higher
  resolution than your current display can handle, and to run in
  &quot;background&quot; under multi-tasking control programs such as DESQview and
  Windows 3.
<p>
  Fractint is an experiment in collaboration. Many volunteers have joined
  Bert Tyler, the program's first author, in improving successive
  versions.  Through electronic mail messages, CompuServe's GO GRAPHICS
  forums, new versions are hacked out and debugged a little at a time.
  Fractint was born fast, and none of us has seen any other fractal
  plotter close to the present version for speed, versatility, and all-
  around wonderfulness. (If you have, tell us so we can steal somebody
  else's ideas instead of each other's.)  See
