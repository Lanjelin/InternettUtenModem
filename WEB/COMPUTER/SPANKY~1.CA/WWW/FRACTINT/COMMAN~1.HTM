<li>
<b>
Getting Started
</b>
<p>
  To start the program, enter FRACTINT at the DOS prompt. The program
  displays an initial 'credits' screen. If Fractint doesn't start
  properly, please see 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2446" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/problems.html">
Common Problems</a>

<p>
  Hitting <b>[Enter]</b> gets you from the initial screen to the main 
menu. You can select options from the menu by moving the highlight with the
cursor arrow keys and pressing <b>[Enter],</b> or you can enter commands
directly.

<p>
  As soon as you select a video mode, Fractint begins drawing an image -
  the 'full' Mandelbrot set if you haven't selected another fractal type.

  For a quick start, after starting Fractint try one of the following:
<pre>
    If you have MCGA, VGA, or better:  [F3]
    If you have EGA:                   [F9]
    If you have CGA:                   [F5]
    Otherwise, monochrome:             [F6]
</pre>
<p>
  After the initial Mandelbrot image has been displayed, try zooming into
  it (see Zoom Box Commands) and color cycling (see Color Cycling
  Commands).  Once you're comfortable with these basics, start
  exploring other functions from the main menu.

<p>
  Help is available from the menu and at most other points in Fractint by
  pressing the <b>[F1]</b> key.

<p>
  AT ANY TIME, you can hit a command key to select a function. You do not
  need to wait for a calculation to finish, nor do you have to return to
  the main menu.

<p>
  When entering commands, note that for the 'typewriter' keys, upper and
  lower case are equivalent, e.g. <b>[B]</b> and <b>[b]</b> 
have the same result.

<p>
  Many commands and parameters can be passed to FRACTINT as command-line
  arguments or read from a configuration file; see 'Command Line
  Parameters, Parameter Files, Batch Mode' for details.

<a name="plotting_anchor">
Plotting Commands</a>
</b>
<p>
  Function keys &amp various combinations are used to select a video mode and
  redraw the screen.  For a quick start try one of the following:
<pre>
    If you have MCGA, VGA, or better:  [F3]
    If you have EGA:                   [F9]
    If you have CGA:                   [F5]
    Otherwise, monochrome:             [F6]
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<b>
  [F1]
</b>
<p>
  Display a help screen. The function keys available in help mode are
  displayed at the bottom of the help screen.
<p>
<li>
<b>
  [M] or [Esc]
</b>
  Return from a displayed image to the main menu.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Esc]
</b>
  From the main menu, <b>[Esc]</b> is used to exit from Fractint.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Delete]
</b>
  Same as choosing 'select video mode' from the main menu.  Goes to the
  'select video mode' screen.  See 
<a href="#video_key_anchor">
Video Mode Function Keys</a>.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [h]
</b>
  Redraw the previous image in the circular history buffer, revisiting
  fractals you previously generated this session in reverse order.
  Fractint saves the last ten images worth of information including
  fractal type, coordinates, colors, and all options. Image information is
  saved only when some item changes. After ten images the circular buffer
  wraps around and earlier information is overwritten. You can set image
  capacity of the history feature using the maxhistory=[nnn] command.
  About 1200 bytes of memory is required for each image slot.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Ctrl-h]
</b>
  Redraw the next image in the circular history buffer. Use this to return
  to images you passed by when using <b>[h]</b>.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Tab]
</b>
  Display the current fractal type, parameters, video mode, screen or (if
  displayed) zoom-box coordinates, maximum iteration count, and other
  information useful in keeping track of where you are.  The Tab function
  is non-destructive - if you press it while in the midst of generating an
  image, you will continue generating it when you return.  The Tab
  function tells you if your image is still being generated or has
  finished - a handy feature for those overnight, 1024x768 resolution
  fractal images.  If the image is incomplete, it also tells you whether
  it can be interrupted and resumed.  (Any function other than <b>[Tab]
</b> and  <b>[F1]</b> counts as an 'interrupt'.)

<p>
  The Tab screen also includes a pixel-counting function, which will count
  the number of pixels colored in the inside color.  This gives an
  estimate of the area of the fractal.  Note that the inside color must be
  different from the outside color(s) for this to work; inside=0 is a good
  choice.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [T]
</b>
  Select a fractal type. Move the cursor to your choice (or type the first
  few letters of its name) and hit <b>[Enter]</b>. Next you will be 
prompted for any parameters used by the selected type - hit <b>[Enter]</b>
for the defaults.

  use is shown on the <b>[Tab]</b> status screen.  The floating point 
option can also be turned on and off using the 'X' options screen.  If you 
have a non-Intel floating point chip which supports the full 387 instruction
  set, see the 'FPU=' command in

<a name="zoom_box_anchor">
Zoom box Commands
</a>
</b>
<p>
  Zoom Box functions can be invoked while an image is being generated or
  when it has been completely drawn.  Zooming is supported for most
  fractal types, but not all.

<p>
  The general approach to using the zoom box is:  Frame an area using the
  keys described below, then <b>[Enter]</b> to expand what's in the 
frame to fill the whole screen (zoom in); or <b>[Ctrl] [Enter]</b> 
to shrink the current image into the framed area (zoom out). With a mouse, 
double-click the left button to zoom in, double click the right button to
 zoom out.

<ul>
<li>
<b>
  [Page Up], [Page Down]
</b>
<p>
  Use <b>[Page Up]</b> to initially bring up the zoom box. It starts 
at full screen size. Subsequent use of these keys makes the zoom box smaller or
larger.  Using <b>[Page Down]</b> to enlarge the zoom box when it is 
already at maximum size removes the zoom box from the display. Moving the mouse
away from you or toward you while holding the left button down performs the
same functions as these keys.

<p>
  Using the cursor 'arrow' keys or moving the mouse without holding any
  buttons down, moves the zoom box.

<p>
  Holding <b>[Ctrl]</b> while pressing cursor 'arrow' keys moves the 
box 5 times faster.  (This only works with enhanced keyboards.)

<p>
  Panning: If you move a fullsize zoombox and don't change anything else
  before performing the zoom, Fractint just moves what's already on the
  screen and then fills in the new edges, to reduce drawing time. This
  feature applies to most fractal types but not all.  A side effect is
  that while an image is incomplete, a full size zoom box moves in steps
  larger than one pixel.  Fractint keeps the box on multiple pixel
  boundaries, to make panning possible.  As a multi-pass (e.g. solid
  guessing) image approaches completion, the zoom box can move in smaller
  increments.

<p>
  In addition to resizing the zoom box and moving it around, you can do
  some rather warped things with it.  If you're a new Fractint user, we
  recommend skipping the rest of the zoom box functions for now and coming
  back to them when you're comfortable with the basic zoom box functions.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Ctrl] [Keypad-], [Ctrl] [Keypad+]
</b>
  Holding <b>[Ctrl]</b> and pressing the numeric keypad's + or - keys 
rotates the zoom box. Moving the mouse left or right while holding the right 
button down performs the same function.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Ctrl] [Page Up], [Ctrl] [Page Down]
</b>
  These commands change the zoom box's 'aspect ratio', stretching or
  shrinking it vertically. Moving the mouse away from you or toward you
  while holding both buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse)
  down performs the same function. There are no commands to directly
  stretch or shrink the zoom box horizontally - the same effect can be
  achieved by combining vertical stretching and resizing.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Ctrl] [Home], [Ctrl] [End]
</b>
  These commands 'skew' the zoom box, moving the top and bottom edges in
  opposite directions. Moving the mouse left or right while holding both
  buttons (or the middle button on a 3-button mouse) down performs the
  same function. There are no commands to directly skew the left and right
  edges - the same effect can be achieved by using these functions
  combined with rotation.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Ctrl] [Insert], [Ctrl] [Delete]
</b>
  These commands change the zoom box color. This is useful when you're
  having trouble seeing the zoom box against the colors around it. Moving
  the mouse away from you or toward you while holding the right button
  down performs the same function.

<p>
  You may find it difficult to figure out what combination of size,
  position rotation, stretch, and skew to use to get a particular result.
  (We do.)

<p>
  A good way to get a feel for all these functions is to play with the
  Gingerbreadman fractal type. Gingerbreadman's shape makes it easy to see
  what you're doing to him. A warning though: Gingerbreadman will run
  forever, he's never quite done! So, pre-empt with your next zoom when
  he's baked enough.

<p>
  If you accidentally change your zoom box shape or rotate and forget
  which way is up, just use <b>[PageDown] </b>to make it bigger until it
  disappears, then <b>[PageUp]</b> to get a fresh one.  With a mouse, 
after removing the old zoom box from the display release and re-press the left
button for a fresh one.

<p>
  If your screen does not have a 4:3 'aspect ratio' (i.e. if the visible
  display area on it is not 1.333 times as wide as it is high), rotating
  and zooming will have some odd effects - angles will change, including
  the zoom box's shape itself, circles (if you are so lucky as to see any
  with a non-standard aspect ratio) become non-circular, and so on. The
  vast majority of PC screens *do* have a 4:3 aspect ratio.

<p>
  Zooming is not implemented for the plasma and diffusion fractal types,
  nor for overlayed and 3D images. A few fractal types support zooming but
  do not support rotation and skewing - nothing happens when you try it.
</ul>

Color Cycling Commands</a>
</b>
<p>
  Color-cycling mode is entered with the <b>[c], [+],</b> or <b>[-]</b>
 keys from an image, or with the <b>[c]</b> key from Palette-Editing mode.

<p>
  The color-cycling commands are available ONLY for VGA adapters and EGA
  adapters in 640x350x16 mode.  You can also enter color-cycling while
  using a disk-video mode, to load or save a palette - other functions are
  not supported in disk-video.

<p>
  Note that the colors available on an EGA adapter (16 colors at a time
  out of a palette of 64) are limited compared to those of VGA, super-VGA,
  and MCGA (16 or 256 colors at a time out of a palette of 262,144). So
  color-cycling in general looks a LOT better in the latter modes. Also,
  because of the EGA palette restrictions, some commands are not available
  with EGA adapters.

<p>
  Color cycling applies to the color numbers selected by the 'cyclerange='
  command line parameter (also changeable via the <b>[Y]</b> options 
screen and via the palette editor).  By default, color numbers 1 to 255
inclusive are cycled.  On some images you might want to set 'inside=0'
(<b>[X]</b> options or command line parameter) to exclude the 'lake' 
from color cycling.

<p>
  When you are in color-cycling mode, you will either see the screen
  colors cycling, or will see a white 'overscan' border when paused, as a
  reminder that you are still in this mode.  The keyboard commands
  available once you've entered color-cycling. are described below.

<ul>
<li>
<b>
  [F1]
</b>
<p>
  Bring up a HELP screen with commands specific to color cycling mode.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Esc]
</b>
  Leave color-cycling mode.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Home]
</b>
  Restore original palette.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [+] or [-]
</b>
  Begin cycling the palette by shifting each color to the next 'contour.'
  <b>[+]</b> cycles the colors in one direction, <b>[-]</b> in the
 other.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  <b>&lt</b> or <b>&gt</b>
</b>
  Force a color-cycling pause, disable random colorizing, and single-step
  through a one color-cycle.  For 'fine-tuning' your image colors.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  Cursor up/down
</b>
  Increase/decrease the cycling speed. High speeds may cause a harmless
  flicker at the top of the screen.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [F2] through [F10]
</b>
  Switches from simple rotation to color selection using randomly
  generated color bands of short (F2) to long (F10) duration.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [1] through [9]
</b>
  Causes the screen to be updated every <b>[n]</b> color cycles (the default is
  1).  Handy for slower computers.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Enter]
</b>
  Randomly selects a function key (F2 through F10) and then updates ALL
  the screen colors prior to displaying them for instant, random colors.
  Hit this over and over again (we do).

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Spacebar]
</b>
  Pause cycling with white overscan area. Cycling restarts with any
  command key (including another spacebar).

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Shift] [F1] - [F10]
</b>
  Pause cycling and reset the palette to a preset two color 'straight'
  assignment, such as a spread from black to white. (Not for EGA)

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Ctrl] [F1]-[F10]
</b>
  Pause &amp set a 2-color cyclical assignment, e.g. red-&gt yellow-&gt red (not

</b>
  Pause &amp set a 3-color cyclical assignment, e.g. green-&gt white-&gt blue 
(not EGA).

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [R], [G], [B]
</b>
  Pause and increase the red, green, or blue component of all colors by a
  small amount (not for EGA). Note the case distinction of this vs:

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [r], [g], [b]
</b>
  Pause and decrease the red, green, or blue component of all colors by a
  small amount (not for EGA).

Palette Editing Commands</a>
</b>
<p>
  Palette-editing mode provides a number of tools for modifying the colors
  in an image.  It can be used only with MCGA or higher adapters, and only
  with 16 or 256 color video modes.  Many thanks to Ethan Nagel for
  creating the palette editor.

<p>
  Use the <b>[E]</b> key to enter palette-editing mode from a displayed
 image or from the main menu.

<p>
  When this mode is entered, an empty palette frame is displayed. You can
  use the cursor keys to position the frame outline, and <b>[Pageup]</b>
 and <b>[Pagedn]</b> to change its size.  (The upper and lower limits on
the  size depend on the current video mode.)  When the frame is positioned
where you want it, hit Enter to display the current palette in the frame.

<p>
  Note that the palette frame shows R(ed) G(reen) and B(lue) values for
  two color registers at the top.  The active color register has a solid
  frame, the inactive register's frame is dotted.  Within the active
  register, the active color component is framed.

<p>

With a video mode of 640x400 or higher, a status area appears between
the two color registers.  This status area shows:
<p>
<pre>

      nnn  = color numbeber at the cursor location
      A    = Auto mode
      X, Y = exclusion modes
      F    = freesyle mode
      T    = stripe mode is waiting for #
</pre>
<p>
  Using the commands described below, you can assign particular colors to
  the registers and manipulate them.  Note that at any given time there
  are two colors 'X'd - these are pre-empted by the editor to display the
  palette frame. They can be edited but the results won't be visible. You
  can change which two colors are borrowed ('X'd out) by using the 
<b>[v]</b> command.

<p>
  Once the palette frame is displayed and filled in, the following
  commands are available:

<ul>
<li>
<b>
  [F1]
</b>
<p>
  Bring up a HELP screen with commands specific to palette-editing mode.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Esc]
</b>
  Leave palette-editing mode

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [H]
</b>
  Hide the palette frame to see full image; the cross-hair remains visible
  and all functions remain enabled; hit <b>[H]</b> again to restore the 
palette display.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  Cursor keys
</b>
  Move the cross-hair cursor around. In 'auto' mode (the default) the
  color under the center of the cross-hair is automatically assigned to
  the active color register. Control-Cursor keys move the cross-hair
  faster. A mouse can also be used to move around.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [R] [G] [B]
</b>
  Select the Red, Green, or Blue component of the active color register
  for subsequent commands

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Insert] [Delete]
</b>
  Select previous or next color component in active register

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [+] [-]
</b>
  Increase or decrease the active color component value by 1  Numeric
  keypad (gray) + and - keys do the same.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Pageup] [Pagedn]
</b>
  Increase or decrease the active color component value by 5; Moving the
  mouse up/down with left button held is the same

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
</b>
  Set the active color component's value to 0 10 20 ... 60

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Space]
</b>
  Select the other color register as the active one.  In the default
  'auto' mode this results in the now-inactive register being set to
  remember the color under the cursor, and the now-active register
  changing from whatever it had previously remembered to now follow the
  color.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [,] [.]
</b>
  Rotate the palette one step.  By default colors 1 through 255 inclusive
  are rotated.  This range can be over-ridden with the 'cyclerange'
  parameter, the <b>[Y]</b> options screen, or the <b>[O]</b>
 command described below.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  '&lt' or '&gt'
</b>
  Rotate the palette continuously (until next keystroke)

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [O]
</b>
  Set the color cycling range to the range of colors currently defined by
  the color registers.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [C]
</b>
  Enter Color-Cycling Mode.  When you invoke color-cycling from here, it
  will subsequently return to palette-editing when you <b>[Esc]</b> from 
it.  See
<a href="#cycling_anchor"> 
Color Cycling Commands 
</a>

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [=]
</b>
  Create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the colors selected by
  the two color registers.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [M]
</b>
  Specify a gamma value for the shading created by <b>[=]</b>.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [D]
</b>
  Duplicate the inactive color register's values to the active color
  register.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [T]
</b>
  Stripe-shade - create a smoothly shaded range of colors between the two
  color registers, setting only every Nth register.  After hitting 
<b>[T]</b>, hit a numeric key from 2 to 9 to specify N.  For example, 
if you press <b>[T] [3]</b>, smooth shading is done between the 
two color registers, affecting only every 3rd color between them.  The other 
colors between them remain unchanged.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [W]
</b>
  Convert current palette to gray-scale.  (If the <b>[X]</b> or 
<b>[Y] </b>exclude
  ranges described later are in force, only the active range of colors is
  converted to gray-scale.)

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Shift-F2] ... [Shift-F9]
</b>
  Store the current palette in a temporary save area associated with the
  function key.  The temporary save palettes are useful for quickly
  comparing different palettes or the effect of some changes - see next
  command.  The temporary palettes are only remembered until you exit from
  palette-editing mode.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [F2] ... [F9]
</b>
  Restore the palette from a temporary save area.  If you haven't
  previously saved a palette for the function key, you'll get a simple
  grey scale.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [L]
</b>
  Pause and load an external color map (.MAP file).  See 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2412" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/palette_maps.html">
Palette Maps </a>.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [S]
</b>
  Pause, prompt for a filename, and save the current palette to the named
  file (.MAP assumed).  See 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2412" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/palette_maps.html">
Palette Maps </a>.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [I]
</b>
  Invert frame colors.  With some colors the palette is easier to see when
  the frame colors are interchanged.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [\]
</b>
  Move or resize the palette frame.  The frame outline is drawn - it can
  then be repositioned and sized with the cursor keys, <b>[Pageup]</b> and
  <b>[Pagedn]</b>, just as was done when first entering palette-editing 
mode.  Hit Enter when done moving/sizing.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [V]
</b>
  Use the colors currently selected by the two color registers for the
  palette editor's frame.  When palette editing mode is entered, the last
  two colors are 'X'd out for use by the palette editor; this command can
  be used to replace the default with two other color numbers.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [A]
</b>
  Toggle 'auto' mode on or off.  When on (the default), the active color
  register follows the cursor; when off, <b>[Enter]</b> must be pressed 
to set the active register to the color under the cursor.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Enter]
</b>
  Only useful when 'auto' is off, as described above; double clicking the
  left mouse button is the same as Enter.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [X]
</b>
  Toggle 'exclude' mode on or off - when toggled on, only those image
  pixels which match the active color are displayed.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [Y]
</b>
  Toggle 'exclude' range on or off - similar to <b>[X]</b>, but all pixels
  matching colors in the range of the two color registers are displayed.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [N]
</b>
  Make a negative color palette - will convert only current color if in
  <b>[x]</b> mode or range between editors in <b>[y]</b> mode or entire 
palette if in 'normal' mode.
<li>
<pre>
  [!]
  [@]
  [#]
</pre>
  Swap R [-] G, G [-] B, and R [-] B columns. 
These keys are shifted 1, 2, and
  3, which you may find easier to remember.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [U]
</b>
  Undoes the last palette editor command.  Will undo all the way to the
  beginning of the current session.
  <b>[E]</b> Redoes the undone palette editor commands.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [F]
</b>
  Toggles 'Freestyle mode' on and off (Freestyle mode changes a range of
  palette values smoothly from a center value outward).  With your cursor
  inside the palette box, press the <b>[F]</b> key to enter Freestyle 
mode. A default range of colors will be selected for you centered at the cursor
  (the ends of the color range are noted by putting dashed lines around
  the corresponding palette values). While in Freestyle mode:

<p>
   Moving the mouse changes the location of the range of colors that are
   affected.

<p>
<li>
<b>
   Control-Insert/Delete </b>
or the shifted-right-mouse-button changes the
   size of the affected palette range.

<p>
   The normal color editing keys (R,G,B,1-6, etc) set the central color of
   the affected palette range.
   Pressing ENTER or double-clicking the left mouse button makes the
   palette changes permanent (if you don't perform this step, any palette
   changes disappear when you press the <b>[F]</b> key again to exit 
freestyle mode).

saves the current image to disk. All parameters required to recreate
  the image are saved with it. Progress is marked by colored lines moving
  down the screen's edges.

<p>
  The default filename for the first image saved after starting Fractint
  is FRACT001.GIF;  subsequent saves in the same session are automatically
  incremented 002, 003... Use the 'savename=' parameter or <b>[X]</b>
 options  screen to change the name. By default, files left over from previous
  sessions are not overwritten - the first unused FRACTnnn name is used.
  Use the 'overwrite=yes' parameter or <b>[X]</b> options screen) to 
overwrite existing files.

<p>
  A save operation can be interrupted by pressing any key. If you
  interrupt, you'll be asked whether to keep or discard the partial file.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [R] </b>
restores an image previously saved with <b>[S]</b>, or an ordinary GIF
  file.  After pressing <b>[R]</b> you are shown the file names in the 
current directory which match the current file mask. To select a file to
  restore, move the cursor to it (or type the first few letters of its
  name) and press <b>[Enter]</b>.

<p>
  Directories are shown in the file list with a '\' at the end of the
  name.  When you select a directory, the contents of that directory are
  shown. Or, you can type the name of a different directory (and
  optionally a different drive) and press <b>[Enter]</b> for a new 
display. You can also type a mask such as '*.XYZ' and press 
<b>[Enter]</b> to display files whose name ends with the matching suffix 
(XYZ).

<p>
  You can use <b>[F6]</b> to switch directories to the default fractint 
directoryor to your own directory which is specified through the DOS
environment variable 'FRACTDIR'.

<p>
  Once you have selected a file to restore, a summary description of the
  file is shown, with a video mode selection list. Usually you can just
  press <b>[Enter]</b>to go past this screen and load the image. Other
choices available at this point are:
<dl>
<dt>
    <b>Cursor keys:</b>
<dd> select a different video mode

    <b>[Tab] :</b>
<dd>

<dt>
    <b>[F1] :</b> 
<dd>for help about the 'err' column in displayed video modes
  If you restore a file into a video mode which does not have the same
  pixel dimensions as the file, Fractint will make some adjustments:  The
  view window parameters (see <b>[V]</b>command) will automatically be set
to an appropriate size, and if the image is larger than the screen dimensions,
it will be reduced by using only every Nth pixel during the restore.

Parameter Save/Restore Commands
</a>
</b>
<p>
  Parameter files can be used to save/restore all options and settings
  required to recreate particular images.  The parameters required to
  describe an image require very little disk space, especially compared
  with saving the image itself.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
  [@] or [2]
</b>

<p>
  The <b>[@]</b> or <b>[2]</b> command loads a set of parameters 
describing an image.
  (Actually, it can also be used to set non-image parameters such as
  SOUND, but at this point we're interested in images. Other uses of
  parameter files are discussed in 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2430" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/param_files.html">
'Parameter Files and the <b>[@]</b> Command'</a>

<p>
  When you hit <b>[@]</b> or <b>[2]</b>, Fractint displays the
 names of the entries in the currently selected parameter file.  The default
parameter file, FRACTINT.PAR, is included with the Fractint release and
contains parameters for some sample images.

<p>
  After pressing <b>[@]</b> or <b>[2]</b>, highlight an entry and
press <b>[Enter]</b> to load it, or press <b>[F6]</b> to change 
to another parameter file.

<p>
  Note that parameter file entries specify all calculation related
  parameters, but do not specify things like the video mode - the image
  will be plotted in your currently selected mode.

<p>
<li>
<b>
  [B]
</b>

<p>
  The <b>[B]</b>command saves the parameters required to describe the
currently displayed image, which can subsequently be used with the 
<b>[@]</b> or <b>[2]</b> command to recreate it.

<p>
  After you press <b>[B]</b>, Fractint prompts for:

<p>
    Parameter file:  The name of the file to store the parameters in.  You
    should use some name like 'myimages' instead of fractint.par, so that
    your images are kept separate from the ones released with new versions
    of Fractint. You can use the PARMFILE= command in SSTOOLS.INI to set
    the default parameter file name to 'myimages' or whatever.  (See
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2429" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/command_line.html">

'parmfile=' in 'File Parameters' </a>.)

<p>
    Name:  The name you want to assign to the entry, to be displayed when
    the <b>[@]</b> or <b>[2]</b> command is used.

<p>
    Main comment:  A comment to be shown beside the entry in the 
<b>[@]</b> command display.

<p>
    Second, Third, and Fourth comment:  Additional comments to store in
    the file with the entry. These comments go in the file only, and are
    not displayed by the <b>[@]</b> command. You can set these comments
	from the command line - 
<a href=
"../../../tppmsgs/msgs22.htm#2290" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/startup_params.html#comment_anchor">
see Comment= Command.
</a>

<p>
    Record colors?:  Whether color information should be included in the
    entry. Usually the default value displayed by Fractint is what you
    want.  Allowed values are:
<pre>
&quot;no&quot; - Don't record colors.  &quot;@mapfilename&quot; 
	When these parameters are used, load colors from the
	named color map file. This is the default if you are currently
	using colors from a color map file.
&quot;yes&quot; - Record the colors in detail. This is the default when you've
	changed the display colors by using the palette editor or by color
	cycling. The only reason that this isn't what Fractint always does
	for the [B] command is that color information can be bulky - up to
	nearly 1K of disk space. That may not sound like much, but can add
	up when you consider the thousands of wonderful images you may find
	you just *have* to record...  Smooth-shaded ranges of colors are
	compressed so if that's used a lot in an image the color
	information won't be as bulky.
</pre>
<p>
    # of colors:  This only matters if 'Record colors?' is set to 'yes'.
    It specifies the number of colors to record. Recording less colors
    will take less space. Usually the default value displayed by Fractint
    is what you want. You might want to increase it in some cases, e.g. if
    you are using a 256 color mode with maxiter 150, and have used the
    palette editor to set all 256 possible colors for use with color
    cycling, then you'll want to set the '# of colors' to 256.

<p>
    See the 
<a href=
"../../../tppmsgs/msgs22.htm#2294" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/color_params.html#record_colors_anchor">
Recordcolors </a> command, which controls when mapfiles
    are used and when compressed colors are written to PAR files.

<p>
    At the bottom of the input screen are inputs for Fractint's 'pieces'
    divide-and-conquer feature. You can create multiple PAR entries that
    break an image up into pieces so that you can generate the image
    pieces one by one. There are two reasons for doing this. The first is
    in case the fractal is very slow, and you want to generate parts of
    the image at the same time on several computers. The second is that
    you might want to make an image greater than 2048 x 2048. The
    parameters for this feature are:
<pre>
       X Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the x direction
       Y Multiples - How many divisions of final image in the y direction
       Video mode  - Fractint video mode for each piece (e.g. 'F3')
</pre>
<p>
    The last item defaults to the current video mode. If either X
    Multiples or Y Multiples are greater than 1, then multiple numbered
    PAR entries for the pieces are added to the PAR file, and a
    MAKEMIG.BAT file is created that builds all of the component pieces
    and then stitches them together into a 'multi-image' GIF.  The current
    limitations of the 'divide and conquer' algorithm are 36 or fewer X
    and Y multiples (so you are limited to 'only' 36x36=1296 component
    images), and a final resolution limit in both the X and Y directions
    of 65,535 (a limitation of 'only' four billion pixels or so).

<p>
    The final image generated by MAKEMIG is a 'multi-image' GIF file
    called FRACTMIG.GIF.  In case you have other software that can't
    handle multi-image GIF files, MAKEMIG includes a final (but commented
    out) call to SIMPLGIF, a companion program that reads a GIF file that
    may contain little tricks like multiple images and creates a simple
    GIF from it.  Fair warning: SIMPLGIF needs room to build a composite
    image while it works, and it does that using a temporary disk file
    equal to the size of the final image - and a 64Kx64K GIF image
    requires a 4GB temporary disk file!

  Fractint command keys can be loosely grouped as:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
   Keys which suspend calculation of the current image (if one is being
     calculated) and automatically resume after the function.  
<b>[Tab]</b> (display status information) and <b>[F1]</b>
 (display help), are the only keys in this group.

<p>
<li>
     Keys which automatically trigger calculation of a new image.
     Examples:  selecting a video mode (e.g. <b>[F3]</b>);  selecting 
a fractaltype using <b>[T]</b>;  using the <b>[X]</b> screen to 
change an option such as maximum iterations.

<p>
<li>
   Keys which do something, then wait for you to indicate what to do
     next.  Examples:  <b>[M]</b> to go to main menu;  <b> [C]</b>
 to enter color cycling
     mode;  <b>[PageUp]</b> to bring up a zoom box.  After using a 
command in this group, calculation automatically resumes when you return from
     the function (e.g. <b>[Esc]</b> from color cycling, 
<b>[PageDn]</b> to clear zoom box).  There are a few fractal types 
which cannot resume calculation, they are noted below.  Note that after 
saving an image with <b>[S]</b>, you must press <b>[Enter]</b>
 to clear the 'saved' message from the screen and resume.

</ul>
<p>
  An image which is <b>[S]</b>aved before it completes can later be 
<b>[R]</b>estored and continued. The calculation is automatically 
resumed when you restore such an image.

<p>
  When a slow fractal type resumes after an interruption in the third
  category above, there may be a lag while nothing visible happens.  This
  is because most cases of resume restart at the beginning of a screen
  line.  If unsure, you can check whether calculation has resumed with the
  <b>[Tab]</b> key.

<p>
  The following fractal types cannot (currently) be resumed: plasma, 3d
  transformations, julibrot, and 3d orbital types like lorenz3d.  To check
  whether resuming an image is possible, use the <b>[Tab]</b> key 
while it is calculating.  It is resumable unless there is a note under the
fractal type saying it is not.

Batch Mode </a> section discusses how to resume in batch mode.

<p>
  To <b>[R]</b>estore and resume a 'formula', 'lsystem', or 'ifs' type 
fractal your 'formulafile', 'lfile', or 'ifsfile' must contain the required
  name.

Orbits Window
</a>
</b>
<p>
  The <b>[O]</b> key turns on the Orbit mode.  In this mode a cursor 
appears overthe fractal. A window appears showing the orbit used in the
calculation of the color at the point where the cursor is. Move the cursor
around the fractal using the arrow keys or the mouse and watch the orbits
  change. Try entering the Orbits mode with View Windows (<b>[V]</b>) 
turned on.  The following keys take effect in Orbits mode.
<pre>
  [c]     Circle toggle - makes little circles with radii inversely
                proportional to the iteration. Press <b>[c]</b> again 
                to toggle back to point-by-point display of orbits.

  [l]     Line toggle - connects orbits with lines (can use 
                with <b>[c]</b>)

  [n]     Numbers toggle - shows complex coordinates and color number of
                the cursor on the screen. Press <b>[n] </b>again to 
                turn off numbers.

  [p]     Enter pixel coordinates directly

  [h]     Hide fractal toggle. Works only if View Windows is turned on
                and set for a small window (such as the default size.) Hides the
                fractal, allowing the orbit to take up the whole screen. Press
                <b>[h]</b> again to uncover the fractal.

  [s]     Saves the fractal, cursor, orbits, and numbers as they  appear
                on the screen.
  [&lt] or [,]  Zoom orbits image smaller

  [&gt] or [.]  Zoom orbits image larger

  [z]     Restore default zoom.

<b>
<a name="view_wind_anchor">
View Window
</a>
</b>
<p>
  The <b>[V]</b> command is used to set the view window parameters
described below.  These parameters can be used to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
   Define a small window on the screen which is to contain the generated
     images. Using a small window speeds up calculation time (there are
     fewer pixels to generate). You can use a small window to explore
     quickly, then turn the view window off to recalculate the image at
     full screen size.

<p>
<li>
    Generate an image with a different 'aspect ratio'; e.g. in a square
     window or in a tall skinny rectangle.
<p>
<li>
    View saved GIF images which have pixel dimensions different from any
     mode supported by your hardware. This use of view windows occurs
     automatically when you restore such an image.

</ul>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>
  'Preview display'
</b>
<dd>
<p>
  Set this to 'yes' to turn on view window, 'no' for full screen display.
  While this is 'no', the only view parameter which has any affect is
  'final media aspect ratio'. When a view window is being used, all other
  Fractint functions continue to operate normally - you can zoom, color-
  cycle, and all the rest.
<p>
<dt>
<b>
  'Reduction factor'
</b>
<dd>
<p>
  When an explicit size is not given, this determines the view window
  size, as a factor of the screen size.  E.g. a reduction factor of 2
  makes the window 1/2 as big as the screen in both dimensions.
<p>
<dt>
<b>
  'Final media aspect ratio'
</b>
<dd>
<p>
  This is the height of the final image you want, divided by the width.
  The default is 0.75 because standard PC monitors have a height:width
  ratio of 3:4. E.g. set this to 2.0 for an image twice as high as it is
  wide. The effect of this parameter is visible only when 'preview
  display' is enabled.
<p>
<dt>
<b>
  'Crop starting coordinates'
</b>
<dd>
<p>
  This parameter affects what happens when you change the aspect ratio. If
  set to 'no', then when you change aspect ratio, the prior image will be
  squeezed or stretched to fit into the new shape. If set to 'yes', the
  prior image is 'cropped' to avoid squeezing or stretching.
<p>
<dt>
<b>
  'Explicit size'
</b>
<dd>
<p>
  Setting these to non-zero values over-rides the 'reduction factor' with
  explicit sizes in pixels. If only the 'x pixels' size is specified, the
  'y pixels' size is calculated automatically based on x and the aspect
  ratio.
<p>
</dl>
<p>
  More about final aspect ratio:  If you want to produce a high quality
  hard-copy image which is say 8&quot; high by 5&quot; down, based on a vertical
  'slice' of an existing image, you could use a procedure like the
  following. You'll need some method of converting a GIF image to your
  final media (slide or whatever) - Fractint can only do the whole job
  with a PostScript printer, it does not preserve aspect ratio with other
  printers.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
    restore the existing image
<p>
<li>
    set view parameters: preview to yes, reduction to anything (say 2),
    aspect ratio to 1.6, and crop to yes
<p>
<li>
    zoom, rotate, whatever, till you get the desired final image
<p>
<li>
    set preview display back to no
<p>
<li>
    trigger final calculation in some high res disk video mode, using the
    appropriate video mode function key
<p>
<li>
    print directly to a PostScript printer, or save the result as a GIF
    file and use external utilities to convert to hard copy.
</ul>

Video Mode Function Keys
</a>
</b>
<p>
  Fractint supports *so* many video modes that we've given up trying to
  reserve a keyboard combination for each of them.

<p>
  Any supported video mode can be selected by going to the 'Select Video
  Mode' screen (from main menu or by using <b>[Delete]</b>), then using 
the cursor up and down arrow keys and/or <b>[PageUp]</b> and 
<b>[PageDown]</b> keys to highlight the desired mode, then pressing 
<b>[Enter]</b>.

<p>
  Up to 39 modes can be assigned to the keys <b> F2-F10, SF1-SF10
  [Shift] + [Fn]), CF1-CF10 ([Ctrl] + [Fn]), 
and AF1-AF10 ([Alt] + [Fn])</b>.  The
  modes assigned to function keys can be invoked directly by pressing the
  assigned key, without going to the video mode selection screen.

<p>
  30 key combinations can be reassigned:  <b>[F1]</b> to <b>[F10]
 </b> combined with any  of <b>[Shift], [Ctrl], or [Alt].</b>
  The video modes assigned to <b>[F2] </b> through
  <b>[F10]</b> can not be changed - these are assigned to the most 
common video modes, which might be used in demonstration files or batches.

<p>
  To reassign a function key to a mode you often use, go to the 'select
  video mode' screen, highlight the video mode, press the keypad (gray)
  <b>[+]</b> key, then press the desired function key or key 
combination.  The new key assignment will be remembered for future runs.

<p>
  To unassign a key (so that it doesn't invoke any video mode), highlight
  the mode currently selected by the key and press the keypad (gray) 
<b>[-]</b>
  key.

<p>
  A note about the 'select video modes' screen: the video modes which are
  displayed with a <b>[B]</b> suffix in the number of colors are modes which have
  no custom programming - they use the BIOS and are S-L-O-W ones.

Browse Commands
</a>
</b>
<p>
  The following keystrokes function while browsing an image:

<ul>
<li><b>[ARROW KEYS]</b>  Step through the outlines on the screen.
<li><b>  [ENTER]</b>   Selects the image to display.
<li><b>  [\],[h]</b>  Recalls the last image selected.
<li><b>  [D]</b>  Deletes the selected file.
<li><b>  [R]</b>  Renames the selected file.
<li><b>  [s]</b>  Saves the current image with the browser boxes displayed.
<li><b>  [ESC] , [l] </b>  Toggles the browse mode off.
<li><b>  [Ctrl-b]</b>  Brings up the 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs23.htm#2315" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/browser_mode.html"> 
Browser Parameters </a> screen.
<li><b>  [Ctrl-Ins/Del] </b>   Change the browser boxes color.
</ul>

<p>
  This is a 'visual directory', here is how it works...
  When <b>[L]</b> or <b>[l]</b> is pressed from a fractal display the current 
directory is searched for any saved files that are deeper zooms of the current
  image and their position shown on screen by a box (or crosshairs if the
  box would be too small). See also 
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs23.htm#2315" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/browser_mode.html">
Browser Parameters </a> for more
  on how this is done.

<p>
  One outline flashes, the selected outline can be changed by using the
  cursor keys.  At the moment the outlines are selected in the order that
  they appear in your directory, so don't worry if the flashing window
  jumps all over the place!
  When enter is pressed, the selected image is loaded. In this mode a
  stack of the last sixteen selected filenames is maintained and the <b>[\]</b>
  or <b>[h]</b> key pops and loads the last image you were looking at.  Using
  this it is possible to set up sequences of images that allow easy
  exploration of your favorite fractal without having to wait for recalc
  once the level of zoom gets too high, great for demos! (also useful for
  keeping track of just exactly where fract532.gif came from :-) )

<p>
  You can also use this facility to tidy up your disk: by typing UPPER
  CASE <b>[D]</b> when a file is selected the browser will delete the file for
  you, after making sure that you really mean it, you must reply to the
  'are you sure' prompts with an UPPER CASE <b>[Y</b> and nothing else,
  otherwise the command is ignored. Just to make absolutely sure you don't
  accidentally wipe out the fruits of many hours of cpu time the default
  setting is to have the browser prompt you twice, you can disable the
  second prompt within the parameters screen, however, if you're feeling
  overconfident :-).

<p>
  To complement the Delete function there is a rename function, use the
  UPPER CASE <b>[R]</b> key for this. You need to enter the FULL new file name,
  no .GIF is implied.

<p>
  It is possible to save the current image along with all of the displayed
  boxes indicating subimages by pressing the <b>[s]</b> key.  This exits the
  browse mode to save the image and the boxes become a permanent part of
  the image.  Currently, the screen image ends up with stray dots colored
  after it is saved.

<p>
  Esc backs out of image selecting mode.

<p>
  The browser can now use expanded memory or extended memory.  If you have
  more than 4 MB of expanded/extended memory available, you can use
  either.  If you don't have 4 MB of expanded/extended memory available,
  use expanded memory as it will allocate as much as possible.  The
  extended memory support will silently fail and default to the use of far
  memory if 4 MB of extended memory is not available.

<p>
  Here's a tip on how to zoom out beyond your starting point when
  browsing: Suppose you restore a fractal deeply-zoomed down in a
  directory of related zoomed images, and then bring up the browser.  How
  do you zoom out? You can't use &quot;\&quot; because you started with 
the zoomed image, and there is no browser command to detect the next outer 
image.
  What you can do is exit the browser, press PgUp until the zoom box won't
  get any smaller, zoom out with Ctrl-Enter, and before any image starts
  to develop, call up the browser again, locate your zoomed image that you
  started with, and see if there is another image that contains it - if
  so, restore it with the browser.You can also use a view window <b>[v]</b>
  to load the first image, and then use the browser.

                                       
<p>
  POSSIBLE ERRORS:

<p>
  'Sorry..I can't find anything'
  The browser can't locate any files which match the file name mask.  See
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs23.htm#2315" tppabs="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/browser_mode.html">
  Browser Parameters </a> This is also displayed if you have less
  than 10K of far memory free when you run Fractint.

<p>
  'Sorry....  no more space'
  At the moment the browser can only cope with 450 sub images at one time.
  Any subsequent images are ignored, make sure that the minimum image size
  isn't set too small on the parameters screen.

<p>
  'Sorry .... out of memory'
  The browser has run out of far, expanded, or extended memory in which to
  store the pixels covered by the sub image boxes.  Try again with the
  main image at lower resolution, and/or reduce the number of TSRs
  resident in memory when you start Fractint.  Make sure you have expanded
  or extended memory available.

<p>
  'Sorry...it's a read only file, can't del <b>[filename]</b>'<br>
  'Sorry....can't rename'<br>
  The file which you were trying to delete or rename has the read only
  attribute set, you'll need to reset this with your operating system
  before you can get rid of it.
