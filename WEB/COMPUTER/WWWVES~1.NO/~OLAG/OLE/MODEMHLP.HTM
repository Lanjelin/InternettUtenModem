<h2>How to start a deathmatch with modems</h2><br>
I've got so many mails from people how have problems starting a Deathmatch with modems, so I have decided to make a page to help people who are stuck.<p>
<li> You must let Doom 2 know what kind of a modem you have. Do this by starting the setup program. Choose 'run modem game' and then 'choose your modem'. If your modem is not on the list, try using Hayes Optima or put an init-string, that fits your modem, in the modem.cfg file. If your modem does not work with any of the modems in the list and you don't have an init-string that fits it, well, then you have a problem.<p>
<li> The easiest way to start a Deathmatch is by using dm.exe. This is an easy program to use, so I think you'll figure out how it works yourself. If you don't have v.1.9, you don't have this program. You can use the setup.exe program, but it's not that good, so why don't you just upgrade your version or you can copy the dm.exe file from a friend.<p>
<li> When everything works on your (and your friend's) computer, you just have to call your friend, tell him to set Doom2 in 'wait for call' mode, and then, call him. If game is running slow, you can try increasing the baud rate. Do this by editing the modem.cfg file. Change the number on the third line to 38400 or 57600. This should make it bettter.<p>
