Info		: A norwegian guy who's played Doom since he
		  was 13 and still loves it.

These lmp-files are demos from the 32 levels of Doom2. 
They're all completed from scratch (with only the pistol), 
without using save slots and on Ultra-Violence skill level. 
There have been used no cheats.

I hope these files can help anybody out there who hasn't 
completed the great game of Doom2 in this way. I didn't have 
100% kills or 100% secret on the levels. As a matter of fact, 
some of the demos are bee lines to the exit.

To view these files, copy all of the lmps to your Doom 
directory. Then type

doom2 -playdemo dm2ha##

in your DOS prompt, where ## is the map you want to watch.

Feel free to contact me about the lmps and anything else 
regarding Doom. I hope you enjoy these files and that 
they're helpful for you.

Thanx to	: Ola Galde, for playing Deathmatch with 
		  me (and winning. shit!)
		  Paul Japp for his Doom2 demo compilation. 
		  Without it I would never had made it
		  through. 
		  Thanx!
