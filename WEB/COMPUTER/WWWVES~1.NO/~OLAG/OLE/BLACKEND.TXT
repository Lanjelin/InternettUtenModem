Hi, folks!! 
I'm back again! Came through CHAOS? Didn't you? Then you'll have problems here
!! Did you?? You're back in business!! Once again, this WAD is made to make
some heart troubles out there! It's originally made for single player, but I
think it's pretty good in DeathMatch too. There is as many monsters on "Ultra-
Violence" as on "I'm too young too die" (Who the hell is playing on that
setting?? Almost like a commercial: Pick up one rocket; get two!!)
