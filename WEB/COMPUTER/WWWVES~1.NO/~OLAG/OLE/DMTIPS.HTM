<h1>DeathMatch tips from the HeadAche</h1><p>
<h3>I have upgraded the Deathmatch tips page a little. On the "weapons" part I have divided into both offense and defence. This should help you not only to become a better killer, but also to make it harder from your opponent to kill you (something that is very important). I have also increased the amount of general advice and special tricks.<p></h3>
<h2><B><a name="Weapons">The weapons</A></B></H2><P>
<B>PISTOL</B><p>
<b>Offense</b>: The pistol is not a weapon you would use in a DeathMatch battle, but sometimes it's actually more useful than you might think. If you get fragged in a battle, your opponet might have lost a lot of health. He might just have 5 or 10 percent left. If you can only get you shot with the pistol at him, he's dead. That means that you came evenly out of the battle and that YOU are actually the man infront as he's got to restart. But there is one bad thing about this: You cannot know ecsactly how much health your opponent has got. Let's say you thoght he had 5 % and he has 35. Then he could very well kill you two or three times before you got him. And if your opponent hasn't lost any health at all, you are changeless! That why you should choose to find another gun, but remember to time your shots, <I>if</I> you choose to use it.<br>
<b>Defence</b>: Nothing is more embarresing than running around with the Super Shotgun without hitting your opponent while he hits one bullet after another into your face until you're dead. You must be patient and aim before you fire. It's also useful to try to keep him away from getting other weapons. If you see that he going towards a weapon, you can just put your aim at the location of the weapon and wait for him to run over the weapon, then you fire and your opponent will be swearing at you calling you a lucky bastard!
<P>
<img src="BERZERK.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/berzerk.gif"><B> BERZERK</B><P>
<b>Offense</b>: The Berzerk is good for your health, as you get 100 % for picking it up. It is though a pretty useless weapon, unless you're invisible! When you start at level 7 for instance, you should pick up an invisibility ball and then the berzerk. Your opponent will probably try to get a weapon from one of the ledges and you can sneak up from behind and SMACK him down! It's fun!<br>
<b>Defence</b>: Remeber that your opponent cannot hit you on distance so this should be an easy target. He'll probably be comming towards you. Therefor the SuperShotgun is an excellent weapon.
<P>
<img src="CHAINSAW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/chainsaw.gif"><B> CHAINSAW</B><P>
<b>Offense</b>: This is, by all means, the worst deathmatch weapon. It's totally useless! The <i>only</i> reason to use this is to toy with a bad opponent.<br>
<b>Defence</b>: You get killed by this one, you've really made a fool of yourself! Just keep waiting for him to some running at you and frag him with The Super Shotgun when he's close.
<P>
<img src="SHOTGUN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/shotgun.gif"><B> SHOTGUN</B><P>
<b>Offense</b>: The shotgun is a lot better than you might think in the first place. It's also very diffrent from the Super Shotgun. While the SS is useless in long distances, the the shotgun is actually good. It's the second best long distance weapon after the chaingun. So, if you are in a battle against the SS you should try to get as far away as possible, and remember to aim carefully. This is very important. Look at the SS for more tips.<br> 
<b>Defence</b>: You don't have a very long time between the shot against the shotgun and therefor it's a little bit more difficult to come out of a battle without getting hurt. But the shotgun won't take such a great amount of health. Therefor you can easily use for example the Plasmagun, take a shot in the face but watch your opponent die while he reloads the weapon.
<P>
<img src="CHAINGUN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/chaingun.gif"><B> CHAINGUN</B><P>
<b>Offense</b>: The Chaingun is not very effective unless you are <I>very</i> good with it. If you get good with it, however, it's very frustrating for your opponent to play against! If you can hit him with almost every single bullett he'll swear you're cheating! The chainsaw is also very good at long distances because it makes instant damage and with the same rate as a close shot. Another useful thing is when your opponent is low on health. You can very easily take 5 or 15 % health from him in just half a second.<br>
<b>Defence</b>: The best tip is probably to keep your head cool and use the Super Shotgun. If must not panic and shoot as fast as possible. But you must also keep moving. If you stand still, you are dead meat. Run towards your prey, aim and ,when you're close, frag him with one shot. If your opponent kills you with the chaingun when you are in a battle and you have a more powerful weapon, it's the certain prove that he is a better deathmatch player. Sad but true...<br> 
<P>
<img src="SSHOTGUN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/sshotgun.gif"><B> SUPER SHOTGUN</B><P> 
<b>Offense</b>: Yahooooooo! This is a great gun!......if you can control it. Many players are running around shooting aimlessly with the SS and it's very easy to beat these kind of players. You must remember a couple of things when using this gun. First off all, if you are holding down the fire-button, stop doing it from now on. The player who shoot the most shots isn't always the one who wins! If you take just a little time to aim, you'll hit more often. You should hit your opponent on almost every shot. This isn't always very easy as your opponent will always be zig-zagging all around the area. A good way to aim is to aim with strafe. It's easier than to aim while turning. If you also run forward at the same time, you can wait until you're really close to your opponent and frag him with one shot.This is huge. It's much better to kill your opponent with one shot. You've perhaps been in this situation: "Come on! He kills me with one shot every time! It's impossible! He must be cheating!". Well, probably he's using the trick above. It's extremly effective if you can handle it. In the beginning, when you use this trick, you'll probably get pretty bad beaten up and your opponent will be like: "Hey! What's wrong with you!". But when you get the hold of it, he'll be more like: "Hey! I swear you're cheating. You weren't that good yesterday!" Another thing you should remember when using the SS is that it's damage depends very much on the distance, so if you can move away from your opponent while you're re-loading your gun and run straight up to him and fire, you have a big advantage.<br>
<b>Defence</b>: As I mentioned above, the SS is not very good on distance and has a long re-loading time. Often, you can run behind a wall as your opponent shoots. While he's re-loading, you have a second or two to run up to him with for example the chaingun. He'll be desperate to shoot again and just as the re-loading is over you run behind the wall, and he'll miss again! Now, you have some more seconds to pull another 4-5 bullets in his head. This technique is very dangerous, though. Good players will not panic at all, just sit calm until they've got you right in front and you're toast. A better way is to keep your opponent at long distance while using the shotgun or the chaingun.

<img src="LAUNCHER.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/launcher.gif"><B> ROCKET LAUNCHER</B><P> 
<b>Offense</b>: Rockets are big, they're slow, and extremly dangerous. Both for you and your opponent. In open areas, it's pretty easy to avoid the rockets. But you can make it a little bit more difficult for your opponents by running forward and strafing while fireing. This makes the distance between the rockets smaller and it becomes a wall of rockets. But the best place to use the launcher is in tight corridors where there's not enough space to dogde the rockets. Like in level 1 for example. There the rockets can be very good. But, actually, I prefer not to use this weapon.<br>
<b>Defence</b>: When the rockets come flying at you, you must keep steady. Watch the rockets, strafe, and you'll easily avoid them. In tight corridors, this is almost impossible. You just don't have enough space to dodge the rockets. As on level 1, you must listen to your opponent. You can cleary here him when he fires. Go into a large room and stay away from the corridors. If he comes into the room, frag him with the SS or plasma. If you're very low on health, you can try to run straight up to him when he shoots, and you'll both get killed and you'll wake up with 100% health without giving your opponent a frag.

<img src="PLASMA.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/plasma.gif"><B> PLASMAGUN</B><P>
<b>Offense</b>: The Plasmagun is very much the beginners favourite weapon, because all you've got to do is spread deadly cells all around the area. If you run forward and strafe while you're shooting, you'll make the distance shorter between the cells and you'll make a wall that is difficult for your opponent to get away from (like the rocket launcher). This requires that you have an open area to move in. Otherwise, you've just got to shoot after your opponent and hope you'll hit him. The Plasmagun is very effective when you come close to your opponent.<br>
<b>Defence</b>: Well, this ain't easy. I have figured out that it's probably best to go into a room with columns (like in level 1, the room with the super shotgun) and stay behind them. This makes it hard for your opponent to hit you with more than one cell a time and you can make steady shots with the super shotgun. Just to keep steady is really important when you face the Plasmagun. Don't panic. Your opponent will also have problems seeing and hearing things when he fires the Plasmagun randomly. Use this to your advantage.

<img src="BFG.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/bfg.gif"><B> BFG 9000</B><P>
This is the most powerful weapon, by far. I could have wrote ten pages about the BFG, instead I have made a small demonstration that you can download. If you want info about the BFG, take a look at the BFG FAQ. There you'll find ALL the info about the BFG 9000!<P>

<h2><b>General advice</h2></B><P>
<h3>Controls</h3><p>
First of all, you <b>must</b> use the mouse and the keyboard. Using only the keyboard, a joystick or a joypad is totally useless! You won't reach a very high level without the mouse. Don't ignore this tip just because it feels strange to use the mouse in the beginning. You'll learn how to use it and you'll see that it's a big advantage. Especially because you can turn 180 degrees in 1/100 second and that you can sircle strafe.<p>
<h3>Movement</H3><P>
When playing single player, you can take it easy, sneak around corners, wait, go back and look for secrets. In Deathmatch you'll have to run all the time. If you don't run, you're an easy prey. You must also be careful that you don't run in patterns and that you're not predictable. Also, try to face your opponent most of the time.<P>
<h3>Know the battlefield</H3><P>
You should know where all the starts, ammo, weapons, soulspheres etc. is.
Especially the invisibilities are extremly important.<P>
<h3>Be well armed</h3><P>
If you have a pistol and face a plasma rifle, you should run away immediatly!
Go find yourself a better weapon!<P>
<H3>Consentrate</H3><P>
This is, perhaps, the most important tip if you're an advanced player. You have to be 100 % 
consentrated. Don't look at the watch, eat a sandwich or write stupid messages! You just don't
have time for that!!<p>
<H3>Know your enemy</h3>
Is your enemy always hiding at one single corner? Does he only use one weapon?
Is he aiming bad? There is always a way to find out how to kill him. The best
players change tactics all the time. Try to find your weaknesses and get
rid of them. A good way to study your opponents tactics, is to record your
Deathmatch in an LMP file.<P>
<h2><b>Special tricks</b></h2><p>
<h3>Strafe run</h3>
To run is important. What many players don't know, is that you can run faster than just running straight forwards. If you run forwards and strafe at the same time, you'll run at about 150% of the 'normal' running. If you do this <i>and</i> turn your view 45 degrees, you'll be straferunning forwards.
<p>
<h3>180 degrees spin</h3>
One of the biggest advantages with the mouse, is that you can spin 180 degrees in one move. This is very handy in Deathmatch. Practise the 180 degree flip, it'll give you more frags.<p>
<h3>The North Wall</h3>
The North Wall (also called Wall Run) is a <I>very</i> fast way of running in Doom. If you strafe run, and stay in contact with a wall witch is going straight north-south, you'll be running about three times faster than normal! This only works when you're running north.<p>
