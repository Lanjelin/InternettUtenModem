<img src="ZOMBIE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/zombie.gif"><B> ZOMBIE MAN</B><P>
This is a monster that really isn't much of a trouble. Make shure you use as little
ammo as possible. A shotgun shell or a coupleof  bullets is enough.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Shotgun, Chaingun, if many: Super shotgun</B><P>
<P>
<img src="SHOTGUY.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/shotguy.gif"><B> SHOTGUN GUY</B><P>
The bad thing about the shotgun guy is that he very easily hits you. Make sure
you shoot him as fast as possible and don't meet to many of them at the same 
time. Don't use more ammo than on the Zombie man.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Shotgun, Chaingun, if many: Super shotgun</B><P>
<P>
<img src="IMP.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/imp.gif"><B> IMP</B><P>
The imp is the most common monster in Doom2. If you meet a single Imp, you shouldn't
lose any health. Just strafe away from his fireballs and pick him down with the
shotgun or the chaingun. Don't come close to him, espesially when you meet a lot
of them, he'll claw on you and you'll lose <B>very</B> much health.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Shotgun, Chaingun, if many: Super shotgun, Rocket Launcher.<P></B>
<P>
<img src="HEAVYWEP.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/heavywep.gif"><B> HEAVY WEAPON DUDE</B><P>
The Heavy Weapon Dude is very dangerous. Try to use the Chaingun or the Plasmagun.
That will lock him. If you meet many of these at the same time you are in trouble,
you lose very much health. They can hit you from any distance. Get rid of them as 
quickly as possible. Stand behind a wall and wait for them.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Shotgun, Chaingun, Super shotgun, Plasmagun, if many: Rocket Launcher, 
Plasmagun.<P></B>
<P>
<img src="LOSTSOUL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/lostsoul.gif"><B> LOST SOUL</B><P>
The Lost Souls are taking pretty much health and are very dangerous if they surround 
you. <B>Don't</B> use the Rocket Laucher. They might fly into you and you will 
be killed by your own rocket. If you use the Super shotgun, wait until he comes
flying at you, then shoot.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Super shotgun, Chaingun, Plasmagun, if many: Plasmagun.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="DEMON.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/demon.gif"><B> DEMON/SPECTRE</B><P>
The Demons are not very dangerous alone, but you use much ammo and they are dangerous 
if many. The bad thing about the Spectre is, of course, that you don't see it very easy. 
You can save much ammo by taking Demons/Spectres with the Chainsaw. For instans on level 8.
<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Super shotgun, Chaingun, Plasmagun, Rocket Launcher, if many:
Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="CACO.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/caco.gif"><B> CACODEMON</B><P>
The Cacodemons work very much in the same way as the imps. The big diffrenses
is that the Cacodemon is flying, is bigger, and you have to use more ammo.
The Cacodemon isn't a very big trouble, only if they are many and if you have bad space.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Super shotgun, Chaingun, Plasmagun, Rocket Launcher, if many: 
Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="MANCUBUS.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/mancubus.gif"><B> MANCUBUS</B><P>
The Mancubus is a very big target and doesn't take much more ammo than a Caco.
Still this is a pretty spooky monster. The worst thing is that it shoots three times, 
three fireballs. Don't strafe too long when it shoots, or you will be hit by one of his other 
fireballs. Don't use partial invisible, that will only make it all 
worse. And watch out for the fireball hitting throgh walls. Don't stand too close.
The good news is of course that it very easily hits other monsters.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Super shotgun, Chaingun, Plasmagun, Rocket Launcher, if many:
Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun, BFG 9000.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="REVENANT.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/revenant.gif"><B> REVENANT</B><P> 
This is a very dangerous monster. Although it doen't take much ammo, its shots 
are deadly: They're seeking! That means that it very often hits you and it takes 
a lot of health. Use the Plasmagun if you have enough ammo, that will lock him.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun, Chaingun, if many: Plasmagun, 
Rocket Launcher, BFG 9000.</B><P>
<p>
<img src="PAIN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/pain.gif"><B> PAIN ELEMENTAL</B><P> 
Kill it as fast as you can!! If not, it will make a lot of Lost Souls. Don't make 
it fight with other monsters, just get rid of it! Plasmagun, Rockets, BFG, whatever!
BIG TIP: The Chainsaw is the best weapon against the Pain Elemantal, unless there are more monsters around.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Rocket Launcher</B> (watch out!)<B>, Plasmagun, Chaingun, 
BFG 9000, Chainsaw, if many: BFG 9000, Plasmagun.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="KNIGHT.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/knight.gif"><B> HELL KNIGHT</B><P>
The Hell Knight is a mini-version of The Baron from Hell. It doesn't take more 
ammo than a Mancubus, but if they hit you, you'll lose a lot of health.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun, Chaingun, Super shotgun, if many: 
Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun, BFG 9000.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="ARACH.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/arach.gif"><B> ARACHNOTRON</B><P>
The small spider doesn't take much ammo, but is deadly if it hits you. On level 7, 
you should get invisible and use the Plasmagun against them. You can lock it by 
using the Chaingun or the Plasma.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun, Chaingun, Super shotgun, if many:
Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun, BFG 9000.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="BARON.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/baron.gif"><B> BARON OF HELL</B><P>
The Baron takes much more ammo than the Hell Knight. Don't use too many shotgun shells or bullets, you need them elsewere. Rockets are great. Watch out, they are shooting pretty fast.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>Super Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Plasmagun, BFG 9000, if many: same weapons.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="VILE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/vile.gif"><B> ARCH-VILE</B><P>
This monster is really bad. If you meet an Arch-Vile you will have to get rid of it
as fast as you can. If not, it will put all the other monsters back to life.
If it is locked in a room and you are behind a wall it's no problem. If not, you must 
wait for it to aim at you(then it stops running) and shoot it with the BFG or the 
Rockets. If it's on a wall in front of you, you can run under the wall and the 
flame will be broken(useful on level 20). Remember that you need only one perfect hit from 
the BFG to kill it.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>if locked in a room: Super shotgun, if not: Rocket Launcher, 
Plasmagun, BFG 9000.</B><P> 
<P>
<img src="SPIDER.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/spider.gif"><B> SPIDER MASTERMIND</B><P>
There are only five Spider Masterminds in Doom2. The first on is on level 6. He is 
no problem, just squeeze him by pulling the switch next to the elevator. Then you 
will meet one on level 20. Just make him fight with the Cyberdemon. If he wins 
you can take him with the Rocket Launcher. The Spider Mastermind on level 23, you must 
take out by yourself. Use the Rockets, there is a lot of them there. On level 28 there 
are two of them. No problem actually. Pick up a invulnerability and they won't hurt 
you. Kill them with the BFG 9000.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>BFG 9000, Rocket Launcher, other monsters.</B><P>
<P>
<img src="CYBER.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/cyber.gif"><B> CYBERDEMON</B><P>
There are five Cyberdemons in Doom2. The first is on level 8. Make him fight with 
the Barons and he won't hurt you. The second is on level 10. Take the 
invulnerability and run to the exit or kill him with the BFG 9000. The thrid is on 
level 20. Make him fight with the Spider-Mastermind. If he wins, kill him with 
the Rockets. The last one you need to pass to finish the game is the Cyberdemon 
on the end of level 29. Just run past him and into the exit, you will problably 
not see much of him. On the second Wolfenstein level, 32, there is a Cyberdemon 
at the end. Use the invulnerability from the hidden room and kill him with the BFG 9000.<P>
Useful weapons: <B>BFG 9000, Rocket Launcher, other monsters.</B><P>

<h2><B><a name="Weapons">The weapons</A></B></H2><P>
<B>PISTOL</B><p>
Don't use this weapon. There is no need to, only to save shotgun shells before you get the Chaingun.
<P>
<img src="BERZERK.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/berzerk.gif"><B> BERZERK</B><P>
Don't use the berzerk as a weapon. You'll get into trouble. If you don't have any ammo, I think the berzerk and the chainsaw are pretty evenly matched.  Good for your health. Don't pick it up unless you have 
less than 30% health.
<P>
<img src="CHAINSAW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/chainsaw.gif"><B> CHAINSAW</B><P>
It's a little bit better than the Berzerk. Espesially because 
you can save much ammo aginst the Demons/Spectres(Espesially on level 8). THE CHAINSAW IS THE BEST WEAPON AGAINST THE PAIN ELEMENTAL!
<P>
<img src="SHOTGUN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/shotgun.gif"><B> SHOTGUN</B><P>
The shotgun is excellent against zombie men, shotgun guys and imps. Sometimes you can save ammo with this weapon against other monsters(for example if you shoot two rockets into a Cacodemon, and it survives, you can kill him with the shotgun and save ammo).
<P>
<img src="CHAINGUN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/chaingun.gif"><B> CHAINGUN</B><P>
The chaingun can be used in a very similar way to shotgun. You can also "lock" monsters with it, so they can't shoot(Cacodemons, Revenants, Pain Elemental e.c.). 
Also use it for long distance shooting. Remember that it uses ammo very fast.
<P>
<img src="SSHOTGUN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/sshotgun.gif"><B> SUPER SHOTGUN</B><P> 
The Super shotgun is excellent against "medium" monsters(Cacodemon, Mancubus, Lost Soul, Hell Knight). The Super shotgun is using <B>very</B> much ammo, so don't use it against zombies, shotgun guys and imps. The Super shotgun is very effective 
against the Heavy Weapon Dude.
<P>
<img src="LAUNCHER.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/launcher.gif"><B> ROCKET LAUNCHER</B><P> 
A great weapon again a troop of small monsters(zomies, shotgun guys, imps, and heavy weapon dudes) and also against the bigger monsters. Don't stand to close 
to the monster you shoot, you might just get killed by your own rocket. 
<P>
<img src="PLASMA.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/plasma.gif"><B> PLASMAGUN</B><P>
Don't use it if you don't mean it! There are not too many cells out there! You should use it when you are surrounded, and when you meet a Revenant or a Pain Elemental. 
<P>
<img src="BFG.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vestdata.no/~olag/ole/bfg.gif"><B> BFG 9000</B><P>
The Big Fucking Gun really acts like its name! Only use it against the big, big monsters
(Spidermaster, Cyberdemon, Arch-Vile). Also use it against a big troop of monsters.
It's espesially effective against imps.
<P>
<h2><b><a name="Advices">General advice(single player)</A></h2></B><P>
Make sure you learn <I>every single level</I> and that you know where most of the 
Armors, Soulspheres, Megaspheres, Ammo and secrets are. The best way the get good though is to 
practice, practice and practice. You should also use the mouse and use the following keys:<P>
Forward-R, Backward-F, Run-Q, Strafe left-W, Strafe right-E, Use/push-Space.<P>
(If you want to record an LMP file, you'll have to put the settings one step
down, to the A, S, D and F keys.)<P>
This will make it easy to shift weapons without moving your hand. Practise shift-weapons 
so you don't have to look at the keyboard. Don't pick up a medikit(25% health) if 
you have for example 91% or 82%. Wait until you need it. Do the same with the ammo, 
the soul/megaspheres and the Armors.<P>
