        re-entries will be removed and will have to try again in

        when it already has a very high position it could be
        number one in the new chart. Otherwise it will have prove
        itself, and do serious climbing first, which will
        automatically be the case when it gets many points. This
        compilation system introduces a chart that is robust.
        Titles can only reach the top when they get many points
        for several weeks in a row. The more usual 'most points
        is highest position' system would cause very strange
        things to happen, when the number of voters is limited,
        like in this case. Another advantage of the adopted
        system is that it is more interesting. Voters can
        carefully watch the movements of their favourite titles,
        and influence the movements by balancing their votes. Of
        course, the influence of a single person on the chart
        decreases, when the number of voters increases. </font></td>

        magazine review percentages, and retail charts. For the
        Albums Charts we used a mixture of the most important
        albums retail charts in the world. For the Movies Charts

        ratings from Internet people. Such initial lists are
        needed to get the algorithms and the chart rolling. They
        are also needed because the number of voters needs to
        grow to a reasonable amount, and it takes time to achieve
        that. Normally, after one or two months, the effects of

        that you can see some strange things happening every now
