        face="Arial">From: Ski Karwowski (Jan 7, 1997)</font><p><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">I have been a voter
        for the PC Games charts since about the 16th week. I
        discovered the charts in the newsgroups when I was still
        a student at Ga Tech. Since then I have changed ISPs, and
        email addresses about five times, but I remain a devoted
        follower of the charts. I try to purchase any game that
        clears the 300 vote mark in the charts, and I have never
        been disappointed using this technique. I was very
        disappointed when I noticed that this weeks issue did not
        list the number of votes received by each game. I humbly
        ask that you reconsider your decision to remove the
        number of votes from the lists. I enjoy the numbers, the
        actual position of a game with respect to another means
        very little to me when I am trying to decide which game
        is next on my shopping list. For example, if Red Alert is
        above Civ 2 in the charts it does not mean that Red Alert
        is better than Civ 2. But, when both Red Alert and Civ 2
        receive more than 1000 votes then one knows that at least
        200 people think that both Red Alert, and Civ 2 are
        excellent games. I feel that the positions may lie a
        little, but the numbers never do.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">I have
        another reason for wanting the number of votes. A couple
        of years ago, I suggested that you compile an all-time
        list that adds the total number of votes received by each
        game. At the time I wanted to watch the relationship
        between my all-time favorite Civ, and the newcomer Doom.
        You replied that it would take too many resources to keep
        track of all votes, but you did start the year end
        &quot;Best of the Year&quot; charts. Well, after that I
        wrote a little program that processes the text of the
        charts as they are issued, and adds the number of votes
        in the new chart to a database of all of the votes from
        the previous charts. I had the votes from every chart
        issued since #6, because that is when you started putting
        the number of votes in the charts. Each week I compiled
        an All-Time chart that sorted by the total number of raw
        votes that each game got in every chart. My friends and I
        enjoy watching the progress of new games in the All-Time
        greats chart, but without the votes listed in each issue,
        it will have to stop at 209.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial">Now that I
        have pleaded my case, I would like to take the time to
        thank you for publishing the charts. I have never been
        disappointed with any game that I have purchased on the
        basis of its performance in the charts. I have an
        additional reason to thank you for the charts as I was
        one of the winners of the five free games at the end of
        the second year of the charts. So once again I just want
        to say thanks, and I apologize for putting you through
        such a long letter.</font></p>

        floods of votes organized by websites and mailing lists,
        there are publishers voting en masse for their own games,
        people vote continuously for old games without playing
        them, etc, etc.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The points only showed the
        raw data. The algorithms we use to compile the charts are
        getting better and better. In the end only the position
        of a game in the chart tells you how good the game is,
        not the number of votes. For example, if game A gets 200
        points from people in 20 different countries, then this
        game is much popular than game B which gets 400 points
        all from one and the same country, or even one and the
        same domain. More points does not make a better game.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I really enjoy reading
        your letter. You must be one of our most devoted readers.
        Thank you for that. But to get to the point: Just
        calculating totals from all the previous points columns
        is not the best method. Because at one or two occasions
        the meaning of the points column was changed in the past.
        Plus: the number of voters has grown significantly, so
        points would actually have to be weighed before adding
        them up. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All I can say right now is
        that you will probably need to wait just a few months,
        and then all your wishes will come true. This year I will
        be making a Hall of Fame with the best games ever. And I
        will be more clear about how the charts are compiled,
        giving you all the data you ever wanted.</font></p>

        Thanks again!</font></p>

        Roxette's song &quot;She Doesn't Live Here Anymore&quot;.
        I would personally have the songs in the current chart

        it, but it does not at all reflect the popularity around
        the world, because it is not a hit record in any
