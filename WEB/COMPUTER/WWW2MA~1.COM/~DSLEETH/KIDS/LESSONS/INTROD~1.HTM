Introduction

	<p>
	<h4>
These lessons are intended for young people (small adults are also
allowed) to help you understand the basics of how computers work
and how to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like everything else you read,&nbsp;  these words
should not be taken as the gospel truth,&nbsp;  just someone's perceptions,&nbsp;
and you can use your own abilities to filter and absorb what helps
you,&nbsp;  and chuck the rest.

	<h2>
Why is it good to learn how computers work?
	</h2>
	<p>
Inside this head,&nbsp;  and inside many other heads,&nbsp;  there are two kinds
of knowledge; the <i>memory work</i> kind of knowledge
and the <i>logical</i> kind of knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;   People
who have their computer knowledge on the memory work side often
have problems installing new programs,&nbsp;  using someone else's computer
or adapting to new operating systems like Windows 95 and many
other computer related difficulties.
	<p>
Things that should live on the memory work side of the brain are
such things as &quot;What is the capital of New York state?&quot;
and &quot;Who was the King of England in 1675&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;  There is
no way that knowledge on the <i>logical</i> side
can help you with these.&nbsp;&nbsp;  For instance,&nbsp;  logically speaking,&nbsp;  New
York City,&nbsp;  a very major place,&nbsp;  just has to be the capital of New
York state,&nbsp;  however it's not.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Albany is.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You just have to memorize
that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And logic is not going to help you with the king question
either,&nbsp;  I mean,&nbsp;  what's logical about kings anyway?
	<p>
However,&nbsp;  can you imagine the state we would be in if you had to
memorize the answer to all the mathematical questions?  &quot;Okay,&nbsp;
students,&nbsp;  is there anyone here who hasn't memorized the answer
to 457 + 7,985 - 598 ?&quot;  You can't memorize them all,&nbsp;  but
you can learn the logic behind them so you can figure them out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then you can't be tricked!
	<p>
It is important that you learn how to figure out things about
computers because there are just too many things to be done with
them to try to memorize it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Any ways,&nbsp;  as anyone who has studied
hard for a test the next day knows,&nbsp;  it's always the stuff you
didn't memorize that they ask!
	<p>
So,&nbsp; lets get started on putting your computer knowledge firmly
on the 'logical' side of your brain.
