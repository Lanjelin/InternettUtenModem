   <h3>
The DOS Operating System
	</h3>
	<h4>
I think that people,&nbsp; who were forced to find their way around computers
running the MS-DOS operating system,&nbsp; are at an advantage because they know
what files are and where they live.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Operating environments such as Windows
and the MAC try to cover up these details,&nbsp; making it harder to learn what really
is going on.
	<p>
Picture yourself sitting at a computer with just the DOS prompt on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The DOS prompt usually looks like this <tt><font size=5> C:> </font></tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did you know that
there is a program running?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well,&nbsp; yes there is,&nbsp; it's the disk operating system,&nbsp; DOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's busy doing what it does best,&nbsp; which is waiting for you to tell it what to do.
	<p>
So you slide up to your trusty input device,&nbsp; the keyboard,&nbsp; and you type a word,&nbsp;
say <tt><font size=5> dor </font></tt> and then you press <tt><font size=5>Enter</font></tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before talking about what happens next,&nbsp; let's look at what just happened.
	<p>
Each time you pressed a letter,&nbsp; it actually did go to the computer,&nbsp; because it appeared
on the output device,&nbsp; the monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you follow the wires,&nbsp; you see that the
only way to get to the monitor from the keyboard is through the computer!&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<p>
So,&nbsp; we learned something,&nbsp; DOS really is running because somehow the action of pressing a
certain key on the keyboard input device,&nbsp; resulted in a letter being printed in
the proper location on the screen output device!&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is actually
 quite a feat,&nbsp; and computers
had been around a long time before a program could do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fact that DOS
puts the character whose key was just pressed on the screen is called <i>echoing</i>
and it's done <i>only</i> as a convenience to you,&nbsp; the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And they say that DOS is
not <i>user friendly</i>!
	<p>
DOS also knows enough not to try to interpret what you have typed until you press the
<tt><font size=5>Enter</font></tt> key,&nbsp; indicating you are finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  There is nothing magical
about the <tt><font size=5>Enter</font></tt> key,&nbsp; it is just another key,&nbsp; but one that the
DOS program,&nbsp; and many other programs,&nbsp; have been programmed to recognize as
<i>"OK,&nbsp; I'm finished inputting,&nbsp; you figure out what I input."</i>.
	<p>
Okay,&nbsp; so now DOS has three letters in a row,&nbsp; in computer terms called a <i>string</i>.
The DOS program has a list of steps to follow when it receives a string from the keyboard.
	<p>
   <dd>
   <img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Check to see if it is a command you recognize.&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes,&nbsp; then do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<p>
   <dd><img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
If not,&nbsp; then check to see if there is a file in the current directory that ends
in <tt><font size=5>.com</font></tt> or <tt><font size=5>.exe</font></tt> or <tt><font size=5>.bat</font></tt>
but has the same first part,&nbsp; such as <tt><font size=5>dor.com</font></tt>
or <tt><font size=5>dor.exe</font></tt> or <tt><font size=5>dor.bat</font></tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If there
is,&nbsp; then get a copy of that file from the long term storage device
and into the short term storage,&nbsp; the RAM,&nbsp; and run the program.
	<p><dd>
   <img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
If there is no such file in the current dir,&nbsp; then look in each directory that DOS
has in a list of directories called the Path.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can find such
 a file,&nbsp; then,&nbsp; again,&nbsp;
pull it into RAM and run it (called executing the file).
	<p>
   <dd>
   <img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
If DOS has taken all of these steps and still can't interpret what you want,&nbsp;
then,&nbsp; using the monitor output device,&nbsp; tell the user <tt><font size=5>'Bad command or file name'</font></tt>.
	<p>
Just be thankful that the computer wasn't given boots as an output device,&nbsp; because
a kick in the shins would be more appropriate,&nbsp; after sending the poor thing on such
a wild goose chase!
	<p>
So,&nbsp; one thing we've learned is that <tt><font size=5>dor</font></tt>
is a pretty meaningless word to both DOS and us!&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now try
 typing <tt><font size=5>dir</font></tt>
	<p>
Hey,&nbsp; that's better.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <tt><font size=5>dir</font></tt> is
 a command that DOS knows,&nbsp; and it means <i>"list
all the files and directories that are in the current directory."</i>
	<p>
Now,&nbsp; when you see <tt><font size=5>'Bad command or file name'</font></tt>
 after telling DOS to do something,&nbsp;
you don't have to just sit there with this confused look on your face.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the logical side of your brain you can figure out why you got that
ouptut instead of the one you were expecting.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you had typed the name of a program,&nbsp; say <tt><font size=5>wp</font></tt>
 and were expecting to start-up Word Perfect,&nbsp; but
received that friendly <tt><font size=5>'Bad command or file name'</font></tt>
 instead.&nbsp; then you can go over in your head
exactly what DOS had tried to do.
	<p>
First,&nbsp; it checked to see if <tt><font size=5>wp</font></tt>
 was a command it recognized - no it wasn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then it looked for <tt><font size=5>wp.com</font></tt> or
<tt><font size=5>wp.exe</font></tt> or <tt><font size=5>wp.bat</font></tt> in its
current directory,&nbsp; the directory
the operating system was left in.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If it was there,&nbsp; DOS would
 have grabbed the file off the hard drive
and put a copy in the RAM.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But it wasn't there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Then DOS looked in all the directories
that are listed in its path variable.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You can see what directories
it looks in by giving DOS
the command <tt><font size=5>path</font></tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
[ <i>Giving DOS the command <tt><font size=5>path</font></tt>
means typing <tt><font size=5>path</font></tt> at the dos prompt <tt><font size=5> C:> </font></tt>
and pressing <tt><font size=5>Enter</font></tt></i> ].&nbsp;&nbsp;  DOS spits out the
 list of directories it has been told to look in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It didn't find such a file there,&nbsp; so it told you so.
	<p>
DOS can be a lot of fun to program,&nbsp; and is actually an excellent place to start
<i>real</i> programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;  My daughter started with
MicroWorlds Project Builder (Logo)
and then we did some DOS programs and now she's writing small C++ programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<p>
If there are enough people interested in these <i>Computer Lessons for Kids and
Small Adults</i>,&nbsp; then I'll teach how to do a little DOS programming.
