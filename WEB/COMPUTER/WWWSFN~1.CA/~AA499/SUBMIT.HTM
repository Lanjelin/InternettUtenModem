<CENTER>How to Submit to <i>The Gallery Of Magical Blades</i></CENTER>
<p>
  There are several catagories in <I>The Gallery Of Magical Blades</i>, and if you could, I would appreciate it if your submission fits into one of these catagories (special exceptions are made for
blades that need a catagory of themselves).  The catagories are:
<p>
<center><i>Bastard Swords, Broad Swords, Daggers, Katanas, Knives, Kopeshes, Long Swords, Rapiers, Sabers, Scimitars, Short Swords, Two-Handed Swords</center></i>
<p>
  Please, if you are to submit a blade that requires tables, it helps if it's typed up in Microsoft's Word for Windows (version 2.0 or less) as it saves me a great amount of time in formatting.
<p>
  I'm looking for someone to help me create forms proporly, and set of a from to e-mail gateway so I can have them easily mailed to myself (my current internet provider, the free-net, doesnt' allow it's users to use cgi-bin).
