  <i>The Gallery Of Magical Blades</i> is a Resource document that was originally designed for the AD&D game by Mr. Sacco.  He has since decided that he can no longer maintain it, and I have taken over for him as author.
  The current version for <i>The Gallery Of Magical Blades</i> is 4.00, which is available in Microsoft Word For Windows version 2.0 format.  It contains over 300 differnet bladed weapons in over 120 pages of document.

  I'm sorry if your blade isn't included with this version of <i>The Gallery Of Magical Blades</i>, I have many more to format through before I enter them, and have had very little time in which to do this.
