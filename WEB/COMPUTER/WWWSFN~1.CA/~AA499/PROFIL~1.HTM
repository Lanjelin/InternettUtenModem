Welcome to Saskatoon Saskatchewan, Canada!  Users utilizing a graphical browser should be able to see a quick map of the world right below this showing them where they are.  I make no garuntees that the information I provide is correct, but I try to the best of my ability to make it so. Also, this page represents my personal (not neccesarily proffesional) views, and is also in no way a reflection of the Saskatoon Free-Net (which I am a proud member of, and this web page is housed on), or the University of Saskatchewan (which I am a student off).
<P>

Okay, now for a little bit about myself.  I'm a first year Computer Science student at the <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS7.HTM#744" tppabs="http://www.usask.ca/index.html">University of Saskatchewan</A>, and have taken many different hobbies up over the years.  I was president of S<SUP>2</SUP>EDS (The Saskatchewan Students for the Exploration and Development of Space), and have always had a high interest in the Space Community.  I have lived in Saskatoon all of my life, and recently graduated from Holy Cross High school (which is situated in saskatoon).  I can be reached via e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:aa499@sfn.saskatoon.sk.ca">aa499@sfn.saskatoon.sk.ca</A>, which I check rather sporadically, but often enough to
answer all major concerns within a reasonable time. 
<P>
Another one of my interests is Role-Playing games and medieval history.  I'm editor of an
electronic document which holds hundreds of magical weapons that can easily be added to any fantasy campain.  I also maintain (on the Saskatoon Free-Net), a web page devoted totaly to <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#901" tppabs="http://www.sfn.saskatoon.sk.ca/~aa499/www/sfn.saskatoon.sk.ca/~aa499/dnd.htm">Dungeons & Dragons</A>.  I find that Role-Playing games offer a nice chage in life, and are useful when soothing one's day, or enhancing one's creative awarness.
