IRPS offers several benefits to it's members and is always looking
for new benefits to give.  If you have any ideas on new benefits which
could be given to the members, feel free to contact
<a href="mailto:mlp26745@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu">Michael Popovich</a> for more 
information.

<h4>Monthly Newsletter</h4>
<ul>
The Internet Role-Playing Society publishes a monthly newsletter which 
is posted on the web page and sent to all club members at the beginning 
of each month.  Articles featured in the newsletter vary from month to 
month, depending up any new games, rules, etc. released.

<p>
Anyone is allowed to write an article for IRPS.  There are no writing
guidelines, although we do ask that you limit your topics to role-playing
in some manner, meaning you can write from price increases in gaming
products, to complete adventures or gaming worlds.  Also, if you do decide
to write, as an author, you will retain all rights to your work and agree
to allow IRPS to email all club members, associate clubs, your article,
and in addition, allow us to post it on our web page.  If you are interested
in writing for the IRPS newsletter or assisting it in any possible way,
please contact <a href="mailto:kmizeri@jetstream.net">Karen Mizeri</a>.
</ul>

<h4>Discounts on Role-Playing Products</h4>
<ul>
All members of IRPS are also eligible for discounts on RPG products
courtesy of Daili's Collectibles, owned by Vice President Craig
Janssen. He sells everything ranging from Role-Playing Games (RPGs)
products to Collectible Card Games (CCGs). Discounts on RPG products
are 30% off and discounts on CCGs vary from game to game. If you
would like to order something or get a current list of items on
stock contact <a href="mailto:daili@gate.net">Craig Janssen</a> for
further information.
</ul>

<h4>Play By E-Mail (PBEM) Games</h4>
<ul>
IRPS is also currently setting up several PBEM games. We are currently
looking for members who would like to judge/play in these games.  If you
don't have a web page devoted to your PBEM we would be happy to allow you
space at our site to post your page and we will also advertise for you in
our club newsletter.  If you have any comments, questions, or ideas about
this, or just want to run a PBEM, please contact 
<a href="mailto:mlp26745@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu">Michael Popovich</a> for further 
information.
</ul>

<h4>Geographical Database</h4>
<ul>
IRPS is also trying to get an online database with information about it's 
members should gamers decide to come together and role-play in real life. 
We are currently searching for a database engine for this feat and will then 
be considering security information about the members.  Also, if you have
experience in CGI scripting and would like to design this engine for IRPS
feel free to contact <a href="mailto:ewulf@dbtech.net">Eugene Tillery</a>.
Currently, if you would like to find out the gamers in your area, will you
need to email <a href="mailto:ewulf@dbtech.net">Eugene Tillery</a> with a
list of area codes which you wish to find gamers in.  He will then get back
to you and give you the names and email addresses of all those gamers in that
area.  This takes approximately two days.
</ul>

<h4>Future Prospects</h4>
<ul>
Also if you can think of any other benefit which you would like to see the 
club offer please contact <a href="mailto:mlp26745@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu">Michael 
Popovich</A> with your ideas and suggestions. We're trying to offer our members 
the best and can't do it without your advice.
