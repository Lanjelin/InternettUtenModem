THE ATRILIAN CAMPAIGN E-JOURNAL

Issue no 5, October 1996

Hello all
After several months of slumber due to various reasons (summer vacations,
players quitting and being replaced by others), play has resumed and my
mailbox is choking again ;-)

Several players complained about the awful ascii map I've drawn. It is true
that, since play has become quite detailed now, a more accurate map is
needed. I know this, of course, and I am trying to have a more detailed map
available on the internet. I hope it'll be there by Christmas (what a nice
present for everybody!)

I'll try and give a list of all the players depending on their location in
the campaign. I hope this'll help some of you guys.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL

Being a summary of the events which took place in SE Atrilia during the 3rd
and the 4th months of Peret in the 1st year of Lalibêa's reign (Ndogo
reckoning).

1/ THE RIVER PANGANI
The water of the river Pangani is fresh again. The evil salt-water
crocodiles that had been infesting it have disappeared, and the blessed
fresh-water crocodiles are back.
The consequence on the crops, however, was terrible, and Northern Dogobar
may face severe famine soon.

2/ PEACE IN THE SEA OF THE SIRENS
Admiral Yoram and the Omukama have signed an agreement between Pheacia and
Dogobar which should bring peace to the Sea of the Sirens.
Most of the agreement is being kept secret at the moment, but some parts of
it have leaked to our investigators.
Here follows what we can print for sure:

a) Pheacia must recognise that the islands of the Sea of the Sirens (Pemba,
Mâfia, Mombaza, Serendíb, the Nzuzei Isles) are Ndogo land, under the
suzerainty of the kingdom of Dogobar.

b) The Pheacians will be allowed to keep one colony on each island, a
walled city under Pheacian rule. The existence of Pheacian military units
is to be accepted. No action against these units shall occur, and it will
be understood that he movement of these forces is not an implied threat to
the Bandogo. The Pheacian military is entitled to pursuit of other military
goals.

c) The Pheacians will be allowed to build a walled city on the coast of
Dogobar. This city will be the exclusive centre of trade between Dogobar
and other lands. The Pheacian fleet shall have a monopoly on that trade.
Trade laws and customs will be enforced by the Pheacians. Pheacian traders
will be allowed in Ndogo cities to conduct business.

d) Peaceful Pheacian citizens will be allowed access to business or
pleasure in Ndogo cities, and are subject to the local laws of the lands
they visit. The Bandogo shall notify Admiral Yoram before execution of
punishment against Pheacian criminals. This does not mean that Pheacian
criminals are not to be punished for their crimes against the Bandogo, only
that Pheacia should be made aware. Pheacian legal representatives shall be
admitted to defend Pheacians accused of serious crimes.

e) The Laws and Rules of the Pheacian Colonies will only extend to the
towns (one by island, one only for the Nzuzei) and one mile outside the
walls of any town.
The Xolas and Bandogo who live in these towns are entirely under Pheacian
laws, but the inhabitants of the rest of the island will be under the
Omukama's direct authority.

f) An important ceremony of passing of power, in which submission of the
islands (and, symbolically, the Pheacians) to the Omukama will be
displayed, is to take place in Dôgu. The Omukama will then grant the lands
for the colonies, and the rights of the Pheacians will be formulated aloud
in front of the people. This on Pemba, Mâfia, Mombaza and Serendíb; a naval
tour of the Nzuzei will be done. Security shall be enforced by Pheacian
ships.

3/ THE RED COAST
A new trouble has arisen in Punt.
A splinter clan of the Camel Xolas called 'the Hump' denounced the Camel
Sheikh's alliance with Gyptos, and proclaimed, in the name of Hammon, that
Punt be freed from Gyptian oppression.

A 'Hump' commando has attacked a Gyptian caravan coming from Gyptos. Since
the caravan wasn't carrying any goods, they had little protection.
However, the merchant leading the caravan, one Djyi, is a well-known member
of the Gyptian aristocracy, and the kidnapping annoys Sebekemhat, the
Gyptian governor in Shedet.
Rumour has it the commando has joined the 'Hump''s charismatic leader,
Drahcir Skoorb, who is hiding somewhere in the dry valleys between the
Gyptian settlements and the lands of the Coastal Xolas.

4/ SOUTHERN PUNT
The harbour Imam Abú Djâfar (leader of the Coastal Xolas) said was being
built with a peaceful intent has seen many Meshuesh ships brought to
anchor.
Spies from neighbouring Xola sultanates reported that the usually peaceful
Coastal Xolas were under heavy military training, some of them having
become efficient fighters.

On the 11th day of the 4th month of Peret, Meshuesh troops stationed in the
harbour arrested a Xola alchemist (allegedly a Pheacian spy) and dragged
him to their fortified headquarters.
Infuriated Xola troops tried to prevent the arrest, but they were no match
to the elite Meshuesh.
The Xola fighters are now deployed around the Meshuesh headquarters... the
air is thick with mistrust...

5/ SLAYERS STRIKE AGAIN
The new sect called 'the Slayers' which has recently attacked Pheacian
property in Dár al-Hamra on Mâfia (during the 2nd month of Peret) struck
again.
On the night between the 8th and the 9th days of the 4th month of Peret,
'Slayer' raiders attacked the poorly-defended island of Pemba and killed
the soldiers of the Pheacian garrison to the last man. 'Slayer' militants
on Mâfia left a parchment claiming the attack in the name of Baal Hammon.

6/ SERIOUS TROUBLE ON SERENDIB
After a tranquil 3rd month of Peret, violence resumed in the north of the
island of Serendíb during the 4th month.
Two large galleys carrying troops and weapons from Mâfia arrived in the
harbour of Qart 'Attíq. They were met by a friendly crowd offering them
food and wine. The wine was actually drugged and the crowd captured the
soldiers and took their weapons.
The captains of the galleys had distrusted the crowd and ordered their
vessels out of the harbour; the galleys are now patrolling half a kilometre
off the coast of Serendíb.
The armed populace controls now the city of Qart 'Attíq. Governor Benba
al-Khardun is besieged in his palace with 100 loyal guards.

News of the revolt have reached Qart Khadash, about 30 km south of Qart
'Attíq. The Pheacian colonists there have proclaimed their loyalty to
Governor Benba, and a column of soldiers from Qart Khadash is heading north
to crush the revolt.

ENCYCLOPAEDIA ATRILIANA
This is the third in a series of regular instalments of encyclopaedic
information about the continent of Atrilia.

*The Gods of the Xolas*

Readers of the Atrilian e-journal may be confused by the Xolas. There seem
to be Xolas almost everywhere in SE Atrilia, and it seems they worship all
kinds of deities.

This instalment of the Encyclopaedia Atriliana shall make the issue clearer
for everybody (hopefully...)

The Xolas used to live all over E Atrilia (including SE Atrilia of course)
in the past. Several wars against various foes (both human and non-human)
as well as climatic changes restricted their territory.

NOMADIC XOLAS
These Xolas are the ones most similar to their ancestors. They live in the
dry plains and savannahs of Western and Northern Punt. They sometimes foray
into the Land of the Githzerai or into Southern Punt.
The religion of the Nomadic Xolas is _shamanism_, a combination of the
worship of Earth-Mother, of the ancestors, and of the spirits of ancient
heroes.

COASTAL XOLAS
These Xolas are the most peaceful of all Xolas. They live in Southern Punt,
raising cattle and tending their crops.
The Coastal Xolas used to be quite unaffected by religion; however, since
the late Meshuesh missionary Imam Suheil visited them, they've become
fervent worshippers of Suheil and of Israfil, the angel believed to carry
his will.

ISLAND XOLAS
The Island Xolas are scattered on the small islands between the Sea of
Zwazi and the Sea of the Sirens.
They received the teachings of Meshuesh missionaries and, as a result,
worship the Lawful Gods (i.e. the same gods as the Northern peoples), among
whom they hold Hammon in highest esteem.

HARATIN
The Haratin are the Xolas of Dogobar. They are slaves or ex-slaves working
in the state-owned plantations of Dogobar ('Harat' means 'labourer' in
Xola).
They worship the Lawful Gods, Kwoth in particular.

NDARUGAN XOLAS
Xola society is very tight and does not leave much to individual freedom,
whether nomadic, coastal or land-based. Hence many Xolas leave their
families and their land in the search for personal achievement and freedom.
Most are renegades from the nomadic tribes, or fleeing slaves from Dogobar.

These runaways usually flee to the inhospitable mountains between Klesh and
the lands north to it. There, they organise themselves as loose bands,
attacking Dogobar or the nomadic Xolas.

In the last years, a powerful warrior has emerged as the ruler of these
bandits: Emir Aman has gathered all the runaways under his firm rule, and
has conquered the (formerly) Ndogo emirate of Ndaruga so that these Xolas
now have a home. He has declared himself Emir of Ndaruga, and has allied
with the Kleshites for support (see issue #2 of the e-zine).

The Ndarugan Xolas, being of such different backgrounds, do not share a
common religion; however, under the influence of their Kleshite allies, it
seems most of them now worship the Chaotic Gods, especially the serpent god
Jáh and the crocodile goddess Ragarra.
