Hello all
	I'm very sorry for being late. This issue was due to arrive in your 
mail boxes about a fortnight ago, but several players had examinations, 
hence the delay.

Speaking of players, I have received several demands to publish an 
up-to-date list of all the players involved in the campaign.  Well, I 
cannot do that because of the presence of secret players and of dormant 
players, but here follows the list of all active players having an e-mail

1/ BATTLE FOR THE CONTROL OF THE BABYO PASS Despite the truce between the 
Omukama and young prince Nari ibn Aman, several Ndogo troops have been 
moved from Dogu and Ngonem to the region of Babyo.  However, since their 
arrival, the troops have been staying in their barracks.

2/ THE GITHZERAI PLATEAU
After the siege of Mellin and the battle between some Githzerai and the 
besieging Xolas, which resulted in the death of the Githzerai leader, the 
tower was captured. The Ahirone Xolas, who had responded to Suppiluliuma's 
demand for help, helped pulling down the tower with their tools.  An evil 
temple was found under the foundations of the tower and was destroyed by 
the Xolas.

The Omukama sent two beautiful all-white bulls as presents for the 
victorious sheikhs. The sheikhs sent back precious weapons as gifts for the 
Omukama but made clear they needed more than presents: they need supply, 
the Githzerai Plateau being completely infertile.

As the Xolas were readying for another siege, they met scouts from an 
unheard-of nomadic tribe simply called "the Nation" whose leader Huang 
Syn expressed his interest in joining the Xolas' holy war against the 
White-Skins.

3/ THE RIVER PANGANI
Ever since the Githzerai conquered the plateau over Dogobar and drove off 
the Wanako Xolas, its previous inhabitants, the earth there has become 
infertile, and the level of the river Pangani that flows through Dogobar 
but whose source lies on the plateau has been getting lower and lower.

In the last weeks, however, the level seems to have become more stable. 
Yet this was no consolation for the Ndogo farmers, since the water of the 
river is becoming salty.

At the same time, huge salt-water crocodiles are entering the river from 
the sea, eating the smaller fresh-water crocodiles and the fish.  The 
waters of the harbour of Panganyo are infested with crocodiles; fishermen 
are afraid to go out.

4/ SERENDIB (PHEACIANS)
There has been much unrest in the Pheacian colonies of Qart 'Attiq and 
Qart Khadash on Serendib.
--Most traders and merchants are believed to be paying a new mob boss known 
as 'the Reasonable Businessman' in exchange for so-called protection.  The 
man, however, is popular among the poor as he's known to help those in 
dire straits.
--Many children were found dead, raped and assassinated, in the back alleys 
of Qart 'Attiq.  Rumours have been spread about the governor being the 
culprit, but all leads to believe it was a put-up, since his beautiful 
daughter An'Ceraphe was herself the target of an assassination attempt.  
The aggressor was killed by Benba's guards.
--Unknown townsmen have aroused the populace against Admiral Yoram's 
prohibition of going and hunting in the forests of the island.  After a 
group of about 15 townspeople got massacred by giant birds while cutting 
wood in the forest, however, the unrest came to a halt.
--The heads of the two most respected and wealthy families of the island, 
the Tingisi and the ad-Dir, got assassinated in Qart Khadash. Admiral Yoram 
has threatened to impose martial law if governor Benba does not find the 
murderers.

5/ MAFIA
The once-peaceful island of Mafia, off the coast of Dogobar, is stricken by 
ethnic strife.  Ethnic Xolas armed by the Pheacian military government of 
Admiral Yoram are taking over Ndogo property and forcing the Bandogo to 
flee to the poorer part of the island, West Mafia.

At the same time, the Pheacians are busy building new temples to their gods 
and converting the Xolas.

The mamluk garrison in the capital, Dar al-Hamra, have stated they will 
remain neutral until an agreement is reached between Admiral Yoram and the 
Omukama.

6/ THE RED COAST
The Gyptian government in Shedet is busy investigating, with the help of 
foreign mercenaries, the recent pirate attack onto its shipyard.

An unknown ship has been spotted in the waters near Shedet but she does not 
seem to be involved in the attack.

7/ AN UNKNOWN SECT WREAKS HAVOC
Two harbours have recently been attacked by a new sect called 'the 
Slayers' which claim to be furthering the cause of the Pheacian god 
Baal Hammer.

Bur Hammon on the Dioscuride Islands first, Bur al-Saadat then on the Xola 
Islands were attacked at night.  The attackers burnt property and caused 
heavy damage, yet did not take any loot, which leads to think wanton 
destruction was their sole aim.

8/ SERENDIB (MESHUESH)
--A rich Northerner, who has stayed in Dar al-Meshuesh for two months, 
claims he has clues about the location of an ancient Atrilian artefact.  He 
is looking for courageous adventurers to organise an expedition.
--A new governor has been appointed in the city of Dar al-Meshuesh, 
Princess Minu at Matu Sha, the daughter of the sultan of Oea (a Meshuesh 
city in the north).  She is a notorious fire elementalist, which 
undoubtedly shall lead to clashes with the local Hammon clergy.

ENCYCLOPAEDIA ATRILIANA
This is the first of a regular instalment of encyclopaedic information 
about the world of the Atrilian campaign.

*The Gyptian calendar*
Although its seasons do not really correspond to the weather in SE Atrilia, 
the Gyptian calendar is the most widely used calendar in SE Atrilia.
The year is made up of 365 days: 360 normal days followed by 5 extra days.
The 360 normal days are divided into twelve 30-day months.  The months 
themselves are grouped in three 4-month seasons: AKHET (Inundation), 
PERET (Growth) and SHEMU (Harvest).  Months are simply known as the Fourth 
Month of Akhet, the First Month of Peret, etc.  The first day of the First 
Month of Akhet roughly corresponds to real-world 20 July. Unfortunately, 
there is no reckoning of years. Each country tends to count them in terms 
of years of rule of the current ruler.  For instance, the current date in 
Dogobar is the 15th day of the 1st month of Peret of the 1st year of 
Lalibea's reign.
