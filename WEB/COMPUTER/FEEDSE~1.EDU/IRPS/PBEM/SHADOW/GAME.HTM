<H1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Game System
</H1><P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The game will be run under the AD&amp;D Second
Edition rules. We will be using e-mail for the time being, but in the future
I'd like to have some live games on IRC. Rounds will be run daily. Players
can write each other and converse, but I ask that conversation doesn't deal
directly with the game(this is to prevent a group of characters from plotting
against another). &nbsp; &nbsp;I hope that everyone that plays has an enjoyable
time. Think and act creativly.

<H1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The History of Hendar
</H1><H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this point, I'll try run through a
short history of The Land Of Shadows. I'll try to add a more detailed history
into the Tome of Time.
</H4><H4>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hendar was once, a long time ago, a joyous
land. The people were content with their lives, and grateful to the Gods.
The different governments got along for the most part. The landscape was
beutiful, and people got along. But good things don't last forever. The clerics
and mages of the land sensed a great evil overcoming the world. A powerful
evil, like none had ever seen. The land became sterile, and harvests became
meak. Plague and filth cursed the towns. The world dropped into despair,
and great armies attacked. Lord Seth, and ec-cleric, commanded his troops,
and before long controlled everything. His tyranical rule brought shadows
over the land. Raznarak, the new god behind the evil flourished, as his minions
grew, and smiled. It appeared as if there was no hope.
