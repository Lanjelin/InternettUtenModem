Below is the new edition of the RPG List of Lists. Sorry if you get this
more than once, it is being cross-posted to the AD&D lists. Please
distribute fully to any other lists or persons who would like it.

         Roleplaying Related Lists, version 4.07, 9th-March-1995    
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Background
==========

In addition to rec.games.frp.*, there are a number of mailing lists and
digests (or newsletters) on the net which may be of interest to
role-playing enthusiasts.

The difference between a mailing list and a digest is that a digest is
collected, edited, and distributed by an editor, while a mailing list
simply forwards all incoming mail to a list of subscribers. Mailing
lists tend toward high volume with many digressions; digests tend
toward low volume with high signal-to-noise ratios. The way of
subscribing is the same for both, so I won't differentiate between them
in the remainder of this message.

As usual, an explanation about listservers in general before I list
the lists. Read this before trying anything.

How to use this list
====================

There are basically three ways in which you could subscribe using email to a
mailing list or digest: through a "listserv/listserver/listproc" address, 
through a "majordomo" address, or through a manual address. With each 
mailing list, however, only ONE of these will work correctly. Each list given
below has a code next to it which tells you which one will work.

Listservers & Majordomo
-----------------------

To subscribe to a list, DON'T send mail to the listname@yyy address that you 
wish to subscribe to. Instead, send mail to xxx@yyy, where you have 
substituted the name for the type of listserver according to the code next to
the list. For example, if we use the AD&D list below:

  adnd-l@utarlvm1.uta.edu (li)       Advanced Dungeons & Dragons RPG

the (li) code indicates a 'listserv' server, so you would send email to
listserv@utarlvm1.uta.edu, essentially substituting 'listserv' for xxx.

You need to use the listname@yyy address only later, once you have 
subscribed. If you have never used a listserver before, send a message
with a blank subject line and with the message body saying just "HELP" 
(without the quotes) to the listserver. It will send you back a HELP message.

Subscribing
===========

Listservers
-----------
If you were interested in joining the spelljammer list, you would send mail 
to listserv@le.ac.uk, with a blank subject line and the main message body
saying, for example, 

  "SUBSCRIBE spelljammer Mr. Bill Clinton" 

(without the quotes). You would then wait for confirmation from the 
listserver and then you would be subscribed to the SpellJammer discussion 
list. 

Majordomo
---------
As for listservers, but you put your email address in the SUBSCRIBE message 
and not a personal name, for example:

  "SUBSCRIBE chaos-info bill@whitehouse.gov"

(without the quotes). You would then wait for confirmation as above.

Manual addresses
----------------
Manual lists come in four types below:
  1) Send email to "listname-request@yyy" with a message as for listservers
  2) Send email to "listname-request@yyy" with a personal message to a user
  3) Send email to a user's account - the list is run from the user's account
  4) Send email to the user's account, but the list is at another address.

More Info from automatic lists
==============================

There are two ways for finding more information on an automatic list 
depending on the type of mailing-list software running. For 'listserv' lists 
try sending a "REVIEW listname" message (without the quotes) replacing 
listname with the list you are requesting info on. For 'majordomo', 
'listproc' or 'listserver' type lists, try sending an "INFO listname" 
command in the same way as the REVIEW command.

Lists
=====

Each type of list is indicated by a one to three letter code in brackets 
after the list name. These correspond to:

li  = listserv
ls  = listserver/listserv
lp  = listproc/listprocessor
m   = majordomo
rq  = NOT necessarily an automatic list. These may be answered personally, 
      use xxx-request@yyy (subscription address) & xxx@yyy (list address).
rqs = Simple Perl Mailer - uses "SUBSCRIBE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the SUBJECT
      field of the message and so is different to all the others. Send 
      "HELP" as the mail Subject field for more info. Use xxx-request@yyy 
      (subscription address) & xxx@yyy (list address).
ps  = NOT an automatic list. These ARE answered personally. There are two 
      forms, either the list is run from the person's account (one address
      listed below) OR the mailing list has one address and you must use the 
      second address given for a personal subscription message.
