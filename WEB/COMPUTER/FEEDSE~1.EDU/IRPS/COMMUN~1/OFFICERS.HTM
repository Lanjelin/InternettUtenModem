<hr>
IRPS currently has a chain of command in which work is passed up and
down.  This is done for efficiency.  Below are a list of current IRPS
officers and with their current titles along with their main staff
members should you need to contact any of them.  Titles which do not
have names next to them are currently open to members who can demonstrate
that they are capable of holding such a position.  Also, IRPS has not
accounted for every possible position in the world, so if there's one
which you think IRPS could use, feel free to contact the President at
any time with your suggestion.
