Internet Relay Chat, other wise known as IRC, is a program which
allows a computer connected to the Internet to access an IRC server.
Once your computer has accessed one of these servers, you can join
one of several channels which allow you to chat with other people
who share the same interests.  This can range from, diving, sports,
television shows, movies, etc. but in our case it's conducting
club meetings and quite possibly role-playing games.

<p>
There are several good IRC programs available on the Internet for free.
The one I use is known as <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS4.HTM#460" tppabs="http://www.mirc.co.uk/">mIRC</a> which 
is constantly updated and, in my opinion, a good program.  You might 
want to take a look at it and consider using it.

<p>
Currently, IRPS operates on nemesis.acronet.net IRC servers.  Meetings are
once each week, Monday night from 9:30 PM till about 11:30 to midnight.
All club members are welcome to stop by during the meetings and share their
thoughts about how the club is going.

<p>
If you have any problems, comments, questions, ideas, or suggestions, feel
free to contact <a href="mailto:mlp26745@pegasus.cc.ucf.edu">Michael Popovich</a> at
any time for help.
