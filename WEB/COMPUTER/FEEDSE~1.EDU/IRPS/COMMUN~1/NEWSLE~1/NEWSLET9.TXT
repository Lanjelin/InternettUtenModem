IRPS Monthly status Report 
Michael Popovich <cad@digital.net>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello Once Again!
	Wow, I'm definitely pleased with how IRPS has been progressing through
the past few months.  When the club first started, we had only a few things to
offer such as the web page, newsletter, and gaming discounts, but with the IRPS
Online city soon coming into existence we'll have more to offer to our club
members.
	Also, I would like to thank each and everyone of our members who make
IRPS a much better place.  Currently, our club membership is up to around 1400
people which is definitely a growth spout for the club.
	Well, that's enough about my mouth yapping away, enjoy the rest of the
newsletter (which by the way is arranged differently this month).

Editor's Note
Karen Mizeri  <kmizeri@jetstream.net>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings all!
        You will notice this month's newsletter is fairly large.  I would like 
to thank everyone who  submitted and encourage them to keep up the good work. :)
We are starting to draw a lot more attention.  For this reason we have a new set
of guidelines for submissions.
Effective immediately they are as follows:
 - All articles must be submitted in DOS text.  Lines are 80 characters.
 - Absolutely no foul language.
 - Articles must be spell checked, and have an understandable format.
 - Articles must meet basic grammar requirements.
 - We accept articles in English only.
 - ARTICLES MUST MEET ALL COPYRIGHT/TRADEMARK LAWS.  This is very, very
   important.  The larger companies are starting to crack down.  IRPS cannot
   afford to be held responsible for copyright/trademark breech.  Questionable
   articles will be refused unless the author can prove they meet these laws.
 - Original submissions only please.  We do not reprint.
 - We reserve the right to not to publish everything we receive.
 - We accept role playing aides, fiction, poetry, and classified advertisements.
 - Submission deadline is the 25th of the month until further notice.

For anyone not sure if they meet these requirements, submit your article early.
I am quite willing to assist anyone who would like to submit in meeting the
guidelines.

 The newsletter will now be divided into four parts.
 1) Monthly columns.  For those of you who write every month.
 2) Role playing aides.  This is monsters, items, new tables, etc.
 3) Fiction
 4) Classified advertisements

We are also considering doing an on-line magazine for IRPS.  I will need 
volunteers to work in all departments and head others:

Graphics 
Research
On-line maintenance
HTML
Layout  - Jenn Millington
Editing/coordination - Karen Mizeri

Anyone who is interested please E-mail me <kmizeri@jetstream.net> with a list
of your qualifications and experience.  I will continue to do the editing and
coordination of the newsletter/magazine. Jenn Millington will be handling 
layout.  We will shortly be starting weekly meetings for the newsletter staff.  
These will be announced at a later date.

Again, thanks to all the writers for helping the newsletter grow.  :)  I would
like to encourage anyone out there who is thinking about submitting and hasn't
yet.  :)  Anyone who has questions can email me at the above address, or from 
the IRPS homepage.

Sincerely,

Karen Mizeri

Ways to Make your Campaign more Fun
Jenn Millington   <jimjen@interlog.com>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have found that sometimes campaigns can become boring.  Gamers play the same
characters over and over again and eventually their characters become
identical.  Sometimes I find the best way to cure this problem is by creating
a bogey table.

The bogey table allows you to give negative and positive traits to your gamers.
I recommend giving one positive and one negative.  This will require gamers to
take more care in role playing their characters.

Rambling Thoughts
Kosala Ubayasekara <kosala@dataphone.se
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-The Green Oasis-

Sand rustled softly under his feet as he walked the streets of Tyr, heading 
towards the main gate. It was daybreak and the city was slowly coming to life. 
Merchants set up their stands, under the guidance of officials from the various 
merchant guilds, and the beggars and thieves started their rounds of the city. 
He met a group of Templars and nodded a quick greeting. They bowed low in 
recognition and the tall Human smiled inwardly. There were certain perks to 
being a Mage in the Sorcerer King's direct service.

His robes picked up in the warm breeze and he thought about his first days here 
in Tyr. He had been so young then. Barely twenty years old and seeking power. 
Didn't every twenty year old lad seek power? He chuckled to himself. Sheer 
persistence got him an apprenticeship with one of the leading Mages in the 
Sorcerer King's service, and his potential was soon noticed by the Sorcerer 
King's advisor's. He had uncommon strength in his magic, they had said. Great 
strength of will, they had said. Once again he felt a burst of humor. He did 
indeed have those things - and so much more. More than they had imagined. Tiring 
of his tutor when he could teach him no more, he had challenged the old man to 
single combat and soundly beaten him. The quickness of which the battle took 
place had disturbed the onlookers, and as he had expected he soon received a 
summons from the Sorcerer King Kalak himself.

Over the next few years Kalak had personally seen to his tutelage and now he had 
finally achieved the power he sought. He was complete in his magic. He thought 
back to the day he cast his first spell. He could still remember the power. The 
way he could feel the energy in the vicinity rush into his body waiting to be 
controlled and expelled as he wished. He relished that feeling. Now walking 
along the main, dusty road of Tyr he relished that feeling again. A few muttered 
words and a gesture and he felt the euphoric influx of energy once more. A thin 
film of ash settled on the ground in a small circle around him and a small bolt 
of white light hit a passing beggar incinerating a hole in his chest.

Raynard Dionus, ArchMage and advisor to His Imperial Highness King Kalak of Tyr, 
watched the beggar fall. He glanced around momentarily to see if his actions 
were noticed. But then shrugging he resumed his walk. Another of his many perks, 
he reminded himself, and smiled.

****

His journey would be a long one, he thought as he boarded the caravan. During 
the weeks that it took for him to arrive at Raam he thought on this latest 
mission that his King had sent him on. To kill the famed Druid of the Green 
Oasis. Raynard had heard of the place, but had dismissed it for a myth. The 
Druid of the Green Oasis was supposed to guard a large piece of fertile land in 
the middle of the desert, north of Raam. The Oasis was also said to hold the 
gateway to a large iron mine. Iron. The most valuable commodity on Athas - and 
most of it would soon be his to control. The thought pleased the Mage. His mind 
once again turned to the matter at hand. From what he had heard, a seeker of the 
oasis had to specifically want to find it, and had to be alone. And then if the 
oasis so wished, it found you. Or at least that was how the rumors went. Raynard 
did not know of anyone who had found it and returned, but the thought only 
bothered him momentarily. It was an old tale. The Druid would have to be an old 
manby now. No match for Raynard's magic or cunning.  Watching the swirling sand 
as it caressed dune after dune on its passage across the desert, he fell asleep.

Raynard did not stay long in Raam.  Only taking time to restock his provisions 
before heading northwards. He wore long robes now, that almost covered his 
entire body. They kept the wind and the sand away as he began his trek 
northwards. Even this far out into the desert he mysteriously met no threat to 
his presence. The otherwise lethal Athasian sands were unusually still. Over the 
next week Raynard walked and searched. The few obstacles he ran into soon 
regretted it and he made good progress. But by the end of the week bitterness 
had set in. It was all proving to be an old wives tale after all. But when he 
woke up on the eighth day, he emerged from his tent onto moist soil, instead of 
sand.

Raynard took a moment to survey his surroundings.  It was not what he had 
expected. This place was - beautiful. The word came slowly and from far away in 
his mind. He looked at the bushes and the fruits and the grass growing on the 
ground. The whole, roughly circular, oasis was no more than one hundred meters 
in radius. He could see the sands blowing just beyond the edge of the oasis, but 
here the biting winds of the Athasian desert did not blow. It was almost surreal 
and somewhat - grand. Another word he had not thought of in many years. There 
were sages who said that the whole of Athas had once looked like this. Raynard 
shook himself out of his meanderings violently, and his regular pattern of 
thoughts pushed through to the surface again. Preposterous! He thought of the 
iron and the wealth and the possibility of a green Athas rapidly dwindled.

He took a few steps around the nearest boulder and there seated in front of him 
was an old man. He was wearing a golden robe and a long, ancient beard grew from 
his chin. Small, bright eyes watched Raynard approach and an aged, wrinkled hand 
lifted in greeting. Raynard almost burst into laughter. This was the famed 
Druid?! 

"Yes I am the Keeper of the Green Oasis," replied the old man.

Raynard stopped for a moment in contemplation. So the old man could read 
thoughts to some extent. He opened his mouth to speak but the old man beat him 
to it.

"I know why you are here." he said sighing heavily, "You come as others before 
you have come, in search of wealth and fame." 

Raynard leapt forward at the word 'fame', a dagger appearing out of the folds of 
his robes into his hand, stabbing at the figure of the old man. But he had 
disappeared. "You cannot kill me that way," came a voice behind him. Raynard 
whirled to find the old man standing a little way behind him. "So be it then old 
one," Raynard snarled, "we will do it your way."

"On the sand," came the reply.

"What?" Raynard asked puzzled.

"We will fight on the sand."

Raynard followed the old man out of the oasis, and into the desert. The faced 
each other now. Raynard a little taken aback with the turn of events and the old 
man tall and regal in his golden robes, in front of him. But the Mage didn't 
hesitate for long. He had always adapted to situations as they changed and 
although it seemed that this old man was going to be more trouble than he had 
thought, he felt no fear. Summoning his will he called for his magic and felt 
the influx of energy from his surroundings as he formed a magical shield around 
his body. A thin layer of ash settled on the sand nearest him and his mouth 
widened imperceptible into the beginnings of a smile. The old man shook his head 
sadly and summoned his own magic from within him. There was no ash surrounding 
him though. His was the magic of life not death. 

The ensuing battle was fearsome to behold. Great bolts of lightning crashed at 
the old Druid who returned the attacks with swirling winds and fire.  Summoned 
creatures fought and died for their masters as one tried to gain supremacy over 
the other. Both men danced an dodged each others attacks as magical shields were 
battered down and new ones were erected in their place. They fought thus for a 
long time.

The Druid looked almost fatigued to the point of death. His already old and 
wrinkled features were drawn with the strain and he wavered more and more under 
each attack from the vile Mage. Raynard himself was at the end of his magical 
repertoire. He had relished this fight. The old man was strong! He had not had 
this much of a challenge in a very long time. Still, it was time to end it. 
Raynard summoned his last ounce of power and channelled a huge magical bolt of 
energy at the Druid's chest. It struck the shield in front of the old man and 
was absorbed but destroying the shield in the process. Now Raynard chose to play 
his greatest advantage. He summoned his enormous will inside him and mentally 
evoked a tremendous blow to his opponent's psyche. 

Yet once again the old man's mind rose to the challenge building up a psychic 
wall to hold against the Mage's bombardment. Enraged, Raynard increased his 
attack with a scream. He pulled at the Druids very soul and launched both of 
their spirits into an alternate dimension. Quasi-energy replicas of both Druid 
and Mage faced each other in the new battlefield. Raynard formed a thought into 
a great scythe and swung it at the Druid. The old man erected a huge wall with a 
thought and met the scythe full force. The wall shuddered - and held. Another 
thought transformed the wall into a whip and it was sent cracking towards the 
Mage. Raynard turned his scythe into a giant fist and caught the whip in 
mid-air. A hail of black arrows rose from Raynard's psyche and rained on the old 
Druid who in his turn erected a great shield as his defence, but in his intense 
concentration to keep the arrows away he missed the spear. Channelled by 
Raynard's thoughts the spear struck the unsuspecting Druid in his exposed chest. 
Raynard quickly followed the attack with a huge hammer aimed at the old man's 
shield. Weakened from the psychic spear the Druid's will finally gave way. His 
shield burst into a million pieces on impact from the hammer and the great iron 
head of the Mage's psychic weapon landed heavily on the Druid. Both spirits were 
launched heavily back into their bodies.

The old man crumpled into the sand - lifeless. Raynard, exhausted beyond 
anything he had ever known, dropped to his knees with his head in his hands. 
"Raynard" came the quiet voice in his head. Raynard jerked his head up to look 
at the dead Druid. As he watched a small thin wisp of smoke rose from the Druids 
body. It grew filling out in form and shape until it was an enormous golden 
creature with a large, beautiful snout filled with rows of teeth. Four legs 
supported a body rippling with muscles and a long tail lay curled on the ground 
around it. It's body shone metallic in the light of the Athasian sun and Raynard 
paralyzed with fear could only watch.

Large eyes watched him without moving and the tail came around in impatience, 
its point not far from Raynard's face. "You.." he stammered.

"Yes Raynard," came the soothing voice again. "I am a gold dragon. The last of 
my kind on Athas."

"But...I killed you. I won." came the weak reply.

The enormous figure of the Dragon shook in laughter. "You lost the moment you 
set foot on my oasis, defiler" came the soft reply. "How do you think this place 
was created?" continued the Druid turned Dragon. 

"But the rumors. The iron?"

"I started the rumors and there was never any iron."

A single large claw extended towards Raynard and a little trickle of electricity 
crackled towards Raynard's head.

Head thrown back Raynard was forced to watch the vision that the Dragon weaved 
in his mind. He saw Athas in all its dusty glory. He saw the great sand dunes 
and the beasts that roamed them. He was suddenly taken back to a time when the 
now dusty ground was covered in green grass, thriving forests and great lakes of 
water. He saw the flowers as they bloomed, the birds as they sang and stood 
under great torrents of rain as it washed down on him from the sky. He smelled 
the green grass and marvelled at the waves that crashed into the shores. 

Then suddenly he was thrown again into a different place. Hooded men walked the 
grasslands turning them into ash and dust. He saw them cast spells and with each 
burst of magic he saw a bit of grass vanish. With each incantation a portion of 
a lake evaporated. The rain stopped falling. The birds stopped singing. The 
great sun turned hot and red.

Behind the hooded figures walked others in green trying to bring back that which 
was destroyed. Suddenly the initial figures turned on these others and destroyed 
them too. Then laughing they continued their destruction. Great sadness filled 
Raynard and for the first time in his life a single tear rolled down his 
hardened face. As the figures neared he tried to call out to them and tell them 
to stop this madness. But when they turned to him and waved it was as if they 
were long time friends. Coming closer they removed their hoods and to his horror 
they all bore his face.

The vision ended and Raynard was once again looking at the huge figure of the 
Dragon. There was a long silence and once again the soft voice of the Dragon 
spoke. "It is time for you to give back a small portion of what you have taken 
Raynard." 

The wings of the great Dragon lifted and his huge body rose majestically into 
the air in front of Raynard. "I am Terivindel, " boomed the voice, "Keeper of 
the Green Oasis and Preserver of Life. And you Raynard must now die in order to 
return some of the life you robbed from this world." Breathing in sharply the 
Dragon rolled his body into a knot and breathed out a great column of light 
directly at the Mage. Raynard began to disintegrate gradually. Dissolving into 
small particles he floated gently up to the Dragon. When the Mage no longer 
kneeled on the ground, Terivindel turned his great head and breathed down on his 
oasis. The borders of the Green Oasis extended a few feet more and a new tree 
rose out of the ground, towering high above the other plants on the oasis. "So 
Raynard," the Dragon mouthed, "there was some good in you after all." The leaves 
of the new tree shook gently at the Dragon as if in reply, and then all was 
still.

The Dragon came slowly towards the ground, and walked back towards his oasis. 
When he reached the green borders he was once again an old man. Proceeding 
calmly to the center of the oasis he caressed the bushes and flowers as he went 
by. Most turned towards him as he passed by and the vines and tall grasses 
turned aside to allow him passage. Coming to the new tree, he squatted down on 
his haunches, and slowly rocking back and forth - he started to sing.

DM's Advice
Earl Harrison <harrison@comsys.net>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I am very excited to tell you all that I have gotten quite a large 
response to my shareware package.  I do have to ask one favor, again.  Where are 
the responses coming back telling me if you like the package or not?  I know a 
few of you did not like it and a few of you are using it.  How about telling me 
if you do or do not like it.
	For those of you that have MIRC or similar program may log into the 
channel that I am at and chat with me.  I am on there every morning from 7-10a 
Indiana time.  My nickname is DungeonM and I am at "IRC.QUARTERDECK.COM" and 
the channel you will be looking for is "30+".  Hope to see some of you there.  I 
can create a new room if enough of you come over to play.  We could even get a 
big game going right there in the chat room.
	This month's article is going to be about something we are not very 
familiar with yet, but we are working on it everyday.  I am talking about 
"Birthright".  This game caught our eye like no other game TSR has put out in 
the last couple of years.  It is all of the other games put together.  It has 
the deserts of Dark Sun and the mystery of Ravenloft and the bizarre that is 
Planescape.  Please don't say mean things about me for saying that about 
Planescape.  I have only seen pictures and read small articles about it.  So I 
am only saying that based on the limited amount of work that I have read on 
the subject.
        Birthright is a game  that any player can get into.  It is full of all 
types of cultures, from the western civilizations to the orientals to the 
mysterious undead.  If you want a challenge then tackle one of the 
awnsheghlien.  There are artifacts waiting to be found and adventure 
everywhere.  The most important part of Birthright is the ability to rule your 
own kingdom.  My group will tell you that it is not easy.  There are so many 
things to do and so many things that the DM can do to you while you are 
ruling your kingdom.  Awnshe may attack you or you might be ambushed by 
another kingdom wanting to expand their domain.
	The army battles are even easier than the rest of the game.  You get 
your army cards and place them on your mat and then draw the combat cards. No 
dice involved.  When you first get the Birthright boxed set you only get 
enough cards to fill about 1/4 of the box that you are supposed to use for 
them.  We have bought enough extra material to fill this box.  We will have to 
get another box for them if TSR ever comes out with more cards.
	For those that don't think there is enough material out there to get 
you going has not been to their local hobby shop in the past few months.  TSR 
is putting out domain books.  What these are is one section of the entire 
continent outlined.  They tell the history, politics, rumors, NPC's and a slew 
of other things to keep that domain going strong for years to come. There is 
even a map of the domain for those that just wish to pass through.  Next they 
have a half dozen modules.  I don't recommend getting these to early in your 
quest to learn the game.  They are much to hard for beginning DM's and players 
to play.  There are a few kit books out there, and I am sure there will be 
more to come.
	I highly recommend looking into this new realm of magic and wonder. 
If you don't do it for you then do it for your players.  I am sure they will 
thank you for giving them somewhere new to adventure.  The entire package is 
very well done.  There is enough maps in the boxed set to keep you going for 
sometime.  They have to be the best maps that TSR has ever done.  My group 
keeps coming back for more of this great continent.  They do not want to play 
our old world anymore.

Status Report
David Knisley <bean6@ix.netcom.com>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hail and well met.  I haven't published an article for a couple of
months and I thought it was about time I share some of the progress we are
making in several areas.  Firstly we are adding five new channel operators to
the undernet channel #IRPS.  This means the channel will be monitored virtually
around the clock now, so make sure you go in and check it out.  Secondly the
On-line city is progressing nicely and we are only a couple of weeks away from
having the Website up and running.  The site will have at the very least a
dedicated ISDN line, but most likely a leased line running at 56kbps, which
will be ideal.  By the publication of the next IRPS newsletter we will be
looking for testers for the On-line city.  I will tell you that we will be
carefully screening play testers as this will be quite an honor.  As a result
if you are interested in test driving the site, polish up your resume and be
ready to submit it.  We are planning on taking only 15-20 people to test the
site initially.  If you would like to see some of the progress that is being
made you may check out the temporary server at
http://wki.accumem.com:81/jelhan/
	Finally I would like to thank everyone that is a member of the IRPS
for showing the enthusiasm to make our Society the largest single role-playing
body on the Web.  You all deserve a big round of applause.  See ya next
month!!!


                                The game grows.
                                David Knisley

On the Shoulders of Giants
Bruce Sheffer <bsheffer@arthritis.org>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When exploring alternate worlds or dimensions you may meet what
seems to be your double.  I see this occurring basically in six different
ways:

1)	There is someone with the same appearance but due to differences in 
birth and upbringing, are totally different than yourself.

2)	There is someone who looks completely different but is you in all
other ways (holds the same job, same upbringing, same grades, same friends, 
etc.).  This assumes that the world is identical to Earth in all significant 
ways, including social trends, inventions, even celebrities and movies.  
This has the possibility to completely weird the players out (especially if 
that person is of the opposite sex), since all the evidence except their eyes 
convinces them that this true.  Usually, seeing is believing, but not here.

3)	There is someone who is you on a completely parallel world, but made a 
choice in the past that sent them in a completely different direction.  This 
can also be done in worlds where the time is advanced (say 20 years in the 
future) and an event still to happen has radically changed the course of your 
expected life -  the life you would have lived if you did not become an 
explorer (for example).  I really teased one guy by saying that he had become 
a male prostitute on an alternate world.  The player didn't want to think that 
anything could force him down that path, so be careful.  RPG's are supposed to 
be fun.

4)	There is someone who looks like you and acts like you even though the 
world's history is totally different.  Has the same taste in partners, music, 
food, sports, and literature.  May even have followed the same career or 
another interest that you have but never pursued.  However, everything else 
is different.

5)	There is your identical self in the same world, same everything, but 
time is retarded and you are seeing a younger (perhaps happier) version of 
yourself.  Do you warn yourself about tragedies still to come, try to get 
him to make the decisions you wish you had made?

6)     There is yourself exactly as you are.  Lots of folks really don't like
themselves so would probably hate having to deal with an externalized version 
of themselves (especially if they had a tendency to use other people and 
would now be exploited by this duplicate of themselves).

	As you can see, there are lots of possibilities for adventure and
confusion.  Multiply this by the number of player characters and the tangle 
may never be unwound without Alexander the Great's solution to the puzzle knot.

More Than Just Dice:  A look at Your Character's Personality
Jay Collins    <backburn@earthlink.net>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Have you been having trouble trying to get the feel of your character? 
Face it, everyone gets into this dilemma whether you're a beginner or a novice 
to role-playing games. Sure you've had a lot of characters by now, and some of 
them seem very similar to each other in more ways than one. By looking at a 
character's Ability Scores we can determine different things about them.

        The numbers on your character sheet and the ones you roll in combat
are more than just numbers. They are what DEFINE your character. They decide 
whether you have enough charm to seduce the thick-witted bartender, and they 
determine whether you strike your opponent or miss. We are going to analyze 
and examine your character. Let's take a look at a typical generic AD&D 
character sheet (Some things are excluded on behalf that some are irrelevant 
to the article):


Name: Kaylin Gailswind      Age: 150                Eyes: Blue
Class/Race: Mage/Wood Elf   Hair: Black with hints of silver
Alignment: True Neutral     Weight: 110 lbs.        Level: 1
Sex: Male

Ability Scores:

Strength: 11
Int: 16
Dex: 10
Con: 9
Wis: 14
Cha: 7

Non-Weapon Proficiencies:
Spellcraft, Religion, Ancient History, Leatherworking

Weapon Proficiencies:
Quarterstaff
AC: 8 (leather)

THAC0: 20
Base: 20

There's your typical character sheet, with a few things taken out. Let's
begin to flesh out what Kaylin is like:

Name: Kaylin's name tends to be very exotic and foreign, not like one you
would find in large and overcrowded human populations. This is what leads
to his race.

Race/Class: Kaylin is a wood elf, and at a young age took an interest in
the tribal shaman's magic skills. With many years of hard work and
diligence, he learned to weave spells of magic.

Age: The only thing to be deducted from his age is that he is 150 years
old, and rather young for and Elf.

Weight: Kaylin weighing 11 pounds is a good average weight for an elf,
since they tend to be shorter than humans.

Alignment: Kaylin's  true neutral alignment suggests that he is easily
moved to either side of a situation and is neutral in all affairs, thus
being very indecisive in situations.

Ability Scores: Now comes the really important part, Kaylin's Ability
Scores. All in all you would sum Kaylin up as being moderately strong,
never really devoting himself to physical exercise, because of his studies.
He is extremely Intelligent due to years of meditation, and reading books
on all schools of magic has hardened his brain into complete focus. He is
moderately dexterous only choosing to run, or leap to escape the local
authorities in the nearest town for sneaking his way into the library. In
this particular town the elves of the nearby woods were shunned from the
community of humans. Coddled by his mother and father from birth, Kaylin
was never let outside to play with the other boys for fear of getting hurt,
but he soon recognized not to trifle with the law after his father sternly
reprimanded him for sneaking into the library. Spending most of his life
indoors, Kaylin wasn't exposed to lengthy talks with others or social
interaction and so his Charisma is atrocious. Reading all of those books
paid off, when it came to Wisdom. Though he was not able to experience
most of life's pleasure's Kaylin's books opened new worlds to him and he
experienced tragedy and triumph through the writers words.

From: telford@tusc.com.au

There was a discussion on R.G.F.D recently about thieves and their tools.
Someone mentioned that an accurate time-keeping device would be handy as
thieves need to know how long they have been picking locks, the time b/n guard
shifts, etc..  Anyway, from that discussion I invented the MetroGnome [sic] a
timekeeping device.  I haven't play tested it yet (it's only a day old) but will
soon.
Thought you might get a giggle.

Here ya go:

MetroGnome:
~~~~~~~~~~~

This small magical statuette was created by Theodore Humplesprain, a gnomish
Mage/Thief.  He was a very adept thief and decided to make a time-tracking
device to aid him in his exploits.

The MetroGnome is a small 2-inch statuette of Theodore himself that he wore
on a necklace.  When Theodore needed to accurately keep track of time (for the
opening of doors, timing guard movements, etc.) he activated the MetroGnome.

Pushing the tiny button on the statuette's belt buckle activates the timer
and the left eye begins to blink (a barely discernible violet glow) every
"second".  After 60 such blinks the right hand of the statuette opens and one 
digit is displayed.  After another 60 blinks the right hand displays a second 
digit, and so on.. After 5 of these transitions the right hand clenches into a 
fist once more, and the left fist opens and displays one digit.  The process 
begins anew.

After 30 minutes the left hand (now displaying 5 fingers) and the right hand 
(also displaying 5 fingers) clench and the right eye glows a dull green.
After another 30 minutes the right eye glows a dull red, then blue, then yellow,
and then back to off.

The glow from the eyes is barely discernible; virtually invisible at any
distance greater than over 5 feet. If so desired the user of the MetroGnome
can pull down the eyelids of the statuette and rely on the hands/finger
combinations and his/her own memory.

Pushing on the statuette's hat turns the Timer off (and resets it)

Theodore Humplesprain died in custody, and the statuette fell into the hands of
his wicked brother - who sold it to an adventuring party.  Where the statue is
now is anybody's guess (though DM's have a fair idea....)


LEFT HAND:

# Digits        Time (min.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
None            check right hand, 1 digit = 1 minute.
1               5 min. + right hand 
2               10 "   "   "     "
3               15 "   "   "     "
4               20 "   "   "     "
5               25 "   "   "     "
None            (eye turns green [30 min.] + right hand)
etc.

The Assassins - Graduation

Home Page:      http://www.ozemail.com.au/~goran/Roleplay.htm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Episode 1  -  Graduation.

NOTES:

Character:     Now I am talking.  (action is drawing a weapon) NOW I'M   
               YELLING.  {Now I am thinking to myself}

        ------------------------------------------------------

The Assassins: Argos - Human Thief 1st level LE (NPC)
               Craven - Human Duelist/Thief 1st/1st LE (PC)
               Keldirk - Human Thief 1st level NE (PC)

Locale:        An antechamber somewhere in the Olman Islands, the secret home
               of The Family, a worldwide network of assassins.

Date:          3rd Ready'reat 581 CY (Common Year)


        ------------------------------------------------------

Craven, Keldirk and Argos sip wine and nervously await their first audience with
The Heart of Darkness, known to his followers as The Marquee de'Ahb or
Grandfather of All Assassins. Having recently finished their apprenticeships,
they expect to learn where on the Flanaess they will begin their careers.

Craven:        (looks anxiously at the huge bronze doors that lead to the
               audience chamber.  He adjusts his collar for the tenth time)

Argos:         So, what's he like?

Keldirk:       Who? The Marquee de'Ahb?

Argos:         (nods)

Keldirk:       How in hell am I supposed to know, I haven't met him either.

Craven:        I once heard some of the elders talking about him, he's really
               old... ancient in fact, and extremely powerful.  They said that
               he has been ruling over the family for over a century.

Argos:         (whistles in amazement) He can't be human.

Listening to their conversation from just outside the room was Shardan, the
Chamberlain's assistant.  He had been sent to speak with the graduates
instructing them on the proper conduct when presented to their leader. He was
also told to explain something of the Marquee de'Ahb to them.

Shardan:       (enters the room) Oh he's human enough... but more than that
               now I feel.  You three will be presented to him in a short
               while and I have been instructed to prepare you.  My name is
               Shardan, I am the assistant to the Chamberlain.  The Marquee
               de'Ahb is, as you know, the head of our Family. He wears the
               cloak of office which bestows certain gifts to the wearer. One
               of the gifts is longevity.

               This cloak is called the Vilus Corumdak, translated it means
               "The Cloak of the Vanquished".  It is made from the faces of
               our most prized targets, which have been removed from the
               victim as you have been taught.  These faces are cured then
               sewn to the hem of the Cloak.  It is believed that the Cloak
               allows the wearer to communicate with the spirits of those
               whose faces are part of it.

               (pauses to gauge the reaction of the three graduates)

               When the Chamberlain summons you, make sure you are ready; The
               Marquee de'Ahb does not like to be kept waiting.  Do not speak
               unless he invites you to do so and above all else show him the
               respect he deserves.  The Grandfather has ruled our family for
               well over 100 years; he deserves and demands respect.  In his
               time he has slain hundreds of people, from beggars to kings,
               and in recent times killed a number of insolent graduates.
               Watch what you say and do.  This meeting is your final test.
               Survive this and you will truly be an assassin.

Shardan leaves and the three graduates are left alone to contemplate their
future.  Not only will this meeting formally mark the end of their
apprenticeship and elevate them to an active member of the family, but it will
also define where they will spend the next several years.

The prize for all assassins is to be posted to the Free City of Greyhawk.
Ordinarily a new graduate would never be posted there but rumor has it, one
of the Family's operatives was recently killed in Greyhawk and it has been
decided he will be replaced by a graduate.  That prize could be been given
to any
of the three who now sat waiting for their meeting.

* Argos - arguably the best proponent of the crossbow that the assassins have
ever trained.  This ability would serve him well in the crowded city affording
him great opportunities to make the kill.
* Craven - graduated second overall, and his unique blend of combat and
assassination make him a strong contender for the position.
* Keldirk - Graduated prematurely.  His early initiation indicates that the
elders have big plans for him.  That could mean he is due to be posted to
Greyhawk.

More time passes and the three graduates are became increasingly restless.
Keldirk resists the urge to consume his fourth glass of wine, while Craven
began pacing the length of the small antechamber. Argos, sits comfortably,
seemingly oblivious to the situation, only the constant twitching of his
foot betrays his nervousness.

Keldirk:       I hate all this waiting... what is he doing?

Argos:         (to Craven) You know that Xavier is in there?

Craven:        What? Oh hell... if that son-of-a-bitch says anything we could
               be looking at some serious trouble.

Argos:         (looking innocent) What's this WE business? It's you he hates.

Craven:        Well the feeling is more than mutual.

Keldirk:       Who's Xavier?

Argos:         He's the guy who graduated ahead of Craven.

Keldirk:       I like him already.

Craven:        Ever since I beat him in the battle royale, he's been trying
               to make everyone think I cheated.  He says that I organized his
               downfall with Argos... and that's the only way I managed to
               win.

Keldirk:       Not a bad idea... I guess it worked.

Craven:        IT NEVER HAPPENED! He lost because he got careless... and
               that's all there is to it.  Its just that he can't accept that
               he got beaten.' (to Argos) 'If he spreads his crap to the
               Marquee de'Ahb we could be in deep trouble.

Argos:         Again with this WE business.  Just leave me out of it... the
               last thing I want is for the Marquee de'Ahb to focus his
               attention on me.  If things go bad I'm afraid you're on your
               own.

Craven:        Thanks buddy - It's good to know where your loyalties are.

Craven's statement was interrupted by the opening of the bronze doors that
lead into the main audience chamber.  A middle aged man enters their room and
addresses the three of them.

Man:           Gentlemen, I am Montlebahn Criss, the Marquee de'Ahb's
               Chamberlain. The time has come for you to be presented to The
               Marquee de'Ahb. Ready yourselves for I will announce you
               presently.

Keldirk:       (stands and stretches his arms above his head)

Craven:        (smooths down his clothes and adjusts his weapons)

Argos:         (quickly finishes his drink and rises)

Montlebahn:    If you would follow me.

They walk into the audience chamber and are formally presented to the Marquee
de'Ahb, the Grandfather of All Assassins.  He sits upon a large golden throne
and beckons them to rise from their positions of supplication. The Vilus
Corumdak all but covers the old, wizened man and all three take a quick
intake of breath as they look upon his skeletal visage. Montelbahn Criss exits
through a curtain.

Marquee de'Ahb: (his voice barely a whisper) Welcome to my Family.  You have
               each worked hard and long, and to stand before me is testimony
               to your discipline and prowess.  I am proud.

               (looks to Craven) You have done well, Craven of Karaban.
               Bladesmaster Kyam counts you as the best student in many years.
               Your skills in assassination require some work; but I am
               confident they will come in time.

               (looks to Argos) You are somewhat of an enigma; your history
               is clouded but I cannot deny your courage or desire to succeed.
               Your loyalty to The Family was established on Kallmaird Beach;
               to which Craven will attest.  I am pleased to call you
               Grandchild.

               (looking to Keldirk) You are a young graduate, by any standard
               and you are yet to complete your studies.  But you, like your
               colleagues, have shown great promise and come to me with your
               Tutor's glowing recommendation.

               (looks at each assassin in turn, then slowly floats out of his
               chair, the 20' long Vilus Corumdak flowing like a macabre
               wedding train behind him.  He floats to the rear of the chamber
               where a large mural hangs.  The mural is a detailed map of the
               Flanaess)

               The situation on the continent is grave.  Ordinarily I would
               offer you your choice of cities to begin your career.  However,
               I no longer have that luxury.  My agents in Rauxes have
               informed me that Mad Ivid and his council are preparing for
               war.  This means more work for us, naturally.  I have been
               forced to relocate an agent from the Prelacy of Almor to The
               Great Kingdom in anticipation of increased workload.  This
               agent was very experienced, and you three will be taking her
               place in Eastern Almor.

               (waves a bony hand, little more than a claw, to the region
               known as The Prelacy of Almor)

               The Prelacy is trapped between hammer and anvil.  To the East
               lies Ivid the Insane, his fiendish council and the multitude of
               power hungry Noble Families intent on conquest both within and
               without The Great Kingdom.  To the West lies the Kingdom of
               Nyrond - with its armored oppressors and war-loving King.  In
               the middle lies The Prelacy of Almor, the once battle ground of
               these military giants.

               As you know the peace in the region relies upon Almor's
               neutrality and its willingness to side with the non-aggressor
               in any war between the two.  If war breaks out, say at the
               behest of Ivid, Almor will close it's borders to The Great
               Kingdom and welcome Nyrond.  The peace also hinges on Ivid's
               constant need to defend his throne and the perpetual threat of
               The Bandit Kingdoms north of Nyrond... ..

               I have made arrangements for you to leave for your posts in two
               days, time is of the essence and I can not afford you the
               luxury of rest before you become useful to us.  Montlebahn will
               provide you the specifics of your assignment.  For now, go with
               my blessing and know that you are being groomed for a more
               important duty.

The curtain opens again and the Chamberlain enters.  He nods before his
lord and indicates to the three assassins that they are to follow. He leads
them out of the audience hall, through the curtain and into another room which
contains a desk and three chairs.  He motions for them to be seated and
begins hunting through some papers on his desk. The room was a shrine to order.
The shelves, the desk even the tapestries which hung on the walls seemed to
have been purposely placed.  There was no clutter anywhere, even though the
desk was covered with items, everything was exactly where it was meant to be,
and it was only seconds before Montlebahn had the paper he was looking for.

Montlebahn:    You have been booked passage aboard a vessel called The Sea
               Swift. It will arrive off the main jetty at dawn the day after
               next.  The journey is expected to take around two weeks at
               which time you will arrive in Chathold. Chathold is the capital
               city of Almor, it will appear strange to you as I know that
               none of you have been in a city of that size in many years.
               Once there you will contact a man called Don Lombard.  He is a
               trader, he owns a business in the Trade Ward.  He has requested
               that all contacts be made at his business, should it prove
               impossible to contact him there he resides in a house in the
               Common Quarter.  The address is on here along with an inventory
               of provisions you will be issued with.'  (hands Craven a piece
               of paper) 'He is expecting you and he will provide you with
               additional instructions.

               I understand that there will be a celebration to mark your
               graduation tomorrow evening.  I trust the three of you will be
               ready to leave the next day, I do not care if you are
               unconscious just do not miss that boat. Any questions?

Keldirk:       Just one.  Are we supposed to all work together? I was kind of
               hoping that I would get to work alone.

Montlebahn:    (smiles) Ordinarily, yes that would be the case... but in
               this situation you will be required to work as a team.  On
               occasion it may be advantageous for one of you to work alone,
               but that will be determined by the situation.

               If there is nothing else, I will leave you to your own devices
               until you are due on board the ship.  The equipment on that
               list will be delivered to your quarters tomorrow evening.

               Congratulations... You are dismissed.

Journal of Fireside Tales; Tales from the Tyrellian Helix (Ix's tale)

My companions and I  had entered  a subterranean complex beneath the lost city
of Altharez.   My companions were a roguish bunch: there was Cimion the leprous,
beggar-thief; Toliape, Mistress of the Mystical Arts of Ulion; Demetriv, former
leader of a mercenary company that had turned mutinous; and of course the one
handed sociopath, Varsen the Pirate.
We were following Paeani, a blind mystic.  Our directions in our quest through
the tunnels of this mysterious subterranean maze for came from the visions of
Paeani who would  relate this information in the most annoying fashion.  He
would chant out strange rhyming riddles, which the rest of us were obliged to
solve.  We finally came to the Chamber of  Echoes, the object of our quest.
Here was supposedly the "Fabled Treasure of the Ages" whose very name caused
spittle to dribble over our greedy lips. The chamber had been carved out of the
living rock into a perfect dodecahedron.  Each side was painted with a detailed
landscape that seems so perfectly executed that you could almost walk into the
scene.  There was on the various walls
  A Desert scene;
  A tropical atoll;
  A sylvan wood;
  A forbidding tundra;
  A chilling boreal woodland scene;
  A great expanse of open ocean stirred by a squall;
  A scene of floating islands in clouds topped with cities grown out of living
    crystals,
  A sprawling metropolis of canals, spires, ziggurats, hanging gardens, graceful
    flying buttresses  and archways, sky walks linking towers;  This decorates
    the floor.
  A lonely moor with a lichen covered cromlech
  A purplish range of majestic snow-capped mountains
  A craggy arid landscape of mesas and canyons under a multi-hued expansive sky
  A dreary swamp of gnarled trees and hanging Spanish moss

The hall was very large.  It  seemed to echo with the sounds of the various
scenes.  It quickly became an overwhelming experience.  Their faces ashen, my
comrades fledpanicked from the chamber, but  I remained, fascinated.  I felt
particularly drawnto a strange platform in the center of the chamber.  It bore
a large mounted cylinder wrapped with twelve interwoven spirals of various
runes.  The spirals were comprised of connecting plates carved with curious and
disturbingly alien runes.  The colors were: Russet, Azure, Aquamarine, Emerald,
Hazel, Amber, Mauve, Damask, Ebony, Tope, Vermilion,  and Lavender.  On the
platform lay the miniature of this object.  On the polar ends of the cylinder
were inscribed runes.   On one end was the symbol of Infinity, on the other
side, nothingness.  The device seemed to be some sort of puzzle and with the
horrible cacophony pounding maddeningly in my ears  I felt overwhelmingly
compelled to begin to solve the puzzle.  The colors twisted and slid about like
the Puzzle Box of Rubric, and the sound of the room began to suddenly feel
washed out as if muffled.  The room also began to blur into blotches of the
twelve colors of the helix.  Only the puzzle helix remained real for me as I
continued to  work on it with fevered urgency.  At the moment  I completed the
puzzle I felt as if I was falling through any inky black void.  The puzzle
cylinder fell from my grasp and my consciousness drifted away.  As I begin to
waken  I heard a strange sounding voice speaking an alien tongue that I
mysteriously understood. Only the last words were directed toward me, they were:
Welcome Home.

As the sun set in the West, an old hermit was beginning a long and arduous
journey Eastward.  He travelled in an old weather worn wagon pulled by an even
older horse.  Within the wagon the hermit carried all of his worldly possessions;
two trunk fulls of clothing and personal effects.  Among the items in the trunks
were ceremonial skulls, candles, various herbs, roots, dried leaves, etc...all
for use in the magical rituals which the hermit partook in regularly.  He also
carried in the wagon a trunk full of treasure and one enormously large leather
bound book of extreme importance.

But among all these items none was more important than the small bundled up form
of a sleeping infant child.

The infant had been conjured and given life by the hermit in his most powerful
acts of magic ever.  He was the oldest and most knowledgeable of the Druids in
Terra Firma and as he neared death, one of the last truly magickal feats the
hermit performed was to create the child to carry on his legacy.

He thought back now to the day of her conjuring.  It was early spring and life
was blooming all about the land, the druid however felt this was to be his last
spring for he had grown old and the end for him grew near.  As a druid, the old
man had sworn to protect the land and her secrets.  He remained today as the
eldest of the druids, whose numbers diminished daily, and knew he must pass the
knowledge of his experience and the land's secrets on to someone worthy.  Yet he
felt none of the current druids were worthy.  Thus his plan to create one who
was worthy was formulated.

The child had been born of the earth, the eternal mother.  Through his summoning
of a tree , a young white oak sapling, the old hermit had begun to formulate his
spell.  At his command the tree uprooted itself and went towards the hermit.
This white oak would serve as the skeleton for her new life form.

The druid began his incantation and an eerie violet fire flooded from his finger
tips to envelope the sapling and entwine it's roots and branches, decreasing
it's size and forming the framework of quasi-bones upon which the magician
would build.  The violet light writhed among the branches as leaves folded in
upon themselves which in turn enveloped branches and intertwined with other
branches to form limbs and torso.

The skeletal structure was complete and the druid chose to use the earth itself
as substance for this soon to be life form.  He called upon the land's own skin,
the soil and rocks to give form to this figure and strength to it's frame.  The
earth gathered in crooks and crevasses upon the wooden frame as is lifted by
invisible hands and filled out the frail form.  Rocks filled gaps to serve as
muscle and lend the strength of the land itself to this child.

Now the druid called upon a different magic as he summoned the land's moisture
to serve as the fluids necessary to sustain this body.  The skin must be supple
and smooth, and so the hermit formed the child's skin from the tiniest, most
precious flowers in all the land.

And when he had finished what stood before him was the most breathtakingly
beautiful woman he had ever seen with the darkest hair imaginable and deep
crystal clear emerald green eyes.

However the body before him had no life yet within it.

The druid knew that to provide the life spark to his creation he must summon a
magic not used in all his lifetime and for many lifetimes before his birth.  A
magic older than the land itself, embedded deep within the earth's core.
The druid summoned the Magic of Life.

And it did answer.

The life giving magic burst forth from the ground to envelope the druid in a
whirlwind of oranges and blues, yellows and reds.  A true myriad of spectral
colors.  The magic threatened to overtake the druid with it's power but as he
was about to lose all, the druid harnessed the very essence of life and sent it
forth from his hands to the lifeless girl before him.

The flames at once ate up the frail form of the girl and entombed her body in
sheath of white hot light which grew to such an intensity that the hermit was
forced to shield his eyes with the cloak he wore.

All at once there was a silent explosion of white light.  The energy burst
forth from the girl in every direction and was instantly gone.

When the druid was again able to look, what he saw left him momentarily stunned.
On the ground where the beautiful raven-haired girl had stood not moments before,
there now rested an even more beautiful infant.  The infant was sleeping and
wrapped in leaves.  Upon examined the sleeping child the druid found she
possessed the same icy emerald green eyes and raven black hair as the woman.
However there was now a snow white streak in the otherwise black hair on the
babe's head.

The druid had gathered the babe and returned to his home, shaking his head in
disbelief.  He had dealt with the forces of magic for his entire adult life yet
this magickal miracle had taken him by surprise.

The druids home was in a grove stand of evergreen trees and as he entered the
front door to his humble shack, he frantically searched for a clean place to
lay the child.  Debris was strewn everywhere, books and vials containing left
over spell components, skulls stacked on shelves and tables, leaves and twigs
mixed in with robes and swaths of satin and cloth lay about the one room
shack.  The hermit hastily swept a pile of cloth onto the floor and lay the
wonder child upon a long oak table.  He took one of the swaths of satin from
the floor and wrapped the child in it, for warmth as much as to keep her from
rolling off the table top.  He then dragged a chair over to the table's edge
and sat in front of the babe, wondering at the marvel of this creation at his
hands.  The elder sat in the chair watching the child for merely a few minutes
before slipping off to sleep. The druid slept uneasily, troubled by dreams.  In
his dreams he saw much destruction and at the center of all the chaos stood a
mature version of the babe.  This troubled the druid's subconscious mind and he
awoke with a start.  He calmed himself and checked to ensure the infant was
still asleep.  The child slept on, uninterrupted and the druid lay down to fall
asleep once again.  And the dreams continued.

The druid dreamed of himself this time however.  He dreamed himself in a
grove of trees, surrounded on all sides by dark and evil beings not of human
form.  Surely demons he thought.  And they sought to take the babe which the
elder held against his frail chest.  In his dream the druid was extremely aged
with many weaknesses and he knew he could not protect the child.  He stood
helpless against this menace as the creatures closed the circle about him.
They lunged forward, attacking and the old man screamed.

There was a sudden blink of light in his dream and the druid found himself
alone and standing before a heavenly, luminescent figure.

"You must leave this land, druid," the angel spoke to him,"take the babe away
from here to a place where she will be safe.  There you must leave her to
discover her legacy on her own.  Your teachings will be of no avail to this
child for she shall overcome even your great command of the land's magic.
Evil has been summoned with your use of the One Great Power.  Evil as powerful
as the good you have created with this summoning.  And this evil shall seek to
have the child and her strength for it's own use.  You must take the child and
leave, hide her and leave her to save her life."

Then the light faded and the druid stood once again in the grove of tree stand
before him stood the grown up child and the druid spoke to her.
"This, child you shall remember when i am gone: yours is the power of the earth.
None shall equal it.  Use it to create and prosper and be not tempted by the
evil which hunts you even now and will not rest until one or both of you is
destroyed.  I have blessed you and cursed you with this gift of life.  Sleep now
and when you awaken your life will begin anew."

The druid awoke from his sleep and heeding the dream's warning began 
preparations for their departure.

He rode now in the wagon with the child in the back, covered and sleeping.  They
travelled North-Easterly with no destination in mind.  Thoughts flooded the
druids mind as the wagon rumbled along the grassy terrain.  Most prevalent among
those thoughts was the alarming rate at which he was aging.  He had grown older
and more decrepit as the journey wore on.  And he noticed the child had grown
also.  For as frail and wrinkled as he had become, the babe had developed and
grown in equal proportion to the point where she now resembled a pre-adolescent
girl.  And she slept the entire trip thus far.  Seemingly the druid had
sacrificed his existence to give this child life.  His once dark wavy hair was
now long and pure white, as were the beard and moustache he wore.  His cheeks
were now sunken and his nose was long and thin where once his profile had been
proud and handsome.  His brows now furrowed over his eyes and clouded their deep
blue color.  His bones had grown old and brittle and his skin had dried and
shrivelled with each passing day while the child grew bigger and stronger.
Nearly a full moon's length of days had passed when the hermit knew he could
continue no further.  Finding a copse of trees nearby, the druid led the horse
and carriage into the shaded cover of their branches.  Here he climbed down from
the wagon and freed the horse.  Then the druid prepared his death rite.
He lie side by side with his daughter upon his lover, the earth and died.
As the warm soothing grip of death took hold of him, the druid again saw the
angel, and she again spoke to him.

"You have done well old one.  The child will be free to learn of her legacy as
she wishes and she shall escape harm.  Sleep now, keeper of the land, let
yourself go.  I hold a restful place for you here.  A place of warmth and
beauty. Come to me now, let death take you into her loving arms.  Die with me
Paolo." And he did.

At the moment of the old druid's passing, the young raven haired woman awoke.
Her eyes opened to the clear blue sky above.  She drew in her first breath of
fresh air and sat up.  Looking around the clearing, the beauty saw an old
weathered wagon.  Beside the wagon stood an aged grey horse grazing on the grass
at his feet.  She noticed a bundle of dried leaves and twigs lying in the grass
next to her and knew instinctively that this was the remains of the druid.  She
took in the grace and beauty of the trees encircling her, the scents of pine and
heather in the air and the sounds of birds singing and creatures scurrying
through the underbrush.  The dark haired woman knew these things innately, knew
what birds and trees and creatures of the forest were.  She knew from where her
knowledge came.  And she felt a pang of loss in her heart for the old man.
Her eyes fell upon the wagon.  Rising to her feet, the beauty strode towards the
wooden cart without a sound.  She looked through the back of the wagon and found
trunks full of clothing and treasure, as well as the large leather bound book.
At once she knew that the book was meant to be read by her and she climbed into
the wagon, settling on a blanket upon the floor.  She set the book on her lap
and opened it.  At once she was flooded with a deluge of memories of the old
druid and his home.  She felt a strong connection to the old man but could not
recall the basis for it so she stored these memories deep in her subconscious
mind for later consideration and began to read the book.

Inside the front cover was an inscription dedicating the book to her.
"To the greatest fruit of my labor, my lovely daughter, Rae Dawn Snoe. Be wise."
It was not signed.

Again she felt the pains of great loss but could not connect them with anything
she knew.

She turned the first page and was at once absorbed by the words written there.
For thirteen full cycles of the moon she read without interruption.  And when
she finished and closed the book, the tome magically consumed itself in a blaze
of beautiful violet flames so that all was left of it was a handful of ashes,
which she gathered up and deposited in a small pouch to be carried at her side
at all times.

She knew now that she was called Rae Dawn.  And she knew a great many other
things which she had no use for now but was certain through this knowledge that
she would have a use for it in the future.  She knew of the land she was in and
it's history and the aspects of nature which surrounded her world.  She knew of
the energies within the core of the land and how it could be used for prosperity
and harm.  And she knew that this power surged through her body at this very
moment.  She felt at akin to the land and knew she would give herself completely
to protect it and it's secrets.

This power within her was strong an she felt the need to release it.  She felt
also that if she released it that the power itself would consume her and all her
surroundings.  This power could be harnessed though she felt and she must know
more of it an it's abilities.

So it was that on a warm sunny day in late summer Rae Dawn Snoe, born of the
union between her father Paolo and mother Earth, set out to discover the truth
behind her being an the  energy which brimmed within her.

And she did this with an urgency she could not comprehend.

Let the journey begin.

I've an image that people could grab if they're interested.  On my main page at 
www.he.net/~bdrag, I made an image that shows me as a member of the IRPS, and 
it links to the IRPS page.  Just thought I'd mention it in case other people 
want to use it to link back to the IRPS page!

If you remember the last issue, we sent out a call for help in developing an
online world. Since that time we have gathered quite a group of people
together to start the development. I would like to let you know how we are
doing and see if there are any other interested parties out there.
We have identified a new web address and a dedicated server to host the new
online universe. We are also detailing a small village scenario to host the
first alpha of the product. Our coding team is diligently at work getting the
host site prepared and some of the basic ActiveX applets and scripts developed.
One area we could sure use some help in is developing realistic graphics for
the site. If anyone out there wants some exposure, here is your opportunity.
We are excited to see where this development will take us, because we think we
have found a new paradigm for Internet gaming. We have taken all of the good
features of MUDs, PBeMs, and chat rooms and tried to combine them in a computer
assisted role-playing environment that we think everyone will enjoy. Whether
you like medieval times, futuristic zones, or space combat, this could possibly
become your favorite bookmark when it becomes available.
I would like to get some idea of who would want to participate in an alpha test
when we have finished the development. Please respond with the subject WEBVERSE
ALPHA: and send your mail directly to mailto://grafx1@airmail.net/In your mail
answer these questions:
- Would you really pay to play an online game?
- If so, how much?
- If the game were free, would you contribute ideas, graphics, and NPCs to keep
it alive?
- If your PC were successful in the game, what rewards would you expect?
- What do you like the most about online games?
- What do you dislike the most about online games?
- What speed is your Internet connection?
