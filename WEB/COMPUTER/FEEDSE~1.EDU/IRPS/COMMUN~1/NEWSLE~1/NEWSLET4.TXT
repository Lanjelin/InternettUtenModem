IRPS Monthly Status Report (Michael Popovich <cad@digital.net>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Hello everyone.  IRPS is doing pretty good right now.  We're moving
right along in growth and we're now up to 600 members and seeking to be
up to 2500 by the end of the year.  Sometime around 1000 members we will
start appealing to RPG companies to see if they would like to post 
advertisements on the club page so that the club can make money and offer
it's members more benefits.
	As always, if you have any ideas, comments, questions, suggestions,
(basically anything) feel free to e-mail me.  A word of caution however,
I'm a little slow at replying at times but I try to get to people as
soon as possible.

Ragboy's Wild Kingdom (Paul Wolfe <ragboy@spacewraith.com>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the first official installment of WK.

In this issue, I would like to cover the role of equipment in the 
wilderness campaign, and how it is affected by use, weather, stress, and 
both natural and unnatural phenomenon.  Rather than cover an exhaustive 
list of equipment and relating information, I will cover some general 
guidelines I like to follow when determining the quality, quantity and 
general characteristics of a party's equipment, before, during and after 
a wilderness trek.  So, onward then, brave reader....

Gearing Up

This is one of the most important stages of a wilderness adventure, and 
one that is most often glossed over.  A list of available gear is 
provided and players tic off what they buy against a pile of money, and 
move on.  Of course, if this could be mirrored to real life, we would all 
have time to game more! :)  But, of course, just to go out and buy 
groceries is a chore, what with finding your keys, driving through 
traffic, searching the shelves for the right brands at the right price, 
then standing in line forever while the guy in front of you counts out 
his potatoes. (I love that commercial).  In a rpg, however, we gloss over 
such experiences for this very reason: who the hell wants to simulate 
such a boring, annoying situation?  However, some guidelines should be 
layed out as to the quality, and variety of equipment your characters are 
likely to encounter on their shopping excursions.  Not all swords are 
created equal, nor are handguns, laser pistols, ropes, nylon lines, body 
armor, etc.  Using a basic percentage table, I determine the quality of 
an item a character buys.  This quality is generally transparent to the 
buyer (unless he or she states specifically what quality is being sought, 
and has the skills to determine such.), so the modifier applied becomes 
relevant only after the item is used and either doesn't yeild the results 
expected or outright fails.  This table can be applied to magical, 
normal, as well as technological components, as anything built, 
enchanted, or created by a mortal is subject to faults.

Item quality table
_____________________________________________________________________
%	desc		modifier	resiliance		price
---------------------------------------------------------------------
01	Exceptional	+15 		+50%			+200%
04	High		+05		+20%			+100%
80	Normal		--		---		 	---
10	Low		-10%		-20%	       Normal to -10%
05	Flawed		-20%		-50%	       Normal to -20%
---------------------------------------------------------------------
%= a breakdown of the percent of items that fall in a given category
modifier=the percentage up or down a roll for "use" should be 
	modified as per the quality of the item.  For weapons, this 
	should only modify accuracy, and not damage. (thus if you 
	roll a 1d12 for accuracy, with an exceptional weapon, add or 
	subtract 2 [whichever is better])
resilience= a modifier to any checks against functionality (thus if a 
	low quality pistol is dropped in the water, and a roll is 
	required to see if it jams, modify that result [required by 
	your game system] by the given 	modifier)
price= Fairly self-explanatory.  If a merchant knows his sword is 
	exceptional, he will mark it up as much as possible, however 
	if he knows its flawed, he will, likewise, try to pawn it off 
	for as much money as he can.

Note that figures such as price and such, represent the starting values.  
If a character chooses to repair an item, maybe replacing bad components, 
etc, this could raise the quality of the item, considerably.  Or, if a 
character demonstrates she knows the quality of an item to a merchant 
(esp. a below normal quality), the price can be driven down further.  
These are functions of role-play, however, and should never be left to a 
dice roll.

As far as quality of wilderness survival gear goes, characters 
should consider finding the highest quality items they can afford (key 
word being survival).  The boonies are hard on equipment, and low quality 
or flawed items could spell doom for a character in a jam.    

As stated, I don't recommend role-playing the purchase of every item  a 
character needs, but for hard to find/restricted items, anything related 
to the overall campaign, or if an adventure can be spun off of the scene, 
feel free.  Otherwise, rolling and notating any relevant results can 
suffice.

The True Test

Once out of the protective arms of civilization, an item's true 
nature becomes paramount.  Likewise, extended maintenance, undo stress, 
and unforseen circumstances can affect how an item performs its 
function.  All of these are valid considerations when dealing with a 
rural situation.  The character's life, many times, depends on the 
performance of his equipment, thus, a system for determining this should 
be enacted.  Many times there are functions (tables, guides, etc) within 
a gaming system that will suffice in (or were actually designed to) take 
such things into account.  Usually, these are ignored, as more important 
things (such as unimaginable wealth, and the dragon sitting on it) are in 
the forefront.  I say, Not So! I've lived in the boonies for 6 month 
stretches, at times, and had to rely on my equipment to keep me alive and 
comfortable.  So, here are some things to consider when you want to wake 
your party up to the harshness of living away from three hots and a cot.

Your party should have some plan as to how they will care for their 
weapons, and other equipment.  Dust, moisture, animals, temperature, and 
other factors adversely affects such things as weapons, electronics, 
food, armor, vehicles, and clothing.  Though, as with buying equipment, 
you should not have to role-play your characters cleaning, storing, and 
maintaining their gear, you should require of them both the time and the 
cost and storage of supplies to do this.  Nothing more than saying: Okay, 
during his watch, Lothar the Barbarian will clean and sharpen his sword.  
Forgetting to say this, should equate to forgetting to do it in real life 
(it happens!).  The effectiveness of equipment should be altered at your 
discretion, especially if some item has been an annoying way for a 
character to unbalance the course of a game, ie. a radar scanner carried 
by Private Snuffy that allows the platoon to never be surprised by the 
enemy.  Should Pvt. Snuffy fail to clean the scanner every day, paying 
special attention to the batteries, well, one day when he turns it on 
ZZZZTTTT.  No scanner.  These rules shouldn't be used to unjustly punish 
your characters, but as a dash of flavor and realism, it can really go a 
long way to bringing out your story and your characters role in it.  

Magical items, for the most part, are as vulnerable as normal items to 
the effects of exposure to the elements, with a couple of exceptions.  
Magical swords and armor, and artifacts or very powerful magical items 
will generally be unaffected by natural elements or conditions.  
Of course, there could be conditions that would even harm these things, 
like a storm that is magical in nature and ferocity, or magical cold or 
heat.  Definitely take any damage into effect for fragile items such as 
scrolls, powders, oil vials, potion flasks, etc.  Wooden staves, or any 
non-metal item should be affectable by the environment, unless stated 
directly in the game rules or deemed so by the game master.  Again, rules 
such as these shouldn't be used to club the characters with undo 
problems, but as both a regulating measure for those parties who are out 
of hand with magical gear, or as a random occurance to keep things 
interesting.  (Mona: "Okay, sizing up the situation, Mona reaches into 
her pouch to get her potion of inviso power."  GM: "Okay, she cuts her 
fingers on the shards of glass, and some of your blood feels invisible 
inside your hand....:)

Likewise, even specialized materials, such that might be found in a 
technlogical campaign, have limits before the substance begins to suffer 
the effects of its environment.  Find out or set what these conditions 
are, and enforce them as you will.  Dropping a pistol into lava, or 
letting your droid get struck by lightning should have adverse effects on 
that equipment.  In sci-fi or real world military campaigns, it is 
important to allow realism to creep in more often than a high fantasy 
game.  These adverse conditions and its affects on equipment are the 
driving force and one of the harshest enemies in such a campaign.  Many a 
military commander has gone insane at the thought of mechanical problems 
in the face of an imminent invasion.

As always, rules such as these shouldn't impede gameplay, or take the fun 
out of the game itself, but add to excitement and realism. (Imagine 
Featherhead the Cyberhacker, who relies heavily on his Net gear to get 
himself out of a sticky situation.  Well how would he react if that gear 
failed, with the enemy approaching?  What other skills or plans does 
he have to use in a pinch?)

Aftermath

When the party finally makes it to a city, the clean up and repair bills 
should be waged (either in time or money, whichever is appropriate.).  
Keep track of those things that were damaged or destroyed, so the 
characters can decide (or forget) to have them repaired or replaced.  
(Mona:  Okay, Mona goes for her the trusty dagger that her father gave 
her...the one she's had forever  GM: Oh, you mean the one that got broken 
in the last adventure?  Sure, you pull a hilt attached to a jagged peice 
of metal from your belt.  The orcs begin to laugh.")  

Use these rules liberally, but give your characters some 
benefit of the doubt when dealing with equipment maintenance and effects 
of the environment. Your characters are heros, and professionals 
afterall, so they will certainly know the importance of equipment 
maintenance.  In certain conditions, as in a firefight or other critical 
time, don't be afraid to heighten the tension by having an important 
peice of equipment fail.  This will not only add a dash of realism 
(who's ever really needed to get to work, only to have your car not 
start..?), it will also spurn inventive reactions by your characters at 
the spur of the moment, expanding the realms of role-play to the 
horizion!!!!  (Or it will really make them mad...and that's what a GM 
does best...)

Bringing Role Players Together Over the Internet
	(Christopher Beattie <chrisb@tansoft.com>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION:
     	Imagine sitting in your room, in front of your computer console, 
your character sheet on one side of the keyboard, a can of soda on the 
other.  Before you, in one of your computer's many windows, a text 
display describes the scene.

============================================================
!DM> OK.  Here's the situation.  You are inside the gigantic
!DM> cavern.  The light is dim, and you can only see about
!DM> 60' or so with your torches, but the cavern extends
!DM> beyond that.  In the dark distance you hear the sounds
!DM> of something huge breathing.  What do you do?
Dathief> I try to hide in shadows and sneak around.
Dartanyon> I ready my longbow.
Waldo whispers to you, "Where am I?"
============================================================

     	While many people are familiar with table top role playing and 
even with role playing by regular or electronic mail, few people have 
been exposed to on-line role playing.  Like play-by-mail, on-line role 
playing has its own sets of problems and advantages.  It can be exciting 
as well as frustrating in its own unique ways.  This article will 
describe some of the unique problems of on-line role playing, as well as 
some ideas for solving those problems.

THE ASCII CONFERENCE ROOMS:
     	Most on-line services have a place where members can get together 
and talk to each other.  Many services will call these areas "Chat" or 
"Conference" areas.  In the simplest setting what you type in is 
displayed to everyone in the area.  There may be separate tables and 
rooms where small groups can privately talk to each other.  Private 
communication can also be supported where one player can send a message 
to a single person in the room.
     	Some conference room commands are useful in a role playing 
setting.  Dice rolling is a very important feature for on-line 
role-playing.  Most systems will support a #d#+# format, which is useful 
for most game systems.
     	Other commands have been added by services as a result of 
features found on many MUDS and other similar games.  They include:

     	Speech: Starting a line of text with a quotation mark can cause a 
variety of responses depending on the last character in the string.  For 
example:

"I want a cookie.        Someone says, "I want a cookie."
"I want a cookie?        Someone asks, "I want a cookie?"
"I want a cookie!        Someone yells, "I want a cookie!"

     	Actions: Starting a line with a colon causes your name to appear 
in front of the message.  For example:

:smiles at the lady.     Someone smiles at the lady.

     	Game Master Functions: Are things that a single person, 
(sometimes called a moderator) can do, which for on-line role-playing 
falls under the Game Master.  These features, when present, are highly 
system dependent.  They can allow the moderator to display text without 
the normal header and speak with a different name. The moderator also 
has the power to gag people or declare a room so that only he or the 
person he delegates can speak, or to figuratively kick someone out of 
the room.

LIFE IN 80 COLUMNS AND 24 ROWS:
     	When people are sitting around a table there is a tremendous 
amount of information that is conveyed without speaking.  This 
"Non-verbal" communication can be as subtle as who the players are 
looking at, if they are paying attention, or as blatant as the players 
waving their hands to get the GM's attention.  On-line, none of this is 
possible.  Every statement, action, and comment takes up one line of the 
screen.  Everything has to be literally channeled through the area of the 
screen devoted to the incoming text, typically somewhere around 20 lines 
of text.
     	This limitation on the number of lines of previous text you can 
see places a great tunnel vision on the on-line game that the GM must 
work hard to overcome.  Since emotions or expressions cannot be seen it 
becomes imperative for everyone to express them whenever appropriate.  
This can be difficult to remember at first but in time can become a 
habit.  Unfortunately, a balance must be struck between relaying enough 
emotions and filling the screen with less non-important information.
     	Private messages also pose a problem for both the GM and the 
players.  Unlike at the table where everyone can see someone passing a 
note, private messages are seen only by the receiver.  This is good in 
that private messages are indeed private.  Unfortunately, when a GM or a 
player is receiving or sending a lot of private sends they are slow to 
respond to public ones.  In addition sometimes players can spend so much 
time in OOC private messages to each other that game play suffers, even 
without the GM's knowledge.
     	Not only is non-verbal communication not allowed, all visual 
communications must be made to fit an ASCII medium.  Maps, if made to be 
sent to the players must be made in ASCII text, must be no larger than 
60x20 in order to be properly seen on the screen.  Here is an example of 
an ASCII map of an inn I used in one of my game sessions.

;       Scale . = 5'
;
;                  /---------|        1: Bones Alley
;          1    ////dn    |  | XX     2: Plague Court
;             D//  |      D  |        3: Latrine

;       |           b            |
;       +---W--------D-------W---+
;         8

     	The semicolons are used to tell the conference room to print the 
text without my name in front of it, and at the same time prevent forward 
slashes from being taken for a command.

ROLE PLAYING ON-LINE AND THROUGH ELECTRONIC MAIL.
     	Unlike table top role playing, role playing on-line can be 
combined with other methods such as electronic play by mail and play by 
forum to provide action even when the meetings are not in session.  This 
can be a good thing, because in an on-line session, times that are early 
for the west coast people are late for the east coast people and on-line 
sessions can be shorter than their table top counterparts.

CONCLUSION: ROLE PLAYING ON-LINE IS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE.
     	When there are few role-players in your neighborhood and you want 
the real time feel that Electronic play by mail does not give, then 
on-line role playing is an alternative.  Getting one started, however, 
may be difficult at first.  Some games, like their play by mail 
counterparts might be a short duration, but others can go on for years of 
enjoyment.

The Book of Genesis (Justin Nathanial White <bwhite@cln.etc.bc.ca>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biomes & Ecostructures

	Now, if you've read the last article, you should have a a map and an idea
of how you want to build your world.  The second step in building a
super-realistic world is developing an Ecostructure.  This takes a lot of
time, and may not be entirely necessary.  I have spent about a week and I
have just progressed into the animal life of the forests of a continent 
the size of Australia (that's not counting the plains and stuff!)  Here 
are some of the advantages/disadvantages to making an ecostructure for 
your world.

Advantages:     
	The ecostructure lets you consistently maintain what the 
description of a forest is.  Also, when you have an ecostructure, you 
generally know what the cultures that you place in that area have to work 
with (ie, what kinds of furs to trap, what types of plants they have 
available for building stuff with, et cetera).  It helps with the makeup 
of cultures (as we will discuss in another article.)

Disadvantages:      
	This is a definite time-eater.  You spend hours thinking of 
logical matches from the smallest plant to the largest animals.  This
information isn't used very often in a novel or in your game except
for description and realism.

	There are many parts of developing an ecostructure that are very 
important in designing your own world.  Like biomes.  You _HAVE_ to 
determine where you want your forests, your plains, your deserts and your 
mountains and whatever other unique/mundane biomes you can thing of 
(fireswamp ;)  When designing the biome areas, keep in mind where your 
poles are, and possibly how the world is tilted on it's axle.  If you've 
taken my advice from the last article and used that worldmap generator.. 
keep in mind that that's assuming your 'planet' has a 90š axle to the 
sun.  If your planet is tilted, you add more snow to the pole that's 
moved farther away and put less on the closer side.
	Now that you have a tilt, you can generally assume the 
'temperate zones'.  Generally, the equator is in the centre of the earth, 
unless you have the axle at a flat 0š or something very close to that, 
then it's at the end closest to the sun, or in the case of multiple suns, 
it really don't matter!
	The equator (as you probably know) is the hottest part of the 
planet.  You should 'paint' a biome of jungles, deserts or other biomes 
that are able to live in hot areas.  Naturally, the poles, or at least 
the areas farthest away from the sun, would be the coldest area, and 
arctic/boreal areas would be the best.  SimEarth is a good program to 
see the relationship of the biomes to the temperature.  Also the manual 
will give you some excellent ideas on how to place biomes.
	Another good factor in determining biomes is the rainfall.  More 
rain gives lusher plants (boreal, forests, jungles) while more arid 
places have less plant life (plains/tundra/arctic).  Usually, rainfall 
is heaviest near the oceans.  I know this for a fact, living in Vancouver 
and getting rain at least once a week, where as my brother in Calgary 
gets very little, but, then again, it depends on how windy your world is.  
A heavy wind could drag the rain farther away from the coast.
	Note also that 'rainfall' also applies to 'snowfall' in colder 
climates =o)  Another good point while placing biomes is the biomes that 
surround the area.  You probably wouldn't see a glacier next to a desert, 
for example (unless there is some logical reason that it's there... like 
magically protected [wait a minute... magic isn't logical =o) ])  would 
you often see a desert next to an ocean?  The latter example HAS happened 
on Earth (I can't remember EXACTLY where... I just remember someone 
telling me about it).  Also, it's not often that you see a jungle sitting 
right next to a desert.  It _could_ happen, but wouldn't it be more 
reasonable to have an area of plains in between them?
	Now that you have gotten your biomes place, here comes the most
time-consuming part... ecostructure!  The food chain is the time 
consuming part.  When developing a food-chain, work from the bottom-up.  
Develop the lowest of the plants, figure out what eats/uses that and et 
cetera.  Work your way up to small animals like mice, then to avians or 
larger animals and then up into humans.  You should probably include 
humans even though we haven't talked about cultures yet.
	Use your imagination on this one.  Are all trees made of wood?  
Be creative!  How about a growing tree made of rock or crystal?  That was
edible?  An easy animal that feeds off it would be some sort of 
gelatinous blob that sucked on the sugar coating, and maybe a larger 
predictor could eat the blob.  That's actually an example from my world, 
but it shows how creativity can make a world so much more special.
	Plan ahead a bit.  If you are going to have a human population 
in the area, think about what resources it would need.  A source of 
clothing, housing, food.  Note, though, that a lack of resource could 
mean a lack of material.  If you don't have furry mammals in the area, 
then the culture may just go without clothing (makes sense if you have 
a warm world) or they'd parade around in leaf clothes.

	Well, I think that's enough for this month.  As usual, if you 
have any question you can eMail me at bwhite@cln.etc.bc.ca or 
BJNW@eWorld.com.

Cyber Abyss Resource List/FAQ (Craig Janssen <daili@gate.net>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Cyber Abyss Resource List / FAQ (Last Updated 3/17/96)
 
This FAQ is always process of being updated. As I find more interesting
stuff, I will add it to the FAQ. If you have any information I can use
or have comments about the FAQ please let me know.
 
Note: This FAQ is maintained by me (Craig Janssen) [daili@gate.net] ;-) 
This FAQ does not necessarily represent the opinions or views of anyone 
else. It should be noted,  I am not trying to favor one CCG or magazine 
over another.  My purpose is to provide infomation relating to the CCG 
industry. 

I will be starting up a RPG Resource FAQ in the near future. If you have 
any www sites or contract email addresses, feel free to pass them on.
 
FAQ

Q. What is a CCG?

A. CCG stands for Collectible Card Games. While Wizards of the Coast, 
   the makers of Magic: The Gathering were not the first to make one. 
   WotC was the first to make a recent impact on a vast scale.

Q. Where do I start?

A. You can start by reading through this resource list. After that, 
   there is many options. You can then join email lists, visit WWW sites, 
   read Usenet News discussion groups. This resource list was made to let 
   people know where to look for information about CCGs and the people 
   that make them. It should be noted there are plenty of places to look 
   as well.

Q. I have played some CCGs, but want to try others. Where can I go for 
   reviews or opinions?

A. There are three places I know of to get reviews or opinions of the 
   various CCGs in print. You can read opinions and reviews on the Usenet 
   News Group rec.games.trading-cards.misc. This group covers most of the 
   non-MTG CCGs.  You can visit WWW sites of magazines that review and 
   offer opinions of the various CCGs. Two sites are 
   http://mxn117.rh.psu.edu/~spud/gamer.htm and 
   http://www.itis.com/other-games. Lastly, you can join the email list 
   of the CCG you are interested in and get opinions from the readers.  
   You can ask questions and be sure of answers.

Q. Where can I get price lists or a price guide to CCGs?

A. On Internet, there is the Cloister price list: 
   http://www.hhhh.org/cloister/pricelists/
   This price list is developed from the auctions and sales on the 
   various Usenet News Groups that deal with CCGs. The major problem 
   with this list is that it doesn't deal with the different editions of 
   cards. If you bear this in mind, the price list is very good for 
   Internet prices. The other source for prices is the magazines that 
   cover the CCG industry. Price guides are the basis for pricing CCG 
   singles in stores. While a lot of people dislike using magazine 
   prices, it is good to be familiar with them, as stores can and 
   do use these price guides for pricing purposes.

Q. Who are you? And why are you doing this?

A. My name is Craig Janssen. I was the Scrye Internet Rep from issue #1 
   to issue #12. My position was moved inhouse at the end of December 
   1995.  I have been playing MTG, 6 months after its start. I was a 
   playtester for the Fallen Empires expansion set. I have had articles 
   printed in Scrye and had a column covering CCGs and the Internet. 
   [Hire me, Please ;-)]  I started this resource list as a supplement 
   to my column in Scrye. I have expanded it and renamed it after I left 
   Scrye.

CCG Information

Magic: The Gathering
 
One thing to look at is Dangelo's list of Rules:
 
These rulings are available via FTP to "ftp.netcom.com" under 
"pub/da/dangelo/magic" as the files "rule-*" in ASCII text, PostScript 
and HP LaserJet format.  The latter two are formatted for easier reading.  
They can also be found on "marvin.macc.wisc.edu" under
"/pub/deckmaster/rules" 
as "rule-*".                                     
 
If you have access to World Wide Web try: http://www.wizards.com (or www.
itis.com/deckmaster a volunteer site). This site has a lot of links to 
other web sites and is the 'official' web site for Wizards of the Coast.
 
MTG-L archive:
 
There are anonymous FTP archives at ftp.itis.com you can get.
They run a little behind, but I looked and they are current through
the 12th (almost all the ones you want).  The 1996 archives are in
/pub/deckmaster/archive/mtg-l and the older ones have their own
subdirectory.

OTE:
 
John Nephew, President of Atlas Games, and Woody Eblom are available for

Thoughts from Thaos (Joshua Reubens <thaos@aol.com>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Future of Role-Playing

	First a little about myself.  Thaos is a character of mine.  He 
was my first P.C. in I.C.E.'s Rolemaster, that I have been playing and 
GMing for a number of years.  I suppose that naming this column after him 
was a bit like calling on the muses for inspiration.  I have been 
role-playing for about eight years, and I actually started out by 
GMing.  I can not claim I was any good at it, but I had a lot of fun 
learning.  I have had little opportunity to actually play, the majority 
of my experience is GMing.  Because of this I have read and own quite a 
few games of many different genres.  The problem is that the area in 
which I live is quite void of role-players.  In fact many of the people I 
do play with are people I introduced to the hobby.  Well, that's enough 
about me, lets get on to something that you will hopefully find a little 
more interesting.
	"Mark Rein Hagen (head of White Wolf) claims that 'role-playing 
as we know it will be dead within ten years'" (Fannon 227).  Hagen goes 
on to explain that the electronic medium will obliterate paper and pencil 
role-playing and that role-playing companies must evolve or die.  It is 
an interesting thing to think about.  Will there one day no longer be 
role-players?  I spoke with a friend on this issue and we agreed that 
there will always be some who hold to the old ways even if role-playing 
in the traditional sense dissipates.  I am willing to say that I will 
stand among those who will never put their dice away.  
	Technology does indeed offer us much.  For instance this 
newsletter would not exist if not for the web.  I do not wish to sound 
as if I am putting down the advances that have been made, I only wish to 
make it known that role-playing could never truly be replaced by any 
thing electronic.  The computer games that call themselves RPG's today 
are in truth nothing of the sort.  They do not give you freedom to do 
whatever it is you wish, do they.  Then they are not a role-playing 
game.  It is hard to play a role when you are forced to follow certain 
guidelines.  
	In a way role-playing is a bit like magic.  In role-playing we 
can create anything, we can be anything.  The idea of magic vs. 
technology is not exactly a new idea.  Have you ever seen the movie 
Wizards by Ralph Bakashi?  Perhaps you have even read or played the RPG,
by Whit Publications Inc.  The latest manifestation of magic vs. 
technology would probably be Mage: The Ascension by White Wolf.  I think 
they portray it best in this game.  The technology that is there is good, 
but we must never forget the magic.
	Take a look at what the future might bring.  There could someday 
be something like the Holodeck on Star Trek.  That would be role-playing.  
Though you still would have to program the computer with the information 
and it could never be ready for anything.  A living GM can adapt and 
change no matter what the player(s) decide to do.  Computers may be able 
to aid in role-playing games.  I have in fact heard that some people use 
a lap top along with all of their adventures.  There are actually quite a 
few programs out to aid and assist in the role-playing experience.  
Though I still say that even if computers can aid us in our hobby, they 
will never be capable of replacing it.
	Role-playing is in my opinion a great and healthy past time.  It 
teaches us valuable things, and expands our imaginations.  In a world 
where being like everyone else has become the goal, role-playing is even 
more essential.  I guess that Mr. Fannon explained it best when he wrote:
	"If you have not played a role-playing game or if you have ever 
considered that RPGs may be 'bad' or harmful,' please give a careful look 
at them.  In this hobby, you will see creativity, social tolerance, 
compassion, open-mindedness, insightful thinking, problem solving, 
historical awareness, and eyes firmly on the future-all in great 
abundance." (Fannon 231)
	I for one agree completely with this assessment, I must also say 
that I find role-playing to be an educational and enlightening hobby.  It 
combines acting and reading, and in doing so creates a new art form, one 
that should be experienced by all.  Hopefully role-playing, with our 
help, will extend into the future and with luck it will even reach a greater 
audience.

Publishing, 1996.

Slight's Miscellanea (Steven Cox <slight@bev.net>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salutations!

	Welcome, all, to my second article!  This month, we're exploring 
options of a more mundane nature than last month's discourse on psionics.  
Let us turn our minds to the topic and nature of Hit Points.  Yes, I 
know..... this subject has been thrashed upon more than the proverbial 
dead horse, but you might find my take on Hit Points rather interesting.  
	Let me tell you, dear readers, a story of Hit Points.  The story 
begins with the character creation of two PCs - a fighter and a mage.  
The player of the fighter wished to play a tough-as-nails warrior, with 
more focus on physical toughness than brute strength.  So, the player 
decided to put his lucky roll of 18 into the PC's constitution score.  At 
the same time, the player of the mage specifically wanted to play a 
sickly mage, with little in the way of sturdiness.  In this case, the 
player gave the mage PC a constitution score of 6.
	Thru many adventures, the two PCs advance to 5th level  Now, you 
might expect that this stout fighter would have acquired many Hit Points, 
while the mage would still be vulnerable to being brought down with a 
single blow.  Not so.  The fighter and the mage, as it turns out, had the 
same number of Hit Points!  Even with the fighter's exceptional, and the 
mage's lackluster, constitution, both ended up with 15 Hit Points.  Do 
the math, my friends - by consistently poor/good die rolls, this 
situation was made possible.
	Okay, I'll admit it - this story never actually happened.  But it 
does serve as an useful example of how the randomness of Hit Point 
acquisition can go against one's PC characterization.  Does anyone really 
want to play a Conan-esque fighter, only to roll 1 after 1 for Hit 
Points?  Or Raistlin when rolling constant 4's?  Presented below is a 
system to remove some of the randomness of the Hit Point system.  Enjoy!

Revised Hit Points System

	I was wanting to mention my idea about hit points.  WHY roll for 
random hp?  Do we roll for random THAC0?  Random AC?  Besides a PC's 
basic stats, hp is the only thing that is randomized in such a way.  I 
have an idea about a hp chart, the way we already have a THAC0 chart, 
based upon Con and the average hp produced from the current system.  For 
example, a fighter gains, on average, 5.5 hp per level advancement at the 
moment.  On my chart, a fighter would gain 5 hp per level, modified by 
Con.  An average Con fighter would still gain 5 hp, while a high-Con 
fighter would gain 14 (max normal by current system - roll a 10 and get 
+4 hp from current Con modifier).  

Table X:  Base Hit Points
				Level
Class	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10  
Priest	4	8	12	16	20	24	28	32	36	40  
Psion	3	6	9	12	15	18	21	24	27	30  
Rogue	3	6	9	12	15	18	21	24	27	30  
Warrior	5	10	15	20	25	30	35	40	45	50  
Wizard	2	4	6	8	10	12	14	16	18	20  


Revised Table 3: Constitution HP Adjustment

Con 1-3		base * 0.25
Con 4-5		base * 0.50
Con 6-7		base * 0.75
Con 8-10	base * 1.00
Con 11-12	base * 1.50
Con 13-14	base * 2.00
Con 15-16	base * 2.50
Con 17-18	base * 3.00

Con 19-20	base * 3.25
Con 21-23	base * 3.50
Con 24-25	base * 3.75

From Level 11 onwards, PCs stop using the above chart and gain hp's at a 
flat rate, as listed below (note that modifiers from Con no longer 
apply).  If a given PC happens to advance at a slower rate than listed 
below (for example, an odd weakling of a fighter who normally gains only 
2 hp per level), continue using the lower rate.

Class		HPs Per Level Past 10th
Priest			+2
Psion			+2
Rogue			+2
Warrior			+3
Wizard			+1
  
	To serve as the first example, and an extreme example at that, 
let's look at a 5th level mage possessing a 18 Con.  At 5th level, he 
would have a base 10 hp.  With his near-godly Con multiplying the base hp 
by 3, the result is 30 hp for our mage.  Seems like a lot, eh?  Well, an 
equivalent mage under the standard rules could have 20 hp max (4 hp * 5th 
level), +2 hp per level for Con, for a total of.... 30 hp!  
	How about a cleric?  Same conditions - 5th level, Con 18.  Base 
hp is 20, multiplied up to 60.  A standard cleric could have 40 hp, plus 
10 hp for Con making a total of 50.  So, my system gives classes other 
than mages more hp for higher Con scores.  Is that so bad, tho?  As 
already shown, a warrior benefits from a high Con more so than other 
classes - why shouldn't *each* class benefit differently?  Shouldn't a 
Con 18 cleric benefit more than a Con 18 mage, but not as much as a Con 
18 fighter?
	While this new system does take out the randomness of hp 
acquisition, I was thinking of adding another element to stir things back 
up, while adding more options at the same time.  Dependent upon campaign 
events, a PC might gain fewer or more hp when rising in level.  For 
example, a fighter was severely beaten and tortured for weeks, but 
managed to fight his way out of captivity and, in the process, gained a 
level.  The DM might declare that, due to extreme punishment, the fighter 
in question gains fewer hp than normal.  This could be expounded upon as 
thus: whatever Con score the PC possesses for the majority of the time in 
the level previous to gaining a new level, that is what the hp adjustment 
is based upon.  Basically, our theoretical fighter was reduced to a 
lower Con for the duration of his torture (and for most of his level), so 
he gets fewer hp.  On the flip side, a mage spending much time in the 
smithy, making a hand-made sword to enchant, might have toughened up a 
bit and is rewarded with more hp.

PROLOGUE
RATTLE BRAINED KENDER
	
	Tas chased after Flint.  The dwarf was running in a mad dash, 
trying to put as much distance as possible between himself and that 
lamebrained kender.  After he died those centuries ago, the old dwarf 
sort of missed Tasslehoff, but now that the kender was dead and in the 
sky with him, the dwarf wished that he was still alive.  At least then, 
Flint thought, he could dream of finally falling into the eternal sleep 
and not be bothered by any doorknob kender for a while at least.  But 
now, he'd have to put up with Tas' endless shenanigans for eternity and 
beyond.
	"Wait up Flint," the old dwarf heard the kender call.  "I didn't 
mean to paste your beard to the forge!  Gee, I never knew beards could 
burn so fast!  It'll grow back though, trust me.  Have I ever been wrong?  
Well don't answer that.  But I could never be wrong about something like 
that.  Could I?"
	Flint stopped and turned to the kender who had caught up with 
him.  Although the dwarf was only about four and a half feet tall, he was 
still taller than the kender who was a few inches shorter.  Tas' blue 
eyes twinkled like always.  His hair, pulled into a topknot, was as 
brownish gray as ever, and just as bouncy.  His face was adult, yet with 
the same playful, childlike appearance common to kender.  A face born 
from the fact that kender could not feel fear.  The one emotion that they 
lacked. 
	Tasslehoff held back a laugh, the dwarf did look rather comical, 
what with his beard barely there what was left singed to an ashen black.  
But Tas knew that laughing at the dwarf would only worsen his temper.  
"Finally. . . you stopped," the out of breath kender panted.  "Now, like 
I was saying, I am really sorry about your beard Flint, I wasn't paying 
attention to what I was doing. . .  Even though I'm not sure that I
know what I was doing anyway but I think it had something to do with the 
action of. . .  Well nevermind that because I guess it doesn't have any 
importance now does it?. . ."
	"Tas," Flint grumbled.  "You aren't really this stupid are you?  
It's all an act right?  To get on my nerves?"  Tasslehoff Burrfoot gave 
the dwarf the most confused look that Flint had ever seen in his entire 
living and dead life.  "Nevermind.  Tanis and the others are waiting on 
us, they said that something wonderful is about to take place down 
below."
	"On Krynn!?"  Tas exclaimed, jumping up and down.  "Nothing 
interesting has happened there since they discovered that new continent, 
what did they call it, of coarse, New Krynn.  And I couldn't forget 
about when the dragons created the dragonlings to take the place of the 
draconians. . ."
	"Rattle-brained kender," Flint mumbled as they walked on.

CHAPTER ONE
THE DRAGON COUNCIL
	Hederah lifted his great old head and peered around the Cave of 
the Council.  The darkness of the cave would not have made it hard for 
him to see in his younger days, but now the ancient blue dragon found 
that his vision had gone bad over the millennium.  He had fought against 
Huma in the Dragon Wars, he was there when Neraka fell in the War of the 
Lance, and when the Knights of Takhississ and the Knights of Solomnia 
fought against Chaos it was his daughter, Flare that the dark knight 
Steel Brightblade rode.  
	Now the great wyrm's scales were decaying, falling out along with 
some of his teeth.  What were once sharp talons were now bent and dull.  
His great wings now had begun to shrivel.  His flanks were covered in 
scars that proved that he was once a very powerful foe in a fight (for 
this reason he was often known to boast of these scars).  He could once 
use his deadly lightning breath to bring down the side of a small 
mountain and wreak havoc on the countryside.  Now he could barley let 
lose a small spark.  And the great memory of a dragon would never be of 
use to him again because it had dwindled to almost nothingness. Yet the 
dragon's absent mindedness did not hinder Hederah from making wise 
decisions.  It was amazing that even though he could remember less and 
less everyday, the great blue seemed wiser and wiser too.  
	Hederah's great age made him highly respected in the Dragon
Council.  He was after all the eldest dragon in the council and therefore
the eldest dragon on Krynn.  What he decided usually was what happened in
the council.  It was on few occasions that a dragon would rival Hederah's 
will.  It was often a young dragon who was foolish enough to say 
something.  This naive dragon was always quickly reprimanded by his
elders or even his peers.
	The Dragon Council only met a few times a year and today was one
of them.  Hederah watched as the dragons began to arrive, both from
within and outside the cave.  Those who arrived from inside the cave were 
other leaders of the council like the great blue himself.  All of the 
council leaders were great wyrms like Hederah too.  There was one for
each dragon color.  The oldest dragon was always the one who was picked 
to represent their hue.  Hederah of course represented the blue dragons.
	The younger dragons came from outside the Cave of the Council.
Every dragon on Krynn was present.  Blue, red, black, green, white, gold,
silver, brass, bronze, copper, sapphire, amethyst, crystal, topaz, 
emerald, mercury, steel, yellow, brown, deep, cloud, and shadow.  All 
were present when the Dragon Council called a meeting.
	The dragonlings, a race created from altered dragon eggs were
arriving with their dragon cousins.  They were created from red and blue, 
silver and mercury, cloud and mist, and sapphire and amethyst dragon 
eggs.  One hundred eggs from a clutch laid every hundred years were 
chosen from these dragon types to become dragonlings.  The dragon parents 
of dragonlings were always proud parents because it was considered an
honor to have your eggs chosen.  Dragonlings were respected and treated
as if they were normal dragons (even though the biggest dragonling was 
fourteen feet tall and the smallest dragon was ninety feet long).   
	Some non-dragons were present as well.  Humans, elves, and 
dwarves were present.  Some kender tried to get in but most were
turned away, politely, at the entrance.  The races new to the people of 
Ansalon were present as well.  The coama, a four armed race of which all 
were female, great warriors, and could rival the elves in beauty.  The
riconus, a strange barbarian like people with the shape of a powerfully
built humans but the head of a rhinoceros.  
	These races were present for different reasons, some to report a 
rogue dragon plaguing the countryside.  Others - especially the coama and
dwarves - were here to do business with the greatest creatures of Krynn.
And others still were only present for curiosity, the want to see what 
went on in one of the fabled dragon meetings.  Because of dragon fear (a 
powerful fear that all dragons emitted on non-dragons that left the 
victims screaming in sheer terror), there were only a few non-dragons in 
the great cave.  These were some of the bravest of their races.  The 
dragons gave a small respect to these people because the force of their 
will had to be very strong to overcome the powerful effects of dragon 
fear.
	After all the dragons and those non-dragons were present and
quiet, Hederah prepared to start the council meeting.  The dragons were
seated by color, each color had a councildragon who would voice their
clan's desires and opinions about anything brought up in the meeting to
the rest of the council.  The blue dragons would start, and then the
golds, reds, sapphire, and so forth, until the mercury dragons had 
spoken.  Then it would be the mortals turn.  The dragonlings were
considered part of what ever color they were.
	"This meeting of the Dragon Council is called to order," said
Hederah, known to mortals as Flash.  "I Flash will speak for the blue
dragons."  He turned his old snake-like head to those of his color.  Then 
he said, "This year I understand that everything is basically alright 
with all the other dragons except for a mear boundary dispute between the
reds and the silvers.  Could councildragons Magmus of the reds, and
Silvara of the silvers speak for your colors?" 
	Magmus and Silvara stepped forth.  They were both relatively
young for councildragons each in their early nine hundreds.  Both had
claws that were still many times sharper than the tips of men's spears.
They were covered in scales of red or a dull silver that served as armor
against swords and arrows.  They were both fine physical specimens.  
	"Flash," both said bowing their necks in respect.  The great blue
gave each a salute of recognition and instructed them to continue.
	"The red dragons believe that the silver dragons have been
disobeying the boundry pact between us."  Magmus said to the council.
"Twice have I heard from some of the other reds that they have seen
silver dragons flying over our lands.  That is our report lord Flash."
	"And what do you have to say to this account Silvara," asked
Hederah.  "Do you have an arguement for the council?"
	"Yes O' Flash," Grayscale repied.  "It is true that I and some of 
my sisters and brethren flew over red dragon territory.  But we did not
hunt any game, be it treasure or food on your lands.  We were simply
escorting someone from the Khalkist Mountains to Tanser.  That is all my
lord."
	"May the council take record," Flash commanded.  "That I Flash
have decided that the silver dragons were within their rights flying over
the Plains of Dust, a red territory. But because they did not first
inform the red dragons of their plans, they must give the red dragons 
some sort of token, to show that they meant nothing of it."
	"That has been officially recorded lord Flash," said a dragonling
scribe.
	Bowing to Hederah in respect, Grayscale and Magmus returned to
there places.
	After the mortal races finished trading with the council, Hederah
prepared to dismiss, when a small voice was heard in the ranks of the
silver dragons. "O' lord Flash," the female voice said.  "May I make a
request?"
	Hederah turned to the source of the voice.  Two figures, one only
about five and a half feet tall, the other a foot and a half shorter
stood at his gnarled feet.  These two, out of every mortal in the entire
Cave of the Council, were every dragon's favorite.  Aletta, the coama 
warrior, found while still a baby, by a silver dragon in the wilderness,
and Witchet Pouchbringer, the kender that was found in the same manor by
a mercury dragon.  Both were raised in the council and were considered
part of it.  Because of their long existence around dragons, neither were
overcome by dragon fear when confronted by the mighty creatures.
	"What is it my child?"  Hederah asked the caoma, calling her
child even though she was seventy nine years of age.  Still young for
the caoma but only a fragment of time for the ancient dragon.  He was
very fond of this one, she had accomplished something that only silver
dragonlings had accomplished, becoming a draco-paladin.
	"If it isn't to much trouble my lord, I would like to make a
request to the council."
	"You know that you are respected here as if you were a dragon
yourself, speak child."
	"Thank you.  Today I was in the Dragon Library and I think I
might have found a lead to magic on Krynn.  I mean other than the
magic that you dragons have.  I am talking about magic that everybody
can use."
	"And I helped!"  Witchet shouted, jumping up and down.  
	"And the kender helped too," Aletta sighed.  "But anyway, I was
wondering if I and a few dragonlings-"
	"And me too!"
	"Yes, and you too Witchet.  But I was wondering if we could
quest for this source of magic.  It could be useful to the council and
the rest of Krynn if the other races like my own could possess magic
again."
	"I am well aware with the possibilities," said Hederah.  "But I 

am not sure if I like the idea, we will discuss this later, assemble 
your party and we will talk after dusk."
.   .   .
	The red glow of the setting sun outlined Aletta's lithe body.  
Her hair cascaded down to the small of her back, framing her beautiful
face with bright silver strands.  The sun made her smooth oak brown skin 
seem a light orange.  Her four arms were crossed across her chest in a 
serious manor as she looked over her party.
	Next to her stood Witchet, the kender was incredibly restless, 
all this waiting around for Hederah to show up so that he could decide 
wether or not he was going to let them try to find magic or not was 
incredibly boring him.  He'd much rather be trying to figure out what 
makes a dragon have a breath weopon.  Or maybe finding out what would
happen if you pulled the ring out of a minotaur's nose.  But he knew that 
if he went off adventuring  he might miss out on this one so he'd just 
stay for a while and see what would happen.  
	Looking around the party, Witchet noticed something, he and 
Aletta were the only non-dragonlings.  There was Myst, a cloud 
dragonling.  He was the largest of the dragonlings, maybe fourteen feet 
tall, Witchet thought to himself, he never was good at judging size.  
Myst was covered in four inches of red-orange scales not too easily 
penetrated.  He had a serious demenour to him, and was easily aggravated,
especially (though Witchet knew not why), when the kender was around.  
One time Myst tried to rip Witchet's throat out, just because he tried to
capture Myst in a bottle when he was in cloud form, an ability cloud
dragons and dragonlings possesed.
	Then there was Firestrike, the only crossbreed dragonling ever.  
His mother was a red his father a blue.  Firestrike had mainly blue
scales, but also red streaks here and there, especially around his eyes.
The most interresting thing about Firestrike, thought Witchet, was that
his breath weopon was a bolt of lightning like a blue dragon, but it was
surrounded by a red flame, like the fire breath of a red.
	Sterling, a silver dragonling stood close to Aletta.  He, like 
her was a draco-paladin.  His posture was proud and he stood tall.  Like 
Aletta he crossed his arms around his massive chest.  He looked only 
straight ahead, if he was anxious he wasn't showing it.  The disipline of 
a draco-paladin shown brightly through him, like the beacon of a light
house on a stormy night in the Sea of Istar.  The only movement that he 
made was to blink, and to caress the hilt of his mighty sword with his 
silver scaled hands that ended in five inch long talons.
	And of course, Witchet's favorite dragonling, the one who he 
viewed as a kender in a dragonling's body, Rellium.  Rellium was a 
mercury dragonling.  Mercury dragons and dragonlings were shunned by the 
other dragons and dragonlings for being too playful.  They were extremely 
kender like, in that they were very immature, wreckless, and nothing
held their attention very long, usually about three minutes.  What made 
them even more annoying was that when they spoke, it was ten times faster 
than a normal speed so other dragons and people had to ask them to repeat 
it and slow it down so that they could understand what they were trying 
to say.
	Witchet and Rellium had always been together since they knew each 
other.  They often left Dragon's Rock to adventure to the far corners of 
Krynn.  Usually, this was without the perrmision of the rest of the 
council which tended to get them into alot of trouble with Hederah.  But 
usually they just figured that Hederah was having a bad day so they would 
stay inside Dragon's Rock for a few days then repeat the prosses.
	"Hederah takes too long," Witchet sighed, looking up until he 
nearly broke his back to see his friend's face.  "You know we could be 
out doing something worth our while right now."
	Rellium smiled then said, "But nooo we have too wait on a two 
thousand year old dragon, to get permission to go off on an adventure, 
when Hederah doesn't really care anyway.  I mean all those times when we 
left without permission all he did was yell, and threaten to fry us with 
his dragon breath.  And I don't think he was serious anyway, but I would 
like to find out what that feels like."
	"Shut-up you two,"  Myst growled.  "Quit complaining, Hederah 
will get here when he does, and hopefully if he does let us search for
magic, he'll make you two stay behind!"  Witchet and Rellium silenced-
for about three minutes, and then began to chatter quietly amongst
themselves.
	"I do wish that Hederah would hurry up though," Firestrike 
whispered.  "I grow weary of all of this waiting."
	"Then wait no longer," came an old, raspy voice.  "I Hederah have 
arrived."
	"And it's about time too!"  Exclaimed the kender.

Earl's Word (Earl Harrison <dungeonm@si-net.com>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Borg & Timothy had searched many weeks for any clues they could 
obtain that would lead them to the lair of the great wyrm.  They stood at 
the edge of the mountain gazing up the sides trying to find a glimpse of 
the large hole in the mountain that the dragon called its home.
	"THERE!" exclaims the over joyous thief, Timothy.  "There just 
above the cliff three-quarters up to the left." "That is what we are 
looking for!"
	The thief latched onto the back of the broad barbarian as he 
began to climb the rock face of the mountain.  The barbarian did not seem 
at all encumbered by the weight of the halfling as he made great leaps 
and bounds up the mountain.
	After many hours of climbing the barbarian hurled the thief onto 
the ledger just facing the lair of the dragon.  Borg finally climbed over 
the edge, then stood and brushed himself off onto the now dust-free thief.  
So once again Timothy dusts himself off all the while snarling and 
cursing at the bigger man.
	Swiftly and quietly a large two-handed broad sword is lifted out 
of its resting place to gleen brightly in the sun. Two small daggers, 
both dull, are pulled from unknown hiding places on the body of the 
halfling thief.  "Let's Go" commands the barbarian.
	As they enter the cave the stench almost becomes unbearable.  
After several more minutes of traveling into the cave the barbarian 
begins feeling the walls to find his way when light appears from a gem 
that the halfling has clutched in his tiny little hands. "Humans!" 
exclaims the thief in a very disgruntled voice.
	When out from the earth jumps a very large creature. He gazes 
upon the two heroes with no effect.   A few claw and pincher attacks and 
the creature must now defend himself.  Three swift and powerful strokes 
of the sword and the Umber Hulk lays at the feet of the powerful 
barbarian. "HA" laughs Borg as he lifts the corpse into the air and throws 
it into the hole that it had created to get the surprise on the two 
scavengers.
	A few more twists and turns and just yards in front of the two is 
more riches and treasures than they could ever hope to carry from this 
place.
	"THUD!" a huge red claw comes crashing down just inches from the 
thief who had been trying to sneak into the chamber and slip off with a 
few goodies before the real action began.
	Borg leaps into the air. Turns his ring and the confidence swells 
in him.  A few well placed sword hits and the dragon rocks back onto its 
hind quarters.  The thief jumps into the fray only to miss his first 
attack and the other dagger goes flying off into the darkness of the 
cave.
	The dragon rears back and belches forth a great blast of fire. 
Borg only laughs it off and then jumps into the dragon's face for another 
three strong strokes with the broad sword.  After the second hit the 
dragon attempts a getaway, but the third and final attack strikes true 
and the dragon slumps to its death.  Our heroes have defeated the great 
wyrm.
	"Timothy" Borg cries into the darkness "You can come out of your 
hiding place!"
	There is no answer. For several moments the barbarian searches 
for his tiny friend. He finds his friend burnt beyond recognition.  He 
had taken the full blast from the dragon's breath weapon and was not as 
lucky as the powerful barbarian.

	The above scenario could be played out on any given Saturday at 
any DM's home, except ONE! MINE!  If you would like to know how to scare 
your players and have them packing their books and grabbing their dice 
and heading for the door with the mere mention of the word dragon then 
read on.  The average great wyrm has lived for over 750 years and 
destroyed countless treasure raiders, how else do you think they get all 
of their wealth, villages and castles in their days.  How many players do 
you know that can boast about these things?  Not many!  Therefore a 
dragon should have countless more powers and hit points than the players 
do.  If played "by the book" then the Umber Hulk at the beginning of our 
little adventure could have a real good shot at the dragon.  But…
Upon consideration by myself and my group we have decided that by adding 
two zeros to the end of the dragon's hit dice the creature now becomes 
the opponent that you have only heard about in fantasy books and legends.  
I know some of you out there are saying "If you would play the dragon 
correctly then you would not have to do that." Okay let's examine this. 
Let's take the following character against any 15 HD dragon that you have 
lying around in your campaign.

BORG: level 15 barbarian with a CON of 18.  That equals 180 hp plus the 4 
hp that he gets for the high constitution which equals a grand total of 
240 hp.  Als give our hero an 18/00 STR, that gives him a +3 to hit and +7 
damage. We can't forget the +4 chain armor and the ring of fire 
resistance.  Oh don't forget the +5 two-handed broad sword.  Now your 
little dragon has a very powerful enemy to fight.  According to the 
Monster Manual you roll an 8-sided die to figure hp for a monster.  With 
this in mind our 15 HD dragon can only have 120 hp when the dragon 
belches his breath weapon the most hp that Borg could take would be 60, 
remember the ring.  If the saving throw is made then that number is now 
30.  Not a very powerful attack from such a noble creature.  Lets take 
out hero and lets see the damage that he can dish out.  3 attacks with a 
broad sword at 3d6+12, which comes out to about 30 hp/shot. Now combine 
the other 2 attacks and we have 90 hp of damage for the lowly humanoid 
that the dragon despises so much.  Next round the breath weapon is now 
only 30 hit points of damage at the MAXIMUM!  Borg makes his saving 
throw and he only takes 7 hpd! OUCH HURT ME! 
Borg attacks and now the maid is cleaning up the mess.  My little idea no 
longer looks so dumb.  Even calculating the dragon's hp and adding one 
zero to that still makes the dragon a very powerful opponent.  The dragon 
is the heart and soul of the game. Hence the name.  Where there are evil 
dragons there are good ones. The same rule applies to these as well.  To 
make them even more powerful seek out the handbook "Dragonomicon".  The 
dragon spells alone are worth the price of the book.  Death's Door, one 
of the spells, drains 50 levels from your player characters, as they walk 
thru it, before it becomes inactive.  Try attacking the dragon now after 
your 20th level characters are now all 6th and 7th level.  Dragons can be 
very powerful allies or they can be very powerful enemies.  It is all up 
to the way the DM play them and the way the players treat them.  It is all 
up to your group to decide how to handle them.  The next time you throw a 
dragon at your players give my little idea a try and see if the outcome 
is a bit different than the players had planed.

Next time I will come down to earth a bit and tell you how to chase 10th 
level characters out of the kobold lair.
