<p>
<i>PGP exists in several different versions. If you are not sure which version
is the right one for you, you may find help <a href="WHICH-~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/which-version.shtml">here</a>. The
following is a list of the most popular PGP versions available today:</i>
<p>
<hr>

<a name="Classic">
<h2>PGP 2.3a</h2></a>
<font size=+2>T</font size>his is the "classic" PGP version, and until
recently, this was the version generally used by PGP users all over the
world. You may still use PGP 2.3a if you want to, but you may experience
problems when trying to process messages and keys generated with PGP 2.6
and later versions, or when using keys that are larger than 1280 bits (the
maximum size is now 2048 bits). PGP 2.3a is presumably illegal to use within
the USA because of patent restrictions.
<p>
<br>


<a name="Unofficial">
<h2>PGP 2.6ui</h2></a>
<font size=+2>T</font size>his is an unofficial, "hacked" version of PGP 2.3a,
which aimed at correcting the incompatibility problems introduced by MIT PGP 2.6.
Please observe that PGP 2.6ui is not a "true" 2.6 version as it is based on
the source code for PGP 2.3a, and as such does not include the improvements
and bug fixes found in the newer versions. PGP 2.6ui was published by
<a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS26.HTM#2603" tppabs="http://freethought.tamu.edu/~meta/">mathew</a> in the UK, but is no longer
supported.
<p>
<br>

<h2>PGP 2.62ui</h2>
<a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS26.HTM#2604" tppabs="http://www.mantis.co.uk/~tony/"><font size=+2>T</font size>ony Lezard</a>
in the UK based this version of PGP on mathew's 2.6ui, but tried to bring it
up-to-date with the latest PGP 2.6x improvements (bigger keys, bug-fixes, new
command options etc.). PGP 2.62ui can be downloaded from
<a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS26.HTM#2605" tppabs="ftp://ftp.mantis.co.uk/pub/cryptography/">ftp.mantis.co.uk</a>.
<p>
<br>

<a name="MIT">
<h2>MIT PGP 2.6.2</h2></a>
<font size=+2>T</font size>his is the latest official version of PGP, released
by <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS25.HTM#2547" tppabs="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> and adapted (some would say mangled)
for use in the USA:
<ol>
<li>It creates messages that cannot be read by PGP versions prior to 2.5.
<li>It uses the RSAREF encryption library, making it slightly slower on most
    platforms. Furthermore, it does not understand the old signature format
    used by PGP 2.2 and earlier versions.
</ol>
PGP 2.6.2 is illegal to export from USA, but once exported anyone may use it
freely. This version corrects a number of bugs found in PGP 2.6
and 2.6.1. If you are a US citizen living in the US, this is probably the PGP
version you want.
MIT PGP 2.6.2 can be downloaded <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS24.HTM#2476" tppabs="http://web.mit.edu/network/pgp.html">here</a>.

<a name="International">
<h2>PGP 2.6.3i</h2></a>
<font size=+2>T</font size>his is the latest international version of PGP,
based on the source code for MIT PGP 2.6.2 and modified for international use.
PGP 2.6.3i is published by <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS24.HTM#2460" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/~staalesc/">Ståle
Schumacher</a> in Norway, and differs from MIT PGP 2.6.2 in the following ways:
<dl>
  <dt><dd><img src="IMAGES/BULLET~2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/bullet_red.gif" alt=*> It does not use the RSAREF encryption library
  <dt><dd><img src="IMAGES/BULLET~2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/bullet_red.gif" alt=*> It is 100% compatible with all other PGP 2.x versions
  <dt><dd><img src="IMAGES/BULLET~2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/bullet_red.gif" alt=*> It corrects a number of bugs present in PGP 2.6.2(i)
  <dt><dd><img src="IMAGES/BULLET~2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/bullet_red.gif" alt=*> It compiles "out of the box" for many new platforms
  <dt><dd><img src="IMAGES/BULLET~2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/bullet_red.gif" alt=*> It adds some new features without breaking compatibility with earlier versions
</dl>
PGP 2.6.3i is the most flexible, up-to-date version of PGP available today.
PGP 2.6.3i is probably illegal to use within the USA,
so if you are a US citizen, you should use <a href="#MIT">MIT PGP 2.6.2</a> or <a href="#USA">PGP 2.6.3</a> instead.
For more information on PGP 2.6.3i, and how to <a href="DOWNLO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/download.shtml">download</a> a copy, refer to the
<a href="INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/">International PGP Home
Page</a>.
<p>
<br>


<a name="USA">
<h2>PGP 2.6.3</h2></a>
<font size=+2>I</font>f you compile the source code for PGP 2.6.3i using the
-DUSA option and linking with <a href="RSAREF.TXT" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/RSAREF.txt">RSAREF</a> (rsaglue2.c) instead of MPILIB
(rsaglue1c.), you will get a version that identifies itself as PGP 2.6.3. It contains
all the same bug-fixes and improvements as PGP 2.6.3i, but it will be slightly
slower, and the "legal kludge" cannot be disabled. PGP 2.6.3 is not an official PGP version, but is still perfectly legal to use inside the USA. It is
only distributed as <a href="DOWNLO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/download.shtml">source code</a>. However, some
helpful individuals that have compiled it for their own use, have also made it
available to the general public:
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS26.HTM#2606" tppabs="http://www.rit.edu/~pdw5973/">MS-DOS</a>, by
Preston Wilson
  <li><a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS26.HTM#2607" tppabs="http://www.math.ohio-state.edu/~fiedorow/PGP/">Macintosh</a>, by Zbigniew Fiedorowicz
</ul>
I cannot guarantee the authenticity of these compilations. On the other hand,
I have no reason to believe that they have been tampered with, either.

<a name="ViaCrypt">
<h2>ViaCrypt 2.7.1 and 4.0</h2></a>
