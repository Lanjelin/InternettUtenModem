<i><font size=+2>T</font size>he following is a list of known bugs in PGP 2.6.3i, and how to correct them. If you think you have
discovered a new bug, please mail the details to

<h2>PGP 2.6.3(i)a patches available</h2>
Click <a href="PATCHS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/patch.shtml">here</a> to download the latest bug-fixes for PGP 2.6.3(i). (Sorry, source code only!)

<h2><img src="IMAGES/BLUEBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/blueball.gif" alt=*> PGP ignores long form of TZ variable</h2>
The TZ environment variable allows you to set your timezone and whether you're
using Daylight Savings Time (DST). The long form of the TZ specification also
allows you to specify when to switch to/from DST:
<pre>
  SET TZ=SSS[+|-]nDST,sm,sw,sd,st,em,ew,ed,et,shift
</pre>
However, most PGP compilations simply ignores everything after the first comma,
which means that PGP will always switch to DST at 01:00 on the first Sunday in
April, and back again at 02:00 on the last Sunday of October. This may not be
correct for all countries (and certainly not if you're in the southern
hemisphere).

<h2><img src="IMAGES/BLUEBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/blueball.gif" alt=*> PGP can't handle pass phrases with accented characters</h2>
A PGP user in Germany who recently upgraded from PGP 2.3a
to PGP 2.6.3i reported that he can't use his old keys anymore
with the new version, supposedly because he has used the german umlaut
characters 'ä' and 'ß' in the pass phrase.
<p>
A piece of advice: don't use any such characters. :-) A pass phrase written
in one character set or code page would probably not work in another anyway.
I think this "bug" was introduced somewhere around version 2.6. If you
have an old key with national characters in the pass phrase, change
the pass phrase to plain ASCII before upgrading to 2.6.3i.

<h2><img src="IMAGES/BLUEBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/blueball.gif" alt=*> Incorrect command line parsing with Borland C (MS-DOS)</h2>
The precompiled DOS version of PGP 2.6.3i is compiled using Microsoft C. If you
compile PGP yourself using Borland/Turbo C and are running the
standard COMMAND.COM shell (not 4DOS), you will find that PGP does not
behave as documented when using " (quotes) for specifying command line
parameters with embedded blanks. For example:
<pre>
  pgp -seat +comment="Would you send mail without an envelope?" msg.txt schumacher
</pre>
should be written as:
<pre>
  pgp -seat "+comment=Would you send mail without an envelope?" msg.txt schumacher
</pre>

<h2><img src="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/redball.gif" alt=*> Text files treated as binary (all platforms)</h2>
The binary/text recognition routine in PGP 2.6.2i has been rewritten in
2.6.3i in order to allow clearsigning of non-European languages (e.g.
Japanese, Korean, Chinese). This usually works very well, but on texts
with very long lines (longer than 132 characters), it will fail. To make the
binary recognition less strict, simply remove line 1056 in fileio.c:
<pre>
  if (lfctr>132) return FALSE; /* line too long. Not a text file*/
</pre>
But please note that text files with such long lines normally don't get
through email intact, resulting in a bad signature.

<h2><img src="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/redball.gif" alt=*> Cannot generate keys (Macintosh)</h2>
There is an error in the MacPGP distribution archive. Here's how to fix it:
<ol>
  <li>Rename the "doc" folder to "Documentation"
  <li>Move the "PGP User's Guide" folder into the "Documentation" folder
</ol>
PGP should now be able to generate the keys.

<h2><img src="IMAGES/REDBALL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/images/redball.gif" alt=*> Compiling problems (various Unix platforms)</h2>
<p>

<h3>Undefined strdup() function</h3>
The strdup() function is normally defined in &lt;string.h&gt;, but on some systems
it may be missing. If PGP won't link because of this, change line 2922 in
pgp.c from:
<pre>
  if (!(new[entrynum++] = strdup(tempbuf)))
</pre>
to:
<pre>
  if (!(new[entrynum++] = store_str(tempbuf)))
</pre>
<p>
Then remove the 'static' declaration from store_str() in keymaint.c.
If you're using an ANSI compiler, you'll have to add the prototype for
store_str() in keymaint.h, too:
<pre>
  char *store_str(char *str);
</pre>
<p>
<br>

<h3>Undefined strncasecmp() function</h3>
If your system doesn't have the strncasecmp() function, simply use
strncmp() instead.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Missing prototypes</h3>
In pgp.c, insert the following line after line 129 (in the #ifdef UNIX
section):
<pre>
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
