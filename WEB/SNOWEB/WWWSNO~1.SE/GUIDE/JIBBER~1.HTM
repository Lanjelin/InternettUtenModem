<H2>Jibber: </H2>
You enjoy snowboarding in big baggy clothes and you try to spend as much time off the ground as on it. You hang around the snowboardpark with your bluehaired, pierced friends and afterwards you enjoy busting it to Rage Against the Machine in the disco.<P></CENTER>

<H2><A HREF="../BJORKL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjorklid.html">Björkliden</A></H2>The resort is lacking the real steepness for a Boarder. But there are some interesting bowls to try. The nightlife and might not be exciting enough for you but you can always take the train to <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#174" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/riks.html">Riksgränsen</A>

<H2><A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#174" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/riks.html">Riksgränsen</A></H2>This is it.. Halfpipe competitions, midnightsun-snowboarding, lots of jibbers everywhere, unlimited offpist. Riksgränsen is the perfect solution for snowboarders but they don't have a permenent halfpipe though. A lot of snowboarders invade the small resort in the end of the season to join snowboard-camps,competitions and all nigth partying.
<H2><A HREF="../SALEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/salen.html">Sälen</A></H2>
Most of the slopes lack the real steepness needed to enjoy snowboarding at its best. But the area is well equipped with snowboard parks. You will not have trouble to find similar friends to you in the slopes. You might realize that there are persons that snowboard even better and has cooler outfits than you! Save your strength in the slopes because the nightlife is very heavy. ( If you are old enought to get inside the bars. )

<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#177" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/are.html"><H2>Åre</H2></A>
This is the meeting place for the majority of the Swedish snowboarders. The slopes are usually crowded with jibbers sitting and waiting for a friend to do a cool stunt. The slopes are really long and steep but you might get frustrated with some flat transportation trails. Åre can also offer you a good halfpipe and a really good headbanging session at night.

 <H2>  <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#176" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/vemdalen.html">Vemdalen </A>&<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#167" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjornrik.html">Björnrike</A></H2>
Vemdalen offers you the steepness but it might be a bit too icy. Björnrike offers you long but very flat slopes . You need vax under your snowboard to make your way down. You do not see too many good boarders on the two areas and this might be your first time to showoff and even impress somebody.

<H2><A HREF="../KITTEL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/kittelfj.html">Kittelfjäll</A></H2>
Snowboarders are a minority here although the area should be perfect for boarding with all its bowls and challenging trails between the trees. Maybe the resorts location, in the middle of nowhere, is what keeping the coolest boarders away.
