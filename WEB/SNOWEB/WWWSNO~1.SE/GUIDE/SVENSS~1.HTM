 You look for a quiet, cheap place for the family that offer nice and easy skiing for the kids. You like taking your wife on some distant crosscountry trail, while your kids are in skischool. You enjoy living in a small cabin or an apartment where you can do your own cooking.<P>


<P><H2><A HREF="../BJORKL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjorklid.html">Bj&ouml;rkliden</A></H2>
Excellent oppurtunity for you and the family here. Björkliden has got a beautiful enviroment and there are many trails where you can enjoy the views around this northern countryside. The resort has many activities for the kids and the prices for the accommondation are really OK.<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B>Don´t get too distracted by the beautiful nature so that you forget to pick up your kids in skischool. 

<H2><A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#174" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/riks.html">Riksgr&auml;nsen</A></H2>
Since Riksgränsen is so close to Björkliden, the enviroment is similar. The skiing is a bit tougher and the nightlife a bit loud. There are some runs on the back of the mountain that are suited for kids and slow mothers. 
<P><B>SnoWeb advice: </B> Make sure your kids doesn´t attempt to ski the steep black runs on the front side of the mountain.

<H2><A HREF="../SALEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/salen.html">S&auml;len</A></H2>
In Sälen there are activities for the whole family and a large variety of small cabins and apartments to live in. The resorts here are easily accessed from the main cities, which makes the journey comfortable and quick.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B>  The slopes are many, so make sure to keep an eye on the kids.

<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#177" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/are.html"><H2>&Aring;re</H2></A>
The resort is perhaps too big and crowded for the family but it has many good activities for the children and offers a few crosscountry trails up on the top part of the mountain. <P>Sometimes the top part, "Åreskutan", gets a bit too cold and windy and then it is not an ideal place to take the kids to. The lower part of the mountain is protected by the wind and offers many long and wide runs.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B>  If your are looking for a more quiet places, you should try some surrounding areas like <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#169" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/duved.html">Duved</A> and Björnen.

<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#176" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/vemdalen.html"> <H2>Vemdalen </A>& 
<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#167" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjornrik.html">Bj&ouml;rnrike</A></H2>
Both resorts attracts many families. A large part of the staff is working especially with arrangement for kids like, competitions, skischool and ski- playgrounds.<P> The slopes in Björnrike is a perfect learning center for kids, with its long and wide runs.  
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Combine. Ski one resort for a few days and then try the other one.

<H2><A HREF="../KITTEL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/kittelfj.html">Kittelfj&auml;ll</A></H2>
The lower section of Kittelfjäll is flat with a short lift for the children. But the rest of the area has difficult skiing. The small resort is situated in a beautiful northern countryside with some impressive peaks surrounding it.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Take the family hiking or go on a long crosscountry tour.
