You think hotels and resturants are an unessesary expence and you just want to ski as cheap as possible. Why just stay one week when you can stay for  months? The slopes should be tough and the beer cheap on a perfect resort and you do not mind sharing room with 10 smelly skibums, with silver-tape on their skiing equipment.

In Björkliden and in Riksgränsen you will be looked at as adventourus not cheap, when you dig yourself a snowcave or put up a tent. The hotel rooms are too expensive for you and forget buying beers in the bar. Spend your money on pasta and a skipass instead. 
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Bring a shovel or a tent.

Late spring and beginning of summer is an ideal time to visit the resort. You can find a few tents popping up in May. The skiing is good and the weather is usually sunny and that makes it to a good bum-resort. There is actually a camping park where you can cook and take a shower. The price for that is 150 <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#132" tppabs="http://bin.gnn.com/cgi-bin/gnn/currency?Sweden">kr </A>per night.The staff  in Riksg&auml;sen are or have been ski-bums so you will get along with them.

  
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> If a snow storm blows your tent away, try the full sized handicap WC in the hotel.

The prices for accommondation are OK if you put 10 people in a 4 bedded cabin on a lowseason week. The nightly activities are, however, painful to your wallet. 
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Bring a car, both as transport between the different resorts and for accommondation.

<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#177" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/are.html"><H2>&Aring;re</H2></A>Do a research on the prices on Hotels in Åre. You can actually find a small room for as low as 150-200<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#132" tppabs="http://bin.gnn.com/cgi-bin/gnn/currency?Sweden"> kr </A>a night. There are many ski-bums working on the resort. Look around and maybe you can find some work for yourself. The train goes all the way and through the village
 
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Go out early if you don´t want to stand in line.

<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#176" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/vemdalen.html"> <H2>Vemdalen </A>&

There is a camping space a few miles outside Vemdalen, that could save you a few Swedish kronor. The two resorts are pretty average if you look at the skiing and the prices on the skipasses.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Be here at the student-weekend in Januar. If you are a student.

Skipasses and the heli-skiing are the cheapest in Sweden if you consider the amount of skiing you get. But otherwise, there are only limited ways to make the stay cheap with just one hotel as an option. This is not the place to do a season in unless you get a job at the hotel or running the lifts.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Check it out.
