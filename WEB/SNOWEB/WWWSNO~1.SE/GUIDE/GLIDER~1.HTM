<H2>Glider:</H2></center>

You enjoy skiing, but only if you can cruise down an easy pist. Your outfit and equipment are as importent as your style in the slopes. The social life with your friends is what makes your vacation worth while.<P>

<P><H2><A HREF="../BJORKL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjorklid.html">Bj&ouml;rkliden</A></H2>
The slopes are long, wide and easy. The beautiful enviroment takes your breath away as you cruise down the well prepared slopes. You seldom end up in a lift-line. In other words a perfect resort for you.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Come up here in May-June when it is warm and the midnight sun is up.

<H2><A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#174" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/riks.html">Riksgr&auml;nsen</A></H2>
Riksgränsen has easy skiing at the backside of the mountain ( seen from the hotel and train station). If you traverse right at the top a few minutes, you can ski a few easy and beautiful offpist runs. You can also stop for a drink and get a nice sun tan along the slopes. The snow can get very wet and heavy during the afternoons in the latter part of the season. 
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Riksgränsen is the perfect resort to show up your new expensive ski-outfit.

<H2><A HREF="../SALEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/salen.html">S&auml;len</A></H2>
Large skiarea with many slopes, modern skisystem and many activities at nights. <A HREF="../SALEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/salen.html">Sälen </A> and <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#177" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/are.html">Åre</A> are the two most popular and largest resorts in Sweden. The resort is perfect for going up over a weekend or for a week with a group of friends or colleges.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> If your skiing-addiction gets too hard; go up to  Sälen for a few days to ski it off.

<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#177" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/are.html"><H2>&Aring;re</H2></A>
Åre with its long wide slopes attracts many cruising type of skiers and on a busy day you could end up in a huge line in the slope or at the lift station. The area is large enough for you to ski different slopes every day and there are mountain resturangs and huts along the slopes. The night life is very hectic, people even come here without skiis just for that.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> If you have trouble deciding where to spend your winter vacation; go to Åre. 

<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#176" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/vemdalen.html"> <H2>Vemdalen </A>& 
<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#167" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjornrik.html">Bj&ouml;rnrike</A></H2>
Björnrike has very gentle and easy slopes. The pace amoung the other skiers should fit yours. Vemdalen has two different areas on each side of the road that takes you to the resort. The smaller one has got comfortable long runs and not as steep and icy as the other side.
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Try to visit Björnrike and Vemdalen plus the other resorts nearby for a complete week.

<H2><A HREF="../KITTEL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/kittelfj.html">Kittelfj&auml;ll</A></H2>
The resort is perhaps too isolated. The most slopes are challenging but there are a few you can cruise down. People up here notice your skiing and your attitude before your outfit and equipment. 
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> If you want to impress your adventourus friends; say that you are planning your vacation in Kittelfjäll.
