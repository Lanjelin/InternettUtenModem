<H2>Party: </H2></center>

You enjoy a short day of skiing, but you always try to find a bar in the slopes around lunchtime. Then the only skiing you do after is down to the Apres Ski for more drinks. The next day you barely make it up to the slopes in time for a lunchbeer.<P>





<P><H2><A HREF="../BJORKL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjorklid.html">Bj&ouml;rkliden</A></H2>

People come here for other reasons than to party. You will need a lot of drinks if you will enjoy the nightlife here. One other problem is the high prices on beer and other drinks. But an experienced ski-partyanimal in Sweden always makes sure he brings his own drinks.



<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Ask around for Swedish home-made liqouer to spice up your vacation.

<H2><A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#174" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/riks.html">Riksgr&auml;nsen</A></H2>

The prices on drinks in Riksgr&auml;nsen are even higher than Bj&ouml;rkliden. But this doesn´t effect the good atmosphere here. You will not have problem finding drinking mates here because there is only one place to go out at night: the hotel. They usually have cool music groups playing at the Apres Ski and somtimes in the bar at night. The sun is always up when you start partying and it is still up when you go to bed.

<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Have some beers at the Apres Ski. It is worth it. 


<H2><A HREF="../SALEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/salen.html">S&auml;len</A></H2>


S&auml;len is a known party resort. People come up here from Stockholm, Gothenburg and other big cities. You will find many activities that don´t require a skipass. The problem here is that there are so many different places to go at night. If you come up here around Christmas and New Years, prepare yourself for a heavy week and don´t forget to practice before. 
<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Bring a non-alkoholic friend to do the driving.



<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#177" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/are.html"><H2>&Aring;re</H2></A>

The night life in &Aring;re is similar to S&auml;len, but &Aring;re is more like a small town with all the clubs and bars quite close together. Lots of activities, music groups and beer every week. There are also many places in the slope where you can stop and have a drink.

<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Go out early if you don´t want to stand in line.



<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#176" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/vemdalen.html"> <H2>Vemdalen </A>& 

<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#167" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/bjornrik.html">Bj&ouml;rnrike</A></H2>

Björnrike is a family resort and you might find yourself lonly in the bar at night.  Vemdalen offers a well equipped bar and during the student weekend in January they have, in their own words, the largest Apres Ski in the world inside a big Gym hall. But the quality of the nightlife on both resorts is shifting.

<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Be here at the student-weekend. If you are a student.



<H2><A HREF="../KITTEL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.snoweb.se/kittelfj.html">Kittelfj&auml;ll</A></H2>

One lift..One Hotel..One Bar. The nightlife can be quite interesting here. Make sure it is a special night, like New Year's Eve, if you are thinking about having a big session. You can at least count on the bartender beeing present, so that you will have somebody to keep you company on a low-season night.

<P><B>SnoWeb advice:</B> Keep a low profile and don´t mention that you are from the city.
