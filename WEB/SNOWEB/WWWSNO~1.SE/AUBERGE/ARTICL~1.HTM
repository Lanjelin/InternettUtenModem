<STRONG>Nestled up against the Parmelan mountains, not far from Annecy, the Auberge Camelia is a restaurant
 that was long known in the past as a simple place to get a simple meal in rural surroundings.<P>

But it has undergone a big change since Roger and Suzanne Farrell-Cook, an English couple bought it 
and spent a lot of time and energy making it a cosy hotel and restaurant.<P>

Everything about the hotel is new though the rooms keep a rural touch, The restaurant and bar look as
 neat and cosy as an English inn of the type the traveller usually searches for in vain.<P>

The reception is friendly. Roger, as he draws your beer or serves your drink before dinner always
 has time for a chat and a smile . Sue who looks after the edibles, is equally hospitable.<P>

<STRONG>Pleasant surprise: the prices are quite reasonable. Situated in a completely rural area where the industry
 revolves around apples pears and milk, the Auberge Camelia is a good place to spend a few hours
 before dining , chatting or passing the night before going on to the ski slopes of Chinaillon or La Clusaz 
about half an hour away.<P>
As I left the Camelia last time after a good meal, I asked Roger if there was anything he would like to say
 to someone who was coming to this part of the Alps to visit Chez Camelia.<P>

You know I think we have something a bit special here.</EM> <BR>And I think he's right.<P>
