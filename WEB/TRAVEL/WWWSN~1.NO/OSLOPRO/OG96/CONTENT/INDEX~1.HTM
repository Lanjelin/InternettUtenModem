art, concerts and nightlife. At the same time it is a green and environmentally friendly city,

experiences. You might just as well decide to stay an extra day in Oslo ! <tab>

<h2>Oslo - advancing world peace</h2>
<font size=-1><p>Oslo was the site of the peace negotiations between Israel and the PLO in 1993. Here the parties
found both the right atmosphere and the right intermediaries to conclude this historical peace
treaty.</p>

The Norwegian Nobel Institute</a> is located near the Royal Palace (the building was erected in 1867
and remodelled in 1903-05 by the architects Berner & Berner). The Nobel Foundation was
established by the Swedish inventor and industrialist Alfred Bernhard Nobel (1833-1896). In his
last will dated 1895 Mr Nobel determined that the annual proceeds from his estate of SEK 30
million should be divided into five equal parts, and the money should be given "as a prize to
persons who had contributed the most to mankind the past year". The Nobel Institute in Oslo is
the home of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, the body which selects the Peace Prize winner.
This committee is elected by the Norwegian Storting (National Assembly). The Nobel
Committee selects the Peace Prize winner based on the criteria set forth in Nobel's will; "the
person(s) who shall have done the most or the best work for brotherhood between nations, for
abolition or reduction of standing armies and for arranging and promoting peace congresses".
The Peace Prize ceremony took place in the Nobel Institute from 1905 through 1946 (only
interrupted by the two World Wars). From 1947 the Oslo University Aula was used, and from
1990 the event has been arranged in Oslo City Hall. The ceremony takes place each year on
December 10, which was the date in 1896 when Alfred Nobel died in San Remo, Italy. </p>

<p>The Nobel institute has a very extensive library (approx. 155.000 books) with focus on
international peace research, international economics, humans rights, political 
science and modern political history. The library is open to the public.</p></font>
