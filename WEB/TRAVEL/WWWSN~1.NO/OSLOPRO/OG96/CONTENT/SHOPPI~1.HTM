<h2>Shopping</h2>

You will find everything in Oslo! Shopping Malls, department stores,
small boutiques, shopping streets with hundreds of small shops and
retailers, charming antique shops, flea markets, suppliers of
exclusive international brand names and local handicraft shops. In the
town centre the shops are situated in different main areas.
<p>

<h4>Aker Brygge</h4>

One of Oslo's newest and most attractive shopping areas with a
delightful location on the wharf! (Bryggen). In the old shipyard
buildings there are several theatres and cinemas, entertainment,
approx. 35 restaurants, clubs and bars, as well as many shops,
food-stores, delicatessen and galleries. All along the wharf there is
bustling activity. Here you can take a walk by the harbour and enjoy
the atmosphere and the view from all the outdoor cafes and
restaurants. Old sailing boats, fresh shrimp, Norwegian beer and mead
onboard a Viking ship in the bargain. Aker Brygge is much more than
shops: it is a place of experiences and impressions. You must come
here and place your finger on Oslo's pulse on a hot and sunny summer's
night or day. Remember, the sun sets late in Oslo in the summer.
<p>

<h4>Vikaterrassen </h4>

Vikaterrassen is a shopping street near Aker Brygge, with several
small exclusive shops. Oslo Konserthus (Oslo Concert Hall) is also
located here, as well as cafes and restaurants. <p>

<h4>Karl Johansgate </h4>

Karl Johansgate is the City's main street. It begins at the Palace and
ends at Oslo Central Station. The University, Studenterlunden,
Stortinget (the Parliament Building) and the National Theatre are on
this street. Henrik Ibsen and Edvard Munch strolled along the street
every day and frequented their usual haunt, Grand Caf&eacute;. Behind
the meticulously-restored facades from the previous century,
Pal&eacute;et Shopping Centre has created an impressive milieu of
"boutiques" and restaurants.
<p>

<h4>Pedestrian precincts </h4>

Pedestrian precincts in the town centre and at Stortorvet (the main
square). From Karl Johansgate you automatically enter Oslo's
pedestrian precincts. Hundreds of shops and restaurants. The
department stores Steen & Strøm, GlasMagasinet and street hawkers from
every corner of the world offer their wares. Don't miss the colourful
flower market on Stortorvet in front of the Cathedral.
<p>

<h4>In Storgaten, Møllergaten and Torggaten</h4>

A mass of shops and fascinating small shopping lanes. And, of course,
Husfliden on Møllergaten, where craftsmen from all over Norway market
homemade goods whose characteristics belong to a rich tradition.
<p>

<h4>"Oslo City" and "Grønlands Torg" </h4>

A visible proof of Oslo's modernization: the shopping centre Oslo
City, the new congress and concert hall Oslo Spektrum, and behind the
largest hotel in Scandinavia - The Plaza -, the new pedestrian
precinct Grønlands Torg.
<p>

<h4>Bogstadveien, Hegdehaugsveien and Majorstua </h4>

Between the Royal Palace and Frognerparken lies one of Oslo's most
popular shopping areas, with more than 400 stores.
<p>

<h4>NORWAY TAX-FREE </h4>

If you are a resident of a country outside Scandinavia, and intend
taking your purchases out of the country, you will get the Norwegian
Value Added Tax (MOMS in Norwegian) refunded. But you must remember to
mention this to the shop so that you can take a Tax-Free check with
you.

Within the last few years there has been a gratifying development with
a number of shops open into the evening. At the large kiosks,
supermarkets or shopping centres outside the City Centre, you can
purchase what you require at almost any time of the day. Don't forget
that we also have dozens of petrol stations, open 24hrs a day, which
stock most things.
