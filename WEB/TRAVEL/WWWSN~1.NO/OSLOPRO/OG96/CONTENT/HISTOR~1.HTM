<h2>History</h2>

In the 8th century a settlement was built right at the top of the Oslo
Fjord. This little Norwegian village grew rapidly during Viking times:
agriculture, trade and shipbuilding were important commercial
activities, and Oslo has truly earned its title of "Viking Capital".
<p>

Oslo was founded long after the town had been developed by the
Vikings. It was not until 1048 that Harald Hardråde (half-brother of
St. Olav - Norway's patron saint) discovered that Oslo was a thriving
community with a port and agriculture. The founding of the city took
place in the turbulent period between the Viking Age and Norway's
Catholic Middle Ages. Many remnants and ruins can be found from
Ancient Oslo in the Memorial Park. The city has a fascinating,
interesting and dramatic history. Oslo's population was substantially
reduced during the time of the Black Death in 1348 which claimed over
50% of the inhabitants. This epidemic also had political consequences
for Norway, which became reduced to a province of Denmark. During this
period Copenhagen was the actual capital of Norway. Oslo was also
greatly affected by the Lutheran-Protestant Reformation of 1537, with
religious conflicts, political separation from the Catholic Church and
the foundation of a Protestant National Church. Many ruins of churches
and monasteries (for example Cistersienserklosteret - the Cistercian
Abbey - on Hovedøya) bear witness to this process.
<p>

Oslo was completely destroyed by fire in 1624, which was purported to
have been started deliberately by four witches. The Renaissance King,
Christian IV of Denmark and Norway, decided to move Oslo from what we
today call the Old Town, and rebuild it under the protective shadow of
Akershus Festning (Akershus Fortress). Following intense renewal and
advanced town planning in the spirit of the Renaissance, a completely
new city was created and named Christiania in 1624. After 1814 Norway
was united with Sweden, and Christiania experienced very strong
economic and political growth with substantial expansion right up
until the dissolution of the union with Sweden and independence in
1905. After the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Christiania in
1924, it was decided that the original name of Oslo was to be
re-instated as of 1 January 1925.

<h2>Population</h2>

Oslo is the capital city of Norway, and has in excess of 480,000
inhabitants. About 20% of the country's population (850,000) live in
Greater Oslo.

<h2>Commerce and Industry</h2>

<h2>Geography</h2>

Oslo city's reference point is 59deg.55"N 10deg.45"E, as far north as,
for example, Helsinki, St. Petersburg, the northerly part of
Kamchatka, Anchorage in Alaska and Kap Farvel in Greenland.
<p>

Its area covers 454 km2 (175 sq miles), of which 242 km2 (93 sq miles)
are forest, 8 km2 (3 sq miles) parkland and recreational areas, 40
islands and 343 inland lakes.

<h2>Climate</h2>

Even though the city is situated so far north, its climate is
temperate in the autumn and warm in spring and summer. There is
usually snow 3 to 5 months of the winter, and skiing conditions are
good in the hills around Oslo between December and April. From May to
July the weather can be quite warm with long periods of sunshine.
Drought can also occur from time to time. This is due to Oslo's
northerly position, well protected by the mountains from Atlantic
rainfall, and favourable help from the Gulf Stream. Statistically
speaking, Oslo is Scandinavia's sunniest capital.

<h2>Holiday, sport and leisure</h2>

Oslo is surrounded by forest and fjord. An important part of the
city's political tradition is to preserve the fjord and the area
surrounding the city for leisure and outdoor pursuits. Oslomarka is
used by thousands of skiers and hikers all the year round thanks to
restrictions in the urbanization of the city.
<p>

Some of the major sports events in Oslo will be the Grete Waitz Race,
the Holmenkollen Relay, Oslo Marathon and the Holmenkollen Ski
Festival.
<p>

Oslo is a ski-eldorado with over 2,000 km (1250 miles) of prepared ski
tracks for cross-country skiing and many ski lifts for alpine skiing.
The tracks are also used throughout the rest of the year: Bærumsmarka,
Nordmarka and Østmarka are all places where many people meet every
weekend.
