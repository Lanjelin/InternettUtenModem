Families with children will have a rewarding task when they visit Oslo and have
to "find something the children will enjoy". We recommend in particular the
amusement park <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#71" tppabs="http://www.norgesparken.no/norgesparken/">Tusenfryd</A>, a few kilometres south of Oslo.<p>
	Many of the best choices of entertainment for children are those offered by
the large establishments: theatres, opera, cinema and museums.<p><br> <br>
