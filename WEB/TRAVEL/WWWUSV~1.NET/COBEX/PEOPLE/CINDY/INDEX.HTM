Hi,<br>

Welcome to my page.  I have been working at COBEX International for about
2 years.  When I first arrived in St. Thomas I had just moved here from
Denver and a lab tech job in a Biotechnology firm (a degree in Biology). 
For the last 2 years I have been doing graphic design and html for COBEX. 
<p>

I hope you enjoy our Web site, we are proud to have the "Official Tourism
Site" for the U.S. Virgin Islands.  If you have any comments or
suggestions please feel free to let us know. <p>

Also if you are interested in getting your own web site on the USVI 
Webzine <a href=mailto:clarason@islands.vi>contact me</a> for more info.<br>
