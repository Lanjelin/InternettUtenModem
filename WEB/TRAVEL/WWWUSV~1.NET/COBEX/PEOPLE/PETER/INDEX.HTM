<P>It all started at New York Hospital, November 17, 1944, in The City.
My early years were pretty much occupied with working through the entire
series of Hugo Gernsback's &quot;Boy Radio Experimenter&quot;. My family
moved to Niagara Falls, NY, where I attended grade school. My Uncle Leonard,
a tinkerer and inventor introduced me to the works of <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2488" tppabs="http://www.neuronet.pitt.edu/~bogdan/tesla/">Nikola
Tesla</A>, a scientist, inventor, occultist, and pioneer of the use of
the AC (Alternating Current) power system we use today. Some of this must
have made an impression, because I went on in later life to become a Senior
Member of the <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2489" tppabs="http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers, (IEEE)</A>.</P>

<P> My first real job was at <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2490" tppabs="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A> Research
and Development labs in East Fishkill, N.Y. This provided a great opportunity
to develop a working knowledge of computers. The job was OK, but the working
environment was a bit restrictive for my taste. </P>

<P>In 1967 I left IBM and went into business, developing electronic controls
for lighting and sound systems. After building several Hullaballoo clubs,
a couple of Electric Theatres, several discos, and some recording studios,
I ended up in Marin County, California. By now I was seriously into rock
and roll technical production, sound, and road shows. Between doing 500
shows for the promoter Bill Graham, mostly in Winterland, San Francisco,
I operated a studio and development lab for high end sound systems. In
the late 70's the first computer kits came out. Now it was possible to
have an entire system on a desktop. This fascinated me even more than rock
and roll, so I jumped back in. In 1979 I moved to the Caribbean, and fell
in love. Along the way I picked up a Certified Media Specialist certificate
from the National Audio Visual Association, (NAVA), and I hold U.S. Federal
Communications Commission Commercial (Radiotelephone) and Amateur Extra
(WA2AAX) Radio Licenses.</P>

<P> Since living in the Caribbean I served for several years as the <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2491" tppabs="http://www.unido.org/">UNIDO
(United Nations Industrial Development Organization)</A> Computer and Telecommunications
Consultant on design and development missions to Barbados, Montserrat,
Trinidad, Antigua, and Guyana. </P>

<P>In 1981 I founded Octagon Consultants Int'l, Inc, a St. Thomas, USVI
based network and computer consulting firm. In 1994 I started COBEX, an
Internet service provider and Web Publishing business. My community service
activities, include serving on the boards of Rotary Club and the Kids and
the Sea Foundation. </P>

<P>I am the organizer and founder of the <A HREF="telnet://virgin.usvi.net.">V.I.P.
FreeNet</A>, the first community computer system in the Caribbean, and
spend a good bit of time promoting the Internet and the <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2492" tppabs="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet
Society</A> in the Caribbean via writing and speaking engagements. For
relaxation, I play pop and classical music on baroque English recorder.
