<H2>Abstract</H2>

<EM>
The United States Virgin Islands is perceived by much of the English 
speaking Caribbean region as a bridge between the fully developed 
telecommunications technology arena of North America and the 'down 
island' developing countries. This is due in part to the tremendous 
publicity put out by the major telecommunications players (AT&T, MCI, 
Sprint, and others) about the fiber optic undersea cable activities 
centered in St. Thomas.<p>
Magen's Bay, St. Thomas, is the hub for the largest confluence of 
submarine cables in the region. Fiber service extends from this hub to 
North America, Puerto Rico, South America, and Europe. More cables come 
on line each year.<p>
Internet connectivity, however, must come from North America. The 
tariffs and policies of the communications carriers result in a high 
price for connectivity. Typically, a T-1 circuit from St. Thomas, VI to 
Miami, FL, costs $15,000 to $20,000 per month , depending on the carrier 
and contract. Academic, governmental, and personal Internet use in the 
region is extremely limited, mostly by uucp and other dial-up 
connections. The costs of setting up, maintaining, and managing an 
Internet hub/service provider operation would result in service fees 
higher than most of the region's potential users could pay.<p>
The paper describes the creation and development of USVI.NET, an 
Internet hub / service provider for the region using a FreeNet as a 
basis for attracting the necessary interest in Internet connectivity in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. Providing the services to users at no cost, 
attracting donations of equipment, software, programming services and 
support, builds the operation to a point of 'critical mass'. The users 
of the service then induce the organizations with whom they are 
affiliated, into Internet connectivity. While individual FreeNet users 
do not pay, any organization on the network does contribute to cost-
sharing. This method builds the network to and throughout the U.S. 
Virgin Islands to a self-sustaining economic basis.<p>
Initial funding for the start up comes from a public sector-private 
sector partnership. Octagon Consultants teams up with the local Public 
Broadcasting System (PBS) affiliate WTJX-TV. (PBS is moving into 
distance learning using 2-way VSAT data technology).<p>
Connectivity to USVI.NET from North America is via a combination of 
terrestrial fiber cable links to SURA.NET, and satellite data links via 
PBS.<p>
The network is subsequently extended south, using 56 K lease lines 
connecting other Caribbean islands and reaching to Guyana, South 
America.<p>
Through partnership arrangements with various local operating telephone 
companies, co-located CISCO async routers with dial up modems allow 
connections on each island without the necessity of long distance phone 
charges.<p>

Internet connectivity did not exist in the <A HREF="../../INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/">
U.S. Virgin Islands</A> prior to 
1994. Residents familiar with Internet services gained their knowledge 
while abroad, in North America or Europe, attending schools, 
conferences, commercial trade shows, or by visiting friends who, for one 
reason or another, had Internet access.<P>
While there is a large (by Caribbean standards) educational institution 
here, the <A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2433" tppabs="http://www.uvi.edu/">University of the Virgin Islands,</A>
the cost of connectivity was prohibitive within the constraints of their 
operating budget.<P>
The government agencies and the commercial business community, many of 
whom have local area computer networks as a part of  their management 
information systems,  did not even use electronic mail. Access to 
Commercial on-line services, such as Compuserve and America On-Line, 
required, in addition to a paid membership, the use of a long distance 
telephone modem call with a day rate of at least 25 cents (US)  a minute 
to connect. Consequently, an extremely limited number of residents had 
any personal experience with these services. The federally funded 
<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs24.htm#2499" tppabs="http://www.nrao.edu/">National Radio Astronomical Observatory</A> 
installed its <A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2500" tppabs="http://www.nrao.edu/doc/vlba/html/VLBA.html"> 
Very Long Baseline Array</A> in St. Croix in early 1994 caused the first 
Internet line to come into the Territory on a subsidized basis.<P>
The University made an arrangement with NRAO to piggy back on that 
line. For the first time in the history of the U.S. Virgin Islands 
direct Internet access was possible, albeit in only a few places.<P>
This situation provided the author with an opportunity to design, 
develop and test a socio-economic model that, if successful, would bring 
widespread  awareness, desire, and ability to pay for Internet 
connectivity to a geographically isolated, underserviced population of 
information have-nots, the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands.<P>
The model would then be adapted and expanded to include the entire 
Caribbean region.<P>

Geographically, the Caribbean region is located south of Florida, North 
of Venezuela, and east of Central America. The 
<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2501" tppabs="http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/vt2/cam.html">Virtual Tourist </A>

the region is available from 
<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2502" tppabs="http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/americas.html">here.</A><P>
The Caribbean includes independent states as well as dependent territories or 
commonwealths of the United States, United Kingdom, France, and  
Netherlands. These entities maintain their own customs, immigration, 
tax schedules, and local governments. The national economies of most of 
these states prior to the mid 20th century were still agrarian and 
trading based, highly profitable to those in control of the industries. 
Today the major industry is tourism, with the all the attendant seasonal 
variations in cash flow.<P>
The Caribbean Region technically includes the island nation of Cuba, and 
those states in the Caribbean Sea south to the north coastal areas of 
Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, and French Guyana. Bermuda and The Bahamas 
are not part of the Caribbean Region.<P>

</PRE><P>
The U.S. Virgin Islands forms the top of a chain of islands extending 
south to Guyana, South America, and are generally known as the Lesser 
Antilles, or  Eastern Caribbean. English is the predominant language. 
Most of the island states were or are British Territories. The monetary 
system is the EC Dollar, fixed to the U.S. dollar at a rate of about  
$1.00 EC to $0.40 US.<P>
The Eastern Caribbean is a difficult place to succeed when it comes to 
business and trade opportunities. High import duties on almost all 
goods, restrictive taxes,  government controls on private enterprise, 
and expensive logistics, including shipping,  telecommunications, and 
costs of inter-island transportation make doing business, whether local, 
regional, or global, extremely complicated and expensive.<P>
Other states in the region essentially belong to France or the 
Netherlands. They share the same logistical difficulties, and even more 
convoluted telecommunications problems.<P>
<EM>Back to <A HREF="#CONTENTS">Contents</A></EM>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="CH3">3. Telecom Costs in the Region</A></H2>
Cable & Wireless has a virtual monopoly on long distance traffic 
between English speaking islands. While there is some Internet service 
available from C&W, in Barbados, for example, the best personal rate 
offered is $ .40 per minute at night. At $ 24.00 per hour, this is 
hardly affordable. In comparison, there are many places in the U.S. 
where a unix shell account on an Internet-connected system can be had 
for $ 24.00 per month. http://www.cwc.com  (under construction).<P>
The French islands, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the French side of St. 
Martin are serviced by French Telecom, and The Dutch islands of Saba, 
St. Eustacia, and the Dutch side of St. Maarten (note spelling 
difference: it IS the same island), are serviced by LandsRadio.<P>
Pricing policies of these carriers are based on perceived value, not 
cost. A DS0, 56K or 64 K circuit from anyplace in the region to the U.S. 
mainland can cost $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 per month. In many cases, the 
circuit is difficult or impossible to get, due to political or other 
non-discloseable reasons.<P>
Compounding all this cost problem is the fact that, due to the lack of 
education in the region of the benefits and value  of network services, 
there would be only a small potential user base to draw upon. Economies 
of scale require a large user base, so each user needs to  pay only a  
very small portion of the overall cost. Major educational efforts would 
be needed to develop an awareness of Internet,  leading to an 
increasing demand for service, and a wider user base.<P>
When taken at face value, political or local economic factors, combined 
with the high cost of transport, to which must be added the cost of 
network operations, equipment, and personnel yield a simple conclusion:<P>
<EM>The costs of setting up, maintaining, and managing an Internet 
hub/service provider operation would result in service fees higher than 
most of the region's potential users could or would pay.</EM><P>
Examining the situation more carefully, however, reveals that there is 
some percentage of the population that is so desperate for Internet 
access that they will pay any price. Another segment of the population 
is aware enough of the advantages of Internet communications and 
connectivity to be willing to pay for that access at certain  price 
levels.<P>
An understanding of exactly what those price levels are,  how many 
people or organizations want or need service, and whether those entities 
are educational, government, or commercial, are what level of service 
they need or want,  can help determine the extent and nature of the 
ultimate funding model.<P>
Consider this example of creative access:<P>
Long distance voice telephone rates from island to island average $ 1.00 
per minute using direct distance dialing (DDD),  even when the 
communicating islands are within line of sight of each other. 
Outgoing calls from the Islands to the U.S. or Canada can be as high as 
$ 2.00 per minute. Billing is in one minute increments.<P>
Conversely, long distance rates from resellers and wholesalers from the 
U.S. to the islands can be as low as US $ .40 per minute, with billing 
in six second intervals (1/10 minute).<P>
This disparity of rates has spawned a new industry in voice telephone 
service products. Long distance callback services in the U.S. provide 
discounted telephone service using computer operated machinery. The 
business operator, say in Miami, has a telephone switch, computer, a 
bank of local dial tone lines, and a wholesale arrangement with some 
provider of long distance service. A unique local phone number in Miami 
is assigned to each Caribbean customer. When the customer in the 
Caribbean, say in Antigua, wishes to place a long distance call, he 
dials direct to the Miami phone number assigned to him. The phone in 
Miami, attached to a computer, is allowed to ring once or twice, but is 
never answered. The Caribbean customer hangs up, paying nothing of 
course, because his call was never completed. Fifteen seconds later, the 
computer in Miami dials the Caribbean customer direct at a pre-arranged 
Antigua number, probably at a rate of US $ .40 per minute. The Antigua 
customer answers, and is immediately patched through an automatic 
switchboard that supplies a Miami dial tone. Using touch tone, the 
Antigua customer places the desired call anywhere in the world, perhaps 
even to a neighboring island, at a cost of $ .40 plus the U.S. long 
distance charge, plus perhaps $ .10 per minute for the stateside service 
provider.<P>
This scheme, of course can and is applied to uucp mail and embedded file 
transfer services. A business on island "X" maintains a unix computer 
system connected to local dial tone with modems. Customers call in from 
their computers and deposit mail, files, etc. destined for Internet 
delivery worldwide.  When the computer calculates that there are at 
least two minutes worth of data transfer, it calls a long distance call 
back service in the U.S. which is specially equipped for computer 
communications. The callback comes in to the Internet-connected 
stateside computer, rings once, gets detected, and initiates a program 
that calls the computer in island "X" and downloads the uucp traffic at 
the discount phone rates. The traffic is then distributed via Internet. 
Incoming traffic for island "X" triggers a modem call from the uucp 
server to island "X", followed by file transfer. The users on island "X" 
modem  in periodically for mail. In the case of users with computer 
systems on line 24 hours a day, local dial uucp takes place 
automatically.<P>
No lease lines are used locally, as this may cause Cable and Wireless to 
notice the revenue diverting activity and, ultimately, attempt to 
restrict it in some way.<P>
This scheme does not stop with e-mail. The service provider on island 
"X" has a small thin ethernet  network. Several  486 PC workstations 
running Windows , a TCP/IP stack, and software such as Spry 3.0 are 
connected to an async router. At the opening of the business day, a  
28.8 K V.34 modem async SLIP connection from the router is made to a US 
mainland Internet service provider via a call back system at US $ .50 
per minute, or $ 30.00 per hour. The customers of the business then 
"Surf the Web" at $ 20.00 per hour each. Only 6 users on the system 
yields an income of $ 120.00 per hour, or over $ 1,000 per day.<P>
The story is passed along to illustrate the point that some users will 
go out of their way to get some level of service, and willingly pay up 
to some choke point. Some  uucp operators are getting as much as US  $ 
300.00 per month.<P>
Yet another class of potential users does not yet know enough to want 
Internet. Some of that group will be able to afford to pay when Internet 
is available, and some will never be able to pay. A combination of 
social responsibility and market development through education must be 
applied to this group to stratify and  define the class of service that 
is appropriate.<P>
Finally, the general hype, hoopla, and perceived desireability of 
certain aspects of  Internet connectivity (high speed Web access)  can 
cause the purchase or  funding of sizzle to be easier than funding the 
steak (e-mail, ftp, gopher, text based workhorses).<P>

<H2><A NAME="CH4">4. The <A HREF="../../INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/"> 
U.S. Virgin Islands</A> Advantage</H2>
Maintaining close cultural and ethnic ties with the rest of the English 
speaking Caribbean, the US Virgin Islands enjoy a unique advantage in 
the region with respect to business, tourism, banking, commerce, and  
telecommunications. While it is politically a U.S. Territory, the USVI 
is unique in that it is outside the jurisdiction of US Customs.<P>
A duty free port, it is the only place in the region where the unique 
combination of open market economy, free enterprise,  fully deregulated 
telecommunications, and income tax exemptions are available.<P>
Toll free 800 service to the U.S. mainland, low cost shipping via 
the U.S. Post Office, special Federal and Local tax incentive programs,  
Free Port status, English language, U.S. dollar, and the protection of 
the US Flag makes the USVI an ideal place to build business and trade 
connections with the rest of the Caribbean.<P>
U.S. stateside residents may write off the cost of business and convention 
travel to the USVI at the maximum percentage allowed by the US Internal 
Revenue Service.<P>
These factors, plus the fact that the author is a 16 year resident of 
the USVI made St. Thomas, USVI an ideal choice as a base of operations 
for this networking project.<P>

<H2><A NAME="CH6">6. Narrative</A></H2>
My computer career started out rather sedately in 1966. I went to work 
every day at building 914 of the IBM Research and Development hybrid 
circuits group, in East Fishkill, New York. Even then there was 
networking. Each of the buildings had a few computer terminals connected 
to a mainframe that was located somewhere near Armonk, New York. One day 
all the engineers got to go on a bus tour to visit "The Machine". We all 
got excited, for a whole hour. <P>
Now, almost 30 years later, 
it's more than just getting exciting.  The Caribbean networking project 
is already into its third year of constantly rising action, 
adventure, and excitement. What's more, it shows no signs of 
slowing down.<P>
Moving to the Caribbean in 1979 to pursue a more relaxed lifestyle, I 
transferred my computer and management skills to solving problems for 
small to mid sized companies on various management information issues. 
While the solutions were often computer related, many times they were 
not. The single common thread that seemed to turn a lagging MIS 
department around, be it private sector or government, was improved 
communications and access to information. High telecommunications costs, 
logistic problems in shipping, delayed mail, and an island time clock 
aggravated the problems. Most computers were used as stand alone items, 
really just advanced calculators, catalogues, or word processors. Few 
computer users interacted with anyone or anything other than their 
machines in the work environment when it came to business information. 
On the other hand, social interaction in connection with other subjects, 
like interpersonal communications, family concerns, discussions of food, 
etc. are much more a part of day to day life in the islands than they 
are in a more developed area.<P>
The institution of in-house electronic mail proved to be one of the most 
significant productivity improvements available to these organizations. 
Social interaction via e-mail as a training exercise proved to be fun 
and effective. From there, it was only a short step to remote office 
communications for electronic information transfer, software support, 
and remote mail.<P>
One of my clients, Virgin Islands Public Television System, provided an 
opportunity to demonstrate how, in a relatively short time (one year), a 
small staff could become more productive through computer support. 
Because we were dealing with television and media professionals, fear of 
equipment was not an issue. Again, the addition of e-mail to the 
management operation proved popular and fun, even for those on staff who 
would not normally use a computer in their work. Several staff members 
asked me if it was possible to "e-mail" persons in other organizations, 
even elsewhere in the world.<P>
<EM>July 1993</EM><P>
This experience gave me an idea for a "hook" to start a FreeNet in the 
Virgin Islands. Many local residents who would never touch a computer 
had, or would have, children going off to college. Most universities 
were on Internet. The possibility of free e-mail exchanges with the sons 
and daughters in school might get some of the 'hard cases' motivated to 
use a computer for telecommunications.<P>
The <A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2503" tppabs="http://www.pbs.org/">Public Broadcast System</A> (PBS) had 
recently announced that they were 
going to move into public service areas other than broadcasting. New on-
line services would deliver distance learning for all ages, multi 
channel television, interactive computer communications, and facilitate 
educator interaction.<P>
This was going to be accomplished via a computer network based on VSAT 
technology.  I called the technical director of the PBS program, Dave 
Drucker, in my capacity as MIS consultant to WTJX-TV, the local PBS 
affiliate. Dave said that while the video and some store and forward 
data would be carried on VSAT, the full PBS experience could only be 
gained if the affiliate had a full time Internet Connection.<P>
A few months of investigation into the costs of doing this yielded some 
number like $ 50,000 per year, just for the phone bill and the mid level 
network provider (SURANET), and it did not include any capital equipment 
or operating expenses.  While V.I. Public Television could afford this 
as a start up cost, there was no way it could sustain paying out at that 
rate for services it would be giving away free.<P>
That was the beginning of the plan.<P>
A few weeks of work resulted in the plan to bring Internet to the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. We would follow the outline in my abstract, achieve the  
mission statement  (Section 5, above), provide for public access to the 
PBS enhanced services, and aim for self-financing of the project within 
two years.<P>
We would start a FreeNet, and provide free service to build a base of 
financial self-sufficiency!<P>
Once the service was running, there would be a public access computing 
with Internet connectivity, a network operations center (NOC), a network 
information center (NIC), and  a bridging and routing service for 
government and private sector. Sale of NOC and NIC, and connectivity  
services to the government agencies and the private sector would provide 
income to reduce the ongoing cost of operating the system.<P>
<EM>January, 1994</EM><P>
I proposed my plan to Calvin Bastian, General Manager of WTJX-TV in St. 
Thomas. I offered to enter into an agreement to finance 100 % of the  
project capital equipment requirements, and 50 % of the operating 
expense in exchange for 50% of any government Internet services revenue 
that we could recoup by providing bridging, routing, and transport.<P>
Our opening financial commitment to operating expenses would be targeted 
at one dollar ($ 1.00) for each person in the U.S. Virgin Islands, or 
approximately $ 100,000.00.<P>
The contractual model used for the partnership was the cooperative 
agreement, the same one that put MERIT, IBM, NSF, and MCI together to 
develop NSF-NET.<P>
The legal precedent already established, the VI Public Television Board 
Executive Committee agreed provisionally to go forward with the project.
<EM>March 1994</EM>
The NRAO brought Internet service for their own use to St. Croix, USVI. 
By arrangement, a piggyback feed went to the University of The Virgin 
Islands St. Croix Campus, where it was routed over a UVI leased 
microwave circuit to the St. Thomas Campus.<P>
I asked the NRAO and the University of the Virgin Islands for permission 
to run a 14.4K SLIP connection into their circuit until I could get new 
service for the V.I.P. FreeNet project. They agreed, on the condition 
that we would have our own service by March, 1995, when their (NRAO) 
contract for service expired.<P>
<EM>May 1994</EM><P>
This was getting to be too much to do alone. I asked two of my co-workers, 
<A HREF="mailto:spitzl@usvi.net">Steven Pitzl</A> and 
<A HREF="mailto:jcb@usvi.net">Jonathan Bartsch </A>if they would help me with 
the FreeNet project by donating a few thousand hours of their time. 
They agreed gladly, and came on board as systems programmer and systems 
administrator.<P>
The next step was contacting the great gurus of FreeNets,  Chet Ramey

the home of the Cleveland Free-Net, to request a copy of the FreePort 
software for 486/PC. Dennis explained that, since the software was not 
officially ported to the 486 platform, and there was no documentation, 
he would supply it but would rather load it himself.  By the way, they 
ask for a contribution of $ 850.00 for that. Oh yes, we needed a 
computer also. I had a spare 486 motherboard, some RAM, and a tower case 
I could donate, but no disk, O/S, or multi-port I/O.<P>
<EM>June 1994</EM>
A few quick calls to friends and local businessmen were in order.  
<A HREF="mailto:fmcl@caribcat.usvi.net">Frank McLaughlin </A> got tapped for 
$ 850.00 for 
the FreePort software, <A HREF="mailto:ab195@virgin.usvi.net"> 
Henry Wheatley </A> and <A HREF="mailto:rhanscom@vitelcom.usvi.net">
Richard Hanscom</A> bought the <A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2505" tppabs="http://www.bsdi.com/">BSDI O/S</A>,
and <A HREF="mailto:jackley@virgin.usvi.net">John Ackley</A>
provided us with a 16 port Boca Research I/O card. 
<A HREF="mailto:ab177@virgin.usvi.net">Parker Highsmith</A> supplied a 500 meg 
SCSI disk. Teen age apprentices <A HREF="mailto:ab161@virgin.usvi.net"> 
Jason Ackley</A> and <A HREF="mailto:ab095@virgin.usvi.net">Wesley Joyce</A> 
actually assembled the machine.  <P>
We sent Dennis Risen the 500 meg disk, and, after a few false starts, 
got the returned 
disk, with software loaded and (almost) running. A few hundred hours 
later we had it stabilized, and ready to demonstrate.<P>
<EM>September 9, 1994</EM><P>
We got a few volunteers together, physically moved the FreeNet machine 
and 8 terminals, and set it up in a local hotel for a seminar conducted 
under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce. Using a dial up SLIP  
connection we were able to demonstrate Internet access, sign up new 
members, and have everyone send President Clinton an e-mail to let him 
know the U.S. Virgin Islands had a public access computer system. The 
next day, we moved the machine, now named "virgin", to its permanent 
location in the office of Octagon Consultants, my consulting firm.<P>
Appeals to local business owners brought funds to install telephone 
lines and buy modems. The local business gets a promo on login, 
announcing who is sponsoring the dial-in port. Eight sponsorships at $ 
1,200.00 each take care of the modems, port costs, and local telco. By 
the way, a dialup business line is about US $ 65.00 per month here in 
the USVI. The first month of operation brought the FreeNet 162 new 
account applications.<P>

While there is no requirement for users to pay for access or service, 
the V.I.P. FreeNet does request a $ 25.00 annual membership fee from the 
users who can afford it.   Public access terminals are available in the 
lobby of WTJX-TV studios, and in the public libraries of St. Thomas and 
St. Croix.   A donation from a local bank, Banco Popular, of an outmoded 
data center yielded 48 dumb terminals, modems, and multiplexers being 
used for public access. Additional terminals are being placed in public 
and private schools, with the lease phone line paid for by PTA groups, 
Rotary Clubs, and other civic organizations.<P>
The V.I.P. FreeNet served as public access site for two U.S. national 
"Electronic Town Meetings", and will continue to participate in all such 
activities.<P>
No grants, federal, local, or other government funds have ever been 
received to support the FreeNet. It is 100% supported by user donations. 
and the private sector.<P>
V.I.P. FreeNet now has non-profit status, an active board of directors 
who meet almost weekly (in virtual meetings, of course), and has money 
in the bank and no debt of any kind.<P>
<EM>March, 1995</EM><P>
The V.I.P. FreeNet Internet access was cut over to the new USVI.NET  
domain. A router was graciously supplied by 
<A HREF="mailto:mansour@cisco.com">Nadia Mansour</A>, Latin America 
Regional Manager for <A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2506" tppabs="http://www.cisco.com/">CISCO Systems</A> 
allows the integration of our terrestial fiber 
connection from St. Thomas to the <A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2507" tppabs="http://www.sura.net/">SuraNet 
(BBN Planet)</A> co-located Miami POP via 
<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2508" tppabs="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>, with our VSAT Hughes 
Personal Earth Station Satellite link to 
<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs25.htm#2503" tppabs="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS</A><P>
With the V.I.P. FreeNet firmly established, a Web server project started 
in earnest. Virtual Tourism being what it is today, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands needed a presence on the Web. <P>
The funding model works like this:<P>
Industry associations such as hotel, charter yacht, bar and restaurant, 
etc. are asked to make an annual donation of at least $1,200.00 to the 
FreeNet. In exchange for this, the association receives a few web pages 
in the <A HREF="../../USVI/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/">Official U.S. Virgin Islands 
Tourist, Vacation, and Business Guide</A>. All members of 
those associations who 
have paid their dues get a short listing in the editorial pages of the 
Guide. The Tourism office and other private sector business then 
"sponsor" the Guide with advertising revenue. The revenue is used to 
defray costs of connectivity, operations, etc. First year revenue should 
be at least $ 50,000. The guide book provides for e-mail response to the 
associations, who then need an account on the system to receive and 
respond to the mail. Since this is a commercial activity, it cannot 
happen on the FreeNet. The cost of an account is U.S. $ 500.00 per month 
for such an association. The resultant $ 24,000 per year derived from 
this source further reduces the operating cost.<P>
A continuous supply of web 'hits' is assured by running contests and 
giveaways. Each month a one week vacation for two is given away on the 
net to visiting "virtual tourists". The vacations are provided by the 
hotel associations.<P>
<EM>April 1995</EM><P>
Critical mass! There are over 1,000 users on the FreeNet, out of 100,000 
total population of the U.S. Virgin Islands. They're e-mailing each 
other, their children in  college, participating in public forums and 
debates, accessing Internet resources, and generally having fun. The 
territory's civic organizations are using the Net to organize their 
activities and publish their calendars. The politicians used the FreeNet 
last November to solicit votes. One percent of the entire population and 
three percent of the workforce has FreeNet accounts. Everyone was 
wondering  why all the government agencies don't get e-mail and publish 
public information on the net.<P>
The new Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Dr. Roy L. Schneider, MD,  
in his 100 day of office address, published his address in real time on 
the V.I.P. FreeNet. At the exact time of the speech, the text version of 
the address became available on line. Eight dial-in modem users and a 
dozen or so Telnet session users were able to read along, or even jump 
ahead as Governor Schneider's speech unfolded.<P>
Governor Schneider is committed to instituting electronic 
communications, joining the information age, and has ordered  Internet 
service for his office and staff. 
<A HREF="mailto:vi001@virgin.usvi.net">Governor Schneider</A> maintains 
a FreeNet account.<P>
The government tourism office 
(<A HREF="mailto:info@usvi.net">info@usvi.net</A>) becomes the first cabinet 
level division to request Internet service. There are obvious reasons, 
the Virtual Tourist needs a response to their e-mail about visiting the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. This is just the beginning. That one account 
contributes another $ 12,000 per year to the cost sharing. Next comes 
the hosting fees for posting government information, databases, and 
public notices. Not only do these activities contribute to the cost-
sharing of the Internet hub,  they also reduce the cost of providing 
government services.<P>
The viability of the operation is now assured, and the operating costs 
are covered at minimum levels. It is now time to add capacity, increase 
bandwidth, and extend the reach of the system further into the 
Caribbean.<P>
The next strategic partnership will bring in an international 
telecommunications company in some type of joint venture to deliver full 
Caribbean outreach.<P>
Integral to the outreach program will be connectivity to the V.I.P. 
FreeNet from other Caribbean islands. A large percentage of the U.S. 
Virgin Islands population has roots in the other islands of the region. 
Again, e-mail will form the core interest building tool, followed by 
participation in  country specific and regional forums. The net can be 
used to stimulate intra regional and extra regional trade, deliver 
distance learning at affordable (free to some) prices, and increase the 
speed of consensus formation about new ideas.<P>
The only thing that remains to be seen is whether certain established 
telecommunications monopolies will allow this funding model to work in 
their protected territories. It is ultimately up to the citizens of 
those territories to create a ground swell of demand that cannot be 
ignored. Stay tuned.<P>
