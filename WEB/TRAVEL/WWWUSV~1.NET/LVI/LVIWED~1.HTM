island beach, using a fleet of sailboats landing on a private island, sunset
ceremony at a historic Great House, 90’ under the sea in a submarine, underwater
in scuba gear, in a seaplane to a lovely traditional wedding at a private
home or a resort hotel. If your imagination can conjure it, we'll make
it happen. <A HREF="WEDDIN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/lvi/weddings.des.html"><IMG SRC="WED.GIF" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/lvi/wed.gif" ALT="Wedding at Sea" HEIGHT=99 WIDTH=149 ALIGN=RIGHT></A><BR>
