<P>The Caribbean is known for its beautiful romantic backdrops - perfect
sites for a wedding. Customized weddings and Vow Renewals can be performed
at traditional venues - hotel, private home, etc. - or at unique locations
- aboard a submarine, in a helicopter, aboard a private yacht. We’re limited
only by our imagination.</P>

<P>We enjoy being creative so allow us to show our stuff. Whether just
the bride and groom or a full-blown affair with friends and family, we’ll
accommodate your budget. We can provide accommodations, air and ground
transportation and activities during your stay on-island to those nearby.
Credit cards can be used for deposit; balance is payable in cash or travelers
cheques.</P>

<P>We will mail you applications necessary to get a Virgin Islands marriage
license and certificate of marriage. For St. Croix weddings the fee is
$50 and checks should be made payable to the Territorial Court of the Virgin
Islands. On St. Thomas and St. John the court fee is included in the package.
There is an eight-day waiting period from the time the Court receives your
paperwork. No blood tests are necessary. On the day of your wedding - or
a day or two before - you simply have to swear in at the courthouse and
pick up the final paperwork. We will followup from the time you mail the
applications.</P>

<P>St. Croix Our Minister/Captain has performed weddings on and around
St. Croix for many years--at sea aboard his two 42’ catamarans as well
as on land under palm trees, beside sugar mills and on various beaches
. The St. Croix Nuptial Menu allows you to customize your event by selecting
only those features desired offering flexibility to tailor your wedding
to your dreams. </P>

<P>.Should you have any questions, feel free to call between 8am and 5pm
Atlantic/Caribbean time Monday thru Friday.</P>

<CENTER><P>We look forward to hearing from you.....
