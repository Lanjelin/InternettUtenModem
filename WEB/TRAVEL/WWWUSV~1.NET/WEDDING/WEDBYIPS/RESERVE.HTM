<h4><i> Making Your Reservations... </i></h4>

<h4>Once you have decided that a romantic Tropical Wedding is what you really want, and that <i>Weddings by IPS</i> are the people you can trust to handle the details of your special day, your next step will be to reserve a date and time for your Wedding.<p>

To book your Wedding date, we require a 50% deposit of the estimated full price of services. The balance will be due on the day of the Wedding. Your deposit is refundable, less a $75 service fee, up to 15 days before your Wedding date.<p>

You may reserve your Wedding date by e-mailing Patty at:
<a href="mailto:weddings@islands.vi">weddings@islands.vi</a> or by calling her at (800) 937-1346 or by remitting a check in US funds by mail to: 

<address>
Weddings by IPS <br>
9719 Estate Thomas<br>
Suite 1 <br>
St. Thomas, VI 00802<br>
</address>

<hr>

If you book your date by mail please remember to include a daytime phone number, and <i>do not</i> consider your date and time confirmed until we speak with you. The same goes for booking your cruise (if that’s how you’ll be visiting us). The reason is simple:
You will have to personally appear at the VI Territorial Court before your Ceremony, and here in the VI we enjoy many holidays (when court is closed) that you might be unfamiliar with. <p>

For your convenience we have listed the day and date of our <a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs28.htm#2893" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/wedding/wedbyips/holidays.htm">1996 holidays.</a> Keep in mind that court is closed on Sunday, and that if a holiday falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on the following Monday.
Any Questions? Ask Patty.</h4>
