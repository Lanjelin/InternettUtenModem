<h4><i>Ask Patty...</i><p>

Patty's organizational skill is one reason we have the best wedding program in the US Virgin Islands; she really can make lemonade out of your lemons. Her father, Teddy Kurpiewski is like that, too.  He can pack 5 pounds of laundry in a 3 pound sack.<p>

But natural planning ability is only part of Patty's secret, the other part is being prepared:  she knows the road to an enjoyable wedding is paved with questions answered before they are asked. Here are a few of her favorites–<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Will I have to promise to obey in the ceremony?</b><br><i>Not unless you want to.</i><p>

<li><b>How long before the wedding does my application have to be filed?</b><br> <i>The court requires 8 working days prior to issuing the license.  We find one to two months before the wedding is about right.</i><p>

<li><b>I've been divorced.  Do I have to prove it? </b><br><i>You bet!  The court requires a certified copy of your final divorce decree.  This is not a document you normally get at the time of your divorce.  Give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get it and what to do with it. </i><p>

<li><b>“I'd like to get the cake, but I'm watching my weight.”</b><br><i>Wedding cake has no calories.</i><p>

<li><b>I don't drink, but I'd like a toast to our future, what can I do?</b><br><i>We have sparkling cider in champagne-looking bottles that's cool, refreshing and non-alcoholic.</i><p>

<li><b>I have the loveliest picture hat I'd like to wear, will it be too windy at the beach?</b><br><i>Yup.</i><p>

<li><b>My groom wants to get married barefoot in his tuxedo, can he?</b><br><i>That's why you come to the islands, dear, there's nobody to say you're doing it wrong.</i><p>

<li><b>My bride wants to wear a bikini wedding/bathing outfit, how about it?</b><br> <i>She'll have to cover up when you go into the court, but otherwise, see above.</i><p>

<li><b>My sister made me a silk bouquet to carry, do I have to get flowers anyhow?</b> <br><i>No way.  Everything Weddings by IPS offers is á la carte,  the packages are only suggestions of popular combinations of services- you don't have to get flowers, cake or any extras you don't want.</i><p>

<li><b>Can I see Bermuda from Magen's Bay?</b><br><i> Maybe if you squint, it's 860 miles North of here.</i>
</ul>
