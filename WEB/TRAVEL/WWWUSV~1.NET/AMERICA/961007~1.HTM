<b>V.I. America's Cup Merchandise Hits Market<br>

St. Thomas, October 7th, 1996 -</b>
<p>
Taking advantage of its proximity to St. Thomas' Charlotte Amalie Harbor 
- the Caribbean's premier cruise ship port-of call
and tourist shopping mecca - the Virgin Islands America's Cup Challenge 
(VIACC) announces the late-October opening of its first retail
outlet for official Virgin Islands America's Cup Team merchandise.


<p>

According to Steve Morton, the V.I. Operations Manager charged with 
launching retail marketing efforts, the downtown Hibiscus Alley
outlet is ideally located to intersect shopper traffic entering from both 
Main Street (Dronnigens Gade) and the Charlotte Amalie Waterfront.


<p>

"Merchandising provides substantial source of income for most America's 
Cup campaigns and we're no exception," explains Morton, the 
Director of Marketing for Little Switzerland before joining the syndicate.


<p>

"Based in the heart of a popular tourist destination with 1.7 million 
visitors annually, the VIACC is well situated to maximize its unique 
advantage
in the U.S. Virgin Islands while it develops additional outlets abroad."
 <p>

The initial line of officially-licensed Virgin Islands America's Cup Team 
merchanise offers tee-shirts, jackets, caps, active wear, and pins, all
bearing the syndicate's trademarked insignia.
<p>

Occupying a prime spot in the downtown shopping district the Hibiscus 
Alley shop is a real estate holding controlled by Topa Equities (V.I.),
whose president William S. Anderson sits on the VIACC syndicate's board 
of directors.
