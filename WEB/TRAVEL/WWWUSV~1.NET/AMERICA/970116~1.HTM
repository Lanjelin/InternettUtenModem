<B>St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands</b> - 
Peter Holmberg, Executive Director of the Virgin Islands America's Cup 
Challenge (VIACC), today confirmed his Caribbean-based yacht racing 
syndicate's partnership with Don Chmiel of Atlanta, Georgia, who'll 
represent the Cup 2000 Challenger both nationally and internationally.

</p>
<p>
According to Holmberg, an Olympic medalist and world-class match racing 
helmsman, "Don's extensive knowledge in all areas of marketing -- 
planning, advertising, media, promotions, sponsorships, hospitality and 
public relations -- provides the kind of coordinated punch needed to 
deliver our America's Cup package directly to corporate decision-makers."
 
</p> <p> 
As Executive Vice President of International Services of Atlanta, Inc. 
(ISA) -- a world leader in sports event and facility management in the 
sports, entertainment, and convention/hospitality industries -- Chmiel is 
a seasoned marketing professional with over 30 years experience in the 
domestic and international area.
</p> <p>
During two decades with top Fortune 100 companies such as General Foods, 
Lever Brothers, and RJR Nabisco, Chmeil established a rapport with 
corporate insiders that is expected to reap sponsorship dollars to fuel 
the Virgin Islands syndicate's quest to wrest the 'Auld Mug' away from 
New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
For the past ten years, Chmeil has put his special events management 
skills to work for clients at a multitude of world-class events, 
including cycling, baseball, golf, professional football, tennis, 
equestrian, figure skating, Formula I racing, and the 1992 and 1996 
Olympic Games.
</p>
<p>
For the 1996 Olympic Games, the syndicate's newly-designated marketing 
guru secured and managed corporate consulting for six major domestic and 
international Olympic sponsors and managed the Olympic hospitality 
programs that included over 12,5000 corporate guests during the 18 
days of the Games.  During the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Chmiel 
chartered and secured government approval for a new cruise ship that 
served a major corporate hospitality venue.
</p> <p>
Coupled with a year-round sailing venue that's considered among the 
world's finest, the U.S. Virgin Islands' high-volume tourism and 
hospitality industries, provide a powerful package of incentives to 
sponsors seeking and international showcase.</p> <p>
