<B>St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands</b> - The dream of winning the America's Cup comes closer with each step.
Today, the Virgin Islands America's Cup team faces the challenge of
raising funds required to retain one of the worlds top racing yacht
designers and start the process to design the boats that will win
us the Cup.
</p>
<p>
Over $2 million has already been raised, from both individuals and
corporate sponsors.  To date, we are very pleased with the positive
response we have received, however the Virgin Islands America's Cup
needs another $2 million to progress to the next step of this campaign.
</p>
<p>
The three week tour of the Virgin Islands on the former Stars and
Stripes has now finished and exceeded our expectations.  The support
that we received during our travels has been immensely encouraging
and we are hoping this will continue through to the year 2000 in New
Zealand.
</p>
<p>
We most certainly would not have been able to progress this quickly in
our campaign without the support and generosity of individuals and
corporate sponsors alike.  We strongly believe that the Virgin Islands
Americas Cup Foundation will be the most successful method of encouraging
our youth to understand and enjoy these beautiful waters.
</p>
<p>
The Virgin Islands America's Cup Foundation is a non profit organization
with a 5013C tax deductible status.  This endeavor is a large undertaking,
but with commitment of people like yourselves, together, we will make this
happen.  You can be a part of this campaign by sending your donations to
The Virgin Islands America's Cup Foundation at 6501 Red Hook Plaza,
Suite 201, St. Thomas, VI 00802.  We can be contacted at phone (809)774-9090,
fax (809)777-5089 or on CompuServe 105401.3030.
