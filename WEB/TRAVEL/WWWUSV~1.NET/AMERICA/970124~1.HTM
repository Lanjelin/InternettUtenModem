<B>St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands</b> - 

Knight Quality Stations' Vice Chairman, Randolph 'Randy' H. Knight, today 
announced that the Knight Quality Stations -- owners of WVWI Radio One 
1000 AM and WWKS, KISS 101.3 FM - have joined the growing group of Major 
Local Sponsors to declare their support of the Virgin Islands America's 
Cup Challenge syndicate.

"The V.I. Challenge needs our help now to seal a contract with a top 
designer that can make us all a winner in New Zealand," says Knight, who 
has pledged $100,000 toward the project.  "Tomorrow may be too late."
 </p> <p> 

Contacted in Florida, where he's currently participating in Yachting Key 
West Race Week and promoting the V.I. Challenge to prospective stateside 
sponsors, syndicate vice-president Peter Holmberg cited Knight and his 
radio group or stepping forward.  "The clock is ticking.  If we want to 
compete at the highest level at the Cup 2000, we've got to have the 
backing of Virgin Islands Knight Quality Stations business leaders and 
community-minded individuals like Randy Knight."

</p> <p>

Broadcasting throughout the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico 
and down-island, WVWI Radio One AM 1000 and WWKS, KISS 101.3 FM are 
affiliated with Knight's group of eight New England-based stations that

WTMN-AM/WXHT-FM/WHEB-FM (Portsmouth, NH); and WEZF-FM (Burlington, VT and 
Montreal).

</p> <p>

WVWI Radio One AM 1000 on-air personality, Capt. 'Fatty' Goodlander, has 
covered the V.I. syndicate's development on the station's Saturday 
morning 'Marine Report' program since last summer.

</p> <p>
