<B>St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands</b> - 
Maurice Kurg, General Manger of Cellular One, today confirmed that Virgin 
Islands-based company's pledge of $100,000 as a Major Local Sponsor of 
the Virgin Islands America's Cup Challenge.
</p>
<p>
"The V.I. Challenge's mission is to unite all Virgin Islanders," says 
Kurg.  "in the spirit of 'friendly competition' that exemplifies the 
America's Cup, Cellular One has matched the sponsorship recently 
announced by competitor Vitel Cellular and is openly challenging other 
local and regional communications companies to climb aboard."

 </p> <p> 
The Caribbean leader among cellular companies providing coverage to 
mariners, particularly among bareboat charter operators, Cellular One has 
an established record of marine recreational event sponsorship that 
benefits a cross-section of the community from the St. Thomas Yacht 
Club-hosted International Optimist Regatta for junior sailors, Kids And 
the Sea (KATS) programs, and the Caribbean Women's Sailing Championship, 
to the American Yacht Harbor Billfish Tournament and the Governor's Cup 
Youth Regatta. Cellular One is also a supporter of Peter Holmberg's 
Virgin Islands Match Racing Team, which now represents the Territory's 
Cup syndicate on the world match race circuit.

</p> <p>

Led by veteran racers Chris Rosenberg and Maurice Kurg, who also serves 
on the V.I. Challenge's Board of Directors, Cellular One's yacht racing 
team will soon be defending its CORT (Caribbean Ocean Racing Triangle) 
Series Championship, captured in 1996 aboard the Melges 24 by the same name.
