Understanding and Selecting Pearl Jewelry
</h1>
</center>
</p>

     "The natural pearl is a sweet accident of nature," says Freddy Neumann, 
who explains to visitors just exactly how a pearl is formed.  A foreign 
object, such as a tiny piece of coral finds its way  between the shells and 
into the oyster itself.  The oyster cannot expel the coral so its body 
encapsulates it.  A pearlsack forms around it and excretes a substance called 
nacre.  Layer upon layer of nacre forms and this process is, in fact, the 
formation of the pearl.<p>

     "As a result, natural pearls are rarely completely round," says Neumann, 
"because the foreign object itself was not round."  Neumann also explains that 
the notion of diving for pearls and actually finding one is more romance than 
fact.<p>

     "Pearls are cultured now," the  Neumanns point out.  "They are cultivated 
primarily in Japan where a bead of Mother of Pearl, cut from the thick-walled 
Mississippi mussel is wedged into the oyster's body.  The oyster lives in the 
ocean until it is harvested after one to three years.  So you see, every 
Japanese cultured pearl has an American heart," Irmela likes to explain.<p>

     This one to three year period is a critical one, says Neumann, because it 
takes that amount of time for the layers of nacre to form.  Pearls that have 
fewer layers are not as strong and sturdy and have been harvested too soon -- 
possibly  at the sixth month period or before.  These pearls are often found 
in discount stores, says Freddy Neumann who emphasizes that when a deal on 
pearls is too good to be true, it probably is!<p>

     When selecting pearls Irmela Neumann recommends that the customer follow 
the same guidelines shat she herself employs when she travels to Japan to make 
her purchases.  "Pick by size, luster, cleanliness and roundness," she says as 
she displays a gorgeous necklace made of pearls that shines beautifully in the 
soft light of the studio.<p>

     To make the point, Freddy Neumann directs customers to the small crystal 
bowl of  jelly beans that grace each counter top.  "Look at these jelly 
beans," he says as he holds up a white one.  "Most people think that white 
pearls are better but that is not necessarily so.  They are often young and 
flat an have no luster," he says as he compares them to the lustrous, shining 
pearls that he holds in his hands.  "I am committed to quality so I  teach my 
customers as much as I can."<p>
