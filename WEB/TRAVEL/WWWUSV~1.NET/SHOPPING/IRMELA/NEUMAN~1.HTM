     "When I design and make jewelry, I think of myself as making "Fairy 
Castles," says Irmela Neumann who began her career as an internationally known 
jewelry designer in her home town of Pforzheim, Germany, a city near the Black 
Forest renowned for the skilled craftspersons who have designed and created 
quality jewelry for centuries.  "It is part of the tradition I learned," says 
Irmela who emphasizes that "I observe and listen to my clients and I craft 
jewelry for them that suites their personalities and life styles."<p>

     Using her grandfather's tool box, Irmela began her apprenticeship at 
fourteen years of age.  "I started working in brass, " Irmela remembers.  "I 
sawed and filed and filed and sawed for all of seven weeks.  I cut paper and 
bent wires each day and from the brass dust I was green up to my elbows!"<p>

     Irmela Neumann's perseverance paid off.  She created her first original 
piece of jewelry, a gold and pearl ring for her mother, and she has been 
designing and producing  unique and interesting pieces ever since.  "Handmade 
jewelry does not mean half-way," says Irmela, who loves working  in high 
quality colored gems an who recently created a tourmaline piece in greens, 
reds and pinks, set in 18 karat gold.  "And I always like to sprinkle a few 
fine diamonds in my pieces," she says.<p>
