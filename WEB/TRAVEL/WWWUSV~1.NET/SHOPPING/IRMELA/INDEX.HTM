Located in the beautifully restored Grand Hotel, Irmela's Jewel Studio is
surrounded by lush green parks and several historic landmarks which
complement the 25 year history of one of St. Thomas' premiere locations to
view, learn about and select rare and beautiful gems—from jade to pearls,
diamonds to rubies—fashioned into gorgeous rings, necklaces, bracelets and
earrings.  There are one-of-a-kind spectacular pieces, many of them
designed by <a href="NEUMAN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/shopping/irmela/neumann.html">Irmela Neumann</a> herself.  And, in
addition to their prowess in jewelry creation, the Neumanns are the
designers of the only Virgin Islands <a href="COIN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/shopping/irmela/coin.html">commemorative gold 
coin!</a><p> 

Once inside the studio, the visitor is graced with the charm of the old
and the beauty of the new.  Exposed stone work and the high, wooden-beamed
ceilings create an ambiance of days of old when pirates roamed the
Caribbean and The Grand Hotel extended its 150 years of hospitality to <a
href="INT~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/shopping/irmela/int.html"> international guests</a> and residents alike.<p>

At the center of the studio an unusual, double twisting spiral staircase 
creates an architecturally delightful focal point for the unique and unusual 
jewelry displayed around it.  Irmela calls it her "biggest piece of jewelry 
and the first one in wood!"<p>

Irmela and her husband Freddy are experts in the art of <a
href="PEARL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/shopping/irmela/pearl.html">understanding and selecting</a> pearl jewelry.<p>

<a href="PEARL2~2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/shopping/irmela/pearl2.html">Pearls, of all shapes and sizes</a> as well as gold,
silver, precious, and semi-precious gems in breathtaking settings, are 
Irmela's specialty.<p>

And when the purchase is made,  the Neumanns provide their customers with 
information on the <a href="CARE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/shopping/irmela/care.html">care of cultured pearls</a> so that this
beautiful jewelry is healthy and happy for years to come.<p>

The unique and the unusual is what visitors find when their Virgin 
Islands journey takes them to Irmela's  Jewelry offerings come from the world 
over and a visit to Irmela's can be as exciting and interesting as exploring a 
museum.<p>
Each member of Irmela's staff is trained to understand and explain the 
specifics of quality jewelry and Freddy and Irmela are meticulous in their 
training procedures.  "This is the first store I head for," says a satisfied 
customer in a letter to Irmela.  And a Director of a well-known cruise line 
compliments Irmela's as "the most knowledgeable" among all the jewelers in the 
Caribbean.<p>
"We love what we do and we love the Virgin Islands," say the Neumanns who 
share their pride in their work and in their home through the crafting of a 
special Virgin Islands Commemorative Gold Coin.  The coin, designed by Irmela, 
who used a surveyor's map and satellite photo of the Virgin Islands to create 
the three United States Virgin Islands  exactly to scale, is available in 
settings as a pendant, tietack, cufflinks, money clip or exquisite ring.  And 
soon Irmela's will feature a  unique wristwatch for men and women with the 
Virgin Islands gold coin on the dial.<p>
Commemorative Coin, precious pearls or any of Irmela's
 gorgeous creations 
they make the perfect gifts to complement the memory of a perfectly lovely time spent in St. Thomas—the Paradise of the Virgin Islands.<p>
