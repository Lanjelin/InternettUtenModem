<h1>
Care Of Pearls
</h1>
</center>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Remember that your cultured pearls are precious jewels so treat them with
care.

<li>Your pearls can become scratched on the hard edges of a jewelry box 
or on 
the surfaces of other metal jewelry, so always store them in a cloth bag or 
wrap them in tissue.

<li>Apply your make up, perfume and hair spray BEFORE you put on your 
pearls.  
These chemicals are not pearl-friendly and can cause a dull film to form on 
your pearls.

<li>Don't clean your pearls with chemicals or abrasives.  In fact it is a 
part 
of pearl folk lore that they should be washed in warm water.  Don't do it!  
Water can seep into the hole in the pearl and damage it.  

<li>Feel free to wipe your peals with a chamois cloth to restore luster.

<li>Instead of at-home treatments, bring your pearls to a jeweler once a 
year. 
She can clean them if necessary and restring them, preferably by adding a 
knot between each pearl to prevent loss if the string should break.
</ul>
