<h3 align=center>First Class Professional Production of Caribbean Plays</h3>
<p>The 1996-97 season at the Reichhold will be the third year for The
Reichhold Caribbean Repertory Company.  The only theater of its kind in the
world, The Repertory Company is dedicated to presenting professional 
productions of Caribbean plays.</p><p>
        In dedicating the center that opened in his name in 1978, Henry
Reichhold listed as one of its objectives:  "To develop professional
theater, dance and musical companies that will perform at the Center and
tour other areas in the West Indies."  The current Reichhold Director,
David Edgecombe, a well know Caribbean playwright,  is the first director
to bring that vision to fruition.  The inaugural production of the Rep
Company opened the 1994-95 season  with David Edgecombe's Coming Home to
Roost, which was held over.  The Company just ended its second season with
a three play Summer Festival Theater featuring the world premier of Caryl
Phillips' Hotel Cristobel, Trevor Rhone's classic Smile Orange (The Center
was proud to have Mr. Rhone come and direct the play), and Cecil "Blazer"
Williams' provocative I Don't want to Bathe.   The plays toured to St.
Croix and were performed there at the Island Center, a first for the Virgin
Islands.</p><p>
        Playwrights  are welcomed to submit plays to the RCA at the address
listed below. Trained professional actors, directors and designers are
recruited locally and abroad. If you're interested in learning more or
working with the Rep company please contact one of our <a href="STAFF.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/reichhold/staff.htm">staff</a>.
</p><p>
        The RCA hopes not just to provide good entertainment for
appreciative audiences, but meaningful work for theater artists and
technicians. Theater business is big business.  What starts as a stage play
can evolve into television and cinema, two areas in which the Caribbean is
not well represented.  In ten years' time, we could be enjoying the
benefits of a multi-million dollar industry.  Professional Caribbean
theater is an idea whose time has come!</p>
