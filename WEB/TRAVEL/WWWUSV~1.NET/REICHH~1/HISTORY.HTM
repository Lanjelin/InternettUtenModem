<h1 align=center>About the Reichhold Center</h1>
<p>The Reichhold Center for the Arts, University of the Virgin Islands
is located on St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, adjacent to beautiful John
Brewer's Bay.  The RCA was a gift from Mr. Henry Reichhold, an American
industrialist, who had a life-long interest in music and art.  Among other
philanthropic projects throughout the world, Mr. Reichhold built the Center
for St. Thomas  where he lived part of the year.  The center opened in 1978
and operations continue, in a large part, through the Reichhold
Foundation - a trust fund also donated by Henry Reichhold.</p>

<p>        The RCA both produces its own shows and presents artist from around
the world.  The Center's productions include STARfest, an annual Virgin
Islands talent extravaganza and The Reichhold Caribbean Repertory Company's
series of Caribbean plays. Performers presented by the Center include most
recently, Itzhak Perlman, Maya Angelou, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and in
years past Bill Cosby, Chuck Mangione and Ray Charles, among others. The
facility is also rented to outside organizations for their productions.</p>
<p>        A driveway from the beach leads through a landscaped area to the
Box Office and main facility, which houses administrative offices and the
theater.  Natural stone, boulders and beautiful vegetation make the center
a showplace.  The amphi-theater has 1196 seats, 356 upholstered seats
sheltered by a high-winged canopy roof and 840 outdoor seats.</p>
