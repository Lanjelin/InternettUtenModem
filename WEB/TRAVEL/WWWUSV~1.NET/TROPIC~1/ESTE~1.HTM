We are a specialty perfume shop and the oldest and most
 extensive on the island, " says <b>Mrs. Estelle Roth</b>, 
proprietor of
one of St. Thomas' most  respected and established businesses.
<b>Roth</b>, who has captained this family run and family begun
business for over twenty years, remembers the birth and early
years of Tropicana.<p>

     <b>Mrs. Roth</b> remembers, "My parents began this business in the
early fifties in a small shop in the Pissarro Building (yes, the
"Pissarro" as in the artist, Camille!).  My father responded to
the needs of US Navy seamen who were part of the Underwater
Demolition Team.  The sailors wanted perfume to take home to
their mothers and sweethearts.  My father went to Panama and
bought the best perfume he could find. Now, of course, we import
all of our products directly, but we continue to follow in my
parents' footsteps in that we buy only the very best today!"<p>

     And at Tropicana the fragrance affectionado will find the
very best perfumes the world has to offer.  The shop is large
and spacious, the aisles wide and uncluttered, an atmosphere
which invites the customer to sniff, spritz and try several of
the thousands of scents <b>Mrs. Roth</b> keeps on hand.<p>

     "We specialize in perfumes that department stores and
specialty stores don't always have on hand," says <b>Roth</b> who
maintains a treasure trove of classic fragrances
that customers have come to know and love.<p>

     "One day a young man, about thirty or so began browsing
through Tropicana," <b>Roth</b> remembers.  "He tipped his head back
and breathed deeply. 'That reminds me of what my mom wore when I
was a little boy,' he said with a smile.  An with his purchase
of that long ago fragrance, he revived a pleasant memory as
well!"<p>
