<p><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+2>You do</font><font SIZE=+1>, however,
need to be accompanied by a</font><b><i><tt> <font SIZE=+1>licensed and
insured dive instructor.</font></tt></i></b><font SIZE=+1> ..I specialize

</font><i><font SIZE=+2>love</font></i><font SIZE=+1>
to teach newcomers how-to-dive. I enjoy the look of discovery and the

(maybe because of television)  </font></font><b><font

</font></font></b><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+3>Diving is easy</font><font SIZE=+1>...ridiculously
easy...the only barriers to diving are the ones you erect yourself with
your own fears. I like to teach a </font><font SIZE=+3>Zen </font><font SIZE=+2>or
meditative approach</font><font SIZE=+3> </font><font SIZE=+1>to diving..concentrating
on the importance of </font><font SIZE=+2>breath</font><font SIZE=+1> and
teaching one to relax. </font></font>

<p><a name="zen"></a><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>In Yoga or Zen
meditation classes the student is taught the <i>OMM</i> sound. This spiritual
mantra sound is used as a focus for quieting ones inner mind and thoughts..but,
I believe the true significance of this sound is the fact that one is taught
to hold the note as long as he or she is able. In doing so they are forced
to </font><font SIZE=+2>exhale</font><font SIZE=+1> almost all their breath.
<b><i>All that bad, CO2 and often smoke filled air, is finally emptied
from the lungs allowing fresh, oxygenated air to be inhaled in its stead.</i></b>
Most people only use a small portion of their lung capacity for breathing...perhaps
as little as 40 or 50% fresh air is inhaled on top of 50 to 60% used, noxious
gases. This type of breathing is similar to panic breathing which is short
and shallow breaths. Of course </font></font><font SIZE=+1><b><font COLOR="#FF0000">panic</font></b><font COLOR="#000080">
is the real killer in diving just as it is in any many other sports. It
is important to <b><i>keep your cool and to think, breath and then act
in any tough or fearful situation.</i></b> </font></font></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>Panic breath means that one never
is able to take a complete breath because one never fully exhales their
prior breath. I use <b><i>laughter, singing and even primal scream techniques</i></b>
to force my students to exhale in conjunction with a shallow off shore
reef dive to bring all the best parts of diving to the first timer. </font></font></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1>On that first dive, depending on
ones individual abilities, I try to give the student a comprehensive idea
of the dive, the equipment, the signals, what to expect... but at the same
time each diver is led down individually so that all one has to do is
breath (and equalize.. explained in the pre-dive discussion) and I do the
rest. Still by having a thorough over-view each diver has the option of
absorbing as much information as they are capable. </font></font></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1><b><i>I stress breath techniques</i></b>,
and </font><b><i><font SIZE=+2>buoyancy control (weightlessness ..just
like the astronauts)</font></i></b><font SIZE=+1>.  Also maneuvering and body
control underwater...It is surprisingly easy!</font></font></p>

<p><font COLOR="#000080"><font SIZE=+1><b><i>Also any diving one does with
me counts towards eventually certification if they continue to dive with
me.</i></b>.and some instructors and dive agencies will credit your previous
dive experiences towards a open 1 cert. course. Supervised diving is very
safe! In a time when most insurance rates are skyrocketing the dive industries
rates are incredibly low because the <b><i>accident statistics today are
incredibly low.</i></b> In my dive area I have not had a single negative
incident or encounter with marine life.  </font></font></p>

<p><font COLOR="#800000"><font SIZE=+2><b><i><tt>The underwater world is
breathtakingly beautiful and combined with the freedom from gravity should
make anyone take the plunge.</tt></i></b> </font></font></p>
