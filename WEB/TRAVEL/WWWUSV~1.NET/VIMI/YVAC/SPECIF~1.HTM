<A NAME="relax"><h2>A yacht vacation is relaxing.....</h2></A>
Take off your watch.  Take a nap, read a book.  Day dream with the sun on 
your face and the tropical breeze tickling your skin.<img src="LAYOUT.GIF" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/vimi/yvac/layout.gif" align=right>
<P>
We have enclosed several color brochures for you to dream over.  The charter yachts that 
we at Yacht Vacations represent come in many different sizes and configurations.  After 
you have your group in mind, we will send you a customized package with only those 
yachts which meet your groups needs.  Here is an example of the layouts of our yachts.

<A NAME="exhilarate"><h2>A yacht vacation is exhilarating....</h2></A>
The thrill of sailing with the wheel in your hands and the wind in your sails.  
Each anchorage offers many an array of activities.  There is swimming, 
snorkeling, water-skiing and frolicking in the sun.
<P>
When you tell us more about your group, we can pick yachts and crews that will conform 
to your desires.  Do you want to SCUBA dive?  Are you hard core sailors or beach 
lovers?  What is your age range?  Is your group a family or longtime friends out for a 
good time?

<A NAME="adventure"><h2>A yacht vacation is adventurous.....</h2></A>
Take off on your wind surfer and race across the water.  Don your SCUBA 
gear and explore the underwater world of colorful fish and coral.  The 
Virgin Islands are world renown for their beautiful  and exotic diving.  Or 
maybe you want to jet ski or single-handedly take the laser out for an 
afternoon sail.
<P>

The "Toys" on each yacht will vary.  We will want to know which toys are a must for 
your group.  Some yachts specialize in diving charters, while some will do occasional 
diving.  All charters can rendezvous dive with dive companies.  We know the yachts 
which have water-skis, kayaks and wind surfers.  So you want to spinnaker fly, ask us!

<A NAME="peace"><h2>A yacht vacation is peaceful.....</h2></A>
Beach combing hand in hand on that long stretch of deserted white sand that 
you have only dreamed about before.  Or just watching the sunset, hoping to 
catch a glimpse of the Green Flash.
<P>
We represent yachts which we personally know.  The yachts are clean and well appointed.  
In most cases you will be accommodated in a double cabin with you own "head" and 
shower.  Dinning in the evening may be below in a teak salon or above under the starlit 
night.  The elegance that you will experience at dinner follow a day of casualness of 
bathing suits and meals served on deck.  

<A NAME="fatten"><h2>A Yacht vacation can be fattening.....</h2></A>
Oh, we hated to mention this one, but can you imagine, your own chef !  A 
chef, whose desire each day is to serve you four and five star meals.  Each 
meal trying to out do the one before.  All of them based on any dietary 
request and/or requirements that you have sent ahead.  Fortunately for all of 
us, the great food is balanced out by the many activities available each day.
<P>
The yachts that we at Yacht Vacations will send you have experienced crews on board.  
It will be our job to help you match up with a crew that will make sure your vacation 
includes every last detail to make it the best vacation you ever had.  All charter yachts 
have a captain, most all have a chef / mate on board.  Larger yachts may have more in 
crew, all the better to serve you.

<A NAME="educate"><h2>A yacht vacation is educational.....</h2></A>
Learn how to sail, snorkel, wind surf and even SCUBA dive.  Your crew 
will share their knowledge of the under water life:  the fish, the coral and 
even an occasional sunken wreck.  They will answer questions on the 
heritage of the different islands that you will sail by, from the days of the 
pirates to the people who live there now.  And yes, every captain has his 
own cache of sea stories, if you care to hear them.

<A NAME="howto"><h2>How to do it all...</h2></A>
<b>So how do you get on board?  </b><br>

</b><br>
We will be happy to spend the time that it will take to choose the 
best yacht and the best crew for you.  We have been active in the yacht charter 
business in the Virgin Islands, and in the world for that 
matter, for almost twenty years.  
<P>
If this is your first time to charter, we recommend the United States and British Virgin 
Islands.  Easily accessible from the Continental U.S. you will find the sailing protected 
among the hundreds of small cays and islands.  Anchorage's are numerous and the 
selection of yachts is greatest.  In the Virgin Islands your charter fee includes the yacht, 
your crew, all food and beverages and any toys on board the yacht.
<P>
Prices start at $150.00 a day per person.  This price is all inclusive in the Virgin 
Islands.  We, of course, can accommodate any more lavish desires that you and your 
group may have.  
<P>
<b>A yacht vacation, is it really for me?</b>
<P>
Who doesn't like tropical islands, crystal clear waters, palm-fringed 
beaches, sunny days and star-filled nights, trade wind breezes, gourmet 
cuisine, explicit service, surrounded by your family and friends and all on 
your own private yacht.
<P>
<b>We at Yacht Vacations guarantee that once you try it, you will be 
back !!!!!</b>
