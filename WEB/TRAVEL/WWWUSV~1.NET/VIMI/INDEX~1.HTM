<H3>A Yachting Paradise</H3>
<P>
The hundreds of islands and cays that make up the Virgin Islands
have an unspoiled beauty and accessibility unequaled anywhere on 
Earth. The safe, calm, crystal clear waters are caressed by the
gentle trade winds. The average year round water temperature 
is 80 degrees and varies only 5 degrees summer to winter.
<P>
Whether you sail your own bareboat or relax in the luxury of a
crewed term charter yacht, the magic of this tropical paradise
will live with you forever. 
<P>
Watersports of every possible type (hold the ice sailing!) are
available. Diving on some of the worlds most famous wrecks.
Fishing in waters where world record Blue Marlin are caught.
Windsurfing, parasailing, even submarine tours, are here for your
enjoyment. All under the constant Virgin Islands sunshine.
<P>
Our marinas and repair services are second to none. All boats,
engines and boat parts are tax free in the Virgin Islands (just
like the rum!).
<P>
For hundreds of years these islands have been a haven for free spirited 
seafarers. For the last twenty five years we have been
providing the very best services to those who are not fortunate
enough to live here but who, just for a week or so, share the
exhilaration of a life of total freedom. Freedom to wander at
will among the harbors and bays, and living reefs and pristine
beaches that hug our tropical shores. The freedom to escape into
a dream world. 
<P>
You can be totally isolated, anchored in a moonlit bay where your
only company is the dolphins and sea  turtles, or you can party
where the partying is legendary. The choice is yours.

<H3>VIMI Information</H3>
<P>
VIMI holds monthly luncheon meeting throughout the year where
members network and share fellowship. Guest speakers inform, 
educate and inspire us, and often learn a thing or two themselves.
<P>
As the voice of the marine industry, the VIMI executive director
and all-volunteer board of directors monitor legislative
activities and apprise government officials of industry positions
on various issues. VIMI is a marine information, referral and
lobbying resource for current members and prospective
businesses.
<P>
VIMI promotes camaraderie within the industry, by hosting
luncheons and social events. Our community work includes the
promotion of marine awareness to the community at large and
competitions that bring the wonders of boating to our youth.
The association promotes industry job development via its
involvement with the Marine & Aviation Vocational Training
Center and other youth job training and placement programs.
Marine industry accomplishments, current events and issues
are reflected in the twice-monthly VIMI News column of the
Virgin Islands Business Journal.
