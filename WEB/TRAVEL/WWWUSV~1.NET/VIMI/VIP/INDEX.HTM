<A NAME="overview"><h3>An Overview of our Services</h3></A>
Power yacht chartering is the ideal way to vacation in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, 
and Virgin Islands Power Yacht Charters (V.I.P.) can provide all that is needed for a fun-filled 
cruising vacation.  V.I.P. manages 20 yachts, and has the distinction of operating the largest 
luxury power yacht fleet in the world.  
<P>
Located in Saga Haven Marina, near the east end of St. Thomas, the V.I.P. fleet is composed 
of some of the top names in the boating industry --- Jefferson, Gulfstar, Hyatt, and HiStar.  
The yachts range from 32' all the way up to 53'.  <b>You can be your own captain</b> 
(bareboat) on a yacht of your choice.
<P>
All V.I.P. yachts feature large sundecks for taking advantage of the warm, tropical breezes and 
breathtaking sunsets that are the hallmark of the Virgin Islands.  One of the biggest advantages 
--- and perhaps the greatest luxury --- of chartering your own yacht is the fact that you can 
avoid crowds and schedules.  You go exactly where you want to go, when you want to go, choosing 
to anchor in any of the innumerable private bays and coves you wish.
<P>
Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of a charter vacation with V.I.P. Yacht Charters is that it 
doesn't have to cost you the proverbial "arm and a leg."  In fact, reserving your private 
floating, furnished condominium for a week costs about the same (per person) as a week on a 
luxury cruise ship.  But what a difference it makes when you have you own private yacht with 
queen-size bed, air conditioning, cellular phone, stereo, and blender, to name a few of the 
amenities at your disposal.
<P>
The power and maneuverability of V.I.P.'s luxury yachts let you enjoy all the famous 
sites in the Virgins during your charter.  This includes such world-famous attractions as the 
Baths at Virgin Gorda, where granite boulders form grottos filled with clear Caribbean water 
for breathtaking snorkeling experiences.  The caves of Robert Louis Stevenson's famed Treasure 
Island, Norman Island, where priceless pirate's booty has been discovered, beckon for 
exploration.  And the Wreck of the Rhone, a sunken 18th century galleon, is sure to intrigue 
the SCUBA enthusiast.
<P>
With all these options available, you may ask, "What is the most popular activity on a luxury 
charter?"  That distinction goes to a nap or a cool tropical drink while you just relax and 
absorb the beauty of the crystal-clear water, surrounded by the lush green mountains on the more 
than 100 islands and cays in the Virgins.
<P>
Other favorite activities available on a V.I.P. charter include SCUBA diving, snorkeling, and 
sportfishing.  But, the choice is all up to you.  After all, this is your vacation.
<P>
V.I.P. Yacht Charters extends a personal invitation to experience --- not just dream about --- 
cruising on your own luxury yacht in the beautiful waters of the Virgin Islands.  You can do 
what you want, when you want, and it's all available at a surprisingly 
affordable price.
