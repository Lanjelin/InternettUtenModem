There are many distinguished tropical resorts on ecologically
pristine St. Croix---but there is only one <b>Colony Cove</b>. No other
beach resort in the Caribbean offers such modern accommodations
nestled so delightfully within such a natural, harmonious island
environment. <p>

<b>Colony Cove</b> is truly special. It has two living reefs just off
its long, balmy, palm-fronded swimming beach. Its tranquil
tropical herb garden is well-known throughout the Caribbean. Sun-drenched nature 
walks are just a few short footsteps away. Bird, and bikini watching are 
all easily accomplished within its shady, floral-scented compound. <p>

Of course, the main accent is on pure, unadulterated tropical
relaxation---and nothing relaxes a world-weary traveler as
quickly as Mother Nature. <p>

Pick out a beach chair. Rest awhile. Close your tired eyes. Feel
the sun; feel it melt away your tensions. Smell the tangy salt
air. Listen to the seagulls laugh. Feel the heat of the fabled
tropics; its lush richness and romantic calypso rhythms. <p>

But just beneath the tranquil surface of this remarkable resort
is a deeper, more serious side: eco-tours, dive adventures, and
sailing excursions. <p>

No other Caribbean resort features such a diverse eco-library
which includes books, tapes, and videos---or regularly hosts
entertaining lectures and educational slide shows by local marine
biologists and divers such as Jeffery Miller of the Department of
Planning and Natural Resources. "Take nothing but pictures, leave
nothing but bubbles," is the unofficial motto of the resort <p>

And it practices what it preaches. <p>

Yet, despite its heart-felt natural focus, <b>Colony Cove</b> also
offers all the comforts and conveniences of home---full kitchen,
micro-wave, washer & dryers, Cable TV, VCR, and HBO. <p>

And at unbelievably low prices: four people can split a two
bedroom condo for a week for just over $800! A couple can rent
a unit for a week for as low as $675 to $750 (plus taxes). (Off-season, repeat 
guests; other restrictions may apply) <p>

<b>Colony Cove</b>. All the magic of the Caribbean, all the comforts of
home. <p>

     Business Conferences

<b>Colony Cove</b> can easily accommodate large groups. Call for rates.
Our conference rooms can seat 35 people, and we have televisions,
VCRs, flip charts, fax machines, slide projectors, overhead
projectors, professional secretarial services, etc., available
upon demand. <p>

All of the above rates are person person, double occupancy. <p>
