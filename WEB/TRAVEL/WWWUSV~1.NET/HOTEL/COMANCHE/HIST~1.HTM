Wayne, Maureen O'Hara and Laurence Olivier made regular visits.
Robert 'Oppie' Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, spent long
periods of time here.<p>

In 1948, the hotel could accommodate 15 persons. It has now
gradually expanded to 75 guests in 42 rooms.<p>

Down through the years it has accommodated numerous other famous
guests; you never know who is hiding behind those large sunglasses
at the Comanche.<p>

The hotel is named after the 72 foot yawl Comanche. This massive
wooden vessel was built in 1902 in Quincy, Massachusetts. It was
sailed to Croix via Bermuda fifty years ago by Ted Dale (the great
great grandson of John Paul Jones) who owned <b>Club Comanche</b> between
1948 and 1990.)<p>

<b>Club Comanche</b> is currently owned and operated by Richard and Mary
Boehm.<p>
