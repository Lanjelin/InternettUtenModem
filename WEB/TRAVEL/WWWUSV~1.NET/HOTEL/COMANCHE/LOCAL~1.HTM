It
is a short, scenic stroll from the hotel to many of the finest
restaurants on the island. Ferries, beaches, the visitor's center,
the Old Custom's House, the market, the Steeple Building,
Government House, and Fort Christiansvaern (1749) are all within
easy walking distance.<p>

Judith's Fancy, Frederiksted, the Estate Mount Washington
Plantation, The Whim Plantation Great House, Victoria House, and
the Botanical Gardens are all within a short drive from the Hotel.
Golf? Horseback riding? Duty-free shopping? Art galleries?
Museums? Crafts? Historical, cultural, and ecological tours? "No
problem, mon!"<p>

No other hotel on the island of St. Croix combines such
convenience and accessibility with such peace and quiet as the
Club Comanche.<p>
