Club Comanche Centrally Located
</h1>
<h2>
The <b>Club Comanche</b> is centrally located in the town of
Christiansted  which is itself centrally located on the island of
St. Croix. 
</h2>
<font size=+1>
It is a short walk from the hotel to 12 of the finest
restaurants on the island. It is only moments away from a ferry
which will bring you to one of the finest beaches on the island
or you can bypass the ferry and swim to the beach if you prefer.
The famous 'Buck Island' excursion sailboats practically leave
from the hotel's dock.<p>

Golf? Horseback riding? Duty-free shopping? Historical, cultural,
and ecological tours? "No problem, mon!"<p>

The visitor's center, Old Custom's House, the Market Place, the
Steeple Building, Government House, and Fort Christiansvaern
(1749) are all within a few moments leisurely stroll of the hotel.<p>

<b>Club Comanche</b>: a perfect combination of convenience and
accessibility with peace and quiet.<p>
