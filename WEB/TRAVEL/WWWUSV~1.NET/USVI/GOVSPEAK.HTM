<p>On behalf of the people of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas, I want to
extend our heartfelt hospitality to you in what is a most exciting time
for us.</p>
<p>As you visit our three islands, you will see evidence of great progress -
expansions to our airport on St. Croix, new shops and restaurants and
tourist friendly police on many street corners. We are eager to share our
excitement about these numerous improvements and additions to our
beautiful islands.</p>
<p>But some things will never change. The natural beauty of our sugar-sand
beaches and crystal-blue waters, the many activities that can be
experienced on land and in the water, and the unique culture found in our
food, music and welcoming people will always be here for your
enjoyment.</p>
<ul>
Sincerely,<br>



Roy L. Schneider, M.D.<br>
Governor, United States Virgin Islands<p>
