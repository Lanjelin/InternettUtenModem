In the spring of 1989, after more than 15 years working in Idaho as a
nuclear engineer, we sold our home and moved to North Carolina.  It
was here we began the seemingly endless project of rebuilding our 40
foot steel cutter.  Ryan was only five at the time and having sailed
<B>Northern Cross</B> up from south Florida the previous summer, was
excited to be embarking on a new adventure.  Our six month project
suddenly stretched to a year, then two, then interspersed with periods
of temporary employment, grew to six!  After numerous threats by
friends to cut our dock lines we departed Cape Lookout on the 20th
of June 1995.  We proceeded to cross the Gulf Stream and after an
eight day, light air, passage we made landfall on the beautiful island of
Bermuda.  Here we found warm friendly people and our first taste of
emerald green water. <STRONG>We were sailing at last!</STRONG>
<P>
Four days later we were again at sea headed south.  The ocean was a
beautiful experience.  It is hard to describe the feeling of being 500
miles from the nearest land in crystal clear blue water, two miles deep. 
The sky, clouds, and seas create a fascinating scene that changes constantly. While on night watch, each of us found our own star to steer
by.  After another eleven days of light sailing conditions we made
landfall on St. John, USVI.  Sleep never felt so good.  The next day
we continued to Charlotte Amalia, St. Thomas where we were
welcomed by friends who had followed our daily progress via amateur
radio.

Many times we are asked "Were the years you gave up to take on this
crazy lifestyle worth it?"  Although we have occasionally asked
ourselves the same thing, the pluses still seem to win over the minuses. 
We would like to share a few thoughts concerning this alternative to
the normal nine to five workday existence.

<H3>Why Travel by Boat? <A HREF="#TOP"><FONT SIZE=-1>(BACK TO TOP OF PAGE)</FONT></A></H3>
<A HREF="ALASKA1L.JPG" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/chuck/alaska1l.jpg">"Home" in Alaska <I>(jpg 40k)</I><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="ALASKA1S.JPG" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/chuck/alaska1s.jpg"></A>
<BR>
We have always enjoyed traveling as a family, usually by car, airplane,
even an occasional train or bus.  But we were always glad to get home
no matter how much fun we had.  We have found that somehow,
traveling in your own boat is different.  On a previous three month
cruise to Alaska we found that we <STRONG>were <I>always</I> home.</STRONG> 
The fact that you are not living out of a suitcase, are always sleeping in
your own bed, and can escape your surroundings into a familiar
space, increase your enjoyment of travel immensely.  And nothing can
compare to the excitement and anticipation of coming into a strange
port by water.
<P>

<A NAME="FAMILY"></A>
<H3>Family Togetherness <A HREF="#TOP"><FONT SIZE=-1>(BACK TO TOP OF PAGE)</FONT></A></H3>
We acknowledge that what I am about to say does not apply to
everyone.  But what better way to spend every day than with your
wife and growing son.  Learning, working, exploring, laughing, and
crying together are experiences that are beyond value.  The years we
are given to be with our children go by much too fast.  And the cruising
experiences as a family have profound effects.  Anyone who has met a cruising
child cannot help but notice something pleasantly different.  There is
an air of confidence, reliability, inquisitiveness, and courtesy that begs
to be admired.

How does one provide for quality education while cruising?  There are
a number of approaches to home schooling while living aboard.  Many
cruisers prefer to use one of the excellent correspondence schools that
are available.  We have been home schooling Ryan for the past seven
years, first using the Calverts Correspondence School and
eventually designing our own curriculum based on help from a North
Carolina school district.  Next year as Ryan enters his first year of
high school we will go back to an accredited correspondence school. 
We make extensive use of a computer and CD-ROM on board. 
Yearly national testing has shown Ryan to be well ahead of his grade. 
We also take every opportunity to involve him in local school events.

<BR>
The lack of daily interactions with peers is always a drawback to
be reckoned with.  We make concessions to allow Ryan to be with
cruising kids whenever possible.  This seems to be a feast or famine
situation. However, whenever cruising kids do get together the common bond of the sea seems to make friendships form rapidly.

When was the last time you spent an afternoon in a laundromat
surrounded by people of a totally different culture?  When was the last
time you were surrounded by people who didn't speak your language
but communicated with a smile?  When was the last time you went
more than a few days without hearing a news update on radio or TV? 
These are normal daily occurrences for cruising couples.  For children,
they are experiences that open an awareness that American life in the
suburbs is not the way most people in the world live their lives.  This
type of education cannot be duplicated.

<A NAME="WISH"></A>
<H3>Wish We Could! <A HREF="#TOP"><FONT SIZE=-1>(BACK TO TOP OF PAGE)</FONT></A></H3>
How many times have we heard from friends and acquaintances back
home "Sure wish we could afford to do that!"  Our reaction to that
statement has occasionally hit a raw nerve.  Just ask us how many new
cars (or even new "old" cars) we drove during the years we were
saving for this adventure?  Ask us how often we dined in fancy restaurants during those years?  Ask us how many large screen TV's or cable channels or golf memberships we had?  Instead we had a dream!  The fact is most people cruising are not wealthy. <B>They just live to a different set of priorities.</B>

<A NAME="ADVICE"></A>
<H3>Advice for Those Trying to Make the Plunge <A HREF="#TOP"><FONT SIZE=-1>(BACK TO TOP OF PAGE)</FONT></A></H3>
 <B>Still interested??</B>  Thinking back, here is a list of things we feel
were important in helping us prepare for our "break away".
<UL>
<LI>Bareboat charters are an excellent way to gain experience in
larger boats and begin to develop a profile of the "proper
cruising boat" for you.
<P>
<LI>If you are not a home handyman (or handywomen) start learning
now!  <I>Self sufficiency</I> is the key to successful cruising.  Enroll in an
adult education Diesel Engine Repair or Electricity 101 class.  Learn
to fix everything!!
<P>
<LI>Join a local amateur radio club and get your amateur radio
license.  We don't know of a single skill that has benefited us more. 
From phone patches to our family while in mid Atlantic, to daily
contact with fellow cruising friends from Venezuela to Maine, to up-to-date local island and weather information, the list goes on and on.
<P>
<LI>Read all you can on boats, cruising areas, seamanship, anchoring,
navigation, weather.  Again the list goes on and on.
<P>
<LI>Set a date and go. And find friends who will threaten to cut your
lines and <B>GIVE THEM A SHARP KNIFE!</B>
