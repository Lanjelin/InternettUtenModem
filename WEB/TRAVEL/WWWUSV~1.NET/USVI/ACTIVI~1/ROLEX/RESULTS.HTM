Tom Hill's Nelson/Marek 46 Titan of Puerto Rico won the 1996 23rd
annual Rolex Cup Regatta.<p>
     This three day, three race international sailing event, sponsored by
the St. Thomas Yacht Club, attracted 98 vessels from 13 countries.<p>
     Weather conditions were nearly perfect, with light to moderate winds
gradually becoming brisk. Sea conditions were light to moderate.<p>
     The first two races were held to the south of St. Thomas, in open
water. These were the Ocean Triangle courses (Course Bravo), and offered
no 'home court' advantage to our local sailors. Easter Sunday's race was
the Ocean World course(Course Charlie), which took place in the Pillsbury
Sound area. Wind shifts, wind shadows, and strong ocean currents became
major factors in this race.<p>
     Why did Tom Hill win the Rolex Cup again? "We did very well the first
two days, despite being over the line early in the first race. We had a
great crew, and our boat is sailing as fast as ever. She's fairly
competitive in all wind and sea conditions.  Despite a sixth place finish
in the final race, we managed to pull it off."<p>
     Tom Hill, who has attended every Rolex Regatta since its inception,
is one of the most consistent race winners in the Caribbean. He has
previously won the Rolex Cup in 1988, 1990, and 1995. (Only one other man,
Dick Johnson of the STYC, has won it as many times.)<p>
     "We're real pleased with the boat," said Hill of Titan, "We've made
no major changes to the boat since we took delivery of it a couple of
years ago. Nelson/Marek gives you a hell of a racing machine right out of
the box, and all we're doing is sailing it as well as we can. I chalk up
our successes to the crew work you just couldn't get a better bunch of
guys..."<p>
     There seems little question that Tom Hill and his crew are becoming
the dominate 'team' in yacht racing throughout the Caribbean. Peter
Holmberg (STYC) may be the fastest sailor in our area, but Hill has the
team, boat, and equipment which wins the most regattas.<p>
     In second place (spinnaker racing fleet), it was Carlos Falcone
(Antigua) on a Melges 24 named Cheeta (formerly Enerserve). Although his
performance was a little off in light airs as soon as the breeze built on
the final day, he led the entire pack.<p>
     In third place it was Tony Amador's J-105 Break Away from Puerto
Rico.<p>
     Peter Holmberg (STYC) sailed a B-28 named Sterling Job. He finished
fourth.<p>
     There were no major mishaps. A number of boats suffered minor gear
and sail damage. The Kiwi 35 Wild Thing (BVI) dismasted in the heavy airs
of the final day.<p>
     There were the average number of (rule) protests for such a large
fleet of boats. The most newsworthy was between Donnybrook (US) and
Morgana (Italy). Both vessels were approaching a race mark, with
Donnybrook on port tack. Donnybrook tacked (or was tacking), and a
collision resulted during (or soon after).  Donnybrook was then protested
by Morgana, and Donnybrook DSQed (disqualified).<p>
     Donnybrook then declined to participate in the following two races.
Since she failed to complete a single race during the Heineken Regatta in
Sint Maarten, she has now failed to complete six out of the last six races
she has entered which surely must be some kind of a new Caribbean record. 
     The J/24 fleet was highly competitive. Eric Tulla (PR) aboard Son of
Syndicate pulled it off. John Foster won his class on the J/27 Magnificent
7.<p>
     The Cruising/Racing (spinnaker) class was won by Stanley Lopez (PR)
aboard his Pearson Flyer Sassy Lady.<p>
     In the big boat fleet, it was Morgana (Italy) clinching the top spot,
with Peregrine (US) having the Best Elapsed Time. Titan won Best Visiting
Yacht in addition to the Rolex Cup.<p>
     Rudy Thompson on the Beneteau Dazzler (STYC) won the cruising
(non-spinnaker) fleet, while Paul Scarano's Maniac of St. John won the
Swan class. Neil Newhart's lovely old yawl Herondelle won the Jib and Main
class. The beach cat class was topped by H. Martinez (PR) of Lost Boys. 
Bill Beer won the J2 beach cat class.<p>
