<a name="one"><h2>Business Opportunities in the USVI[1]</h2></a>


The USVI is a great place to establish a business!  In addition to a full
range of businesses to serve and supply the local population,
opportunities also exist to service the tourist trade in such areas as
retail stores and gift shops, hotels, restaurants, and attractions such 
as dive operations and the like.  Better yet, if you establish a qualifying 
business and hire local employees, your business can be eligible for 
generous government tax incentives<a href=#two>[2]</a> which will eliminate 
almost all income taxes<a href=#five>[5]</a>,and local taxes<a 
href=#six>[6]</a> for ten years or more.
<a href=#toc>Table of contents</a><p>

<a name="two"><h2>Virgin Islands Industrial Development Program 
Investment Incentives[2]</h2></a>


The USVI Industrial Development Program provides exemptions from nearly
all local taxes<a href=#six>[6]</a> and a 90% income tax<a 
href=#five>[5]</a> exemption.  In order to
qualify, a business must invest $50,000 or more in a USVI business and
employ ten persons.  Initial tax benefits are granted by the USVI
Industrial Development Commission<a href=#thirteen>[13]</a> for either 
ten or fifteen years and
may be renewed for five year periods.  The Industrial Development Program
is typically used by hotels, light manufacturing enterprises, and service
businesses. Benefits are usually not granted for businesses which
primarily serve the local market.  USVI resident shareholders of companies
which have benefits are also entitled to 90% income tax exemptions.<p>

Manufacturers which plan to import products into the United States can
combine the benefits of the Industrial Development Program with those of a
federal law (called the "Headnote 3A" program) to eliminate U.S. customs
duties if there is a sufficient amount of value added to the product in the
USVI. <a href=#toc>Table of contents</a><p>

<a name="three"><h2>Establishing a USVI Corporation or Qualifying a 
Foreign Corporation[3]</h2></a>



Any three individuals may incorporate a USVI corporation by executing
(before a notary public) and filing articles of incorporation with the
office of the Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands.  The corporation
is formed as soon as the articles are filed and the filing fee is paid. 
The incorporators or the directors adopt by-laws to govern the
corporation's affairs.  The method of incorporation is the same whether a
company is being formed as a domestic corporation, an exempt company<a 
href=#seven>[7]</a>, or a foreign sales corporation<a href=#eight>[8]</a>.<p>

The stock of a USVI corporation must be registered and there is a $1,000
minimum capital requirement.  Stock may or may not have a par value.  The
"standard" corporation has 1,000 shares without par value.<p> A USVI
corporation must have three directors (all of whom must be individuals)
who manage its affairs.  It is also required to have at least three
officers:  a president (who must be a director), a secretary, and a
treasurer.  Other officers are allowed as well.  A corporation must appoint 
a local resident agent for service of process.<p>

Corporations organized outside the USVI may qualify to do business in the
USVI by filing a copy of their articles of incorporation (or equivalent
document), appointing a resident agent, providing some financial
information, and paying a fee.<p> Domestic corporations, and foreign
corporations authorized to do business in the U.S. Virgin Islands, are
subject to an annual franchise tax and must file an annual report by June
30 of each year.  The franchise tax is a minimum of $150 per year.
<a href=#toc>Table of contents</a><p>

<a name="four"><h2>Moving an Existing Corporation to the USVI[4]</h2></a>

The USVI permits both the inbound and outbound redomiciliation of
companies and it is the only jurisdiction under the U.S. flag to allow for
both of these options.  An inbound redomiciliation is when a company
formed outside the USVI wants to move to the USVI and be treated as if it
had been formed there.  When the company moves into the USVI it can also
elect to be treated as an exempt company<a href=#seven>[7]</a> if it 
otherwise qualifies.<p>

An outbound redomiciliation, by which a USVI corporation moves its
domicile to another jurisdiction, is allowed, provided that the laws of
the jurisdiction to which the company wishes to move permits it.  The
company must first prepare and file whatever documents are required by the 
other jurisdiction; then an affidavit is filed with the USVI as evidence 
that the company has continued its existence elsewhere.  Then the government 
issues a certificate of discontinuance.  A corporation which has removed its
domicile from the USVI is not liable for future franchise or other taxes
but it does not avoid liabilities incurred prior to its
redomiciliation. <a href=#toc>Table of contents</a><p>

<a name="five"><h2>USVI Income Taxes[5]</h2></a>



Generally, instead of filing returns and paying taxes to the IRS,
residents of the USVI, and corporations<a href=#three>[3]</a> formed in the 
USVI, 
file returns and pay income taxes directly the Virgin Islands Bureau of
Internal Revenue<a href=#thirteen>[13]</a>.  The taxes are at the same rates 
and use the same
forms and rules as the federal income tax under what is called the "mirror
system" of taxation.<p> The mirror system applies differently to
corporations than to individuals.  One of the differences is that in
addition to the regular corporate tax rate, corporations are also subject
to a 10% corporate tax surcharge which brings the maximum corporate
graduated rate to 38.5%.  There are no local income taxes or surcharges
imposed on individuals over and above the mirror system rates so that the
overall rate of income tax for individuals is equivalent to the rate that
a resident of a state without a state income tax would pay.<p>

One of the results of the mirror system is that a corporation incorporated
in the United States, along with a corporation incorporated elsewhere
outside of the USVI, is considered foreign for USVI tax purposes.<p> U.S.
citizens and permanent residents with income from the USVI, but who are
not resident there, pay the same total amount of tax as they would if all
their income were from U.S. sources, but the tax is apportioned between
the United States and the USVI. This is done on IRS form 8689.  These
individuals file their form 1040 returns, along with the form 8689, with
the IRS and they file a copy with the Virgin Islands Bureau of Internal
Revenue<a href=#thirteen>[13]</a>. <a href=#toc>Table of contents</a><p>

<a name="six"><h2>Other USVI Taxes[6]</h2></a>

There are no sales taxes in the USVI.  There are several other taxes that
do apply, however, including the following:<br> 
<ul> 
<li>Real Property Taxes 
<li>Gross Receipts Taxes 
<li>Excise Taxes and Customs Duties 
</ul>
While all of the taxes described here generally apply to USVI businesses,
there are exemptions from all of them for exempt companies
<a href=#seven>[7]</a> and foreign
sales corporations<a href=#eight>[8]</a>.  In addition, beneficiaries of the 
Industrial
Development Program<a href=#two>[2]</a> are exempt from all of these taxes 
except for customs duties, where a special one percent rate applies.<p>

<h3>Real Property Taxes.</h3> 

USVI real property is subject to an annual tax at a rate of 1.25% of 
assessed value.  Assessed value is defined by statute to
be 60% of actual value.<p> 

<h3>Gross Receipts Taxes.</h3> 
The USVI imposes
a tax of 4% on the gross receipts of USVI businesses.  Businesses with
annual gross receipts of less than $150,000 are exempt from tax on their
first $5,000 per month of gross receipts.<p> 

<h3>Excise Taxes and Customs Duties</h3> Articles imported into the U.S. 
Virgin Islands for use or resale in a trade or business are subject to an
excise tax.  Because the USVI is outside the U.S. customs zone, foreign
(non-U.S.) made goods are also subject to a customs duty which is separate
from the U.S. customs duty. The rate of excise tax on most goods is 4%,
while the rate on certain products, such as cigarettes, is higher. 
Alcoholic beverages are subject to a flat rate based on volume.  Certain
other goods are subject to a lower rate of excise tax, and most tourist
items, such as jewelry, watches, crystal, artwork, electronic goods, and
leather goods, are exempt entirely.  Tourist items are also exempt from
the 6% U.S. Virgin Islands customs duty. <a href=#toc>Table of 
contents</a><p>

<a name="seven"><h2>Tax Free Entities in the USVI - USVI Exempt 
Companies[7]</h2></a>

There are three types of entities that can be established in the USVI
which are either fully or partially exempt from USVI taxes and U.S.
federal income taxes.  One type of entity is a USVI corporation which
obtains the benefits of the Virgin Islands Industrial Development
Program<a href=#two>[2]</a> for its business activities in the USVI.  These 
companies are
fully exempt from most local taxes and receive a 90% exemption from USVI
income taxes.  They also enjoy a special customs duty rate of one percent. 
These companies are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on 
their USVI operations.<p>

Another tax free entity is a USVI foreign sales corporation<a 
href=#eight>[8]</a> (FSC) which
pays no local taxes except for a nominal annual fee.  Thousands of USVI
FSCs have been set up by U.S. exporters as a means to reduce U.S. federal
income taxes on their export sales by about 15%.<p>

For foreign persons, even more generous exemptions are available through
the use of the third type of tax-free entity:  a USVI exempt company.  The
USVI is the only jurisdiction in the world where a non-U.S. person can
establish a tax-free entity under the U.S. flag.  USVI exempt companies
are often used as holding companies for portfolio investments, for the
ownership of aircraft<a href=#eleven>[11]</a> that are registered with the 
U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration, or as captive insurance companies<a 
href=#ten>[10]</a>.  There are
a number of other offshore tax planning<a href=#nine>[9]</a> structures that 
can take advantage of USVI exempt companies.<p>


Except in the case of certain captive insurance companies, U.S. and USVI
citizens, residents, and companies are prohibited from owning, directly or
indirectly, ten percent or more of the stock of a USVI exempt company. 
With respect to income from all sources except those in the United States
or the USVI, an exempt company is entirely free of all U.S. and USVI
income taxes.  Furthermore, except for a nominal annual franchise fee
($1,000), an exempt company is free from all local taxes as well.  These
tax benefits are guaranteed for 20 years by contract with the USVI
government.  The identity of the owner of a USVI exempt companies is not
public information but it is subject to disclosure to the Virgin Islands
Bureau of Internal Revenue<a href=#thirteen>[13]</a> or the IRS upon proper 
request. <a href=#toc>Table of contents</a><p>

<a name="eight"><h2>U.S. Export Incentives Using USVI Foreign Sales 
Corporations [8]</h2></a>


The U.S. Internal Revenue Code authorizes the establishment of foreign
sales corporations (FSCs) in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  FSCs are
established by U.S. exporters in order to reduce their income tax on
profits from export sales by approximately 15%.<p> Since the FSC program
was established by Congress in 1984, more FSCs have been established in
the U.S. Virgin Islands than in any other jurisdiction in the world.  They
have come to take advantage of the professional infrastructure and the
excellent communications and transportation links between the USVI and the
U.S. mainland, as well as for the tax benefits.  Local benefits for FSCs
include complete exemption from all local taxes<a href=#six>[6]</a> and 
Virgin Islands
income taxes<a href=#five>[5]</a>, except for a nominal annual franchise tax 
and license
fee.  Benefits are guaranteed by a contract with the government for up to
thirty years.<p> FSCs are usually established with the assistance of a
licensed USVI FSC management company, many of which have offices in the
United States mainland as well.<p> A regular FSC (one with export sales in
excess of $5 million annually) is required to hold its annual meetings in
the U.S. Virgin Islands, although this can be handled by a management
company if desired.  A small FSC (one with export sales of $5 million or 
less annually) does not have to hold such meetings.<p>

Small FSCs must pay a flat annual franchise tax to the USVI government of
either $400 or $900 depending on the volume of sales.  The annual
franchise tax for regular FSCs starts at $1,000. <a href=#toc>Table of 
contents</a><p>

<a name="nine"><h2>Offshore Tax Planning[9]</h2></a>

As a result of the generous tax exemptions available to foreign sales
corporations<a href=#eight>[8]</a> and USVI exempt companies<a 
href=#seven>[7]</a>, the USVI has become an
offshore tax planning center.  While foreign sales corporations are 
formed
for the specific and limited purpose of saving taxes on export profits, 
USVI exempt companies are formed for numerous different purposes.<p>


A USVI exempt company ought to be utilized rather than an offshore entity
formed in another jurisdiction in any situation where U.S. flag protection
is either desirable or essential to the purposes of the company.<p> 

For
example, USVI exempt companies benefit from coverage under U.S. bi-lateral
investment treaties and treaties of friendship commerce and navigation and
are therefore ideal for persons who seek political stability and the
protection of U.S. laws and treaties.  Holding assets through a USVI
exempt company covered by such treaties helps protect them from
expropriation by an unfriendly government.<p> 

Another use for a USVI
exempt company is where there is a desire to have access to United States
courts for dispute resolution.  By incorporating an exempt company in the
USVI, the United States courts located in the Virgin Islands would
generally have jurisdiction over disputes involving the company
notwithstanding the fact that its business activities take place
elsewhere.<p> 

USVI exempt companies are also useful as financing entities
for foreign persons who are required by banks to keep accounts in U.S
dollars in order to borrow money.  This would be particularly appropriate
if the country where the investment is to be made requires local entities
to keep accounts in local currencies.<p> The USVI redomiciliation
<a href=#four>[4]</a>
statute can be used to move a tax-free company from another jurisdiction
into the USVI.<p> USVI exempt companies can also be used by foreign
persons who wish to register their aircraft<a href=#eleven>[11]</a> with the 
Federal Aviation
Administration or to establish captive insurance companies<a 
href=#ten>[10]</a>. <a href=#toc>Table of contents</a><p>

<a name="ten"><h2>Captive Insurance in the USVI[10]</h2></a>

The USVI permits the establishment of insurance companies which are exempt
from most local regulation so long as coverages do not involve USVI risks. 
The exempt insurers statute permits the licensing of "International
Insurance Companies" also known as captive insurers.  An International
Insurance Company may also qualify as a USVI exempt company and thus be
eligible for exemption from income and other local taxes.  Unlike other
types of exempt companies, an International Insurance Company may be owned
by U.S. persons and still be eligible for these benefits so long as its
income is effectively connected to a USVI trade or business.<p> The USVI
is unique among offshore insurance domiciles in that it is considered a
state for the purposes of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 ("ERISA").  As a result, it is possible to establish a captive
insurance company, or branch, in the U.S. Virgin Islands which may write
employee health and retirement plan coverage in the United States. 
Captives established in foreign jurisdictions are not allowed to write
this type of coverage in the United States. <a href=#toc>Table of 
contents</a><p>

<a name="eleven"><h2>FAA Aircraft Registration by Foreign Owners Using 
USVI Exempt Companies[11]</h2></a>

A USVI exempt company<a href=#seven>[7]</a> may be used by foreign 
persons to own an aircraft
registered with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.  In order to
meet the FAA requirements, the stock of the exempt company must be owned
by a voting trustee who is a U.S. citizen.  Using a USVI exempt company
for this purpose is preferable to using a Delaware company (which is the
traditional corporate vehicle) because, unlike a Delaware company, a USVI
exempt company is free of federal income taxes. <a href=#toc>Table of 
contents</a><p>

<a name="twelve"><h2>Obtaining U.S. Citizenship in the USVI While 
Avoiding U.S. Estate and Gift Taxes[12]</h2></a>

In many cases the U.S. federal estate and gift tax apply in the USVI to
U.S. citizens and permanent residents domiciled there at death or at the
time of the gift.  There is an important exception, however:  the federal
estate tax does not apply to property located outside the United States
which would otherwise be part of the estate of an individual who acquired
his or her U.S. citizenship as a result of birth or naturalization in the
U.S. Virgin Islands or another U.S. possession, so long as the individual
resides in the USVI at the date of death.  There is a similar exception
for the gift tax.  For persons considering becoming naturalized U.S.
citizens, this provides an attractive planning opportunity.<p> Property
located in the USVI, or stock of a USVI corporation (including a USVI
exempt company<a href=#seven>[7]</a>) is not considered U.S.-situs property 
under the 
U.S. federal estate tax.  Therefore it is not included in the estate of a
non-resident alien of the United States. <a href=#toc>Table of
