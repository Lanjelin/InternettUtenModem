To see the island, 33 square miles in size, you can rent a car or take a
guided tour. One part of the trip takes you up and up circling and winding
hills. Drake's Seat is where Sir Francis used to sit and count his ships.<p>
Just below Drake's Seat is <a href="../PIX/MAGNBCH.JPG" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/pix/magnbch.jpg">

Magens Bay Beach, USVI<i><font size=-1>(jpg 28k)</font></i></a>, <br>

said by National Geographic Magazine to be one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.<br> <p>
Another part of the island looks very much like the countryside of France,
with cattle grazing in green fields. And west of downtown there even is a
place called Frenchtown. <p>

Whether you stop atop a mountain or along the shore, be sure to sample one
of our tropical drinks made with <b>Virgin Islands rum.</b><p>
In St. Thomas there are fine hotels, restaurants with an international
cuisine, the largest charteryacht fleet in the Caribbean, and a variety of
other things to do away from the beach. Again, ask at the Visitors' Bureau
for suggestions.

We'll start by touching upon the many ways you can see the island.  <p>

<ul>
<li><b>By air.</b>
It might sound extravagant -- but it's a memorable way to see mountainous
St. Thomas and St. John -- and the British Virgins, too. There's room for
five in a twin engine plane that takes you up for 40 minutes. Also, there
is the helicopter service that can drop you off at one of our many
deserted islands for a romantic picnic. The charters are reasonable; your
hotel will have specifics.  <p>
<li><b>By car.</b>
You can rent a car from one of many companies -- you must have a driver's
license, but no local permit is required.  We we drive on the left, a
custom which lingers from the days of Danish rule.<p>
<li><b>Safari bus.</b>
Your hotel can arrange the trip for you -- a 1-1/2 hour excursion at a
nominal cost.  <p>
<li><b>Taxi.</b>
Your hotel can arrange this, too and it's a very comfortable way to see
everything. The drivers are well informed; they'll suggest an itinerary,
and even a stop for lunch. Follow their advice.<p>
<li><b>Walking.</b>
Since so much of the island goes uphill, be ready for some exercise on
your sightseeing trip, and wear comfortable shoes. For the real
enthusiast, be advised that the "99 Steps" are really more than that!<p>
</ul>
