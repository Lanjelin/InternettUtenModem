<h1><i>A Whirlwind Tour of St. Croix</i></h1>
<h2>Touring the island is quite an adventure, since it's 82 square 
miles.</h2>
<font size=+1>
Rental cars are available. You can also rent a taxi/tour car and have the
guide show you the island. The cost varies; it depends on the number of
hours. Your guide will know where to take you, what to see, and where to
have lunch (which is extra) outside of town.<p>
Through your hotel you can arrange for a twilight sail or a cocktail
cruise or a Buck Island cookout and much more. Sightseeing tours
can also be arranged through your hotel. Ask for literature to find the
range of programs offered.<i><b> <font size=-1> All photos provided

<ul><li><b>Estate St. George Botanical Garden</b>

Consisting of lush woods and rich land, the Garden covers 16 acres
and contains ruins of a 19th-century sugarcane village and rum factory
including workers' homes, manager's house, a bake oven, stone dam, a
blacksmith's shop and foundations of a watermill. A small admission fee is
charged.
<br clear=all>
<p>
<li><b>Buck Island Reef</b><br>
	Here is the only United States National Monument (we call it a "National
Park") that is underwater. The Park itself covers over 850 acres including
the island proper, with a sandy beach, picnic tables and barbecue pits.
The reef has two major underwater trails -- Turtle Bay Trail and East End
Trail. Numerous boats operate off the dock in Christiansted; your hotel
has specifics.<p>

<li><b>Cramer Park</b><br>

<a href="CAROLLEE/00CL00.JPG" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/carollee/00cl00.jpg">

alt="Cramer Park">36k</a><br>

A very nice place to relax the day away during the weekdays. The Park has a 
beautiful beach and picnic area.  On weekends the park is transformed 
into a outdoor bar atmosphere with DJ's and music.<p> 
<br clear=all>

<li><b>Cruzan Rum Distillery</b><br>

<a href="CAROLLEE/03CL14.JPG" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/carollee/03cl14.jpg">
<img hspace=15 align=left src="CAROLLEE/03CL14_S.JPG" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/carollee/03cl14_s.jpg" width=150 height=85
alt="Cruzan Rum Distillery">34k</a><br>

Out on West Airport Road you can visit the distillery and see them making
Virgin Islands rum. The tour includes a walk through the plant by long,
flat sections of kegs, up ramps past the distilling, through fumes as
intoxicating as the rum itself, to bottling and labeling. Check at your
hotel for visiting hours.<p>
<li><b>Eastern End of the Island</b><br>
You've gone as far as you can go in the United States on the easternmost
point of St. Croix, Point Udall. The spot is barren, but beautiful. Bring
your camera.<p>
<li><b>"Eye to the Sky"</b><br>
Less than a mile from Point Udall, the National Science Foundation has
funded the installation of a giant $5-million-dollar antenna -- 82 feet in
diameter. This 260-ton dish will be used to explore the unknown universe.
Visit the site, where guides will explain that the antenna is identical to
nine others around the U.S. Together, the ten make up a single radio
telescope, sharing their data over the internet.<p>

<li><b>Rain Forest</b>

alt="Rainforest"></a>
As you head towards Frederiksted, you'll come upon Creque Dam Road and the
15 acres of the Rain Forest. The dam itself is 150 feet high. You will
also go along Mahogany Road, which is lined with beautiful mahogany trees,
yellow cedar, and Tibet trees (also called "mother's tongue" because of
the pods that rustle in the wind). The air is filled with the scent of
many of our island fruits, and also the call of mountain doves. The Forest
is private property; the owners have graciously consented to let visitors
tour.<p>

<li><b>St. Croix Leap</b>

alt="Cramer Park">22k</a><br>

Also in the Rain Forest, you will find a group of talented woodcarvers.
You can order wood sculptures and chairs and tables all made from local
mahogany and have them shipped to your home.

Here's where Columbus first arrived in the Virgin Islands in November 1493

called this island Santa Cruz.

showplaces. Small admission fee.<p>

craft.<p>

<h3><b>In Frederiksted</b></h3>

Here's where many cruiseships dock, approaching the palm-fringed town from
the open sea. Frederiksted is known for its continuous shoreline.<p>
<strong><b>What to see</b></strong>

<ul><li><b>Fort Frederik</b>
<a href="CAROLLEE/FTFRED.JPG" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/carollee/ftfred.jpg">43k<br>
<img hspace=10 align=left src="CAROLLEE/FTFRED.GIF" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/carollee/ftfred.gif" width=150 height=100 
alt="Fort Frederik"></a>
The first foreign salute to the U.S. flag was given at Fort Frederik in
1776. At the Fort on July 3, 1848, Governor General Peter Von Scholten
emancipated the slaves in the Danish West Indies. The Fort has been
restored in brick red and white, to the way it looked in 1840; the Fort
actually dates back to the 18th century. The restoration includes the
courtyard, the stables, the old soldiers canteen where tobacco and beer
were purchased, and the old garrison, is an art exhibit area. Open daily
Monday through Friday.<p>
<li>In the middle of Prince Street, you'll find the <b>Old Danish School.</b> 
It was designed by the well-known Danish architect Hingleberg in the
1830s.<p>
<li>At the corner of Prince and Market Streets is <b>St. Patrick's Roman
Catholic Church,</b> built of coral stone in 1842. Other churches include
<b>Lutheran,</b> the <b>Moravian</b> and <b>St. Paul's Episcopal Church</b>
-- all historical buildings.<p>
<li>Just one block across on the corner of <b>Market Street</b> is history that 
still lives today. It is the <b>Market</b> that has been here since the 
earliest days of Frederiksted in 1751.
