<h2>USVI Hotels Will Not Penalize 
Travelers Affected if Airline Strikes</h2>

<b>ST. THOMAS, U.S.V.I., FEBRUARY 13, 1997</b> - The U.S. Virgin Islands
Department of Tourism and hoteliers on St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas 
are preparing for a possible strike by American Airlines’
pilots.  Island hoteliers announced today that, in the event that
American Airlines’ pilots go on strike, U.S. Virgin Islands hotels will
waive or credit all customary deposits or penalties for “no shows” as a
result of an American Airlines strike.  <p>
	While there is still hope that the threatened strike will not occur,
the general points of the provisional plan announced by the U.S. Virgin
Islands hoteliers are as follows:<br>

• Commencing with the first day of the strike and ending upon final
settlement of the strike negotiations, island hotels with 51 rooms or
more will grant full refunds to their incoming guests who are unable to
use their American Airlines tickets.<p> 
 
• Hotels with room capacities of less than 50 will credit their
strike-affected guests for future stays provided that contact is made
with the property on or before scheduled arrival date.<p>
 
• Strike-affected guests will need to contact their reserved
accommodations one day prior to their intended arrival date, while the
possible strike is in effect in order to receive a refund or credit.<p>
 
• Individual properties’ policies may differ slightly from this general
description.  Travelers are advised to contact their intended
accommodations, particularly if on the island of St. Croix, for specific
details.<p>


	Tourism Commissioner Wylie Whisonant has maintained contact with the
U.S. Virgin Islands’ many hotel industry leaders and government
officials to discuss the potential American Airlines’ strike and its
possible effects on the local economy which relies heavily on tourism.  
<p>
						
	The hoteliers are protecting their guests in this manner to prevent
potential visitors from needlessly canceling hotel reservations in the
U.S.V.I. for fear of losing their deposits.  “If American Airlines does
not experience a strike, vacationers will still be able to keep their
initial vacation plans,” said Whisonant.  “If the airline pilots do
strike, travelers will not experience a financial loss as a result of
having to cancel hotel reservations.”<p>
	American Airlines is the major carrier into the U.S. Virgin Islands and
the loss of American’s flights will have a negative effect on the
islands’ tourism industry.  However, other major carriers such as Delta
Airlines and USAir also have daily direct flights into this American
territory.  Tourism officials have committed to exploring alternative
travel options if needed.  Some of these options include charter flights
into the islands during a strike period, or increasing the number of
other airlines’ flights into the U.S.V.I<p>.
