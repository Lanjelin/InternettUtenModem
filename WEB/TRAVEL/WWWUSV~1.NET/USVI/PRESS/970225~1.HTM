<b>U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, MARCH 1997</b> - Every spring and summer, some of the
world’s most talented athletes descend on the U.S. Virgin Islands to

<a href="../STX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/stx.html">St. Croix</a>, 
<a href="../STJ~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/stj.html">St.

become a sports-lover’s paradise hosting everything
from an international triathlon to an LPGA <a 
href="../../GOLF/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/golf/">golf</a> 
tournament to a national windsurfing championship.<p>
	Tournament season moves into high gear Easter weekend when St. Thomas
hosts the 24th Annual International <a 
href="../ACTIVI~1/ROLEX/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/activities/rolex/">Rolex Cup Regatta</a>.  
Yachtsmen 
from around the globe, including <a href="../../AMERICA/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/america/">V.I. 
America’s Cup Challenge</a> leader <a 
href="../../AMERICA/INDEX.HTM#holmberg" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/america/#holmberg">Peter
Holmberg</a>, will compete for the coveted Rolex Cup in the waters off of
Cowpet Bay.  The Rolex Cup is just one of several regattas that draws
sailors to the USVI every year.  St. Thomas' sailing season continues
with the Caribbean International Optimist Regatta June 12 - 15.  St.
Croix welcomes the  Memorial Day Regatta May 24 - 26, and the Warren
Young Memorial Race June 29.<p>
	St. Croix is not only known as the home of Wake Forest basketball star,
Tim Duncan, but also for some of the best golf courses in the world. 
The greens of St. Croix’s <a 
href="../../GOLF/HTML/ST_CRO~1.HTM#carambola" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/golf/html/st._croix.html#carambola">Carambola 
Golf Course</a>, designed by Rober Trent
Jones, will host the LPGA’s most talented golfers April 9 - 12.  Last
year’s co-champion Sally Little will be among the players competing in
the winner-takes-all 4th Annual Konica USVI Golf Classic.  The three-day
event is scheduled to be the first tournament of the inaugural LPGA
Medalist Tour. <p>
	St. Croix once again becomes the center of attention May 4, when the
island welcomes the 8th Annual St. Croix International Triathlon.  Five
hundred athletes from 32 countries are expected to compete for this
year’s $50,000 prize purse.  The competition requires triathletes to
swim two kilometers (1.2 miles), bike 55 kilometers (34.1 miles) and run
12 kilometers (7.4 miles).<p>
	St. Thomas’ summer tradewinds and warm waters offer ideal conditions
for windsurfers competing for the title of National Champion July 14 -
19.  <a href="../../HOTEL/SAPPHIRE/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/hotel/sapphire/">Sapphire Beach Resort and

U.S. Windsurfing National Championships, held for the first time outside
of the continental U.S.  More than 200 professional and amateur athletes
are expected to compete in four levels of competition during the
five-day event.<p>
 	<a href="../ACTIVI~1/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/activities">Sportfishing</a> enthusiasts 
should polish their rods and reels before
arriving on St. Thomas this summer.  The American Yacht Harbor Billfish
Tournament July 17-20, will draw fishermen from around the Caribbean and
the U.S. mainland to St. Thomas for the first competition of the
sportfishing season.  Anglers won’t want to miss the annual V.I.
Atlantic Open Blue Marlin Tournament which celebrates its 25th
anniversary August 14 - 19.<p>
	Swimmers would also appreciate the adventure and satisfaction of
completing the 5.5 mile swim from Buck Island through the colorful reefs
and sandy bottoms of St. Croix's surrounding waters on November 3.  Also
on St. Croix, the Annual Atlantic Tele-Network VI Tennis Championships
on July 24-27, is also sure to be a crowd-pleaser for tennis fans, as
the competitors battle it out for a chance at this year's title.<p>
	Whether in the heat of competition or watching from the sidelines,
athletes and their fans will find plenty in the USVI to challenge their
spirit of competition this season.  With a different international,
national or local tournament held almost every week, the USVI is the
place sports lovers will want to be this spring and summer.<p>
