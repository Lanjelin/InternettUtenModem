St. Croix To Attract Top International Athletes
For May Triathlon
</h3>
ST. CROIX, U.S.V.I., FEBRUARY 24, 1997 - The United States Virgin
Islands is gearing up for its 8th Annual St. Croix International
Triathlon to be held on May 4.  More than 500 top athletes from 32
countries will converge on St. Croix for a day of intense competition as
they test their skills and endurance in hopes of capturing this year's
$50,000 prize purse.<p>
	This year's theme, "Beauty and the Beast," describes the agonizing
triumph experienced by triathletes as they compete in this race.  While
enjoying the scenic beauty of St. Croix, they will be confronted with
some of the most challenging obstacles, such as the world-renowned climb
known as "The Beast," that will stretch their abilities and stamina to
the maximum.  Participating athletes will cover three challenging
courses including a 2 kilometer (1.24 mile) swim, 55 kilometers (34.1
miles) of biking and a 12 kilometer (7.4 mile) run.<p>
	Triathletes will swim from the beach at Protestant Cay, located in the
middle of Christiansted Harbor, through the Caribbean's clear blue
waters to the dock at Fort Christiansvaern.  The bike course will take
triathletes over hills and through dikes with gorgeous views of coral
bays and old castles to overcome crowd-pleasing favorites such as "The
Hot Corner" and "The Beast."  Finally, the race will culminate in a 12K
run on St. Croix's country roads and through the well-kept grounds of
the Buccaneer Hotel down to King Street, where an enthusiastic crowd
will applaud the triathletes' triumph with a hardy Crucian welcome.<p>
	The St. Croix International Triathlon is one of the most prestigious
events of the sport.  Last year, the event attracted more than 20,000
spectators who lined the streets of St. Croix to cheer and encourage
triathletes to persevere.  This year's event will be televised
worldwide.<p>
	Other events preceding the main competition include the Paradise 5K Run
on April 27; a welcome party on May 1; and the Crucian Picnic & Carbo
Feast and Jump-Up Street Festival on May 2.<p>
