<h1 align=CENTER>The World of Walji's Adventure Pakistan</h1>

<p>Travelling in Pakistan can be the ultimate adventure. Due to the
lack of publicity and insufficient "advertising gloss," one sees 
very few tourists here. A a result, Pakistan is a beautiful, 
unspoiled destination, and the people still welcome strangers 
according to old tribal custom: Greet all who pass by your door 
with an invitation to come in and share the day's meal. 
Furthermore, Pakistan's geographical diversity allows for a wide 
range of trips to be planned; from overland touring to China on 
the route of Marco Polo, to floating down the Indus river in 
boats reminiscent of Alexander the Great's navy; from trekking to 
the base camp of K-2, the second highest mountain on earth, to 
riding on camel back along the old desert trade routes used first 
by the Moghuls and then by the East India Company.</p>

<p><i>Walji's Adventure Pakistan</i> <b>guaranteed departure trips</b> are
designed to allow one to sample a small range of this diversity, 
Generally, it is better to plan trips to northern Pakistan in the 
summer months (mid-May to mid-September) and to the southern half 
of the country in the winter. Some trips may be combined so that 
in the spring and autumn, both halves of the country may be 
covered. Descriptions of the various regions are provided at the 
beginning of each section.</p>

<IMG SRC="FRONT.GIF" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/pakistan/front.gif" ALIGN=right WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=201 Alt="Photo"><p>We are pleased to offer some special tours; the
Kalash Valleys in Chitral, visiting the lost tribes of non-
believers featured in <i>The Man Who Would Be King</i>; 'Shandur 
Polo', a spectacular tournament featuring players from 
Afghanistan, China and Pakistan batting it out on the highest 
polo field in the world; a Yak safari in Hunza, riding on Yak 
back on trials that retrace the routes of the local tribes' 
summer pastures; the Sibi Horse, Cattle and Camel Festival, a 
wonderful exhibition of the best animals of Baluchistan in a 
typical nomadic bazaar; and many more. Of course, our tried and 
tested classic treks and tours are also featured, with many new
departure dates to fill the demand.</p>

<p>Should, however, one want a more personalised itinerary for
family and friends, we would be happy to tailor-make an adventure 
according to one's exact specifications.</p>

<IMG SRC="OFFICE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/pakistan/office.gif" ALIGN=left WIDTH=262 HEIGHT=170 ALT="Photo of Office"><p><i>Walji's Adventure Pakistan</i> selects and trains only the best
adventure guides, mostly from the Hunza and Nanga Parbat regions. 
Unlike all other adventure operators in Pakistan, we do not hire 
seasonal nor part-time staff. Our crews, consisting of trekking 
guide, cook and assistant cook, are full-time staff who work 
exclusively for <i>Walji's Adventure Pakistan,</i> and are trained
exhaustively in order for them to provide the best of services to
clients. Our present strength of 75 staff allows us to
effectively service all customer requests.</p>

<A NAME="level"><p><i>Walji's Adventure Pakistan</i> trips are marked according to <B>level of
difficulty</B>, Some trips may seem to be more strenuous than marked 
(see note below); however, our indicated levels of difficulty are 
based on the following criteria:</p>
<UL>
<LI><b>Level A:</b> Day hikes, riding on a camel yak or pony or in a
jeep, bus or boat, 6-7 hours a day; ability to tolerate extreme 
temperatures (up to 45 degrees centigrade in the mountains); and 
high altitudes (up to 5000 meters).

<LI><b>Level B:</b> 6-7 hours moderate hiking per day, gradual
altitude gains, with a maximum altitude of 4000 meters attained; 
however, some passes or side trips or day excursions may reach 
4500 meters.

<LI><b>Level C:</b> 5-6 hours strenuous hiking per day, sharp
altitude gains, with a maximum altitude of 4750 meters attained; 
however, some passes or side trips or day excursions may reach 
5000 meters.

<li><b>Level D:</b> 6-7 hours strenuous hiking per day, sharp
altitude gains, with a maximum altitude of 5200 meters attained; 
however, some passes, side trips, day excursions or summit climbs 
may reach 6000 meters. Elementary knowledge of the use of ice axe 
and crampons is recommended.
</UL>

<p><b>Note:</b> The above hours per day are averages; some days may
be as short as three hours due to altitude gain or temperatures, 
while other days may be as long as 10 hours due to mountain 
passes being negotiated. <b>Nonetheless, bear in mind that no two
people are the same, and some may not be able to negotiate trails 
as swiftly and surely as others, resulting in differences in the 
hours walked.</b></p>

<p><i>Walji's Adventure Pakistan</i> treks are managed in the field by a
qualified trekking guide from the Hunza or Nanga Parbat regions.
These trekking guides are all licensed by the Government of Pakistan,
are conversant in English and have worked with our organisation for a
minimum of five years. Additionally, they are given specialised training
every year, so that they may fine-tune their skills.</p>

<p>Typically, the trek day starts at the break of dawn, with warm
washing water in a bowl supplied to each person, along with a cup 
of hot tea or coffee. Half-an-hour later, a breakfast of 
chappatis (unleavened baked bread) with jam and marmalade, 
cornflakes or porridge, and tea or coffee is served. Where 
possible, fresh eggs are provided. While breakfast is being 
prepared and consumed, the tents are folded, and duffel bags and 
other loads distributed to porters.</p>

<p>On almost all treks in Pakistan, porters carry the camp
equipment, food and one's personal duffel bag (the weight of the 
duffel should not exceed 12.5 kilograms). One is expected to 
carry only a day pack containing items for the day's walk: water 
bottle, jacket and camera. The pace is unhurried, so that each 
trekker can establish a rhythm uniquely one's own, and which 
allows one to take in the breath-taking scenery. Our trekking 
guide and the chief porter (porter sardar) ensure that members 
are provided support throughout the day's walk, so there is no 
worry of being left "behind", or wandering off the trail.</p>

<p>Generally, after three to four hours walk, one will arrive at the
lunch spot chosen by the cook. A cold lunch is served, with 
tinned fish or meat, cheese, biscuits or crackers, dried fruits 
and nuts and tea. On extraordinarily cold days, a hot soup may 
also be served. After lunch, another three to four hour walk will 
bring one to the site where the night's camp will be pitched. 
While the tents are being set-up and the campsite is being 
established, tea and biscuits are served.</p>

<p>Dinner is served usually shortly after dusk,and comprises a hot
soup, a main staple with accompaniment, dessert and tea and 
coffee. A meal mix of 60 percent local and 40 percent western 
dishes is maintained while on trek. Food on treks is always 
plentiful and wholesome. However, unlike treks in other regions 
of South Asia, all items need to be carried on trek, as the few 
villages that one may pass while on trek are unable to restock 
trekking parties. Moreover, mindful of our clients concerns, 
<i>Walji's Adventure Pakistan</i> staff are taught to maintain the
highest standards of camp and kitchen hygiene.</p>

<IMG SRC="TENT.GIF" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/pakistan/tent.gif" ALIGN=left WIDTH=264 HEIGHT=165 ALT="Photo of Tent"><p>The equipment supplied on trek is of superior standard. Roomy
three-person tents are used as doubles, and two-person tents as 
singles. Closed cell foam mattresses are provided, and a simple 
yet hygienic toilet tent is part of standard equipment. 
Additionally, the kitchen crew are provided with a cook tent made 
of fire-retardant material. As an option, clients can request a 
large mess tent furnished with a pressurised lantern, a folding 
table and camp stools.</p>

<p>Consequently, any person who is healthy, physically fit and
enjoys the outdoors will thrive on a <i>Walji's Adventure Pakistan</i>
trek. After all, we do promise you <i><b>The Ultimate Travel 
Experience</i></b>.</p>
