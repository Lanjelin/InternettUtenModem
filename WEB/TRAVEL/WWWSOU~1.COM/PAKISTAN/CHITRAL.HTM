<p>Chitral forms Pakistan's northwestern border with Afghanistan,
and is home to the precipitous mountains of the Hindkush. This 
range is different from the Himalayas and Karakorams, and since 
there are no 8000 meter peaks here, it is not as well known. 
However, Tirich Mir at 7708m and its accompanying peaks, Noshaq 
(7492m), Istoro Nal (7403m) and Saraghrar (7338m) command 
respect. Alexander the Great's troops had to battle through the 
snows on their passage from Afghanistan to Pakistan, and called 
the Hindu Kush 'Parapamisus' meaning mountains over which no 
eagle can fly. Additionally, Tartar hordes passed through here, 
notably Gengis Khan and Tamerlane, and a route of the Silk Road 
wound through the Baroghil Pass in Upper Chitral. Nonetheless, 
Chitralis have been mostly left alone in their valley for 
centuries, and their origins remain shrouded in mystery. Present 
day Chitralis are mostly Muslims, but in the south of Chitral 
there are three Valleys inhabited by the Kafir Kalash, an 
anamistic tribe that has evaded being converted to Islam. Chitral 
has been traditionally and, except for a brief spell 
uninterruptedly, ruled by the Mehtars who claim as ancestors the 
Tartar ruling family of Tamerlane. However, in the late 19th 
century the British established a garrison in Chitral, as at that 
time it was thought that there existed easy passage from Russia 
to British India. When that proved unfounded, the British lost 
interest in Chitral, and the Mehtars were left to govern as they 
wished until the late 1960's. Finally in 1974, Chitral was 
annexed by Pakistan, and the Mehtars' rule came to a rather 
ignominious end. The beauty of Chitral lies as much in its 
rustic, mountainous terrain, as in its warmhearted and friendly 
inhabitants.</p>

<h3>Kafir Kalash Trek</h3>
<i>Level B</i><br>

<p>The setting of Rudyard Kipling's <i>The Man Who Would Be
King,</i> is purported to be in the Kafir Kalash Valleys. In the 
late 19th century the area used to be known as Kafiristan -- Land 
of the Infidels -- and extended to several valleys in present day 
Afghanistan. However, the inhabitants of the Afghan Kafir valleys 
were forcibly converted to Islam, leaving only the tribes of the 
three valleys of Rambur Bomboret and Berir to carry on their 
centuries-old animistic culture. After driving from Chitral to 
the least frequented of the valleys, Rambur, trek over two passes 
in as many days to Bomboret. This middle valley is the most 
commercialised, so trek out of the 'commercial' area to Shawal, 
where the shepherds have their summer pastures. The next day 
return to Bomboret, to prepare for the following day's gruelling 
crossing over the ridge separating Bomboret from Berir. Spend 
some time exploring Berir, before making the return drive to 
Chitral.</p>

</h3><i>The Mountains Over Which No Eagle Can Fly</i></h3>
<i>Level B</i><br>

<p>The Tirich Valley is populated with several small villages,
separated by groves of apricot trees. The valley is very fertile, 
and the resulting verdant floor is in breathtaking contrast to 
the orange and yellow apricots, especially in late summer. After 
driving to Uthul, trek across Zani Pass (3886m) to Shagram 
village. At the crest of Zani pass, there are excellent views of 
the Hindukush and Hindu Raj ranges, and the colour contrasts of 
the two are readily discernible. Trekking through the villages of 
Atak and Bandak, one will arrive at Shogor, at the foot of the 
Tirich Glacier. From here trek on to the Lower Tirich Glacier to 
the furthermost point of the trek. The day's excursion will allow 
for fantastic views of Tirich Mir (7708m) and Istoro Nal (7403m) 
as well as the heavily crevassed Upper Tirich Glacier. Return in 
two days on the same route to Shagram, from where one will drive 
back to Chitral.</p>
