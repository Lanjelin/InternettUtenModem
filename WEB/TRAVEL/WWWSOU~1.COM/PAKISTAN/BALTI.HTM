<p>Nestled in this region is the greatest concentration of lofty
peaks on Earth. Within this area of 26,000 square kilometres, lie 
60 mountain peaks above 7000 meters, four of which tower above 
8000 meters: K-2 (8611m), Gasherbrum I (8068m), Broad Peak 
(8047m) and Gasherbrum II (8035m). Bordered to the north by the 
Sinkiang province of China, to the east by Ladakh, to the south 
by Kashmir and to the west by Gilgit-Hunza, Baltistan has been 
largely ignored by most invaders, conquerors and explorers. Very 
little is known of the origins of the inhabitants, but the 
architecture, the features of the indigenous population and the 
similarity of the modern-day Balti language to archaic Tibetan 
has earned their abode the nickname of "Little Tibet". Mentioned 
first by the Chinese in the 8th century, this region remained 
predominantly Buddhist until the 15th century, when most of the 
locals converted to Islam. In the mid-19th century the Maharajas 
of Kashmir conquered and annexed Baltistan, and it remained part 
of Kashmir until 1947, when the local Baltis fought to join 
Pakistan. The capital of Baltistan is Skardu, strategically 
placed near the confluence of the Indus and Shigar Rivers. At an 
altitude of 2300 meters, Skardu is surrounded by sharp peaks in 
breathtaking hues of ochre, grey, violet and black. Apart from 
the wheat and corn fields alongside the river banks, the regions 
a desert. The consequent juxtaposition of sand dunes with green 
and yellow fields bifurcated by the swirling, roaring Indus, all 
amidst a backdrop of ragged, snow-capped peaks, is a sight 
defying imagination. This truly is, in Fosco Mariani's words, 
"The world's greatest museum of shape and form."</p>

<h3>K-2 Base Camp</h3>
<i>Level D</i><br>

<IMG SRC="K2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/pakistan/k2.gif" ALIGN=left WIDTH=112 HEIGHT=138><p>Perhaps the most spectacular trek in the world, the K-2 Base Camp
trek follows the mountaineers' route up the Baltoro Glacier, and 
passes through the greatest concentration of high peaks in the 
world. The apex of this trek is the junction of the Goodwin-
Austen and Baltoro Glaciers, a spectacular setting called 
Concordia (4400 m). Here, within a radius of a few miles, tower 
10 of the world's 30 highest peaks. From Skardu, one drives as 
far as the road permits, and then commences the walk to Askole, 
the last settlement. After this village human habitation ends, 
and one enters an incredible wilderness of ice, rock and sky. 
Ascend the Baltoro Glacier -- the world's second longest outside 
the polar regions -- to Concordia. At this junction, one is 
surrounded by such famous peaks as the Gasherbrums (8068 m and 
8035m), Broad Peak (8047m), Golden Throne (7312), Chogolisa 
(7654m), Mitre Peak (6006m), Crystal Peak (6238m) and of course, 
K-2 (8611m). Explore this mountain grandeur for two days before 
making the return trek back to Skardu. <i>For this trek it is 
mandatory to have emergency evacuation insurance.</i></p>

<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Leave Skardu and drive as far as the road permits.
<LI><b>Day 2-9:</b> Trek to Concordia via Askole, Jhula, Paiju, Khubrse,
Urdukas and Goro. 
<LI><b>Day 10-11:</b> Two days for exploration and side trips.
<LI><b>Day 12-18:</b> Outbound trek returning to road head, and drive back
to Skardu.

<A NAME="masherbrum"><h2>The Day of Judgment</h2>
<h3>Masherbrum Base Camp</h3>
<i>Level C</i><br>

<p>Masherbrum Peak (7821m) is a uniquely shaped mountain whose snow
capped tip evokes trepidation and awe. The route to the base camp 
leads through the idyllic Khaplu and Hushe villages, whose 
inhabitants embody the hospitable Balti lifestyle. Surrounding 
these villages are the jagged peaks of the Karakorams, and one 
can empathise with geologists fascination with this geologically 
'young' mountain mass. Straight ahead of Hushe village lies the 
overshadowing presence of Masherbrum, and the trek leading to the 
intermediate camp -- though strenuous -- follows in part the 
trail leading to the summer pastures of the Hushe villagers. 
Masherbrum Glacier is easily bridged and Masherbrum Base Camp 
gives one a clear understanding of why Masherbrum is better known 
as 'The Day of Judgment'. After spending a day exploring the area 
near base camp, retrace one's steps to Khaplu and thence to 
Skardu.</p>

<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Drive to Khaplu.
<LI><b>Day 2:</b> Explore Khaplu and drive as far as the road permits
towards Hushe and then, if necessary, walk to Hushe village. 
<LI><b>Day 3:</b> Hike to Choghaspa.
<LI><b>Day 4:</b> Hike to Masherbrum Base Camp.
<LI><b>Day 5:</b> Free for exploration.
<LI><b>Day 6:</b> Return trek to Hushe.
<LI><b>Day 7:</b> Hike to the road head, if necessary and drive to Skardu.

<h3>Deosai Jeep Adventure</h3>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<IMG SRC="JEEP1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/pakistan/jeep1.gif" ALIGN=right WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=210><p>The Deosai Plains lie between the Indus River and the southern
extension of the Himalayan Range, whose most famous peak is Nanga 
Parbat (8125m). At an average height of 3800m, the undulating, 
green, flower-filled meadows are surrounded by snow capped peaks 
and the drive through these plains is a soul stirring experience.</p>

<p>Furthermore, freshwater lakes abound, and as a result, make this
seldom disturbed area a haven for wildlife, including Brown Bear 
and Markhor. Our jeep ride from Skardu will take us through 
Satpara Valley over Ali Malik Pass (4082m) to Kala Pani Stream. 
From here one can hike over level ground to the next camp spot of 
Deosai Lake (3865m). One will then drive over Chachor Pass 
(4267m), to Tarashing, which is the jump-off spot for treks and 
expeditions to the Rupal face of Nanga Parbat. Explore the area, 
including a possible hike to Chungpar Glacier. Continue on to 
Rama Lake and after spending a day hiking in the area, jeep from 
Rama to Gilgit.</p>
