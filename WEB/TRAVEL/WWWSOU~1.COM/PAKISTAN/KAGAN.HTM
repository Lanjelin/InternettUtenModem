<h1 align=CENTER>Pakistan's Little Kashmir, Kaghan Valley</h1>

<p>This resplendent forested valley is a beautiful prelude to
Pakistan's northernmost massif. The alpine lakes nestled amidst 
4000 to 5000 meter high show-capped mountains make for picture-
book scenery, which allows mental acclimatisation to the towering 
spires of the Karakorams. The Kaghan Valley is easily accessible 
from the capital, Islamabad, and lies on the old route from the 
plains of Punjab to Gilgit-Hunza and Baltistan. The plethora of 
sights in this 160 kilometre-long valley is unbelievable: the 
Kunhar River, swollen by glacier melt, meanders its way through 
the valley, and is the perfect river for trout fishers; the 
picturesque villages of Shogran -- from where there are clear 
views of the highest peak in Kaghan, Malika Parbat (5290m) and 
Naran, straight out of Hans Christian Anderson make good stating 
points for many excursions into side valleys; Lake Saif-ul-Mulk 
(3212m), named because Prince Saif-ul-Mulk-supposedly drowned 
here together with his beloved fairy princess by her jealous 
demon lover, reflects the surrounding peaks and alpine meadows in 
its crystal clear waters. The emerald Lake Lalusar, lying higher 
up the valley and the source of the Kunhar, makes a serene 
camping spot on the way to the northern exit of the valley. 
Gittidas Meadow (3634m), filled with alpine flowers, is the 
summer pasture for the herdsman of Kaghan; and the northern 
valley exit, Babusar Pass (4175m) -- whose crest affords 
commanding views of the valley -- squeezes out a jeep track that 
guarantees one the ride of one's life. It is little wonder that 
local folklore abounds with fairies, nymphs and abode more 
suitable for leprechauns.</p>
