<h1 align=CENTER>Winter Adventures in Southern Pakistan</h1>

<p>Three of Pakistan's provinces, Punjab, Sind and Baluchistan, are
best toured in the winter, due to the extreme high temperatures 
in the summer. The Punjab, land of the five rivers, is the most 
populous and the most fertile of the three. Sind, named after the 
Indus, has the most colourful culture with lively music and 
brightly decorated crafts. The largest province, Baluchistan, 
contrary to its rich past today is a serene, challenging 
territory with wide expanses of desert forbidding mountains, and 
a beautiful coastline. The south of Pakistan has sustained 
settlers for thousands of years. In fact, the second oldest 
civilisation in the world, dating as far back as 5000 BC, is the 
Indus Valley Civilisation. The Punjab also played host to Guatma 
Buddha in his search for enlightenment, and his disciples 
established in Taxila a centre of learning famous throughout 
Asia. It was in the Punjab that Alexander the Great finally ended 
his eastward push in 325 BC and headed homewards via the 
Baluchistan coastline after sailing through Sind down the Indus 
River. During the 15th to 17th centuries Islam made its presence 
felt, with the invasion of Mahmood of Ghazni through Baluchistan, 
Sind and Southern Punjab, and the consequent mass conversion of 
the indigenous population. The subsequent Moghal period was one 
that saw the flourishing of the arts with magnificent courts, 
palaces, gardens and shrines being constructed. The East India 
Trading Company was the next in the long line of conquerors, and 
the British Raj set the foundation upon which was established 
modern day Pakistan. The legacy of saints and shrines, princes 
and pavilions is still very much in evidence and makes for 
culturally rich adventure touring. As a result, the trips in this 
area are an odyssey into the past and allow one to rediscover, 
study and appreciate the culture and peoples of a bygone era.</p>

<A name="indus"><h1 align=CENTER>The Lion River, Indus Boat Safari</h1>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>The Indus river, 3200 kilometres in length, is Asia's third
longest and starts as a little mountain stream in Tibet. 
Explorers were enamoured by the river, and hundreds of 
expeditions were launched to try to find the source. Today, the 
Indus supports the largest irrigation network in the world, an 
amazing 65,000 kilometres at last count. The beauty of the Indus 
lies in its contrasts: from a raging torrent tearing through 
precipitous gorges in the north, to the lazy, meandering waterway 
of the Punjabi plains. The perspective of the river one has 
during this trip is that of a life-giver. On traditional fishing 
and cargo boats -- whose design was borrowed from Alexander the 
Great's ships -- float downriver, viewing the rural life of the 
peasants of Punjab, and keeping track of the innumerable species 
of birds that stop on their north-south migratory patterns. 
Additionally, there is the possibility of catching the unique 
fresh-water blind Indus Dolphin at play, as it `races' one's boat 
convoy. This four day tour begins at the large Taunsa Barrage, 
and ends in a small village approximately 50 kilometres 
downstream. Enroute visit some of the villages  that line the 
banks, and learn from the reed-basket weavers, the fishermen, and 
the ploughmen, about their life on this magnificent, `Lion' 
River. On return to Multan, there is a possibility of taking an 
optional tour to Uuch Sharif, where there are magnificent shrines 
of Muslim saints.</p>

<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Depart Multan for Taunsa Barrage.
<LI><b>Day 2:</b> Begin boat ride down the Indus, stopping in villages
enroute. 
<LI><b>Day 3:</b> Drift down stream with migratory birds as our companions.
<LI><b>Day 4:</b> Float to Ghazigat village, and then drive back to Multan.
</ul>

<h2>Optional Tour Uuch Sharif</h2>

<p>During the day's excursion visit this former tiny Kingdom, which
in the 13th century was made famous by Islamic scholars and 
saints. There are beautiful tombs of the more popular saints,  
notably those of Bibi Jawandi and Jalal Surkh Bukhari. The 
architecture of these tombs reflects a Central Asian influence, 
and the embellishments extensively make use of the beautiful 
glazes blue tilework of the area. On return to Multan, transfer 
to the airport for one's flight to the next adventure.</p>

<h1 align=CENTER>Muslim Architecture and Crafts</h1>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>Faisalabad, known as 'Little Manchester' because of its vast
textile industry, is the third largest city of Pakistan. In this 
city one of the most aesthetically designed hotels in Pakistan, 
the Faisalabad Serena, has opened its doors. The inspiration of 
its design has been the rich architecture of the inner city of 
Faisalabad, exuberant Punjabi colours and decorative arts, and 
the Islamic heritage of the city and the region. This unique 
hotel will be the meeting point from where a tour of the hotel 
will follow with a visit of the surrounding areas to see how 
local and artistic traditions have been incorporated in the 
hotel's design. The nest day, visit Chiniot, an attractive little 
town known for its inlay work and beautiful wood carving . 
Chiniot is the ancestral home of the great craftsmen of the 
Moghal period, most of whom were involved in the building of such 
magnificent marvels as the Taj Mahal, the Golden Temple, and 
Wazir Khan's Mosque. After a visit of the local bazaars and the 
17th century Moghal mosque, return back to Faisalabad.</p>

<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Arrive Faisalabad, and overnight at the Serena Hotel.
<LI><b>Day 2:</b> Full day excursion of Faisalabad and surrounding area.
<LI><b>Day 3:</b> Full day sightseeing excursion of Chiniot. Late afternoon
return to Faisalabad and transfer to the airport.
</ul>

<h1 align=CENTER>The Land of the Lost River, Cholistan Camel Safari</h1>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>The legendary Cholistan Desert extends for over 17,000 square
kilometres right into the Thar Desert of Rajastan, India. This 
whole area, once irrigated by the Hakra River and lush green, is 
now a desolate semi-desert expanse of sand and salt bushes. All 
along the 550  kilometres of the Hakra's dry river bed over 400 
archaeological sites, some dating as far back as the 5000-year 
old Indus Civilisation, have been discovered but are yet to be 
excavated. According to archaeologists, the key to the mysteries 
of the ancient Indus Civilisation lies buried in the sands of 
Cholistan. Additionally, during the 16th and 17th centuries, the 
Moguls built several forts in this area, the most striking of 
which are at Darawer, Maujgarh, Dingarh and Marot. The Camel 
Safari begins at Multan, from where one will drive to Lal Suhanra 
Park, situated at the edge of the Cholistan Desert. From here, 
lumber along on camel back visiting desert villages, lonely 
nomadic settlements, ancient forts and archaeological sites. By 
night, witness the camel drivers dance the local 'Jhumar' around 
a warm campfire. The safari ends at Shahiwala, and from there 
drive back to Multan.</p>

</ul>

<h1 align=CENTER>Indus Valley Highlights</h1>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>The Indus Civilisation, dating back to 5000 BC, was the precursor
of the great civilisations of South Asia. Its heyday marked over 
1000 towns scattered across the Indus delta, some of which had 
populations of over 40,000 inhabitants! Only ten of these sites 
have been excavated, and one will visit two of these, Mohenjodaro 
and Kot Diji, with an option to visit a third Mehrgarh. After 
arrival in Sukkur, explore Kot Diji as well as other historical 
sites of the Moghal and Talpur eras. The next day, following a 
day long excursion to Mohenjodaro, board an overnight train to 
Quetta. At sunrise, one will enter the Bolan Pass, and the ochre 
coloured rocks glinting in the early morning sun makes for a 
breath taking sight. In Quetta itself, visit the traditional 
bazaar, stuffed with Baluchi goods, and crowded with proud 
moustache sporting Baluchi tribesmen. After an overnight, proceed 
for an optional tour to Mehrgarh, or take a flight to connect 
with one's next adventure.</p>

<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Arrive Sukkur
<LI><b>Day 2:</b> Visit Kot Diji and Mohenjodaro, and in the evening board
an overnight train to Quetta. 
<LI><b>Day 3:</b> Afternoon visit the city and bazaars.
<LI><b>Day 4:</b> Optional tour of Mehrgarh or transfer to the airport for
onward flight.
</ul>

<h1 align=CENTER>Optional Tour of Mehrgarh</h1>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>The recently discovered archaeological site of Mehrgarh has
unlocked the secrets of the Indus Valley Civilisation by 
uncovering sites and graves over a 3000 year time span. Mehrgarh 
s significant for it establishes the pre-Indus Civilisation 
period, and shows clear transitions of the inhabitants from 
nomadic hunter gatherers to settled hunter farmers. This day long 
trip from Quetta goes through the Bolan Pass to Sibi, and then 
turns off onto a dirt track to the site. One will return to 
Quetta for an overnight before departing the next day.</p>
 
<h1 align=CENTER>Saints, Sentinels and Shrines -- Sind Jeep Safari</h1>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>The Islamic culture that flourished along the banks of the Indus
River gave tremendous fillip to the arts and crafts. Due to the 
Islamic restriction of not portraying human or animal figures, 
the art and architecture was restricted to geometric designs or 
calligraphy. As a result, the monuments built in the Islamic 
period have a beauty not well developed in any other art form. On 
this tour which starts from Multan, one will visit the graceful 
tombs and mausoleums of Islamic saints, as well as the award 
winning mosque of Bhoong, which is on the way to Sukkur. In 
Sukkur itself, there are the Indus valley remains of Kot Diji, 
and many Moghul and Talpur sights, including the leaning Masum 
Shah Tower. From Sukkur, drive to Mohenjodaro, the most famous 
Indus Valley archaeological sight, and then on to the shrine in 
Sehwan Sharif, where Sind's most famous Sufi saint, Lal Shahbaz 
Qallander, lies entombed. in the evenings, there is a regular 
'dhemmal' devotional dance which brings to life the sufis' mys-
terious ways of being close to Allah. One will also visit the 
boat people of Manchar Lake, Ranikot Fort and Hyderabad, before 
ending the tour in Karachi, Sind's capital.</p>

<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Drive Multan to Sukkur, enroute visiting Bhoong Mosque.
<LI><b>Day 2:</b> Sightseeing of Sukkur and Kot Diji.
<LI><b>Day 3:</b> Drive via Mohenjodaro to Sehwan Sharif.
<LI><b>Day 4:</b> Excursion to Manchar lake.
<LI><b>Day 5:</b> Drive to Ranikot, perhaps the largest fort in the world,
and then on to Hyderabad. 
<LI><b>Day 6:</b> Full day tour of Hyderabad.
<LI><b>Day 7:</b> Drive to Karachi, via Thatta and Bhanbore.
</ul>

<h1 align=CENTER>The Nomadic Trail -- Baluchistan Jeep Safari</h1>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>At one time Baluchistan used to be a fertile, well inhabited area
attracting even hunters from the Stone Age, approximately 50,000 
years ago. The pre-Indus Valley Civilisation period, where the 
indigenous population made the transition from hunter-gatherers 
to hunter-farmers, is thought to be along the Bolan River with 
recent archaeological finds dating back as far as 6000 BC. This 
coupled with Baluchistan's being a natural crossroads for traffic 
from Persia and Afghanistan, made the main routes ideal for 
nomads. In fact, the North South route from the central states of 
Russia through Afghanistan, Baluchistan and Sind to the coasts of 
India is still in use today. the route that this safari will 
follow begins in Sukkur, and the first day will take one to the 
Hot Springs of Pir Ghaib via the site of Mehrgarh, where remains 
of the Pre-Indus Valley Civilisation are to be found. The next 
day will go through the torturous winding Bolan Pass to Quetta, 
the modern day capital of Baluchistan. After a visit of the city, 
drive to the summer resort of Ziarat, situated near the largest 
Juniper Forest in the world. Spend the day hiking in the hills of 
Ziarat, before returning to Quetta.</p>

<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Jeep from Sukkur to Pir Ghaib, via Mehrgarh.
<LI><b>Day 2:</b> Wind through Bolan Pass to Quetta.
<LI><b>Day 3:</b> Full day tour of Quetta city.
<LI><b>Day 4:</b> Drive to Ziarat via Gundak and Kach.
