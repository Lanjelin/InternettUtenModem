<p>Known as the "Killer Mountain," Nanga Parbat (8125m) is the 9th
highest peak in the world and perhaps the most challenging. 
Anchoring the western end of the Himalayan Range, Nanga Parbat 
was first climbed in 1953 by Herman Buhl. The following two treks 
take one to the north and south faces of this magnificent 
mountain.</p>

<h3>The Rupal Face Trek</h3>
<i>Level B</i><br>

<p>This trek leads to the base camp of Nanga Parbat's southern face,
the most dangerous and difficult of all the routes to the summit. 
From Gilgit, drive through the gorges of the Astor Valley to the 
beautiful alpine village of Tarashing. From here, it is a two day 
hike to the base camp, which is set amidst a lush alpine meadow. 
Enroute traverse the Chumphere and Bazin Glaciers, before 
reaching the traditional base camp, locally known as Latobah. 
From this area there are spectacular views of the towering 5000m 
Rupal Face of Nanga Parbat. The entire trek parallells Rupal 
stream, and offers fine views of Chongra (6447m) and Rajkot 
(7074m) peaks. After spending a day at leisure exploring the 
area, recommence the two day return trek to Tarashing, and then 
jeep to Gilgit.</p>

<A name="fairy"><h2>Fairy Meadows</h2>
<h3>The Raikot Face Trek</h3 >
<i>Level B</i><br>

<p>Fairy Meadows, so named because of local superstition that
fairies inhabit this spectacularly forested alpine meadow, is a 
wonderful setting from where to explore Nanga Parbat. One will 
drive from Gilgit to Jeyal, and from there walk a few hours to 
Fairy Meadows. Shepherd's huts are scattered around the area, and 
clear water is plentiful - coupled with the pine forests and the 
looming north face of Nanga Parbat, one can readily believe that 
fairies really do live in this alpine meadow. The next day's trek 
will lead to the base camp of this trek, Beyal, from where day 
excursions will be made to the German memorial to those killed in 
the 1937 expedition, and to the foot of Jiliper Peak. On the 
return, stop for the night at Fairy Meadows, before trekking to 
the road head and driving back to Gilgit.</p>
