<p>For the adventure-loving tourist, there are few places in the
world that can compare to the valleys of Gilgit and Hunza. Gilgit 
is an ancient trading post, whose bustling bazaar has been a 
<i>caravanserai</i> for many of the traders of the silk road.</p>

<p>With the opening of the Karakoram Highway leading to China, the
population of Gilgit has increased manifold; however, its dusty, 
old-world ambience remains largely unaffected by the large 
numbers of fortune seekers, traders, ambassadors, and tourists 
that seasonally swell the town. Dominated by the 6134m Domani 
Peak, the city is encircled by featureless, brown and black 
coloured `hills' ranging up to 4500m high. The local population 
has made an effort to turn this dusty bowl of a city into an 
oasis, and one will see patches of green, terraced fields, 
interspersed with orchards of apricot, cherry and apple.</p>

<p>While Gilgit is noted for its bazaar and its potpourri of
peoples, Hunza is known for its breath-taking mountain vistas. 
Snow-capped Rakaposhi (7788m), and Ultar (7388m) dominate the 
valley, and the village, and the villages of Karimabad and 
Gulmit are the prettiest in this former kingdom. Nestled close to 
China and the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan, the entire valley 
is of great strategic importance. Hunzakurts have historically 
taken advantage of their strategical placement, and used to 
waylay without discrimination all manners of caravans plying on 
the trade routes to and from China. In fact, their legendary 
toughness has contributed to the myth that the Hunzakurts 
routinely live to be 120 years old! However, their strength and 
ruggedness is belied by their gentle, warm and hospitable 
character. It is the serene environment, coupled with the <i>joie 
de vivre</i> of the Hunzakurts that makes one's trip to Hunza the 
memory of lifetime.</p>

<A name="vistas"><h2>Mountain Vistas of Hunza</h2>
<i>Level C</i><br>

<p>This trek takes you to fascinating Upper Hunza, and one has the
opportunity of traversing two glaciers, and hiking alongside part 
of Batura Glacier, which at approximately 65 kilometres in 
length, is the second longest glacier outside the polar regions. 
Additionally, at the high point of this trek at Patundas meadow 
(4575m), one has clear views of a plethora of peaks: the Passu 
Group (7284 to 7500m), the Batura Group (7500 to 7784m), Shishpar 
(7619m), Disteghil Sar (7885m), Momhil Sar (7342m) and Rakaposhi 
(7788m), amongst others. From the starting point of Gilgit, drive 
on the Karakoram Highway to Ghulkin. The next three days' 
trekking will bring one to Patundas. The days, though short due 
to sharp altitude gains, will allow one to traverse Ghulkin and 
Passu Glaciers, and pass by Borit Lake. At Patundas spend a free 
day feasting one's eyes on the mountain panorama,  before taking 
the next two days descending to Passu, and returning to Gilgit.</p>

<A Name="rashpari"><h2>Nagar, the Forgotten Valley</h2>
<h3>Rashpari Peak Climb (5058m)</h3>
<i>Level C</i><br>

<p>Across the Hunza River from Karimabad, lies the beautiful,
unspoiled Nagar Valley. Traditionally the bitterest of foes, 
Hunzakurts and Nagarites have made peace in a manner typical of 
royalty, by marrying the princess of one to the king of the 
other. The nadir of this adventure in Nagar Valley is attaining 
the summit of Rashpari Peak, from where one has commanding views 
of Nagar and Karimabad. At the same time, one can be closer to 
the grandeur of Rakaposhi (7788m) and Diran (7258m), which loom 
large on the horizon. Our trek commences from the ex-King of 
Nagar's `palace' across the Barpu Glacier to Hamdar, and in two 
days one makes the journey to a glacier lake at the base of 
Rashpari Peak.  The peak is not technically difficult, but 
requires a lot of stamina as altitude gains are severe. After 
submitting Rashpari Peak, descend to Paipari at the edge of Barpu 
Glacier, and then traverse the Barpu to return to Shishkin and 
Nagar. <i>For this trek it is mandatory to have emergency 
evacuation insurance.</I></p>

<A NAME="yak"><h2>Batura Glacier Yak Adventure</h2>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>The yak, the mountain dwellers' beast of burden, is a fierce-
looking, shaggy creature, similar to a cow, and -- fortunately -- 
as passive as one. Traditionally and principally reared in 
Pakistan's north as a source of milk, yaks are also used to carry 
loads from one village to another, and to give rides to young 
children, and the not-so-young, on long-distance journeys. This 
new, thrilling adventure will take one on yak back on the 
traditional shepherds' route to high pasture grounds. Beginning 
at the foot of Batura Glacier, whose nearly 65 kilometre length 
makes it the second longest glacier in the world outside the 
polar regions, one will traverse the glacier near Malungin, and 
ride to Yashipirt. From here there are superb views of the Batura 
Peaks, ranging from 6830m to 7785m, the Kampire Dior Group, 
ranging from 6931m to 7143m, Shispare (7619m), and Passau Peak 
(7284m). From Yashipim, retrace one's route back to Passu 
village, perched comfortably atop one's sure-footed, shaggy 
friend.</p>

<A Name="naltar"><h2>The Hindu Raj</h2>
<h3>Naltar - Ishkoman Trek</h3>
<i>Level B</i><br>

<p>The Ishkoman valley divides the Hindu Raj, Hindu Kush and
Karakorams and consequently, trekking in this area allows one to 
see three types of geologically distinct mountain ranges. The 
trek begins with a short jeep ride to the beautiful, alpine 
valley of Naltar. This valley has an air force ski training 
centre which is surrounded by flower bedecked alpine pastures, 
and thick pine trees. After exploring the village, trek to Naltar 
Lake, whose crystal clear waters mirror the surrounding peaks. 
After spending a free day by the Lake, trek to Shani, at the base 
of Naltar pass, the gateway to Ishkoman. Enroute to Shani, one 
will pass many Gujer settlements, and meet herdsmen tending their 
goats and yaks. One will then cross over Naltar Pass (4200m) to 
Trang. From the top of the pass, there are beautiful views of the 
three mountain ranges, and countless peaks in the 6000 to 7000m 
range. The gradual descent from Trang to Chatorkhand in Ishkoman 
leads one to the traditional village of a famous religious figure 
(Pir), and one might be able to converse with the locals about 
the Pir and his influence. From Chatorkhand, jeep back to Gilgit.</p>

<A Name="jeep"><h2>Marco Polo Jeep Safari</h2>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>This trip follows the route of Marco Polo, and is undertaken in a
four-wheel drive vehicle. On this safari, one will drive through 
the beautiful valleys of Puniyal, Ghizar Mastuj, Chitral, Kafir 
Kalash, Dir and Swat. Enroute, cross the Shandur (3720m), and 
Lowari Passes (3200m). This journey offers astonishing contrasts: 
from stark, shale cliffs to lush green crop fields; from 
thunderous rivers to serene lakes. Even the dwellings, language 
and customs change from one valley to the next. The safari starts 
in Gilgit, and after spending a night in Gupis, arrives at 
Phander Lake, which is one of the most scenic places in this 
area. One day will be spent here at leisure to fish for trout and 
visit the villages. One will then continue over Shandur Pass with 
its two crystal-clear lakes and world's highest polo field, to 
Mastuj, an important village during the 19th century siege of 
Chitral. From Mastuj, drive to Chitral, from where panoramic 
views of the Hindu Kush range, and it's highest peak, Tirich Mir 
(7708m) are to be found. Driving on to Swat, one will pass 'the 
valleys of the infidels' -- the Kafir Kalash -- and cross over 
Lowari Pass, before ending in this emerald valley, popularly 
known as `the Switzerland of the East'.</p>

</ul>

<A name="polo"><h2>Polo On the Pass</h2>
<i>Level A</i><br>

<p>At approximately 3700m, the polo field on Shandur Pass is perhaps
the world's highest. Here the spirited game of mountain polo -- 
which some say originated in the neighbouring mountain fiefdoms 
-- is played at it's very best, as the two top teams from Gilgit 
and Chitral vie for the honour of being recognised as the 
champion of the northern areas. Shandur Polo is a rough game that 
lures in the spectators, and is played with no holds barred. Of 
late, teams from Afghanistan and Kashgar (China), have also been 
invited to compete. The resulting melange of cultures allows one 
the rare opportunity of experiencing the vitality of these hardy 
mountain folk, in a setting largely unchanged over centuries. 
During the week-long festivities, there are folk dances, trout 
fishing competitions, singing contests, but above all, there is 
<b>polo!</b> For the duration of the games, a tented city is 
established to cater for the players, participants and on-
lookers, and set amidst the backdrop of the Hindu Kush mountain 
range, one has the feeling of being transposed into the world of 
Rudyard Kipling's <i>Man Who Would Be King.</i> Being a part of 
this exciting, highly-charged atmosphere is unforgettable, an 
experience of a lifetime.</p>


<h3>Itinerary</h3>
<ul>
<LI><b>Day 1:</b> Drive from Gilgit to Phander Lake.
<LI><b>Day 2 to Day 5:</b> Participate in the fishing and singing contests,
