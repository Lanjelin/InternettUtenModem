<IMG SRC="MAP.GIF" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/pakistan/map.gif" WIDTH=594 HEIGHT=424 ALT="Pakistan Map (61 k)"><p>To the ancients the land that is today Pakistan was a continent
that took its name from the great river Indus sweeping southwards 
from some of the highest mountains in the world. Along its banks 
and among its tributaries grew up civilisation after 
civilisation, luring successive waves of conquerors -- until, in 
our own century, the land came into itself in free and modern 
statehood: Pakistan.</p>
     
<p>About the end of the first half of the third millennium BC, a
city civilisation was born in the Indus Valley. The transition 
from village life was so sudden that outside inspiration seems 
probable. We know that the merchants of Mesopotamia undertook sea 
voyages over the Persian Gulf to Bahrain and Oman, and they may 
well have penetrated the Indus Valley.</p>
     
<p>The well-known facts are that in the Indus civilisation we have
knowledge of an urban culture, occupying a huge area largely 
within the modern political boundaries of Pakistan, which can be 
reasonably estimated to have existed between 2500 and 1750 BC. It 
was centred on the river Indus, and at its maximum extent 
contained within what is very roughly an equilateral triangle 
with sides of about one thousand kilometres, one of which is 
formed by the coast of the Arabian Sea, with its apex on the 
river Sutlej hardly more than two hundred kilometres south of the 
Himalayan range.</p>
     
<p>The Indus Valley civilisation's disappearance was just as swift
as its prominence, and archeologists even today search among the 
ruins for clues that will allow them to piece together the story 
of the rise and fall of this grand civilisation.</p>
    
<p>The next historical landmark in this area that constitutes
modern-day Pakistan was the advance of Alexander the Great. In 
327 BC, he led a part of his army from Afghanistan through the 
territories which are now Nawagai, Bajaur, Dir and Swat. Later, 
he marched over the hills to the Indus, which he crossed near 
Hund, and to Taxila.</p>
     
<p>When Alexander arrived at Taxila, he found a flourishing Buddhist
city of learning. Several years earlier, Buddhism had begun to 
establish its influence and its emphasis on discipline and order 
had allowed it to build up a following over a widespread area, 
starting from the present-day Indian State of Bihar, to upper 
Swat.</p>

<p>Alexander readily assimilated Buddhism into his empire, and the
result gave rise to a Greco-Buddhist school of art and culture. 
The most famous proponent of this school was the great Mauryan 
Emperor Ashoka, whose enduring achievement was the establishment 
of Buddhism as the dominant element in the culture and life of 
inhabitants from Taxila to upper Swat (also known as the region 
of Gandhara). In fact, pilgrims from abroad considered Gandhara 
to be the second home of Buddhism after Bihar, where the Buddha 
was born and spent most of his life.</p>
     
<p>The Gandharan period -- from the second to fifth centuries AD --
gave way to many invading hordes amongst whom were the White 
Huns, Sassanians, Turks and Hindu Shahis.</p>
    
<p>It was not until the 11th century, with the advent of Islam, that
stability once again came to the region. The Mughals were the 
greatest of all the Islamic rulers, and from early in the 16th
century till the early 18th century, their rule was marked with
the flourishing of culture.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the British, who had begun contact with the Mughals
through the East India Trading Company, began to dominate the 
economic and political scene, and controlled the entire sub-
continent until the 1930's.</p>

<p>Thereafter, educated Muslims of the area began their fight for
freedom. They found in Mohammad Ali Jinnah an effective leader, 
and through him agitated for an independent state. Their struggle 
for independence was rewarded on August 14, 1947, when the 
modern-day state of Pakistan came into existence.</p>

<p>It is this country, steeped in rich and varied history, with a
geographical diversity stretching from the high mountains of the 
North to the desert plains of the South, that we wish to explore 
with you, the intrepid traveller.</p>
