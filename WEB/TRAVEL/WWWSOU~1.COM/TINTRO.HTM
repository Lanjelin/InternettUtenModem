The King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC) is an autonomous, non-
governmental and non-profit organization. KMTNC was created because of the realization 
that the relationship between nature conservation and economic development is mutually 
dependent. It was established by the special King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation Act 
in 1982. It became fully functional in 1984 after the completion of necessary formalities.<P>
<P>
 KMTNC is named after the late <B><U>King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev</B></U> without whose 
timely intervention most of the existing protected areas of Nepal would  not have existed . 
The Trust enjoys the august patronage of <B><U>His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram 
Shah Dev </B></U> and is privileged to have  a well-known conservationist <B>His Royal 
Highness Prince Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah</B> as the Chairman since its inception. The 
Trust's activities are guided by a Board of Trustees, comprising of eminent national and 
international personalities. Its conservation activities began with a handful of projects 10 years 
ago. Today, it has successfully undertaken over 60 projects in the fields of nature conservation, 
biodiversity protection and sustainable rural development. <P>

The Trust's programs represent a milestone in Nepal's nature and wildlife conservation history 
as they typify a change in the overall approach to conservation. It has tested unique innovations 
which have proved that conservation can be achieved through the involvement of local 
communities in a manner which brings direct benefits to the local people. <P>
<P>
 KMTNC does not receive any annual budgetary support from His Majesty's Government 
of Nepal. It is funded entirely by charitable donations from in-country as well as foreign sources. 
Donations to KMTNC are tax-deductible.<P>
<P>
Over the last 10 years, the Trust has evolved as a people-oriented institution banking essentially 
on the people for their support in its conservation efforts. Its long-term goal is attaining total 
development by making the people fully accountable and confident in their ability to determine 
their own development and conservation priorities. <P>
<P>
Its role in this process is that of a catalyst. The Trust approaches the problems aiming not to 
seek a solution on its own but to try to help the people find answers. This approach to problem-
solving seeks to bring about attitudinal changes for conservation and development among the 
people rather than impose pre-determined ideas. The community is involved from the design to the implementation of any projects
under the aegis of KMTNC as they are the ultimate beneficiaries and stakeholders.<P>
<P>
This explains the Trust's focus on both long-term research and conservation projects being 
undertaken at the Nepal Conservation Research and Training Center (NCRTC) and 
community-based programs such as Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP).<P>
<P>
Today, the Trust's efforts to protect and conserve the natural and cultural heritage have emerged 
as some of  the best-known examples of successful environmental conservation and people-
friendly development in the entire Himalayan region.<P>
