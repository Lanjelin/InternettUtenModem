<p><b>Himalayan Hilltreks</b> offers you the hills of Nepal, that legend-shrouded Kingdom in the clouds.  Indeed, not very far beyond the
outskirts of Kipling's fabled Kathmandu, Nepal awaits you, still
untouched, unspoiled, merely because the rugged countryside has, thus
far, resisted the advance of modern communications.  A day, nay a few
hours on foot, will take you to the grandeur of the mountains, to a
serene medieval countryside, to the picturesque ruins of feudal
palaces and forts, through verdant splendour of rice paddies and
cool, green forest to the warmth and friendliness of the simple
Nepalese folk.</p>

<p>Himalayan Hilltreks specialises in catering to the individual, the
couple, the small party of friends of family, school parties, the odd
group.  Treks are specially tailored to the needs of our clientele.
Our guides, well versed in the lore of the Himalayas, escort and take
care of you.  For the disabled, ponies with special saddles are
provided so that they may share the experiences of their physically
better-off companions.</p>

<p>Himalayan Hilltreks arranges all-inclusive treks which means we
supply you with everything you need to make your trek comfortable.
This includes all camping equipment: tents, mattresses, Sherpas to
make and break camp, cooks to prepare delicious camp meals and guides
to attend, liase and assist.</p>

<p>For the more adventurous set, we have the lodge-trekking concept:
carry your own pack or share a porter with a friend, go accompanied
with a guide, stay and eat at wayside inns along the better-known
trails -- Annapurna, Everest, Langtang or Helambu.  Accomodation and
meals are rather basic, share a room or bed down in a dormitory,
meals of rice and lentils, curried vegetables.  But it's one helluva
lot of fun and a great experience, actually living with the local
folk.</p>

<p>There is no age limit for trekking:  If you are healthy, you'll be
fine.  No need to be a climber or mountaineer.  A little walking
practice at home before you set out is conditioning enough.   See
your Doc before you come and get yourself insured against accident,
sickness and possible evacuation by helicopter since you will be
trekking in remote and high mountains.</p>

<p>If you let us know what sort of trek you'd prefer, the time you have
on hand, we shall be happy to make recommendations, work out a few
special itineraries tailored to your taste and send them for your
selection.</p>

<p>We do sometimes accept last-minute bookings but prefer these made
ahead of your arrival to enable us do a proper job of organising your
trek.</p>

<p>We also take care of hotel accomodations, airport arrival and
departure services, local sightseeing and rafting arrangements,
excursions to jungle lodges and mountain resorts.  Just indicate your
preferences or budget.</p>
