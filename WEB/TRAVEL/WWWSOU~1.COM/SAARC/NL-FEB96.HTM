<p align=left>&#160;<strong>The SAARC HOUSING MINISTER' CONFERENCE</strong><br>
The SAARC Housing Ministers' Conference was held in Colombo on 28 February 1 March 1996, 
with the primary focus to formulate a SAARC collective position preparatory to the Second United 
Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) scheduled to be held in Istanbul in June 
1996. The Conference was attended by all Member States and the SAARC Secretariat was 
represented by SecretaryGeneral Naeem U.Hasan and Director Ahmed Latheef.The Ministerial 
Meeting of the Conference was preceded by a meeting of the Officials, which formulated the draft 
of the Colombo Resolution on Human Settlements and submitted it to the Ministers for their 
consideration.The Housing Ministers' Conference was opened by Secretary-General, Naeem 
U.Hasan, and chaired by the leader of the Sri Lankan delegation, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister 
of Housing, Construction and Public Utilities. </p>
<p>In his inaugural address, the Minister highlighted the ongoing programmes of his country in poverty 
alleviation and housing. In this context, he stated that these programmes were aimed at creating a 
balanced human development in low income settlements in Sri Lanka in the future. The Minister 
added that the objective of the shelter policy in his country is to cater to the present and future 
generations and also to fulfill the nation's infrastructure needs in the context of a rapidly changing 
demographic, economic and social environment. The leaders of delegations of all Member States 
presented their country statements in which they emphasised the issues and concerns of Member 
States in the area of urban development and human settlements in the region.<br>
They also shared their views on the two overall themes of Habitat II Conference i.e. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) Adequate Shelter for All, and <br>
(ii) Sustainable Human Settlements Development in an Urbanising World. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The SAARC SecretaryGeneral in his statement drew the attention of the Conference to various 
initiatives taken by SAARC in the area of human settlements development. While highlighting that a 
fifth of the world's population live in the region, he expressed the hope that the deliberations of the 
Conference, particularly the Colombo Resolution on Human Settlements would provide a positive 
contribution to the outcome of the Habitat II Conference and help to improve the living environment 
of the peoples in the region. The Colombo Resolution on Human Settlements adopted by the 
Ministers incorporates views of Member States on major issues and concerns before the Habitat II 
Conference. The key areas identified by the Ministers relate to eradication of poverty, creation of 
an enabling environment for human settlements development, development of a sustainable human 
settlements approach in an increasingly urbanising world, and capacity building and institutional 
management. The Resolution also highlights those areas in which cooperation and coordination 
among SAARC Member States as well as at global level should be further 
strengthened.Recognising the critical importance of the issues related to urbanisation and housing in 
the region, the Conference felt that there is a need to institutionalise the process of regional 
cooperation and consultation in the field of shelter and human settlements within the SAARC 
framework. While considering the Colombo Resolution, discussions were also held on the relevant 
sections of the draft Global Plan of Action of the Second United Nations Conference on Human 
Settlements (Habitat II). The Colombo Resolution on Human Settlements has been subsequently 
forwarded to the SAARC Secretariat of the HabitatII Conference as the collective input from 
SMRC Member States to the Conference.</p>

inaugurated by the Minister of State for Women and Child Development of India, Ms. Vimla 
Verma. In her inaugural address, the Minister, highlighted that SAARC had through the projection 
of a collective SAARC position at the Beijing Conference, focused attention on urgent concerns of

in the implementation of the Plan of Action for Women and decided that in order to make the 
exercise more feasible, the review, henceforth, would be carried out biannually. The Committee, 
while reviewing the SAARC Decade Plan of Action for the GirlChild (19912000 A.D) noted that 
the Eighth SAARC Summit had directed that a comprehensive middecade review of the 
implementation of the Plan be prepared for submission to the Ninth Summit. In this context they 
discussed the common format designed for the purpose and decided on the methodology for 
completing its work within the timeframe. </p>
<p>The Committee noted that the Workshop scheduled to be held in New Delhi in September 1996 
specifically to address this issue would be the forum at which this matter would be taken up.While 
discussing the followup of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, Member States 
highlighted the steps being taken by their respective countries to implement the decisions and 
commitments in the Platform of Action adopted at the Beijing Conference. They noted that more 
detailed discussions would take place at the SAARC Workshop scheduled to be held in New 
Delhi in 1997 on the subject.The Committee discussed issues relating to the particularly vulnerable 
group of girl children in the region i.e. GirlChildren in Especially Difficult Circumstances (GCEDC) 
and approved the methodology for the preparation of a Regional Overview. </p>
<p>As directed by the Eighth SAARC Summit, the Overview alongwith specific recommendations to 
address the problems faced by these GirlChildren would be presented to the Heads of State or 
Government at the Ninth Summit. The meeting also discussed matters relating to the publication of 
the fourth issue of the SAARC Solidarity Journal and decided that the theme of the next issue 
would be &quot;Women in the Informal Sector&quot;. It also decided that the issue would be brought out to 
coincide with the Ninth SAARC Summit. The meeting drew up the Calendar of Activities for 1996, 
which included three workshops to be held in India, Maldives and Pakistan respectively. The 
Eleventh Meeting of the Committee would be held in India during the last quarter of 1996.</p>
