</strong></em></font>A Memorandum of Understanding on Administrative Cooperation was signed between SAARC 
and the European Commission on July 10, 1996 at the Headquarters of the European Union in 
Brussels. SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan and the Director for South and South East 
Asia, Emiliano Fossati signed the Agreement on behalf of SAARC and EU respectively. The 
Memorandum of Understanding focuses primarily on exchanges of information, institutional support 
and training, and technical assistance.</p>
<p align=left>Notwithstanding the bilateral cooperation which already exists between the European Union and all 
of the SAARC member countries, a strong willingness to improve and strengthen the relations 
between SAARC and the European Union has been seen in recent years on both sides. The signing 
of the MOU between EC and SAARC is a first step in setting up a mechanism for promoting 
cooperation between the twoorganizations. While in Brussels, the Secretary-General held meetings 
with Vice-Chairperson of the South Asia Delegation of the European Parliament, Anita Pollack, 
Secretary-General of the European Parliament Enrio Vinci, and Director-General in the European 
Commission Juan Prat Col.</p>
<p align=left>A detailed round of discussions was held between the officials of the various services of the 
Commission and the delegation of the SAARC Secretariat on July 9, 1996. They focused on 
specific areas/projects in which cooperation could be immediately initiated to implement the 
Memorandum of Understanding.The Secretary-General also met the SAARC Ambassadors based 
in Brussels and briefed them on on-going activities and programmes of the Association.</p>

improving the implementation of the scheme. Representatives from member states attending the 
meeting presented status reports on the implementation of the Scheme in their respective countries. 
The recommendations of the Group include those relating to preparation of a comprehensive 
information brochure by each member country giving details of their offers under the scheme, 
expediting dissemination of such information and sending in applications within specified 
time-frames as well as improving the terms and conditions of the offers to make them more
