<p align=center><em>The Kathmandu Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of the member countries 
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on November 4, 1987.</em></p>
<p align=left><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>1.The President of Bangladesh, the King of Bhutan, the Prime Minister of India, the President of 
Maldives, the King of Nepal, the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the President of Sri Lanka 
assembled for the Third Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC) in Kathmandu on 2-4 November, 1987.</p>
<p>2. The Heads of State or Government recalled with pleasure the launching of SAARC which 
marked the beginning of a new era of regional cooperation for the promotion of peace and 
progress, mutual trust and goodwill in South Asia and underlined the importance of annual meetings 
at their level, as a prime mover, in consolidating and accelerating the pace and process of overall 
social, economic and cultural development in the region. They renewed their commitment to the 
SAARC Charter. They reiterated their desire of promoting peace, stability, amity and progress in 
the region through strict adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter and 
Nonalignment, particularly respect for the principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, 
national independence, non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States 
and peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>3. The Heads of State or Government emphasized that a fundamental goal of SAARC was to 
promote the welfare of the peoples of South Asia and to provide them with the opportunity to live 
in dignity and realise their full potential. They were conscious of the formidable tasks ahead of 
eradicating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and unemployment and alleviation of environmental 
degradation facing South Asia today. They were convinced that the peoples and governments of 
South Asia could, acting in unison, surmount these challenges.</p>
<p>4. The Heads of State or Government expressed their faith in and commitment to the principles and 
purposes enshrined in the United Nation Charter. They further believed that the United Nations has 
an important role to play in promoting universal trust, understanding and concerted actions for the 
attainment of lasting peace, global development and general disarmament. They reiterated their 
concern at the crisis facing the United Nations. They expressed their commitment to the multilateral 
negotiating process and called upon all states to help strengthen the UN system. They reaffirmed 
their belief that SAARC will reinforce this process by promoting South Asian cooperation.</p>
<p>5. The Heads of State or Government also reaffirmed their deep commitment to the principles and 
objectives of the Non-Aligned Movement. They underscored the validity of its philosophy and the 
historic role the Movement has been playing and continues to play in strengthening world peace and 
harmony as well as in promoting development with justice and equity. They also noted that 
institutionalization and strengthening of regional cooperation in South Asia had further nurtured the 
spirit of South-South cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, equity and common benefit. They 
expressed satisfaction over the result of the Ministerial Conference on Nonaligned Countries held in 
Pyongyang in June 1987 and urged the Non-aligned and other developing countries to take action 
to implement effectively the Pyongyang Declaration and Plan of Action on South-South 
Cooperation.</p>
<p>6. The Heads of State or Government recognised that the external environment had a critical 
bearing on the development of the economies of the South Asian Region. They noted with deep 
concern that growth in the world economy had again slowed down with adverse consequences for 
South Asia and other developing countries, especially for the least developed and landlocked 
countries. They observed that equitable participation of the developing countries in international 
trading and economic systems and in arrangements for the coordination of global macro economic 
policies was essential for enhancing prospects and performance of the world economy.</p>
<p>7. The South Asian leaders noted that the world economy had long suffered from a structural 
disequilibrium. The pace of global economic expansion had further slowed down. The downward 
trend in commodity prices had continued. The net export earnings had fallen aggravating payment 
imbalances in developing countries. The terms of trade had further deteriorated with enormous 
losses to developing countries. At the same time, the diminishing financial flows to developing 
countries remained unchanged with contraction in new lendings and growing burden of debt 
servicing. In fact there had been a reverse flow of resources from developing to developed 
countries. The trade conflicts had also sharpened with the rise of protectionism thus further 
weakening the international trading system and eroding the principle of special and differential 
treatment in favour of developing countries.</p>
<p>8. The Heads of State or Government reiterated the urgent need for resumption of North-South 
Dialogue with a view to promoting coordinated actions by developed and developing countries to 
channel trade surpluses for development, revive growth in flagging economies, overcome debt 
difficulties, expand export access to the developing countries and stabilise commodity prices, 
regulate capital flows and exchange rates more closely, and provide emergency relief and 
assistance to the poorest countries. They called for an early convening of the International 
Conference on Money and Finance for Development. They also stressed the need for preserving 
and liberalizing the multilateral trading system with renewed efforts both within and outside the 
GATT Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. They also underscored the importance 
of the developed countries fully respecting the commitments made in Punta del Este on &quot;standstill 
and rollback&quot; and called for the early and effective implementation of this commitment. The Heads 
of State or Government also reviewed the outcome of UNCTAD VII. They hoped that UNCTAD 
would play an increasingly effective role in promoting harmonious and equitable international 
economic relations.</p>
<p>9. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed the need for special measures in favour of the 
least developed countries in order to strengthen their resource capabilities and structural 
transformation and urged the international community, in the light of recent decisions at UNCTAD 
VII, to speed-up tangible assistance including increased resource flows to these countries within the 
framework of the Substantial New Program of Action (SNPA) for the Least Developed Countries 
for 1980s.</p>
<p>10. The Heads of State or Government expressed concern at the deteriorating international political 
environment which was due to great power policies and practices of domination and intervention as 
well as the increased resort to threat or use of force, aggression, occupation, pressure, economic 
coercion and interference in violation of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United 
Nations. These destabilising measures were creating a climate detrimental to the policies of peace, 
goodwill, stability, prosperity and respect for each other.</p>
<p>11. The Heads of State or Government believed that the escalation in military expenditure was a 
major constraint on world development. In this regard they noted that the UN Conference on 
Disarmament and Development had clearly established a link between disarmament and 
development and had provided a valuable frame work for future action in this vital area.</p>
<p>12. They welcomed the understanding reached between the United States and the Soviet Union on 
Intermediate Nuclear Forces. This should be a precursor of further accords between them to 
reduce drastically their strategic nuclear missiles and to refrain from extending the arms race to 
Outer Space. They called for the early conclusion in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament of a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and a Convention to Ban Chemical Weapons. They declared their 
intention to continue their efforts to contribute to the realisation of the objective of halting the 
nuclear arms race and eliminating nuclear weapons. They declared their resolve to support every 
effort to conclude a treaty prohibiting vertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>13. The Heads of State or Government expressed their deep concern at the fast and continuing 
degradation of the environment, including extensive destruction of forests, in the South Asian 
region. They also noted that South Asia was afflicted with such natural disasters as floods, 
droughts, landslides, cyclones, tidal waves which have had a particularly severe impact recently, 
causing immense human suffering. At the same time they expressed concern over the danger posed 
by the global sea level rise and its effects on South Asian countries. These natural disasters and the 
degradation of the environment were severely undermining the development process and prospects 
of the member countries. They, therefore, decided to intensify regional cooperation with a view to 
strengthening their disaster management capabilities. They also decided to commission a study for 
the protection and preservation of the environment and to the causes and consequences of natural 
disasters in a well-planned comprehensive framework. They entrusted the Secretary-General with 
this task.</p>
<p>14. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their conviction that the region being most 
populous in the world and having age-old socio-cultural links, rich and varied human and natural 
resources, offered immense scope and potential for regional cooperation and that the growing 
interaction among its people had added stimulus towards this end. They reiterated their 
determination to pursue their individual and collective efforts for the optimal utilisation of the vast 
human and untapped natural and other material resources.</p>
<p>15. The Heads of State or Government reviewed with satisfaction the progress made so far in the 
implementation of the SAARC Integrated Programme of Action and emphasised the need to 
further consolidate and streamline the process. They were conscious of the need to exercise greater 
discretion in the selection of activities in different sectors. They took note of the criteria and 
procedures relating to administrative structuring and financing of regional institutions endorsed by 
the SAARC Council of Ministers. They directed that the establishment of such regional institutions 
should proceed only after taking into account their viability and benefits to the member countries 
with due consideration to economy and efficiency.</p>
<p>16. The Heads of State or Government expressed satisfaction at the launching of the SAARC 
Audio Visual Exchange programme coinciding with the opening of the Third SAARC Summit in 
Kathmandu. While taking note of the dates for the institution of the SAARC Chairs, Fellowships 
and Scholarships and the commencement of Organised Tourism among SAARC member 
countries, they directed that the schemes for the SAARC Documentation Centre and the SAARC 
Youth Volunteer Programme be implemented at the earliest.</p>
<p>17. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction the signing of the Agreement 
establishing a South Asian Food Security Reserve and expressed confidence that this will provide a 
much-needed cushion against food shortages and scarcity situations in the region.</p>
<p>18. The Heads of State or Government expressed happiness at the signing of the SAARC Regional 
Convention on Suppression of Terrorism and considered it a historic step towards the prevention 
and elimination of terrorism from the region. In this regard, they also reiterated their unequivocal 
condemnation of all acts, methods and practice of terrorism as criminal and expressed their 
abhorrence of their impact on life and property, socio-economic development, political stability, 
regional peace and cooperation.</p>
<p>19. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their agreement to expand SAARC activities in 
other concrete areas of cooperation in order to ensure more tangible benefits from SAARC to the 
peoples of the region. They were convinced that regional cooperation could be consolidated and 
expanded on the basis of growing regional complementarities and inter dependence. They believed 
that the SAARC long-term perspective should, therefore, focus on measures to expand and 
strengthen such areas of regional complementarities and interdependence not only through 
formulation and implementation of more concrete and action-oriented programmes but also through 
coordination of national policies and approaches for finding common solutions to their common 
problems.</p>
<p>20. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the first annual review of the Situation of 
Children in the SAARC member countries. They reiterated their commitment made in the 
Bangalore Declaration to accord highest priority to the needs of children in national development 
planning and emphasised that more intensified action should be taken for the welfare and well-being 
of children. They further reiterated their call for an early conclusion and adoption of a United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>21. The Heads of State or Government expressed their satisfaction at the establishment of the 
SAARC Secretariat in Kathmandu, strengthening further the process of regional cooperation in 
South Asia. They expressed their gratitude to His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev for 
most graciously inaugurating the SAARC Secretariat.</p>
<p>22. The Heads of State or Government were conscious of the aspirations of the peoples of South 
Asia to communicate and cooperate with each other at the people-to-people level. They 
recognised that academics, researchers, non-governmental organizations and others have an 
important role to play in promoting the SAARC spirit and giving impetus to regional programmes 
and projects. They further observed that the interest and enthusiasm so far demonstrated by the 
increased interactions and exchange of information at the inter-governmental level should be 
capitalised and translated into tangible programmes and projects. They recognised the vast 
potential for the generation of friendship, goodwill and trust through interactions between the 
peoples which would foster harmonious relations in South Asia.</p>
<p>23. The Heads of State or Government expressed their deep conviction that the Kathmandu 
Summit has further consolidated the gains of SAARC and given a renewed thrust and direction to 
the future course of regional cooperation. They were also convinced that the Kathmandu Summit 
has helped to create an atmosphere conducive to strengthening this process, besides generating 
further goodwill and friendship among the member countries in the larger interest of the region.</p>
<p>24. The Heads of State or Government were conscious that SAARC should be increasingly 
oriented to the people's needs and aspirations so that the masses of the region could be drawn to a 
greater extent into the mainstream of SAARC activities. This, they firmly held, would help bring 
about a qualitative improvement in the general atmosphere of the region contributing to peace, 
friendship and cooperation in the areas.</p>
<p>25. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their firm commitment to the spirit and objectives 
with which the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation was launched and reaffirmed 
their determination to work, individually and collectively, towards the attainment of these 
objectives.</p>
<p>26. The Heads of State or Government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka were deeply appreciative of the exemplary manner in which His Majesty the King of Nepal 
discharged his responsibilities as Chairman of the Meeting. They expressed their profound gratitude 
for the warm and gracious hospitality extended to them by His Majesty's Government and the 
people of Nepal and for the excellent arrangements made for the Meeting.</p>
