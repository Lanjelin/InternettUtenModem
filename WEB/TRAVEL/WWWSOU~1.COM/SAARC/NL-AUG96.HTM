<p>SAARC Ministers adopt &quot;Rawalpindi Resolution on Children of South Asia&quot;WELFARE of the 
Children of South Asia has always been high in the SAARC Agenda. Successive summits have 
re-iterated the commitment of SAARC leaders to address issues relating to children. The Third 
SAARC Ministerial Conference on Children of South Asia was held in Rawalpindi on 20-22 
August, 1996 to give further impetus to the efforts of member countries and to undertake a mid 
term review of the World Summit Declaration on Children.</p>
<p>The &quot;Rawalpindi Resolution on Children of South Asia&quot; adopted at the conclusion of the 
Conference takes into account the implementation of earlier decisions as well as mid-decade goals 
contained in the National Plans of Action drawn up within the overall framework of the World 
Summit Declaration on Children. It takes full cognizance of the pioneering work of SAARC 
focusing on the needs and initiation of a series of organized steps in the area of child development. 
It stresses on the urgency to achieve the goals for children and women through greater commitment 
of resources and through increased partnership between the Government and Communities. </p>
<p>CHILDREN: Prime Minister of Pakistan, SAARC Secretary-General and other participants during 
the children's performance at the Conference. The Resolution embodies a Vision Beyond The Year 
2000 and the Ministers have recommended through the resolution that the years 2001-2010 be 
declared as the &quot;SAARC Decade of the Rights of the Child&quot;. The Rawalpindi Resolution reflects 
SAARC's common resolve to build a secure future for the children of South Asia.Prime Minister 
Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto while inaugurating the three-day Conference highlighted the need for 
sustained support from all member states to fulfill the dream of nurturing children in a secure and 
happy environment.</p>
<p>Moving from promise to performance, South Asian countries must implement the commitments 
already made, in order to decrease the 50 million child deaths predicted over the next decade, 
attain economic solvency, end gender discrimination, and fight the spread of epidemics, she said. 
The Prime Minister identified issues such as gender equality, right of the girl child, rights of the 
children especially in difficult circumstances and education for the children as priority areas which 
require strengthening of regional efforts. As a future strategy for the region, she called for realistic 
examination of new emerging issues like child labour and trafficking of children with the objective to 
solving them. </p>

world they should inherit, she said.The Conference was formally opened by SAARC
