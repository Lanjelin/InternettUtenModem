<p align=left><font size=3><em>The MALE Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of the Member Countries 
of</em></font><em>Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on 23rd November, 1990.</em></p>
<p align=left>1.The President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, His Excellency Mr. Hussain Muhammad 
Ershad, the King of Bhutan, His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the Prime Minister of the 
Republic of India, His Excellency Mr. Chandra Shekhar, the President of the Republic of Maldives, 
His Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the Prime Minister of Nepal, The Right Honourable 
Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, His Excellency 
Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and the Prime Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri 
Lanka, His Excellency Mr. Dingiri Banda Wijetunga met at the Fifth Summit of the South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation at Male' on 2123 November, 1990.</p>
<p align=left>2. The Heads of State or Government reiterated that cooperation among the countries of South 
Asia was necessary for improving the quality of life of the peoples of the region. They recalled their 
conviction that the objectives of peace and stability in South Asia could be best served by fostering 
mutual understanding, cooperation and good neighbourly relations. They reaffirmed their 
commitment to the purposes and principles of the South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation and renewed their resolve to intensify cooperation under its aegis in pursuit of their 
common objectives. </p>
<p align=left>3. The Heads of State or Government stressed their desire to promote peace, stability, amity and 
progress in the region through strict adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter and 
the Nonaligned Movement, particularly respect for the principles of sovereign equality, territorial 
integrity, national independence, nonuse of force, noninterference in the internal affairs of other 
States and peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p align=left>4. The Heads of State or Government expressed satisfaction that the launching of SAARC in 1985 
and the initiatives under the Integrated Programme of Action for strengthening regional cooperation 
in South Asia had generated much enthusiasm and hope in their peoples, and that the South Asian 
consciousness necessary for the success of regional cooperation was gradually permeating the 
region. They reiterated their resolve to make optimal use of the positive forces of goodwill, trust 
and understanding existing among their peoples and to turn SAARC into a dynamic instrument for 
achieving its objectives and creating an order based on mutual respect, equity, cooperation and 
shared benefits.</p>
<p align=left>5. The Heads of State or Government reviewed the status of children in South Asia and noted that 
the recent World Summit for Children had imparted a new impetus to the ongoing efforts in this 
field. They believed that relevant recommendations of the World Summit could be usefully 
incorporated into a Plan of Action in the South Asian context and its implementation should be 
reviewed annually. The guidelines for such Plan of Action could be prepared by a panel of experts 
to be appointed by the SecretaryGeneral and examined by the Technical Committee on Health and 
Population Activities. They also welcomed the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and its entry into force. They expressed the hope that those Member States, who have not 
already become party to the Convention, would do so at an early date.</p>
<p align=left>6. The Heads of State or Government endorsed the recommendations made by the Second 
SAARC Ministerial Meeting on Women in Development held in Islamabad in June 1990. They 
noted with satisfaction the enthusiastic response in all Member States to their collective call for the 
observance of 1990 as the &quot;SAARC Year of the Girl Child&quot;. They decided that in order to maintain 
focus on the problems of the Girl Child, the years 19912000 AD should be observed as the 
&quot;SAARC Decade of the Girl Child&quot;. </p>
<p align=left>7. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction the growing regional cooperation in 
combating the problems of drug trafficking and drug abuse. They expressed serious concern over 
the growing linkages between drug trafficking and international arms trade and terrorist activities. 
They agreed that observance of 1989 as the &quot;SAARC Year for Combating Drug Abuse and Drug 
Trafficking&quot; had had a profound impact in drawing attention to the menace and to the need for its 
elimination. They expressed satisfaction that following the decision of the Fourth SAARC Summit, 
the SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances had been signed at 
Male'. They urged the Member States to take early measures to ratify the convention for its entry 
into force. They were convinced that the Convention would help in making SAARC efforts in this 
area more effective.</p>
<p align=left>8. They endorsed the decision of the Council of Ministers in regard to the timeframe for completion 
of the Regional Study on the Causes and Consequences of Natural Disasters and the Protection 
and Preservation of the Environment. They noted with satisfaction that the methodology for 
undertaking the Study on the `Greenhouse Effect' and its impact on the region was likely to be 
finalized in the near future and desired that the Study itself be completed for consideration at the 
Sixth Summit. In this context, they noted that the destruction of rainforests, the world over, was 
contributing significantly to adverse climatic changes and this aspect should also be covered in the 
proposed Study. They expressed the hope that these Studies would lead to an action plan for 
meaningful cooperation in the field of Environment and Disaster Management.</p>
<p align=left>9. Recognizing that environment had emerged as a major global concern, the Heads of State or 
Government noted with alarm the unprecedented climatic changes predicted by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They urged the international community to 
mobilize additional finances and to make available appropriate technologies to enable the 
developing countries to face the new challenges arising from climate changes and sealevel rise. They 
agreed that Member Countries should coordinate their positions at international fora on this issue. 
They also decided to observe 1992 as the &quot;SAARC Year of Environment&quot;.</p>
<p align=left>10. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that the national studies on Trade, 
Manufactures and Services had been completed. They underlined the need for expeditious action 
for completing the Regional Study within the timeframe stipulated by the Council of Ministers. They 
expressed the hope that it would open new avenues of cooperation for the prosperity of the 
peoples of the region. </p>
<p align=left>11. The Heads of State or Government approved the recommendations of the Council of Ministers 
regarding Special SAARC Travel Document and decided to launch the scheme.</p>
<p align=left>12. The Heads of State or Government expressed concern that Member States were compelled to 
divert their scarce resources in combating terrorism. They called for expeditious enactment of 
enabling measures for the implementation of the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of 
Terrorism. They also urged Member States to continue to cooperate in accordance with the 
Convention. </p>
<p align=left>13. The Heads of State or Government noted that as their countries stood on the threshold of the 
next millennium, the world was undergoing profound transformations characterised by popular 
upsurge for democracy, liberty and exercise of human rights, lowering of ideological barriers and 
the relaxation of global tensions and progress towards disarmament and the resolution of a number 
of regional and global conflicts. There was also a welcome trend towards the opening up of the 
global economy and integration of national economies into the mainstream of the world economy. 
They further noted the trend of increasing integration of the pattern of global production, 
consumption and trade, growing multipolarity of the world economic structure and integration of the 
markets of the developed countries in order to maintain their technological lead and competitive 
edge. These changes presented new challenges and opened up new opportunities to the South 
Asian countries, as to the rest of the developing world. The Heads of State or Government were 
convinced that their mutual cooperation can be a critical factor in enabling them to pursue these 
objectives more effectively. </p>
<p align=left>14. The Heads of State or Government, noting the vital importance of biotechnology for the 
longterm food security of developing countries as well as for medicinal purposes, decided that 
cooperation should be extended to this field and, in particular, to the exchange of expertise in 
genetic conservation and maintenance of germplasm banks. In this connection, they welcomed 
India's offer of training facilities and agreed that cooperation in the cataloguing of genetic resources 
stored in different SAARC countries would be mutually beneficial. Taking note of the proposal 
made by the Group of Fifteen Developing Countries (G15) for the establishment of a gene bank for 
developing countries, they agreed to participate in this venture.</p>
<p align=left>15. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the idea of setting up of a Fund for regional 
projects which could make available credit on easy terms for the identification and development of 
regional projects. They agreed that representatives of the national development banks of the 
Member Countries should get together to work out the precise modalities for the source of funds 
and the manner in which these could be related to joint venture projects. They accepted India's 
offer to host this meeting. </p>
<p align=left>16. The Heads of State or Government regarded the recent developments in the Gulf as the most 
unfortunate aberration from the present trend of detente, cooperation and peaceful settlement of 
disputes. They reaffirmed their adherence to UN Security Council Resolutions on this issue. While 
emphasizing the need for a peaceful solution of the issue, they called for immediate and 
unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of its legitimate 
Government. They stated that the Gulf crisis had dealt a severe blow to their economies. They 
needed massive international assistance to compensate the loss suffered by them due to a sharp 
decline in remittances, setback to their exports and severe strain on their balance of payments 
position imposed by increased oil prices. They recognized the potentiality of cooperation among 
themselves for mitigating the impact of these adverse consequences.</p>
<p align=left>17. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that the initiative of the Government 
of the Maldives for the Protection and Security of Small States at the UN in 1989, which they all 
supported, had also received overwhelming support of the international community. They agreed 
that, because of their particular problems, small states merited special measures of support in 
safeguarding their independence and territorial integrity. </p>
<p align=left>18. The Heads of State or Government expressed the hope that the talks between the two Super 
Powers on arms control would culminate in the conclusion of an agreement for substantial reduction 
in their nuclear arsenals leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. While welcoming the 
measures being considered for arms reduction at the global level, they were convinced that the 
objective could be best achieved through the promotion of mutual trust and confidence among the 
Member States. They underlined the inherent relationship between disarmament and development 
and called upon all countries, especially those possessing the largest nuclear and conventional 
arsenals, to rechannel additional financial resources, human energy and creativity into development. 
They expressed their support for the banning of chemical weapons and early conclusion of a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In this context, they welcomed the convening of the UN 
Conference in January 1991 to consider amendments to the Partial Test Ban Treaty to convert it 
into a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. </p>
<p align=left>19. The Heads of State or Government expressed concern that the international economic 
environment for the developing countries had been characterised by negative resource flows, high 
trade barriers, serious external debt problems and high interest rates. The need of SAARC 
countries for increased concessional resources and technology as well as access to markets for 
their exports could not, therefore, be under estimated. They called for collective efforts based on 
mutuality of interest and felt that regular NorthSouth consultations were essential for ensuring 
equitable management of global interdependence.</p>
<p align=left>20. The Heads of State or Government recalled the usefulness of the First Ministerial Meeting on 
International Economic Issues held in Islamabad in 1986. They agreed that the second such 
Ministerial Meeting be held in India in 1991 to review the outcome of the Uruguay Round and to 
coordinate positions at international conferences including the U.N. Conference on Environment 
and Development, 1992.</p>
<p align=left>21. Notwithstanding the continuing efforts on the international economic plane, the Heads of State 
or Government emphasised the pressing need for the Ministerial Meeting to address itself 
vigorously to the objective of selfreliance. They directed the Ministers to prepare a strategy for 
mobilising regional resources which would encourage and strengthen individual and collective self 
reliance in the region.</p>
<p align=left>22. The Heads of State or Government expressed their support for the Paris Declaration (1990) 
and the Programme of Action adopted by the Second United Nations Conference on the Least 
Developed Countries. They called upon the international community to contribute to the successful 
implementation of the Programme of Action which is of special importance for the socioeconomic 
development of the region.</p>
<p align=left>23. The Heads of State or Government recognized the imperative need for providing a better 
habitat to the peoples of South Asia through optimum utilization of indigenous technology, 
knowhow and material, and decided that 1991 be observed as the &quot;SAARC Year of Shelter&quot;.</p>
<p align=left>24. The Heads of State or Government noted that millions of disabled persons lived in the SAARC 
region and immediate action was required to reduce their sufferings and to improve their quality of 
life. They decided to observe 1993 as the &quot;SAARC Year of Disabled Persons&quot;.</p>
<p align=left>25. The Heads of State or Government were particularly happy that the Fifth SAARC Summit 
coincided with the Twenty Fifth Anniversary of the Independence of the Maldives which provided 
them with the opportunity to express their solidarity with the people and the Government of the 
Maldives. They expressed their conviction that the Male' Summit had helped in consolidating the 
gains of regional cooperation and in strengthening the institutional base of SAARC.</p>
<p align=left>26. The Heads of State or Government gratefully accepted the offer of the Government of Sri 
Lanka to host the Sixth SAARC Summit in 1991.</p>
<p align=left>27. The Heads of State or Government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka expressed their deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which the President of the 
Maldives had discharged his responsibilities as Chairman of the Meeting. They expressed their 
profound gratitude for the warm and gracious hospitality extended to them by the Government and 
the people of the Maldives and for the excellent arrangements made for the Meeting. </p>

<p align=left>15. The Heads of State or Government emphasized the importance of regular exchange of views
