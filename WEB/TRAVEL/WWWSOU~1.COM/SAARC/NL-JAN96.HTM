<p><b>POVERTY ERADICATION</b> <br>
The Second Meeting of the Finance and Planning Ministers of SAARC member states was held in 
New Delhi on 3-4 January 1996 to review the progress achieved in eradicating poverty in South 
Asia. Minister of External Affairs, Pranab Mukherjee chaired the meeting, which was opened by 
SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan who also delivered a statement at the inaugural 
session. All member states participated in the meeting. </p>
<p>The discussions focused on the impact and serious consequences of widespread incidence of 
poverty in the SAARC countries. The member states stressed their firm resolve to carry forward 
their efforts in the key areas by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) appropriately prioritising their development efforts in order to have the 
maximum possible impact on poverty eradication; <br>
(b) undertaking special poverty eradication programmes taking all policy 
imperatives into account; <br>
(c) improving the institutional environment and resource availability for the 
attainment of the goals relating to sustained growth in income and employment 
generation and poverty eradication; and <br>
(d) developing strategies for greater social mobilisation and community 
participation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meeting also emphasised that intensified regional cooperation would contribute significantly to 
poverty eradication in the region. In this context, it welcomed the operationalisation of SAPTA and 
stressed the need for concerted efforts to expand areas of economic cooperation in the SAARC 
region. </p>
<p>Other issues discussed during the meeting included the role of NGOs in the evolution of poverty 
eradication programmes. It reiterated that steps be taken to bring about a closer interface between 
Government agencies, NGOs and community organizations engaged in poverty eradication so as to 
bring about convergence in actions at all levels, particularly at the grass-root level. </p>
<p>The report adopted at the end of the meeting noted that acute deprivation among significant 
segments of the peoples of the SAARC countries constituted a major challenge. It underscored the 
need to sustain actions already initiated by the member states at the national level to eradicate 
poverty by the target date of 2002 AD. </p>
<p>The Ministers, in their report, recommended that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) while the meeting of the first two-tiers may continue to be held annually as 
stipulated by the Eighth SAARC Summit, a flexible approach may be adopted on 
the timing/periodicity of the meeting of the third-tier comprising of the Ministers of 
Finance and Planning of SAARC countries; <br>
(b) member states would designate appropriate Nodal Agencies for the 
establishment of networking arrangements in order to regularly exchange 
information and share experience on poverty eradication;<br>
(c) member states would forward to the SAARC Secretariat annual reports 
highlighting the progress made by them in the area of poverty eradication for 
dissemination in a consolidated form to all member states; and <br>
(d) the relevant SAARC Technical Committees would take up, with sharper focus 
the issue of poverty eradication in its broadest sense in order to intensify actions in 
the areas falling under their purview. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left>The report affirmed the commitment of member states to address the child labour issue in some of 
the SAARC countries through evolving a holistic approach towards poverty eradication in which 
the problem of child labour would receive appropriate attention. </p>

<p><b>MEETING OF COMMERCE MINISTERS OF</b> <br>
<b>SAARC MEMBER STATES</b> <br>
The First Meeting of Commerce Ministers of SAARC member states was held in New Delhi on 
8-9 January 1996 to provide greater impetus to intra-SAARC trade under the Agreement on 
SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) and to promote economic cooperation in the 
region. The meeting was inaugurated by the current Chairman of SAARC, Prime Minister of India, 
P.V. Narasimha Rao. In his inaugural address, the Prime Minister of India emphasised the 
importance of enhancing substantially regional trade and economic cooperation so as to increase 
the bargaining strength of the SAARC region in the post-Uruguay Round scenario. The meeting, 
attended by all member states, was chaired by Minister of State for Commerce of India and leader 
of the Indian delegation P. Chidambaram. He urged SAARC member states to consider the 
possibility of adopting a &quot;negative list&quot; approach in the matter of extending tariff and non-tariff 
preferences to each other. </p>
<p>SAARC Secretary General, Naeem U. Hasan, in his statement at the Inaugural Session, presented 
a resume of SAARC's initiatives and ongoing activities in the field of trade and economic 
cooperation among the member states. Directors Ashok K. Attri and Tahir Iqbal Butt also 
participated in the meeting. </p>
<p>The Commerce Ministers and leaders of delegations welcomed the operationalisation of SAPTA, 
effective from 7 December 1995, which coincided with the completion of the first decade of 
SAARC. They reiterated their commitment to accelerating the SAPTA process including the full 
implementation of all the provisions of the SAPTA Agreement and to the realisation of South Asian 
Free Trade Area (SAFTA) as the goal preferably by the year 2000 but not later than 2005. </p>
<p>They welcomed the convening of the Inter-Governmental Group (IGG) on Trade Liberalisation, 
and its first meeting on 14-15 March 1996 in Sri Lanka, which would initiate the second round of 
trade negotiations. They agreed that the second round should consider removal of non-tariff and 
trade control barriers so that trade in items of export interest of the member countries receives the 
desired impetus. They further agreed that IGG would also carry out their negotiations for extending 
the tariff concessions so as to make them wider, deeper and more meaningful. The meeting decided 
that the process of the second round of Negotiations should be concluded before 31 July 1996. </p>
<p>The Commerce Ministers and leaders of delegations also agreed that businessmen should be issued 
multiple entry visas on application. </p>
<p>They underlined the importance of exchange of information and simplification, harmonisation and 
streamlining of customs and related procedures and decided that meetings of Customs 
Administrations of the SAARC countries should be held once every six months in order to achieve 
rapid progress in the initial stage. They welcomed the offer of Pakistan to host the second meeting. </p>
<p>The meeting also discussed development of business information network, promotion of a SAARC 
Arbitration Board, and other issues like public bulk purchases and transport and transit 
improvement. </p>
<p>The Commerce Ministers decided to meet on an annual basis for regular consultations in order to 
meet the target set for achieving South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and to pursue the various 
other economic cooperation measures. </p>

<p><b>INDIA HOSTS THE FIRST SAARC TRADE FAIR</b> <br>

&quot;Cooperation for Growth&quot;. The Fair, organised as a part of the commemoration of the first decade

member states. Various engineering goods, gems &amp; jewellery, leather goods and footwear,

display and sale. Food Festival, Film Festival, Cultural and Music Programmes from various 
SAARC member countries were other attractions at the SAARC Trade Fair. </p>

for economic development. It provided a befitting venue for the representatives of the business and 
industry of the SAARC member countries to discuss various issues connected with promotion and 
expansion of intra-SAARC trade. </p>

interactive meeting with a cross-section of the SAARC business community organised by the 
SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) in collaboration with the Federation of 
Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). They felt that such interaction with their 
business communities, who were the essential medium for their trade growth, was extremely useful 
in promoting their shared objectives. </p>
<p>The Fair was organised by India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), New Delhi in association 
with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry on behalf of SCCI and was 
sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce of India. The Second SAARC Trade Fair would be held
