<p align=left>&#160;<b>SECOND ROUND OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER SAPTA BEGINS</b> <br>
The Second Round of Trade Negotiations under SAPTA was launched in Sri Lanka by the 
Meeting of Inter-Governmental Group on Trade Liberalisation held in Colombo on March 14-15, 
1996. The Meeting was held under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Internal and External 
Trade, Commerce and Food of Sri Lanka, N.V.K.K. Weragoda. All Member States participated 
in the Meeting and held bilateral/multilateral trade negotiations for expanding the lists of products 
and deepening the tariff cuts under SAPTA. The SAARC Secretariat was represented by Director, 
Ashok K. Attri. </p>
<p>The President of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga sent a message to the Meeting 
in which she reiterated Sri Lanka's commitment to implement all components of SAPTA for timely 
launching of South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). The Meeting was inaugurated by Kingsley T. 
Wickramaratne, Minister of Internal and External Trade, Commerce and Food of Sri Lanka. In the 
Inaugural Session, Ashok K. Attri, Director, SAARC Secretariat outlined the background and 
mandate of the meeting. </p>
<p>The Inter-Governmental Group held in-depth discussion on modalities for conducting trade 
negotiations including various approaches like product-by-product basis, across the board tariff 
reductions, tariff reduction on sectoral basis and by adopting direct trade measures. The Group 
decided to conduct trade negotiations by adopting a combination of these approaches, without 
precluding the product-by-product approach. The Group also agreed on the need of fast-track 
approach for negotiations to conclude the Second Round of Trade Negotiations by July 31, 1996. 
The Meeting further agreed that all attempts should be made to realise SAFTA by the year 2000 
A.D. </p>
<p>Sri Lanka proposed that all businessmen in the region should be given SAARC Visa Exemption 
stickers for free mobility within the region and informed that in Sri Lanka no restriction are 
applicable on visits of businessmen from the region. It was also recommended that a special 
meeting of the Group should be held to examine broad spectrum of trade facilitation measures such 
as transport, professional and financial services, port, shipping, air transport etc. </p>
<p>The Group felt that the SAARC Secretariat should continue to procure latest trade publications and 
computerised trade databases available on CD-ROMs developed by UN organisations like World 
Bank, IMF, ESCAP etc. to disseminate information from the same to the concerned economic 
researchers etc. and to assist IGG by providing latest possible information. The Group also felt that 
on-line information service &quot;SAARCNet&quot; of SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) 
should also be available in the Secretariat for the purpose of promotion of foreign trade of SAARC 
Member Countries. </p>
<p>Bearing in mind the economic conditions of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the SAARC 
region, the Meeting also decided to keep a day earmarked in the next IGG Meeting, to be held in 
June 1996, for discussion on LDCs. </p>

following its approval by the Council of Ministers. The overall responsibility of coordination in
