<p>South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) completed ten years of its existence 
on 8 December 1995. To mark its first decade, member countries organised various activities and 
programmes at the regional as well as national level. The SAARC Secretariat at Kathmandu also 
organised special programmes to mark the occasion. </p>
<p>The highlight of these activities was the Special Commemorative Session of the SAARC Council of 
Ministers held in New Delhi on 18 December 1995, at which the Ministers focused on the theme 
<strong>&#147;SAARC - Vision for the Second Decade&#148;.</strong> The then Prime Minister of India and Chairman of 
SAARC, P V Narasimha Rao inaugurated the session. In his inaugural address, Mr. Rao stressed 
the need to consolidate the gains of SAARC during the first decade and further strengthen 
interaction among member states to realise the full potential of their cooperation during the next ten 
years. </p>
<p>The Foreign Ministers in their statements recalled the significant achievements made during the first 
decade and acknowledged that SAARC has evolved into a viable institution. They agreed that a 
landmark of economic cooperation has been the operationalisation of SAARC Preferential Trading 
Arrangement (SAPTA), and hoped that it would eventually lead to the realization of a South Asian 
Free Trade Area (SAFTA). The Ministers also reiterated their commitment to the eradication of 
poverty by placing the people at the centre of all development efforts. They felt that during the 
second decade, SAARC should consolidate the achievements of the past and build on them to 
achieve further progress in economic integration, poverty eradication and people-to-people 
contacts in the region. In their vision for the second decade, the Ministers emphasized on the need 
to harness the resources of the region in economic and social sectors. The Ministers planted trees 
at the Rajiv Smriti Van, New Delhi during the Commemorative Session. </p>
