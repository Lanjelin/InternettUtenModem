<p align=center><font size=4><b>I. SAARC : the First Decade</b> </font></p>
<p>The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, 
India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be 10 years old in December 1995. As the 
Association marks its first decade, it is time for us to take stock of regional cooperation in South 
Asia, ten years after the beginning of the SAARC process. It is equally relevant at this point to 
extend our vision to the future and see how the decade old process of institutionalised regional 
cooperation in South Asia could be made more dynamic and attuned to the hopes and aspirations, 
as well as needs of our people. </p>
<p>The process of establishing regional cooperation in South Asia initiated in May 1980 was by itself a 
watershed of great significance. Extreme caution characterised all efforts undertaken to translate 
into reality the first few steps in this general direction. It was decided, right at the beginning, that the 
foundation of the new edifice would be laid in a phased step-by-step manner. Given the existing 
realities of the South Asian power structure, this was the most pragmatic thing to do. It is true that 
the peoples of South Asia share common values, embedded in their shared historical, cultural and 
linguistic heritage. But it is equally true that the geo-political realities and long prevailing atmosphere 
of distrust existing in the region, which long vitiated the atmosphere in South Asia, was not to 
disappear over night. There was an imperative need to build on the positive impulses of our region 
and promote confidence, setting aside points that divided member countries. The general provision 
in the SAARC Charter to exclude bilateral and contentious issues from the deliberations of the 
organisation and the principle of unanimity in decision making should be seen in the light of these 
realities. </p>
<p>The first significant step in the evolution of regional cooperation in South Asia was the meeting of 
the Foreign Secretaries of the seven countries in Colombo in early 1981, which was followed 
subsequently by the Foreign Ministers meeting in New Delhi in 1983, where the Integrated 
Programme of Action (IPA) was formally launched, through the adoption of the Declaration on 
South Asian Regional Cooperation (SARC) . Two years later, on 8 December 1985, SAARC was 
born in Dhaka, with the signing of the Charter of the Association by the Heads of State or 
Government of member states during their first Summit. This was seen as a clear manifestation of 
the peoples of South Asia, to cooperate with each other in the search for solutions to their common 
problems. </p>
<p>As cooperation within the SAARC framework took concrete shape, with a definite purpose, a 
number of key decisions were taken. The institutional framework of the organisation was thus 
outlined giving regional cooperation an institutional shape. Cooperation was formalised within a 
four-tier structure and a permanent Secretariat was established. From the early days, the Heads of 
State or Government remained the highest authority of SAARC activities at the top, followed by 
the Council of Ministers, the Standing Committee, and the Technical Committees, each body 
meeting at least once a year, barring a few exceptions. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the annual Summits provide a unique opportunity for imparting necessary impetus to 
the process of regional cooperation at the highest level, in addition to holding bilateral consultations 
among the leaders. The latter has often proved a useful means of easing tension between member 
countries on many critical occasions during the last one decade. During this period, SAARC has 
emerged as a major instrument in facilitating interaction among member counties on a wide range of 
issues of common concern to the member counties. It has, in the process, been able to reduce the 
critical knowledge gap which separated our countries. The value of this is not easily perceived, but 
it will perhaps not be an exaggeration to say that countries in South Asia would have been worse 
off without SAARC. </p>
<p>The appeal and the continued relevance of SAARC stem, to a great extent from the fact that it has 
identified and prescribed in its Charter, as one of its primary objectives, the promotion of the 
welfare of the peoples of South Asia and improvement of their quality of life. Its relentless 
endeavour to make some progress in this regard remain as strong today as it was at the outset. 
Initially, SAARC had identified five areas for cooperation among the member countries. However, 
over the years, other core areas have been included as priority concerns within SAARC. These 
include such vital areas as poverty, environment, education, drug trafficking and drug abuse, 
terrorism, women, children, youth, etc. which have great significance for our teeming millions and 
their day-to-day problems, concerns and aspirations. </p>
<p>It has often been a point held out against SAARC that after its most encouraging launching a 
decade ago, SAARC activities have stagnated and have failed to promote cooperation in the core 
economic areas on any significant scale. However, on this account also, there are reasons to be 
optimistic. After a decade of cooperation, it is gratifying that even on this key concern, some useful 
ground has been broken. Significantly enough, the Sixth SAARC Summit in Colombo in 1991 
decided to establish a SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), which laid the 
foundation of cooperation in the vital area of trade.</p>
<p>The Agreement was subsequently signed in Dhaka in April 1993 during the Seventh SAARC 
Summit, which provides an umbrella framework of rules providing for step-by-step liberalization of 
intra-regional trade, and envisages periodic rounds of trade negotiations for exchange of trade 
concessions on tariff, para-tariff and non-tariff measures. SAPTA also contains provisions giving 
special and favourable treatment to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the SAARC region.</p>
<p>Provisions for safeguard action and balance of payments measures are also incorporated in the 
Agreement to protect the interest of member states during critical economic circumstances. The first 
consolidated schedules of concessions to be agreed upon under the Agreement have been finalized 
and approved, thus completing the first phase of trade negotiations among the member countries. 
The parallel process of ratifying the Agreement has been completed by member states and the 
agreement will come into effect on 7 December 1995. </p>
<p>The SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry established in 1993 with constituent units in all 
member states and its headquarters in Karachi, is also playing a dynamic role in the promotion of 
trade and economic cooperation through disseminating information about the content, scope and 
potential of SAPTA among the business community in the region. The completion of the first phase 
of trade negotiations with the identification of lists of concessions would perhaps have a limited 
impact in terms of substantive increase in the volume of trade among the member countries. This 
may very well be the beginning of a historic process, which will lead to further reinforcement of 
economic cooperation among member countries. </p>
<p>Following the Sixth and Seventh SAARC Summits, SAARC's attention has also been focused on 
the key concern of poverty alleviation. Eradication of poverty has been and remains the most 
formidable concern for the majority within SAARC countries. A staggering 400 million people in 
the region today, live under the poverty line, calling for immediate and urgent action. Happily, the 
SAARC process has provided member countries a unique forum to address this great challenge in 
a collective manner. The Sixth SAARC Summit at Colombo commissioned the Independent South 
Asian Commission on Poverty Alleviation to address the various aspects of this most formidable 
problem. </p>
<p>The report of the Commission was presented on the eve of the Seventh SAARC Summit and it 
agreed on a South Asian consensus on poverty eradication through this consensus. The SAARC 
leaders have committed to accord a high priority and pledged to overcome this challenge through 
the implementation of an Agenda of Action which would <i>inter-alia</i>, include a strategy of social 
mobilization, policy of decentralized agricultural and human development. The Leaders also agreed 
to follow-up on the subject through formulation, at the national level, of pro-poor plans to be 
harmonized with the open economy and structural adjustment strategies pursued by member 
countries. </p>
<p>As a follow-up to this commitment at the highest level, a three-tier mechanism has been established 
within the SAARC framework for the exchange of information on experiences of SAARC 
countries in poverty alleviation programmes.<br>
The three-tier consists of </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) Group of Secretaries concerned with poverty eradication and social 
development, <br>
(ii) Finance and Planning Secretaries, and <br>
(iii) Ministers of Finance and Planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to give further impetus to the issue of poverty eradication in the region, SAARC has 
designated 1995 as the &quot;SAARC Year of Poverty Eradication&quot;. The Plan of Action drawn up to 
mark the year include strategies such as setting up a high-level national institution in each member 
country with a view to promoting an integrated approach to policy formulation, implementation of 
poverty eradication programmes and reviewing their effectiveness. </p>
<p>The Plan also recognizes that empowerment of the poor is the most fundamental requirement of 
poverty eradication and called upon member governments to commit themselves to creating the 
necessary conditions including the financial and political backing to the support structures for 
organizing the poor; encourage the process of organizing the poor along social and economic 
interests and channel resources for this purpose; foster decentralization and introduce local 
self-governance backed up with the financial resources needed; and encourage NGO involvement 
in organizing the poor and designing and implementing programmes for poverty eradication. 
Member countries are in the process of implementing the Plan at their national levels. </p>
<p>The SAARC process has also created a new awareness about actions to be taken separately or 
jointly by member states on a number of other vital areas with specific relevance for the region. In 
the field of environment, SAARC has thus completed two significant studies, one relating to the 
causes and consequences of natural disasters and protection and preservation of the environment, 
and the other on the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; and its impact on the region. Both these studies contain 
specific recommendations for implementation at the national and regional level. </p>
<p>In order to address the issue of financial constraints, several steps have been taken by the 
Association. The SAARC-Japan Special Fund established entirely with the contribution of Japan 
and presently amounting to US$ 500,000 has been useful in supplementing the financial 
commitments of member states in organizing SAARC activities / programmes. The SAARC Fund 
for Regional Projects (SFRP) established with an initial capital of $5 million is utilized to identify 
and develop projects having a regional character and necessarily of commercial in nature. A 
SAARC Regional Fund (SRF) was also established with the aim of financing those activities/ 
programmes under the IPA, which remain unimplemented due to financial constraints. </p>
<p>Recently, during the Eighth SAARC Summit it was decided to establish a South Asian 
Development Fund (SADF), merging the earlier funds and endowing it with three windows; the first 
for identification and development of projects, the second for institutional and human resource 
development projects, and third for social development and infrastructure development projects. 
While SAARC initiatives in these myriad areas were taken, the Association was also instrumental in 
triggering important action to implement an impressive social agenda with far reaching impact. </p>
<p>Survival, protection and development of children in South Asia and in particular the more 
vulnerable Girl-Child has been an issue which has received high priority in SAARC. An annual 
review of the Situation of Children in the region is carried out by SAARC at the highest level. The 
organisation, has indeed, been a pioneer in highlighting the issues relating to children, particularly the 
gender disparities in the region.</p>
<p>The SAARC Decade Plan of Action adopted to promote the welfare of the Girl-Child in the region 
sets out clearly the gender-specific SAARC goals as well as the priority concerns in the critical 
areas of health and nutrition, education and literacy, and marriage and motherhood. A mid-decade 
review of the implementation of the decade plan is being carried out for presentation to the 
SAARC leaders during their Ninth Summit. Needless to say, the concerns of women are also being 
addressed in SAARC with a view to bring them into the mainstream of the development process in 
member states. </p>
<p>The Association has designated specific SAARC years to focus particular attention on important 
thematic issues of great social significance and to underscore the importance of action needed in 
specific areas. Beginning with 1989 as the SAARC year for combating Drug Trafficking and Drug 
Abuse, SAARC has designated successive years to focus on Women in Development, Shelter, 
environment, disabled persons, youth, poverty eradication respectively. 1996 will be observed as 
the SAARC Year of Literacy. In addition, the 1990s have been declared as the SAARC Decade 
of the Girl-Child. SAARC has also convened Ministerial meetings on some of these issues which 
have provided the much needed political impetus to address the problems faced in these areas. </p>
<p>In addition to initiatives in these vital areas, SAARC has established four regional Centers, the first 
being SAARC Agricultural Information Center (SAIC) in Dhaka followed by SAARC 
Tuberculosis Center in Kathmandu, SAARC Meteorological Research Center (SMRC) in Dhaka 
and the SAARC Documentation Center in New Delhi. These Centers have carried out useful work 
in their respective areas. </p>
<p>SAARC has also finalised three important regional Agreements/ Conventions in addition to 
SAPTA. These cover the crucial issues of food security, terrorism, and narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances. The Conventions relating to Terrorism and Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances have been ratified by all member states, and enactment of enabling 
legislatures by member countries is being completed. Progress has been made by the SAARC 
Terrorism Offenses Monitoring Desk and the SAARC Drug Offenses Monitoring Desk, both 
established in Colombo in disseminating relevant information to member states relating to the two 
areas. </p>
<p>Building bridges among the peoples of the region has been one of the prime objectives of SAARC. 
The progress in the key areas have been quite positive by any standard. As early as in 1986, 
SAARC laid special emphasis on promoting people-to-people contact in the region. The SAARC 
Audio Visual Exchange (SAVE) Programme, the SAARC Chairs, Fellowships and Scholarships 
Scheme, the SAARC Youth Volunteers Programme and the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme are 
some of the important initiatives taken in this regard. The SAVE Programme, which comprise of 
TV and Radio programmes broadcast regularly once a month on specified dates has been widely 
acknowledged as popular programmes and have evoked keen interest in member countries.</p>
<p>SAVE at present provides useful and informative programmes on cultural themes relating to 
member countries on a regular basis. In addition to such programmes, joint productions on specific 
themes such as environment, disabled persons and youth have been broadcast to create greater 
awareness about these issues. There is a growing feeling that the frequency of these programmes 
should be increased and the contents enhanced and enriched by focusing on socially sensitive issues 
as well, in order to boost this scheme. Such programmes it is felt could also highlight success stories 
for combating the many problems common to the region. </p>
<p>The SAARC Chairs, Fellowships and Scholarships Scheme has, on the other hand, tremendous 
potential to facilitate greater interaction among the intelligentsia in the region. Efforts are being made 
for optimal utilization of seats offered under this Scheme. Similarly, the SAARC Visa Exemption 
Scheme facilitates greater contact between the peoples. The scheme is under constant review for its 
further appropriate expansion. </p>
<p>In this context, it is worthwhile to note that increasing emphasis is being given to reinforce 
inter-governmental efforts with greater people-to-people contacts and interaction at other 
non-governmental levels. The need for greater participation of NGOs, including professional bodies 
in the private sector, to promote socio-economic and cultural development of South Asia is being 
greatly emphasized. SAARC has actively supported all steps taken by the business community, 
professional bodies, scholars and academics and the efforts made by them in promoting regional 
cooperation in South Asia. It is encouraging to note that with the establishment of SAARC, 
tremendous interest has been generated among these groups and member governments have had 
the benefit of continuous and positive contributions from several sources.</p>
<p>New ideas have emanated from the intellectual community which have been accepted by SAARC 
and integrated as part of its official process. SAARC has also developed a mechanism for officially 
recognizing regional apex bodies with similar aims and objectives. SAARC has welcomed the 
Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians. While two other such bodies have been 
accorded recognition by SAARC so far, several entities are in the process of completing the 
required formalities in this regard. </p>
<p>SAARC has also assumed a new dimension through its interaction and cooperation with other 
regional and international organizations. It has entered into cooperative arrangements through 
signing MOUs and Agreements with several regional and international organizations including 
UNCTAD, ESCAP, UNICEF, APT, UNDP, AND UNDCP. Besides, increased attention has 
been given to projection of SAARC collective positions at a number of international fora, a practice 
which has now become a regular feature. Beginning with the United Nations </p>
<p>Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in 1992, SAARC has presented its 
collective positions at all subsequent major international conferences, the last being the Fourth 
World Conference on Women in Beijing. This has not only enhanced the international profile of 
South Asia, but also enabled the countries of the region, as a whole, to articulate their common 
position with a concerted and stronger voice. </p>
<p>As SAARC completes its first decade and enters into the second, it is important that we also focus 
on some of the challenges faced by the organisation, in order to build on its past gains and look to 
its future with a clear vision. In this context, we may note that the Integrated Programme of Action 
(IPA) remained central to the SAARC process. Technical Committees have been established 
under the twelve agreed areas of cooperation, viz. Agriculture (including forestry), Communications 
(telecommunications and postal services), environment, health and population activities (including 
children), meteorology, prevention of drug trafficking and drug abuse, Rural Development 
(including youth volunteers programme), science and technology, tourism, transport and women in 
development.</p>
<p>These Committees are responsible for the implementation, coordination and monitoring of the 
programmes in their respective areas of cooperation. Recently, it has been decided to merge the 
Technical Committees on Environment and Meteorology as Technical Committee on Environment 
and Meteorology with effect from 1 January 1996. At present the IPA and the TCs cover activities 
which are primarily short term in nature, i.e. workshops, seminars, training programmes, study 
tours, meetings of expert groups, etc. on specific themes. Other activities include establishing 
networking arrangements among member states in certain areas, compilation of Directories, 
preparation of research studies and state-of-the-art reports etc. </p>
<p>There is a growing feeling that programmes and activities under the IPA should be made more 
specific, target oriented and time bound in nature and should lead to a process of regional 
cooperation which would bring tangible benefits to the peoples of the region. The SAARC leaders 
are very much aware of these requirements and a review process is already underway to make 
significant improvements in all these areas. </p>
<p>It is true that even after a decade of its existence, the challenges faced by SAARC still remain 
formidable. The socio-economic problems facing the peoples of South Asia remain numerous. As 
the organisation enters into the second decade, the most pressing challenge faced by the countries 
of the region continues to be the perennial problem of poverty compounded by a population 
explosion. The success of SAARC in this area depends on the extent to which the political 
commitment expressed at the highest level to eradicate poverty in the region in the shortest possible 
time, could be vigorously followed up by member states with practical initiatives of a wide ranging 
nature.</p>
<p>Cooperation in the area of trade and economy among member countries is a top priority in the 
SAARC Agenda, which should be seen as a complimentary process aimed at poverty eradication 
and human development. The viability of SAARC as a regional organisation which would bring 
tangible benefits to the peoples of South Asia depends to a large extent on the strength of economic 
cooperation established among member countries. Mobilisation of resources from within the region 
to be supplemented by external resources should be a matter of highest priority for all the member 
countries.</p>
<p>Harnessing the potential of the private sector in all the member countries can be a useful step in this 
most desired direction. It is a matter of satisfaction to note that SAARC has also begun discussions 
on establishing sub-regional economic cooperation and recognized that the forward movement 
generated by SAPTA should eventually progress towards the creation of a free-trade area in the 
region. </p>
<p>The last one decade has been an exciting period, for regional cooperation in South Asia. Through 
concerted action and a remarkable display of pragmatism, the foundation for cooperative efforts in 
South Asia on a wide front has been laid. There is an imperative need to consolidate this gain and 
look forward with a positive spirit to build on that foundation. In the face of a multitude of problems 
within the region affecting all our people, it is certain that we have no other better alternative to 
pursue. SAARC is a unique instrument of peace and progress devised by all our countries together. 
It is endowed with a formidable capacity to keep us together for our common good. We must 
utilise it to its fullest extent and to the best advantage of the peoples of our region. </p>

SAARC Secretary-General <br>
November 1995 </strong></em></p>

<p align=center><font size=4><strong>II. INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p>The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, 
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. SAARC is a manifestation of the 
determination of the peoples of South Asia to work together towards finding solutions to their 
common problems in a spirit of friendship, trust and understanding and to create an order based on 
mutual respect, equity and shared benefits. The main goal of the Association is to accelerate the 
process of economic and social development in member states, through joint action in the agreed 
areas of cooperation. </p>
<hr>
<p align=center><font size=4><b>III. EVOLUTION</b> </font></p>
<p>The idea of regional cooperation in South Asia was first mooted in November 1980. After 
consultations, the Foreign Secretaries of the seven countries met for the first time in Colombo, in 
April 1981. This was followed, a few months later, by the meeting of the Committee of the Whole, 
which identified five broad areas for regional cooperation. The Foreign Ministers, at their first 
meeting in New Delhi, in August 1983, formally launched the Integrated Programme of Action 
(IPA) through the adoption of the Declaration on South Asian Regional Cooperation (SARC). </p>
<p>At the First Summit held in Dhaka on 7-8 December 1985, the Charter establishing the South 
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was adopted. The objectives, principles 
and general provisions, as mentioned in the SAARC Charter, are as follows : </p>
<p><font size=3><b><i>Objectives</i></b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- To promote the welfare of the peoples of South Asia and to improve their quality 
of life; <br>
- To accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the 
region and to provide all individuals the opportunity to live in dignity and to realise 
their full potentials; <br>
- To promote and strengthen collective self-reliance among the countries of South 
Asia; <br>
- To contribute to mutual trust, understanding and appreciation of one another's 
problems; <br>
- To promote active collaboration and mutual assistance in the economic, social, 
cultural, technical and scientific fields; <br>
- To strengthen cooperation with other developing countries; <br>
- To strengthen cooperation among themselves in international forums on matters of 
common interests; and <br>
- To cooperate with international and regional organizations with similar aims and 
purposes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3><b><i>Principles</i></b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Cooperation within the framework of the Association is based on respect for the 
principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, political independence, 
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and mutual benefit. <br>
- Such cooperation is to complement and not to substitute bilateral or multilateral 
cooperation. <br>
- Such cooperation should be consistent with bilateral and multilateral obligations of 
the member states. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3><b><i>General Provisions</i></b> </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Decisions at all levels in SAARC are taken on the basis of unanimity. <br>
- Bilateral and contentious issues are excluded from its deliberations. </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p align=center><font size=4><b>IV. INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE </b></font></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Summits</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p>The highest authority of the Association rests with the Heads of State or Government. During the 
period 1985-95, eight meetings of the Heads of State or Government had been held in Dhaka 
(1985), Bangalore (1986), Kathmandu (1987), Islamabad (1988), Mal&eacute; (1990), Colombo 
(1991), Dhaka (1993) and New Delhi (1995), respectively. </p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Council of Ministers </b></em></font></p>
<p>Comprising the Foreign Ministers of member states is responsible for the formulation of policies; 
reviewing progress; deciding on new areas of cooperation; establishing additional mechanisms as 
deemed necessary; and deciding on other matters of general interest to the Association. The 
Council meets twice a year and may also meet in extraordinary session by agreement of member 
states. It has held fifteen sessions till November 1995. </p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Standing Committee</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p>Comprising the Foreign Secretaries of member states is entrusted with the overall monitoring and 
coordination of programmes and the modalities of financing; determining inter-sectoral priorities; 
mobilising regional and external resources; and identifying new areas of cooperation based on 
appropriate studies. It may meet as often as deemed necessary but in practice it meets twice a year 
and submits its reports to the Council of Ministers. It has held twenty regular sessions and two 
special sessions till November 1995. </p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Programming Committee</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p>Comprising the senior officials meets prior to the Standing Committee sessions to scrutinize 
Secretariat Budget, finalise the Calendar of Activities and take up any other matter assigned to it by 
the Standing Committee. This Committee has held fifteen sessions till November 1995. </p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Technical Committees</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p>Comprising representatives of member states, formulate programmes and prepare projects in their 
respective fields. They are responsible for monitoring the implementation of such activities and 
report to the Standing Committee. The chairmanship of each Technical Committee normally rotates 
among member countries in alphabetical order, every two years. At present, there are twelve 
Technical Committees. However, with the merger of the Technical Committees on Environment 
and Meteorology, beginning from 1st January 1996, the number of Technical Committees will be 
eleven. </p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Action Committees</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p>According to the SAARC Charter, there is a provision for Action Committees comprising member 
states concerned with implementation of projects involving more than two, but not all member 
states. At present, there are no such Action Committees. </p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>Other Meetings</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p>During the first decade of SAARC, several other important meetings took place in specific 
contexts. A number of SAARC Ministerial Meetings have been held, to focus attention on specific 
areas of common concern and has become an integral part of the consultative structure.So far 
Ministerial-level Meetings have been held on International Economic Issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Islamabad (1986), Children<br>
- New Delhi (1986) &amp; Colombo (1992), Women in Development <br>
- Shillong (1986) &amp; Islamabad (1990), Environment - New Delhi (1992), Women 
and Family Health<br>
- Kathmandu (1993), Disabled Persons<br>
- Islamabad (1993), Youth - Male' (1994), Poverty <br>
- Dhaka (1994) and Women : Towards the Fourth World Conference on Women 
in Beijing<br>
- Dhaka (1995). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, six Meetings of Planners have been held, one in 1983 and five annually from 1987 to 1991. 
These meetings initiated cooperation in important areas such as Trade, Manufacturers and 
Services; Basic Needs; Human Resource Development; Data base on socio-economic indicators; 
Energy Modelling Techniques; Plan Modelling Techniques and Poverty Alleviation Strategies. <br>
In addition, a high level Committee on Economic Cooperation (CEC) has been established in 
1991, for identifying and implementing programmes in the core area of economic and trade 
cooperation. <br>
A three-tier mechanism was put in place in 1995, to follow-up on the relevant SAARC decisions 
on Poverty Eradication. The tiers consist of Meeting of Secretaries in-Charge of Poverty 
Eradication, Meeting of Finance/Planning Secretaries, and Meeting of Finance/Planning Ministers. </p>
<hr>
<p align=center><font size=4><b>V. SAARC SECRETARIAT </b></font></p>
<p>Established in Kathmandu on 16 January 1987, the SAARC Secretariat is responsible to 
coordinate and monitor the implementation of SAARC activities, service the meetings of the 
Association and serve as the channel of communication between SAARC and other international 
organizations. </p>
<p>The Secretariat comprises of the Secretary-General, a Director from each member state and the 
General Services Staff. The Secretary-General is appointed by the Council of Ministers upon 
nomination by a member state, on the principle of rotation in alphabetical order, for a period of two 
years. Mr. Abul Ahsan from Bangladesh was the first Secretary-General (16 January 1987 - 15 
October 1989) followed by Mr. Kant Kishore Bhargava from India (17 October 1989 - 31 
December 1991) and Mr. Ibrahim Hussain Zaki from the Maldives (1 January 1992 - 31 
December 1993). The present Secretary-General, Mr. Yadab Kant Silwal from Nepal, assumed 
the office from 1 January 1994. The next Secretary-General from Pakistan, Mr. Naeemuddin 
Hasan will assume office on 1 January 1996. </p>
<p>Directors are appointed by the Secretary-General, upon nomination by member states for a period 
of three years which, in special circumstances, may be extended by the Secretary-General for a 
period not exceeding another full term, in consultation with the member state concerned. <br>

<p>Member states make provision in their respective national budgets, for financing activities and 
programmes under the SAARC framework including contributions to the Secretariat budget and 
that of the regional institutions. The financial provision thus made is announced annually, at the 
meeting of the Standing Committee. </p>
<p>The annual budget of the Secretariat, both for capital as well as recurrent expenditure, is shared by 
member states on the basis of an agreed formula. The initial cost of the main building of the 
Secretariat, together with all facilities and equipment, as well as that of the annex building 
completed in 1993 has been met by the host government. </p>
<p>A minimum of forty percent of the institutional cost of regional institutions is borne by the respective 
host government and the balance is shared by all member states, according to an agreed formula. 
Capital expenditure of regional institutions which includes physical infrastructure, furnishing, 
machines, equipment etc. are normally borne by the respective host government. Programme 
expenditure of regional institutions is also shared by member states, according to the agreed 
formula. </p>
<p>In the case of activities under the approved Calendar, the local expenses including hospitality, 
within agreed limits, are borne by the host Government, while the cost of air travel is met by the 
sending Government. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><b>VII. INTEGRATED PROGRAMME OF ACTION (IPA)</b> </font></p>
<p>The IPA is a key component of the SAARC process and includes twelve agreed areas of 
cooperation, each being covered by a designated Technical Committee. </p>
<p>In response to the emphasis given by successive Summits on the need to further consolidate and 
streamline IPA and to make it more result oriented, a comprehensive set of guidelines and 
procedures was adopted in 1992 for the rationalization of SAARC activities. As a result of this, 
there is now a greater focus on activities that would bring tangible benefits to the people of South 
Asia. </p>
<p>The Secretary-General reports on the progress in the implementation of IPA to the Standing 
Committee, both at its inter-Summit and pre-Summit Sessions. </p>
<p>The Standing Committee has also taken the initiative to review the institutional mechanisms and 
activities of the Association, including, the evaluation of the functioning of the Technical 
Committees, amalgamation/alteration of their mandate and also a review of the role of the 
Secretariat.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>The highlights of the activities under each Technical Committee are as follows: </strong></em></p>
<p><font size=3><em><b>1. Agriculture (TC01)</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p>Agriculture was among the original five areas identified for fostering regional cooperation. The first 
meeting of TC01 was held in 1983. Subsequently, Forestry was also included in the work of the 
Technical Committee. TC01 was instrumental in the setting up of SAARC Agricultural Information 
Centre (SAIC) at Dhaka in 1988 - the first SAARC regional institution. </p>
<p>Member states have been exchanging Germplasm, Breeding Materials on Livestock and Fishery in 
accordance with the quarantine regulations in force in their respective countries. Prototypes of 
Farmtools and Equipment have been exchanged for trial and adaptation. Activities for Improved 
Livestock through Exchange of Animals, Frozen Semen and Vaccine have also been undertaken. 
The responsibility of compiling lists of institutions and disciplines capable of offering training in 
member countries has been entrusted to SAIC. Rice and Wheat-breeding Programmes for 
enhancing productivity have been conducted while Multilocation trials for various crops are being 
undertaken. </p>
<p>Regular meetings of Counterpart Scientists is a very important feature of the Committee's 
programmes. The list of Counterpart Scientists in the twelve agreed areas of crops and disciplines 
have been finalised for networking. These are : Rice (Millet); Wheat; Oilseeds; Horticulture 
(Potato) Vegetables and Fruits; Fisheries; Forestry; Transfer of Technology; Livestock (Animal 
Health and Production); Farm Machinery and Implements; Post Harvest Technology; Agriculture 
Economics &amp; Policies and Soils. Progress has been made towards establishing a network on 
Amelioration of Problem Soils. </p>

<p><font size=3><em><strong>4. Environment (TC04) </strong></em></font></p>
<p>The Third SAARC Summit (Kathmandu, 1987) decided to commission a study on &quot;Causes and 
Consequences of Natural Disasters and the Protection and Preservation of the Environment&quot;. 
National Studies were undertaken and subsequently consolidated into a Regional Study, which was 
approved by the Sixth SAARC Summit (Colombo, 1991). </p>
<p>The recommendations of the above Regional Study were considered by the Committee on 
Environment (February 1992), which identified, for immediate action, measures for strengthening 
the environment management infrastructure; programmes on environmentally sound land and water 
use planning; research and action programme on mountain development in the Himalayan Region; 
coastal zone management programme; a SAARC forestry and watershed programme; programme 
on energy and environment; pollution control and hazardous waste management programme; a 
SAARC cooperative programme for biodiversity management; peoples participation in resource 
management; information exchange on low cost and environmentally sound habitat technologies; 
establishment of a SAARC relief and assistance mechanism for disaster and regional cooperation 
on the development of modern disaster warning systems. </p>
<p>A special session of the Committee on Environment (November 1992) met to evolve specific 
programme activities and modalities to implement the above measures. </p>
<p>The Fourth SAARC Summit (Islamabad, 1988) decided that a joint study be undertaken on 
&quot;Greenhouse Effect and its Impact on the Region&quot;. National Studies prepared by member states 
were consolidated into a regional study, which was approved by the Seventh SAARC Summit 
(Dhaka, 1993). </p>
<p>The Committee on Environment was designated as the Technical Committee on Environment and 
included within its purview, &quot;Greenhouse Effect and its Impact on the Region&quot;. It began functioning 
from January 1, 1993. </p>
<p align=left>TC04 has identified measures for immediate action from among the recommendations and decided 
on a number of modalities for their implementation. These include, improving climate monitoring 
capability through networking arrangement and through SAARC Meteorological Research Centre 
(SMRC); developing climate change and sea-level rise scenario through country specific studies 
and sharing of information data in this respect; making available to member states expertise on 
climate research and monitoring Greenhouse Gases emission; identification of training and research 
institutions and ongoing programmes; exchange of information and data; exchange of experience on 
strategies for developing, mitigating and adaptive responses to climate change. </p>
<p align=left>TC04 also covers topics such as Approaches to Environmental Legislations, Regulations and 
Standards in SAARC countries; Rehabilitation of Degraded Lands; Training Course on Wetlands 
Assessment and Management; Workshop on Alternate/Renewable Energy and Workshop of 
SAARC National Experts on Climate Change. The urgent need to establish a networking approach 
through identified nodal points/institutions has also been stressed. </p>
<p align=left>A SAARC Environment Ministers Conference was held in New Delhi in April 1992 to evolve a 
joint position on the issues related to the UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED). SAARC also presented a common position paper to the Fourth World Conference on 
Natural Disaster Reduction (Yokohama, May 1994). </p>
<p align=left>TCs on Environment and Meteorology will be merged and designated as TC on Environment and 
Meteorology with effect from 1 January 1996. </p>
<p align=left><font size=3><em><b>5. Health and Population Activities (TC05)</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p align=left>Health and Population Activities was one of the original five areas of cooperation identified by 
member states. The First Meeting of TC05 was held in 1984. </p>
<p align=left>The primary focus of TC05 has been on children, population welfare and policy, maternal and child 
health, primary health care, disabled and handicapped persons, control and eradication of major 
diseases in the region such as malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, diarrhea diseases, rabies, AIDS, and 
iodine deficiency disorder. </p>
<p align=left>Important activities undertaken by TC05 include the setting up of the SAARC Tuberculosis Centre 
(STC), in Kathmandu in 1992, devising a standard Format for preparing the Annual Review of the 
Situation of Children in the SAARC region; establishment of networking arrangements for training, 
research and eradication of malaria and regional approach for combating major diseases in the 
region. A Directory of training programmes in six priority areas, i.e. malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, 
diarrhoeal diseases, human rabies and maternal and child health have been prepared and circulated. 
In addition, several status papers on important subjects relating to health have been circulated 
among member states. </p>
<p align=left>The Second SAARC Summit (Bangalore, 1986) decided that the survival, protection and 
development of Children should be given highest priority and directed that annual reviews be 
undertaken on the situation of children in SAARC countries. Such annual reviews for the years 
1993 and 1994 have been completed by TC05 based on annual country reports submitted by 
member states. These annual reviews have indicated, <i>inter-alia</i>, reduction of infant mortality and 
significant progress in the immunisation programme for children in the region. </p>
<p align=left>TC05 will be renamed as TC on Health, Population Activities and Child Welfare with effect from 1 
January 1996. </p>
<p align=left><font size=3><em><b>6. Meteorology (TC06)</b></em><em> </em></font></p>
<p align=left>Meteorology was also one of the five areas of cooperation initially identified by member states. The 
first meeting of TC06 was held in 1984. Since its inception, the Committee has been involved in 
organizing seminars/workshops in areas such as Joint Inter-Comparison of Barometers,

<p>Since its establishment in 1987, TC07 has implemented a number of programmes in law 
enforcement, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation as essential elements of a coordinated regional 
strategy in combating drug trafficking and drug abuse. It contributed significantly towards the 
finalisation of the SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in 
November 1990, which came into force in September 1993 upon its ratification by all member 
states. </p>
<p>Cooperation among Drug Law Enforcement Agencies and Officers is being developed through 
short-term activities such as Seminars and Training Courses. Nodal Agencies in member states 
have been nominated to exchange information and intelligence on drug offences. The SAARC Drug 
Offences Monitoring Desk (SDOMD) has been established in Colombo to collate, analyse and 
disseminate information on drug offences. Efforts are afoot for further strengthening SDOMD. </p>
<p>In the field of demand reduction, short-term activities such as workshops/ seminars held so far have 
focused on the role of media in drug abuse prevention, community mobilization against drug abuse, 
preventive education, school curriculum development, treatment and relapse prevention and 
exchange of information on indigenous and innovative methods of treatment. A networking 
arrangement among Nodal Institutions in drug abuse prevention is being established. </p>
<p>Meetings of selected NGOs involved in Drug Abuse Prevention have been held. A Directory of 
such Organisations has been compiled in order to promote greater interaction among them. The 
Colombo Plan Bureau's Project Proposal and the establishment of working relations between 
SAARC and the Colombo Plan Bureau were approved by the Twentieth Session of the Standing 
Committee. This will promote and encourage cooperation among NGOs in SAARC countries 
involved in anti-narcotics activities. </p>
<p>Efforts have been directed at promoting SAARC member states' accession to the relevant UN 
Conventions, conclusion of Regional and Drug Convention and harmonisation and consolidation of 
national drug laws. A Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation between SAARC and the 
United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) has been signed. </p>

<p><em><b>10. Tourism (TC10)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>TC10 was established in 1991 to promote cooperation in the field of tourism in the region. At its 
first meeting held in Colombo in October 1991, the Committee decided on an Action Plan on 
Tourism to promote cooperation in the areas such as training programmes, exchange of 
information, joint promotion, jointventure investment, intraregional tourism etc. It also reviewed 
progress on the SAARC Scheme for Promotion of Organized Tourism. These topics have formed 
an integral part of the agenda of the five Meetings of this Committee which have been held so far. </p>
<p>Under the purview of TC10, member countries have exchanged information on training facilities 
existing in the region and a number of slots for providing training in the field of tourism and hotel 
management were offered. TC10 has decided upon steps to produce joint tourism brochure, 
SAARC Travel Guide and joint-production of SAARC tourism promotional film on the theme &quot;A 
Unique Holiday with Diversity : From Top of the World to the Sunny beaches&quot;. Activities such as 
familiarisation tours and Food Festival in member states were also identified. Steps were also taken 
to coordinate the participation of SAARC member states in international tourism fairs. Emphasis is 
also being placed on the importance of early launching of the SAARC Scheme for Promotion of 
Organised Tourism. </p>
<p><em><b>11. Transport (TC11)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of the transport sector, TC11 was set up in 1983. The work of the 
Technical Committee covers three major segments of transport, i.e. land transport, divided into 
roadways and railways; sea transport sub-divided into inland waterways and shipping; and air 
transport. </p>
<p>The activities of TC11 cover exchange of data and information, preparation of status papers, 
compilation of data-base and directories of consultancy centres for transport sector. Seminars and 
Workshops have covered areas such as Material and Cost of Road Construction, Maintenance of 
Roads, Rural Roads, Road transportation and safety; Containerisation for Railways, Urban 
transportation, Inland Water Transport, Maritime Transport etc. </p>
<p>Training Courses have included Corporate Planning for Railway sector, Highway and Bridge 
Engineering. A Compendia of Information on Roads in the SAARC region has been completed and 
similarly data on Railway Transport has been compiled. Two important Directories - one on 
Centres of Excellence and the other on Consultants and Experts in the field of transport are being 
prepared. An important Study on &quot;In-depth examination of Transport Infrastructure and Transit 
Facilities so as to come up with viable proposals for Improvement&quot; has recently been completed. </p>
<p>The activities held under the Transport Sector, so far, have helped in fostering better cooperation 
among member countries and resulted in the dissemination and exchange of data, expertise, 
information and experiences. </p>
<p>The work programme for the 1990s covers a wide range of issues related to rail, sea and air 
transportation. Recently, four new areas of cooperation in the Transport Sector have been 
identified by the Committee: Transport Safety, Rural Transport, Environmental Aspects, and 
Energy Conservation. Two new proposals : &quot;Establishing Joint Venture Operations to provide 
Container Liner Shipping Services for Long Haul Trade Routes&quot; and &quot;Consultancy/Contracting 
Joint Ventures in the Transport Sector in the SAARC Region&quot; are also being considered by the 
Technical Committee. </p>
<p>Transport is a vital area in providing access to products to markets and opening up new areas of 
productivity. Especially now with the signing of Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading 
Arrangement (SAPTA) this sector has even a more crucial role to play in intra-SAARC trade. </p>
<p><em><b>12. Women in Development (TC12)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>Women in Development was included as an area of cooperation under the IPA in 1986. Specific 
issues taken up by TC12 include, preparation of a Regional Plan of Action for Women, effective 
dissemination of technical information relating to women in development generated by member 
states, preparation of Guide Books on Women in Development by member states etc. SAARC 
Women's Journals on specific themes relating to women in development have been published to 
coincide with important events like SAARC Summits. </p>
<p>On the recommendation of the Committee, 1990 was designated as the &quot;SAARC Year of the 
Girl-Child&quot; and subsequently 1991-2000 A.D. declared as the &quot;SAARC Decade of the 
Girl-Child&quot;. A SAARC Plan of Action has been drawn up to observe the decade in order to 
highlight the gender disparities in the region and to promote the welfare of the Girl-Child. Member 
states are now in the process of implementing the Plan of Action. In this connection SAARC would 
be conducting a comprehensive mid-decade review for presentation to the Ninth SAARC Summit. </p>
<p>SAARC has recognised the serious threat faced by certain groups of Girl Children in Especially 
Difficult Circumstances (GCEDC) and decided that an urgent appraisal of the situation of these 
children be undertaken and presented to the Ninth SAARC Summit. </p>
<p>Several short-term activities like seminars, workshops and training courses have been held in the 
areas of women in law, women and environment, women's education and training, women's 
employment, women in agriculture and extension etc. Several activities related to different aspects 
of the Girl-Child have also been held under the Committee. Exhibitions on Handicrafts and Design 
by Women have also been organised by member states. </p>
<p>A Women's Cell has been established in the SAARC Secretariat to act as a Data Bank and a store 
house of information on Women in Development in the region. It will also act as a forum for 
coordination among member states and other TCs. </p>
<p>A SAARC collective position on issues before the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing 
in September 1995 had been formulated and a &quot;SAARC Ministerial Meeting on Women: Towards 
the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing&quot; has been held and the Dhaka Resolution 
adopted at the meeting provided additional input from SAARC Countries to the Beijing 
Conference. </p>
<p><i>Girl representatives present the Girl-Child's Appeal to the Heads of State or Government

<hr>
<p align=center><font size=4><b>VIII. POVERTY ERADICATION</b> </font></p>
<p>The Sixth SAARC Summit (Colombo, 1991) accorded the highest priority to the alleviation of 
poverty in South Asia and decided to establish an Independent South Asian Commission on 
Poverty Alleviation (ISACPA) consisting of eminent persons from member states to conduct an 
in-depth study of the diverse experiences of member states and report their recommendations on 
the alleviation of poverty to the Seventh Summit. </p>
<p>A consensus on poverty eradication was adopted at the Seventh SAARC Summit (Dhaka, 1993). 
The Summit welcomed the ISACPA report and expressed its commitment to eradicate poverty 
from South Asia preferably by the Year 2002 through an agenda of action which would, <i>inter-alia</i>, 
include a strategy of social mobilization, policy of decentralised agricultural development and 
small-scale labour-intensive industrialisation and human development. The Summit also stressed 
that within the conceptual approach of &quot;<i>Dhal-Bhaat</i>&quot;, the right to work and primary education 
should receive priority. It also underscored the critical links between the success of national efforts 
at poverty alleviation and relevant external factors. The Summit urged major actors in the world 
economic scene to create an enabling atmosphere supportive of poverty alleviation programmes 
and expressed the need for a new dialogue with donors for this purpose. The call for a new 
dialogue with donors has led to important initiatives in this respect, among which was the 
SAARC/World Bank Informal Workshop on Poverty Reduction in South Asia (Annapolis, USA, 
October 1993). UNDP and ESCAP are formulating proposals for cooperation with SAARC in 
Poverty Reduction. </p>
<p>The Eighth SAARC Summit (New Delhi, May 1995) endorsed the recommendations of the 
Finance/Planning Ministers (Dhaka, July 1994) to establish a three-tier mechanism for exchanging 
information on poverty eradication. India hosted the meetings of the first and the second tier in New 
Delhi (September 1995). The meeting of the first tier </p>
<p>Group of Secretaries dealing with Poverty Eradication and Social Development in Member 
Countries during their meeting in New Delhi to address Poverty Eradication issues in the region. 
which constituted the Group of Secretaries to the Governments in the Ministries / Departments 
concerned with poverty eradication and social development in SAARC countries, underscored the 
need to give a distinct status and top priority to pro-poor plans in member countries ensuring 
specific commitment of adequate resource and organisational support. It also stressed the necessity 
to involve the poor in the formulation and implementation of plans meant for them through 
participatory institutions and process at grass root levels. The member states were also urged to 
evolve mechanisms to evaluate the efficacy of pro-poor plans and develop appropriate 
socio-economic indicators relevant for the purpose. On specific issues germane to poverty 
eradication, the meeting emphasised the need to pursue an integrated approach taking into account 
the critical linkages among various sectors. </p>
<p>The Meeting of the second-tier, i.e. Finance and Planning Secretaries, endorsed the 
recommendation of the first-tier and emphasised that poverty eradication should be viewed in the 
overall context of accelerating economic growth resulting in resulting in employment generation in an 
environment of macro-economic stability with emphasis on overall human resource development. 
The meeting also put special emphasis on the need to improving the implementation of poverty 
eradication programmes through devolution of power and decentralisation. A special mention was 
also made in the meeting on the need to ensure the sustainability of these programmes, especially 
through ensuring their recurring cost. </p>
<p>The Meeting of the third-tier Finance and Planning Ministers, is proposed to he held in India on 3-4 
January 1996 which will consider the second-tier Report. Its recommendations will be submitted to 
the Ninth SAARC Summit through the Council of Ministers. </p>
<hr>
<p align=center><font size=4><b>IX. TRADE AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION</b> </font></p>
<p>SAARC has taken important steps to expand cooperation among member countries in the core 
economic areas. In 1991, a Regional Study on Trade, Manufactures and Services (TMS) was 
completed outlining a number of recommendations for promoting regional cooperation in the core 
economic areas. The Council of Ministers at its Ninth Session in Mal&eacute; in July 1991 endorsed the 
Study and decided to set up a high-level Committee on Economic Cooperation (CEC). This 
Committee has so far held six meetings. </p>
<p>At the Colombo Summit in December 1991, the Heads of State or Government approved the 
establishment of an InterGovernmental Group (IGG) to seek agreement on an institutional 
framework under which specific measures for trade liberalization among SAARC member states 
could be furthered. IGG evolved a draft Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement 
(SAPTA) during its first two Meetings. Subsequently, the Council of Ministers, upon the 
recommendation of CEC signed the framework Agreement on SAPTA in Dhaka on 11 April 1993 
during the Seventh SAARC Summit. </p>
<p>In the subsequent four Meetings of IGG, the member states conducted their bilateral/multilateral 
trade negotiations in which they exchanged concessions to be offered/sought. The Consolidated 
National Schedules of Concessions were finalised in the Sixth Meeting of the IGG held at the 
SAARC Secretariat, Kathmandu on 20-21 April 1995 and subsequently approved by the Council 
of Ministers in May 1995. All SAARC member countries have ratified the SAPTA Agreement and 
as per Article 22 of the Agreement, SAPTA will enter into force on 7th December 1995 - two 
years ahead of the time schedule envisaged initially. </p>
<p>The Council of Ministers at its Fifteenth Session agreed that the full and timely realisation of the 
benefits of regional economic cooperation required </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) the implementation of other related measures such as the removal of para-tariff, 
non-tariff and other trade control barriers within the specific timeframes and<br>
(b) eventual progression to the creation of a free-trade area in the region. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Heads of State or Government at their Eighth SAARC Summit (New Delhi, May 1995) noted 
with satisfaction that the first round of trade negotiations under SAPTA has been completed. They 
reiterated their firm belief that the operationalisation of SAPTA will herald the beginning of a new 
and significant process of regional cooperation and would lend strength to SAARC as an institution 
for promoting the welfare of the peoples of South Asia. </p>
<p>CEC at its Sixth Meeting (New Delhi, November 1995) recommended that with the 
operationalisation of SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), it is now desirable to 
work towards removal of para-tariff and non-tariff barriers, widening and deepening the tariff cuts 
and expanding the list of products to be included for intra-SAARC preferential trade under 
SAPTA. It reiterated that the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) is a clear eventual goal, at 
the same time it noted that the progress towards it may have to be in gradual stages. To push the 
SAPTA process forward, it recommended that the Inter-Governmental Group on Trade 
Liberalisation be reconvened to conduct the Second Round of Trade Negotiations under SAPTA 
and proposed that the first meeting of the second round may take place in early 1996 and 
appreciated the offer of Sri Lanka to host the same. The Committee also recommended that the 
first Meeting of the Committee of Participants of SAPTA may be held in the third quarter of 1996 
to review the progress in the implementation of the Agreement. </p>
<p>Each member country will notify the SAARC Secretariat and the SAARC Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry about their overseas bulk purchases. A Group of Experts from Research Institutions 
of Member States have been requested to commission a tripartite study involving governments, 
business and academic sectors to accelerate the process of eventual progression to the creation of 
a free-trade area in the region. </p>
<hr>
<p><em>The following initiatives have also been taken towards promoting trade cooperation within 
the region: </em></p>
<p><em><b>i. Cooperation in the field of Handicrafts and Cottage Industries</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>A Group of Experts on Joint Ventures in Handicrafts and Cottage Industries was established in 
1991 pursuant to the decision of the Fifth SAARC Summit (Mal&eacute;, 1990). So far, the Group has 
held two meetings in which it has identified an indicative list of crafts and industries for the purpose 
of mutual cooperation. Out of this list, the Group has selected six sectors namely: hand knotted 
carpets, beekeeping and honey production, handloom textile products (including embroidery), 
leather products (including leather garments), wooden handicrafts and pottery and ceramic 
products as priority areas. It has made several recommendations regarding development of 
marketing and export promotion, design development, procurement and supply of certain raw 
material, skill upgradation and transfer of technology, entrepreneurship development. The 
implementation of these recommendations is reviewed regularly by the Committee on Economic 
Cooperation (CEC). At its Sixth Meeting in New Delhi in November 1995, CEC urged member 
states to take all necessary steps for the speedy implementation of these recommendations. The 
Committee requested the Secretariat to coordinate organisation of other agreed activities through 
consultations with member states as appropriate. </p>
<p><em><b>ii. Study on Transport Infrastructure and Transit Facilities</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>The CEC was directed by the Council of Ministers at its Eleventh Session (Colombo, July 1992) to 
specify appropriate steps for further improvement of transport infrastructure and transit facilities in 
the region to accelerate the growth of trade within and outside the region. Subsequent to this, a 
consultancy report was prepared on the subject by the Institute for Sustainable Development, 
Kathmandu. The Report was considered by the CEC at its Sixth Meeting in New Delhi in 
November 1995. The CEC requested the member states to complete their examination of the 
Report urgently. </p>

<p><em><b>i. SAARC Audio-Visual Exchange (SAVE) Programme</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>The SAVE programmes comprise of regular TV and Radio Programmes which are being 
telecast/broadcast on the 1st and 15th of each month respectively in all SAARC member countries. 
SAVE Radio and TV Quiz Programmes are also being held at regular intervals and have evoked 
keen interest among the youth. The other programmes include joint productions on specific Themes 
such as Environment, Disabled Persons and Youth. SAVE has proved to be an effective medium 
for promoting South Asian consciousness amongst the peoples of the region and for establishing 
people-to-people contact. </p>
<p><em><b>ii. SAARC Documentation Centre (SDC)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>The Centre has been established to provide ready access to reliable and up-to-date information on 
technical, scientific and development matters. </p>
<p><em><b>iii. SAARC Scheme for Promotion of Organised Tourism </b></em></p>
<p>The Scheme was initiated with the over-all objective of people-to-people contact in the region and 
more specifically as a step to facilitate development of intra-regional tourism. Confessional air fare 
to the tourists travelling under the Scheme is now under the consideration of the Technical 
Committee on Tourism which is presently taking necessary action to ensure early implementation of 
the Scheme. </p>
<p><em><b>iv. SAARC Chairs, Fellowships and Scholarships Scheme</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>The SAARC Chairs, Fellowships and Scholarships Scheme was instituted with the aim of providing 
increased cross-fertilization of ideas through greater interaction among students, scholars and 
academics in the SAARC Countries. This Scheme has now been brought under the purview of the 
Technical Committee on Education, Culture and Sports. </p>
<p><em><b>v. SAARC Youth Volunteers Programme (SYVOP)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.The main objective of the SYVOP is to harness the idealism of Youth for 
regional cooperation programmes by enabling them to work in other countries in 
the field of agriculture and forestry extension work. SYVOP was brought under the 
purview of the Technical Committee on Rural Development in 1989. Seven 
activities have so far been held in the member countries under this programme. </p>
<p>2. Other initiatives taken by the Organisation for promoting people-to-people 
contact include the following : </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><b>1. SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>In order to further promote closer and more frequent contacts among the peoples of the region, the 
SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme was initiated in 1988. The Scheme became operational from 
March 1, 1992 and so far about 1600 visas have been issued under the Scheme. Currently, 
persons entitled to the Scheme are the Supreme Court Judges, Members of the National 
Parliaments, Heads of National Academic Institutions, Foreign/Permanent Secretaries dealing with 
foreign affairs, SAARC Secretary-General and Directors of the SAARC Secretariat, Presidents of 
National Chambers of Commerce and Industry and their accompanying spouses and dependent 
children below 18 years of age. </p>
<p><em><b>2. South Asian Festivals</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>The First South Asian Festival was held in India from 9-24 October 1992 with popular 
participation from all member states. The festival which included performing arts, exhibitions and 
seminars was a unique event and served to enhance the interaction and strengthened the affinities 
among the peoples of South Asia. The festival also served to focus on the civilisational personality 
of South Asia manifested in the rich heritage of its art forms, architecture, literature, theater and 
films. </p>
<p>South Asian Festivals covering selected areas would be organised in future in member countries. </p>
<p><em><b>3. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>SAARC has emphasized the need for strengthening intergovernmental efforts with increased 
peopletopeople contacts through greater participation of NGOs, including professional bodies in 
the private sector, to promote socio-economic and cultural development of South Asia. In this 
context, a set of guidelines and procedures for granting recognition by SAARC to Regional Apex 
Bodies has been formulated. </p>
<p>While the following regional apex bodies have been welcomed/granted recognition by SAARC, 
applications for recognition from several other apex bodies of professionals such as architects, 
accountants, university women etc. are presently under consideration : </p>
<hr>
<p><b>(i) Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians</b> </p>
<p>The Speakers of Parliaments of SAARC Countries first met in Sri Lanka in June 1992 and 
resolved to set up an Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians. They met in 
Kathmandu in November 1992 and The First South Asian Festival held in India (October 1992) 
with participation from all Member Countries was a unique event which focused on the rich cultural 
heritage of South Asia formally launched the &quot;Association of SAARC Speakers and 
Parliamentarians&quot; and adopted the Charter of the Association. The Speakers Council which is the 
Apex Body of the Association finalised and ratified the draft rules of the Association prepared by 
the Parliamentary Secretaries-General in January 1994. Since then they have met periodically and 
addressed issues of common interest to member countries. The Heads of State or Government at 
their Seventh Summit (Dhaka, April 1993) welcomed the initiative of the Speakers of Parliaments 
of SAARC Countries in forming the Association </p>
<p><b>(ii) SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI)</b> </p>

December 1992. </p>
<p>SCCI has established its headquarters at Karachi and national units in all seven SAARC countries. 
Mr. S.M. Inam was elected as the first President of SCCI. The establishment of SCCI is a 
significant development and it will act as a dynamic instrument of promoting regional cooperation in 
the areas of trade and economic relations. </p>
<p>The SAARC Chamber has been instrumental in disseminating the information about the content, 
scope, and potential of the Framework Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement 
(SAPTA) among the business community in the region. For this purpose, it has organised, under its 
aegis, various National Seminars on SAPTA in the Member Countries. A Regional Seminar on 
SAPTA was also organised in Kathmandu in December 1994 by the Federation of Nepalese 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry in cooperation with the SAARC Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry and Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung. </p>
<p>SCCI delegations, headed by its President and comprising representatives of the National 
Federations of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of SAARC Member States, have visited 
Germany and Japan for expanding the exports from the SAARC region to the European Union and 
Japan. </p>

<p align=center><font size=4><b>XIII. SAARC FUNDS</b> </font></p>
<p><em><b>South Asian Development Fund (SADF)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>In order to establish a South Asian Development Fund, initially a Panel of Experts was formed 
under the chairmanship of H.E. Lyonpo Dawa Tshering, the Foreign Minister of Bhutan. The Panel 
of Experts consisting of eminent persons from the SAARC Region held three meetings and the 
Chairman had exploratory consultations with the potential donors. Subsequently it was decided to 
establish an InterGovernmental Group (IGG) on South Asian Development Fund (SADF) to define 
the size, structure, resources and operational modalities of the proposed Fund and also to examine 
the relationship of the Fund with the SAARC Fund for Regional Projects including the possibility of 
their merger. </p>
<p>A Consultant appointed by the Secretary-General submitted his Report which was considered by 
the IGG at its Second Meeting held at the SAARC Secretariat in October 1994. </p>
<p>The Second Meeting of IGG, <i>inter-alia</i>, recommended that a three-window South Asian 
Development Fund (SADF) may be established with the merger of the SAARC Fund for Regional 
Projects (SFRP), the SAARC Regional Fund (SRF) and a third window for social development 
and infrastructure building. This recommendation has been since approved by the Fifteenth Session 
of the Council of Ministers (New Delhi, 1995). The Council approved the recommendation of the 
Standing Committee which included convening a meeting of the Group of Experts consisting of the 
Members of the Council of SAARC Fund for Regional Projects (CSFRP) and National Focal 
Points of Member States at the SAARC Secretariat, to finalise the terms of reference, operational 
modalities and composition of the Governing Board of the South Asian Development Fund 
(SADF). The Meeting of the Expert Group held at the SAARC Secretariat (September 1995) 
finalised the recommendations for consideration of the Sixteenth Session of the Council of 
Ministers. </p>
<p><em><b>SAARC-Japan Special Fund</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>SAARC-Japan Special Fund has been established, under which the Government of Japan has 
agreed to finance activities/programmes relating to SAARC region. Letters were exchanged 
between the Secretary-General and the Japanese Ambassador in Kathmandu on 27 September, 
1993 confirming the acceptance of the Memorandum on the Guidelines for the Fund. </p>
<p>The Fund established entirely with contribution of the Government of Japan consists of two 
components. The allocation under Component-I is to be used to finance selected 
programmes/activities identified and managed by the member states. Component-II would be for 
the programmes/activities identified and managed by the Government of Japan. </p>
<p><em><b>SAARC Fund for Regional Projects (SFRP)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>The SFRP was established in 1991 to make available credit on easy terms for the identification and 
development of projects having a regional character. The Fund is managed by the Council for 
SAARC Fund for Regional Projects (CSFRP) comprising representatives of the Development 
Financing Institutions of SAARC member states. So far feasibility studies for thirteen projects have 
been undertaken which cover hydropower, sericulture, dairy products, medicinal cultivation and 
herbs etc. </p>
<p><em><b>SAARC Regional Fund (SRF)</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>The SRF aims at expediting the implementation of approved projects/programmes under IPA 
which remain unimplemented due to financial constraints. It would be administered by member 
states themselves. The sources of the Fund would be grants from donor countries, international 
agencies and organisations, and private sector donations. The projects/programmes that would 
qualify for funding are programme costs of SAARC Regional Institutions; costs of programme 
component of networking arrangements; development projects of scientific and technical in nature; 
projects/programmes involving high costs; long-term training programmes and 
projects/programmes of any other nature to be identified in future by member states. </p>

System (TRAINS) was signed in February 1993. The global aim of TRAINS is to increase 
transparency in international trading conditions and thus facilitate trade. This was the first 
Agreement of cooperation to be signed by SAARC with an international organisation. Under this 
Agreement, UNCTAD provides the SAARC Secretariat, on a regular basis, an updated copy of 
TRAINS CD-ROM containing latest data on trade control measures prevailing in developed and 
developing countries. The SAARC Secretariat in turn updates trade control measures prevailing in 
the SAARC member states on a regular basis and forwards the same to UNCTAD Secretariat, on 
computer floppies for incorporation in the updated versions of TRAINS CD-ROM. </p>
<p>SAARC Secretariat has now data on trade control measures prevailing in 50 countries including 
most of the SAARC member countries. The target of UNCTAD is to include latest trade control 
measures of 100 countries of the world in this PC-based information system. This information is 
available to SAARC member states on request. </p>
<p><em><b>2. ESCAP</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>A Framework Agreement for cooperation between SAARC and ESCAP was signed in February 
1994. The Agreement provides for cooperation on development issues through joint studies,

human resource development, trade promotion, foreign direct investment, environmental protection 
and prevention of drug trafficking, infrastructure development etc. </p>

Children in Especially Difficult Circumstances (GCEDC); mid-decade goals on Children emanating 
from the World Summit for Children (1990) and certain aspects of the United Nations Convention

strategies to meet these challenges. </p>

<p><em><b>5. UNDP</b></em><em> </em></p>
<p>A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between SAARC and UNDP was signed by the 
SAARC Secretary-General and Administrator of UNDP in July 1995. The MOU embodies a 
general agreement for broad-based collaboration with the aims and purposes of promoting 
sustainable human development for attaining poverty elimination, preservation and protection of
