<p><i>The Declaration of the Seventh SAARC Summit of the Heads of State or Government of 
Member Countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on 11th 
April 1993.</i></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></font></p>
<p>1. The Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Her Excellency Begum Khaleda 
Zia, the King of Bhutan, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the Prime Minister of the Republic 
of India, His Excellency Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, the President of the Republic of Maldives, His 
Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the Prime Minister of Nepal, the Rt. Hon. Girija Prasad 
Koirala, the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, His Excellency Mr. Mohammed 
Nawaz Sharif and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Shri Lanka, His Excellency 
Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa met at the Seventh Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation (SAARC) at Dhaka, Bangladesh on 10 - 11 April, 1993.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>REGIONAL COOPERATION </b></font></p>
<p align=left>2.	The Heads of State or Government reiterated their commitment to the principles and objectives 
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), to the five principles of 
peaceful co-existence, the UN Charter and non-alignment. The Heads of State or Government 
noted the progress achieved in regional cooperation under the aegis of SAARC. They felt that time 
was now opportune for SAARC to provide a further dynamic impetus to activities in the core areas 
of economic, social and cultural cooperation in the SAARC region.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>INTEGRATED PROGRAMME OF ACTION (IPA)</b></font></p>
<p>3.	The Heads of State or Government welcomed the recent specific steps taken to consolidate and 
further streamline IPA-related SAARC activities. They also stressed the need for a progressive 
movement towards undertaking more well-defined, target-oriented and time- bound projects and 
programmes to ensure tangible benefits for the peoples of South Asia.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE IPA</b></font></p>
<p>4.	The Leaders welcomed the recent decisions to institutionalize cooperation in the core areas. </p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>MORE BUSINESS-LIKE AND FUNCTIONAL APPROACH IN THE CONDUCT OF 
SAARC MEETINGS</b></font></p>
<p>5.	The Heads of State or Government approved the recommendations of the Eleventh Session of 
the Council of Ministers for adopting a more business-like and functional approach in the conduct 
of Summit meetings. They also noted with satisfaction the guidelines and procedures approved by 
the Eleventh Session of the Council in this respect relating to other SAARC meetings. They 
decided to meet informally whenever necessary, between Summits.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>CONSENSUS ON ERADICATION OF POVERTY IN SOUTH ASIA</b></font></p>
<p>6.	Conscious that the sheer magnitude and complexity of South Asian poverty constituted a major 
political and economic challenge, the Heads of State or Government reiterated their commitment to 
continue to accord a high priority to its eradication from the region in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>7.	They pledged to overcome this challenge through the implementation of appropriate pro-poor 
development strategies at macro and micro levels.	</p>
<p>8.	In this context, the Heads of State or Government welcomed the Report of the Independent 
South Asian Commission on Poverty Alleviation established at the Colombo Summit. The Report 
provided valuable insight and illustrative examples of successful poverty alleviation programmes in 
individual Member States.</p>
<p>9.	Acknowledging that the abiding human qualities of dignity, creativity and productive potential are 
eroded by chronic poverty, the Heads of State or Government reiterated their commitment to 
empowering the poor for enhanced growth, consistent with human development and equity.</p>
<p>10.	The Heads of State or Government committed their Governments unequivocally to the 
eradication of poverty in South Asia, preferably by the year 2002 A.D. through an Agenda of 
Action, which would, inter-alia, embody :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-	A strategy of social mobilization involving the building of organizations of the poor 
and their empowerment through appropriate national support mechanisms, with the 
assistance of respective Governments;<br>
-	A policy of decentralized agricultural development and sharply focussed 
household level food security through universal provision of `Daal-Bhaat' or basic 
nutritional needs;<br>
-	A policy of decentralized small scale labour intensive industrialization, with the 
choice of efficient and cost-effective technology;<br>
-	A policy of human development, including the enhancement of the social role and 
status of poor women, the provision of universal primary education, skill 
development, primary health care, shelter for the poor and protection of children; -	
A policy to support the above initiatives with adequate financial resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>11.	The Heads of State or Government stressed that within the overall conceptual approach of 
`Daal-Bhaat', the right to work and the right to primary education should receive priority.</p>
<p>12.	The Leaders also underscored the critical link between the success of national efforts aimed at 
poverty alleviation and the external factors affecting growth and development. They urged all major 
actors in the world economic scene, particularly the industrialized countries and multilateral and 
regional financial institutions, and Non-Governmental Organizations to create an enabling 
international atmosphere that is supportive of poverty alleviation programmes in South Asia. This 
would require a new dialogue with donors.</p>
<p>13.	The Heads of State or Government agreed to the follow-up action indicated below :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-	a national level pro-poor plan to be drawn up by each Member State. This plan is 
to be harmonized with the open economy and structural adjustment strategies;<br>
-	to share during the next Summit, information regarding the progress achieved. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>TRADE, MANUFACTURES AND SERVICES</b></font></p>
<p>14.	The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed the need to liberalize trade as early as possible 
through a step by step approach. They underscored that this should be done in such a manner that 
all countries in the region could share the benefits of trade expansion equitably.</p>
<p>15.	In this context, the Heads of State or Government welcomed the finalization of the framework 
Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA). They expressed their deep 
satisfaction over the signing of the framework Agreement. The Leaders stressed that all necessary 
steps should be taken to begin the first round of trade negotiations to exchange trade preferences 
among Member States under the Arrangement. </p>
<p>16.	The Heads of State or Government further underlined the critical importance of urgently 
promoting intra-regional cooperation, particularly in the area of manufactures in order to enhance 
the productive capacity of the Member Countries, and to promote sustained growth and 
development to prevent the marginalization of South Asia's trade interest in the larger global 
context.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></font></p>
<p>17.	The Heads of State or Government expressed their deep concern at the unabated degradation 
of the environment and recurrence of devastating natural disasters. They also underscored the risks 
and dangers involved in overlooking the challenge posed by these problems. They expressed their 
commitment to implementing at all levels - national, bilateral, regional and global - programmes for 
the protection and preservation of the environment and prevention of its degradation. The Heads of 
State or Government recognized that the completion of the Regional Study on the &quot;`Greenhouse 
Effect' and its Impact on the Region&quot; was a significant step forward in promoting regional 
cooperation in this vital area. They also stressed the importance of continuing the ongoing SAARC 
activities in the field of environment.</p>
<p>18.	The Heads of State or Government welcomed the outcome of the United Nations Conference 
on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and underscored the imperative 
need to ensure the flow of resources to successfully implement the wide range of suggested 
initiatives and actions contained in Agenda 21. The Heads of State or Government noted that all 
international actions in the area of environment should be based on common but differential 
responsibilities, collective endeavours and a balanced perspective. Such actions, they stressed, 
must consider the protection of environment, economic growth and eradication of poverty as 
mutually reinforcing. All environmental initiatives, they underscored, must preclude the imposition of 
arbitrary and one-sided pre-conditions and ensure a harmonious blending of environmental and 
development concerns. They further noted with satisfaction the establishment of the Commission on 
Sustainable Development. They urged that the Commission approach environmental problems of 
developed and developing countries in an equitable manner.</p>
<p>19.	The Heads of State or Government expressed their satisfaction over the adoption of a common 
position by Member States prior to the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development. They expressed their determination to continue in future the practice of 
intra-SAARC consultations on matters of common concern.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>POPULATION</b></font></p>
<p>20.	Recognizing the sovereign right of all countries to promote, adopt and implement their 
population policies and mindful of their cultures, values and traditions, the Heads of State or 
Government stressed the need to integrate demographic objectives and population strategies in the 
formulation of the development strategies of Member Countries. In this context, they also noted the 
importance of adequate investment in the health and education sectors for the success of their 
population programmes. They agreed that cooperation among Member States should be 
strengthened, both through sharing experiences and in other practical ways, to enhance their 
capacity to deal with the population problem. The Leaders urged Governments of developed 
countries, as well as all concerned international and regional organizations, to strengthen their 
financial and technical support in the areas of health and education as part of their strategy of 
assistance to developing countries in their development efforts.</p>
<p>21.	The Heads of State or Government welcomed the offer of Nepal to host a SAARC Ministerial 
Conference on Women and Family Health in Kathmandu in October/November 1993.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>SHELTER</b></font></p>
<p>22.	The Heads of State or Government reiterated that housing was a basic right for all people and 
that Governments should act as facilitator and supporter of shelter programmes initiated by the 
people. They urged Member States to continue to work towards the global objective of &quot;Shelter 
for All by the Year 2000&quot;.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>CHILDREN</b></font></p>
<p>23.	Reaffirming their commitment to accord the highest priority to child survival, protection and 
development, the Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that all Member States had 
completed their National Plans of Action on Children. They reiterated their call at the Colombo 
Summit to continue to ensure coordinated follow-up action by Member States on their respective 
plans.</p>
<p>24.	The Heads of State or Government endorsed the &quot;Colombo Resolution on Children&quot; adopted 
by the Second SAARC Ministerial Conference on Children held at Colombo in September 1992 
and urged Member States to implement programmes as appropriate in their respective national 
contexts, to achieve the illustrative goals embodied in the Resolution, and the goals of the SAARC 
Plan of Action on Children.</p>
<p>25.	The Heads of State or Government noted, in particular, the need to take effective measures to 
protect children against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation and agreed to promote 
cooperation among Member States in devising such measures.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>YOUTH</b></font></p>
<p>26.	Stressing that the youth of South Asia constituted a vital resource for national development and 
that mobilization of their latent power was imperative, the Heads of State or Government focussed 
special attention on the needs of the Youth in South Asia and their development.</p>
<p>27.	The Leaders noted that the youth of South Asia faced a number of serious problems requiring 
urgent attention and remedial measures. They welcomed the offer of the Maldives to host a 
Ministerial Conference on Youth in South Asia in 1994 to address the problems of the Youth and 
focus on the broad theme of youth and development. They also agreed to designate 1994 as the 
&quot;SAARC Year of the Youth&quot;.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>PLAN OF ACTION FOR THE DISABLED PERSONS</b></font></p>
<p>28.	The Heads of State or Government while recalling their decision at the Male' Summit to 
observe 1993 as the &quot;SAARC Year of Disabled Persons&quot;, adopted the Regional Plan of Action for 
the Disabled Persons. They urged Member States to take concrete steps to implement the Plan. </p>
<p>29.	They welcomed the offer of Pakistan to host a Ministerial Conference on Disabled Persons in 
September 1993.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT</b></font></p>
<p>30.	While reviewing the situation of women in the region, it was noted with satisfaction that over a 
period of time, the content of regional cooperation which addresses the issue of development, 
gender and equality for women has steadily grown in SAARC. The Heads of State or Government 
hoped that the cooperation thus developed will enable Member States to achieve the ultimate goal 
of bringing women into the mainstream of development with independence and equality.</p>
<p>31.	The Heads of State or Government recalled that in pursuance of their collective will expressed 
in the Male' Summit to observe the 1990s as the &quot; SAARC Decade of the Girl Child&quot;, Member 
States had undertaken to formulate National Plans of Action for the improvement of the condition 
of the Girl Child giving priority to her survival, protection and development. They expressed 
satisfaction that some Member States had already completed this task and others were expected to 
do so soon.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></font></p>
<p>32.	The Heads of State or Government emphasized that cooperation in the field of Science and 
Technology was of utmost importance in order to accelerate the process of development in South 
Asia.</p>
<p>33.	They called for further intensification of efforts by Member States in this important area, 
particularly to facilitate research and exchange of information through networking arrangements in 
the field of bio-technology, genetic engineering, energy modelling techniques and other identified 
areas of cooperation.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>TERRORISM</b></font></p>
<p>34.	The Heads of State or Government reiterated their unequivocal condemnation of all acts, 
methods and practices of terrorism as criminal. They strongly deplored the adverse consequences 
of terrorism.</p>
<p>35.	They noted with grave concern that the efforts to combat the growing threat of terrorism had 
resulted in the diversion of valuable scarce resources from urgent development programmes.</p>
<p>36.	The Leaders reiterated the need to give high priority to the enactment of enabling legislation at 
the national level to give effect to the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism, 
while urging the Member States which had not yet done so, to make every effort to finalize this 
matter before the Eighth SAARC Summit.</p>
<p>37.	While recognizing that some progress had been achieved in the fields of consultation and 
exchange of information, they stressed the need for further enhancing cooperation in these fields as 
well as for coordinated action. They called for the expeditious implementation of the 
recommendations formulated for advancing cooperation in this regard in pursuance of their decision 
at the Colombo Summit.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ABUSE</b></font></p>
<p>38.	The Heads of State or Government reiterated their grave concern at the growing menace of 
drug trafficking in the region and the aggravation of the problem of drug abuse among the South 
Asian population, particularly the youth.</p>
<p>39.	They recognized the devastating impact of drug abuse on the very fabric of society and the 
serious threat to security and stability posed by drug trafficking through its growing linkages with 
organized crime, illicit arms trade and terrorism.</p>
<p>40.	The Heads of State or Government were gratified to note the expanding cooperation among 
Member States to combat and eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking and drug abuse.</p>
<p>41.	They reiterated the need for further strengthening cooperation in this field and called for the 
expeditious implementation of the recommendations formulated for this purpose in pursuance of 
their decision at the Colombo Summit.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>SECURITY OF SMALL STATES</b></font></p>
<p>42.	The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to pay special attention to the 
monitoring of the security of small States and underscored the need to consider special measures of 
support to preserve their sovereign independence, territorial integrity and the well-being of their 
people. They further noted that real protection of small and weaker States should be firmly rooted 
in the Rule of Law and strict adherence to universally accepted principles and norms relating to the 
sovereign rights and territorial integrity of all States - big or small. This, they stressed, should be 
ensured by all countries either severally or collectively through the pursuit of appropriate actions.</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACT</b></font></p>
<p>43.	The Heads of State or Government stressed the need to further promote people-to-people 
contact in order to ensure increased involvement of peoples of South Asia in the process of 
regional cooperation. In this context, they noted that the formulation of guidelines and procedures 
for extending recognition to regional apex bodies would facilitate participation of these bodies in 
promoting regional cooperation at the people-to-people level.</p>
<p>44.	The Leaders expressed the hope that the recent recognition of the SAARC Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry would contribute positively to enhancing cooperation in the crucial areas 
of trade and economic relations.</p>
<p>45.	The Heads of State or Government expressed their appreciation to the Government and people 
of India for hosting the First South Asian Festival of SAARC Countries in 1992. The Festival 
provided the people of the region the opportunity to share in the rich cultural heritage of South 
Asia. The Heads of State or Government hoped that the South Asian Festival would become a 
regular feature.</p>
<p><b>ASSOCIATION OF SAARC SPEAKERS AND PARLIAMENTARIANS</b></p>
<p>46.	The Heads of State or Government welcomed the initiative of the Speakers of Parliaments of 
SAARC Countries in forming an &quot;Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians&quot;. They 
were of the view that the establishment of this Association would add another important dimension 
to the process of regional cooperation.</p>
<p><b>SOUTH ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND</b></p>
<p>47.	The Heads of State or Government endorsed the recommendation of the Council of Ministers 
for the establishment of an Inter-Governmental Group (IGG) on South Asian Development Fund 
(SADF) on an ad-hoc basis. They directed that the IGG define in clear terms the size, structure, 
resources and operational modalities of the proposed Fund. They also directed the IGG to examine 
the complementarities between the SAARC Fund for Regional Projects (SFRP) and SADF, and 
their relationship, including the possibility of their merger. They welcomed the offer of the Maldives 
to host the meeting of IGG.</p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS</b></p>
<p>48.	The Heads of State or Government had wide-ranging discussions on the current global political 
trends and future prospects, particularly those issues that affect South Asia. In this context, they 
reiterated their deep commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and reaffirmed 
their resolve to strengthen the United Nations as the central instrument for peace, security, 
disarmament, development and cooperation among the nations of the world. To this end, the 
Leaders supported all constructive initiatives aimed at strengthening the United Nations. They, 
however, underscored that any move to adapt or reform the United Nations must be undertaken 
with the sole objective of rendering the United Nations more democratic, efficient and effective and 
not to limit the focus of its attention to a narrow and isolated range of objectives.</p>
<p>49.	The Heads of State or Government reiterated their firm commitment to the principles and 
objectives of the Non-aligned Movement and underlined the continued validity and relevance of 
these principles and objectives in the contemporary global political and economic context. They 
recalled the important role the Movement had been playing in strengthening international peace, 
promoting development and establishing more equitable and just economic relations and enhancing 
international cooperation in all areas. They expressed their deep conviction that the Movement's 
innate strength uniquely equipped it to continue to play a most constructive role in laying the 
foundations and defining the characteristics of a new world order which should be based on the 
principles of justice, equity and democracy in international relations. In this context, the Heads of 
State or Government welcomed the success of the Jakarta Summit of the Non-aligned countries 
and called for the expeditious implementation of its decisions.</p>
<p>50.	The Heads of State or Government noted that the end of the cold war presented new 
opportunities and challenges. They observed that despite many positive developments and recent 
successes in resolving some regional conflicts, the international political scene was still marred by 
strife and tension. They expressed their serious concern over the unfortunate and tragic 
consequences of ethnic conflict and violence afflicting people and communities in many parts of the 
world. They stressed that efforts must be intensified to find peaceful and viable solutions to conflicts 
of long standing nature and new problems through greater respect for international law and 
universally accepted humanitarian norms and standards.</p>
<p>51.	The Heads of State or Government noted a number of recent positive developments in the area 
of nuclear, chemical and conventional disarmament including the agreements on bilateral arms 
reductions between the United States and the Russian Federation. They expressed their hope that 
the implementation of the far-reaching arms reduction agreed in the Washington Agreement of June 
1992 and START II signed in Moscow in January 1993 would be successfully carried out. The 
Leaders urged all Nuclear-Weapon States to collectively endeavour to attain the ultimate goal of 
complete elimination of nuclear arsenals in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>52.	They also underscored the imperative to further broaden and deepen the dimensions to 
disarmament and to complement bilateral approaches to disarmament with effective multilateral 
approaches. While welcoming the recent progress in arms reduction at the global level, the Leaders 
were convinced that this objective could be best achieved through the promotion of mutual trust 
and confidence among Member States.</p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ISSUES</b></p>
<p>53.	The Heads of State or Government noted that while it was important to build peace and create 
conditions of stability in the world, it was equally important to promote economic and social 
development. They underscored that international cooperation for development and eradication of 
poverty were inextricably linked with the preservation of international peace and security and hence 
needed to be treated on an equal footing and pursued with equal vigour. The Heads of State or 
Government expressed their grave concern over the continuing deterioration in economic situation 
in the majority of developing countries. The economies of developing countries, they observed, 
continued to suffer as a result of limited market access for their exports, dwindling resource flows, 
absence of adequate foreign investment, mounting external indebtedness, inadequate transfer of 
technology and the inequities in the global monetary, financial and trading systems. The Heads of 
State or Government noted that although the developing countries themselves had the primary 
responsibility for their economic development, the role of developed countries remained central to 
the revival of the growth of the world economy - in particular the economies of the developing 
countries.</p>
<p>54.	The Heads of State or Government reiterated the vital importance of economic 
interdependence among nations and of the need for reviving North-South dialogue. They fully 
endorsed the view that there should be more equitable economic opportunities for all nations. 
These should include such important features as the strengthening of a free, open and 
non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, effective macro-economic coordination and fiscal 
discipline to ensure stable conditions conducive to development in the global economy. They also 
reiterated their firm support for the broadening of the coordination of international macro-economic 
policies to take into account concerns of all countries, specially the developing countries. Referring 
to the competing demands for capital and investment resources, the Heads of State or Government 
underscored the need to ensure the adequate flow of investment resources to the developing 
countries through increasing global savings and a more equitable utilization of the peace dividends. 
In this context the Heads of State or Government also underscored the need to fulfil the 
internationally agreed aid targets for the developing countries and the Least Developed Countries. 
They emphasized on the need for exceptional finance to facilitate implementation of economic 
reform programmes in SAARC Countries.</p>
<p>55.	The Heads of State or Government also strongly underlined the need to continue efforts to seek 
a comprehensive, durable and growth-oriented solution to the external indebtedness of the 
developing countries. This, they stressed, was essential to accelerate the process of growth in these 
countries. A lasting solution to the debt crisis, the Heads of State or Government noted, must take 
into account the need to significantly reduce the stock and service of all types of debts of indebted 
developing countries to augment the concessional aid flows to SAARC Countries and work out 
anticipatory measures to prevent the recurrence and proliferation of the debt problem.</p>
<p>56.	The Heads of State or Government also underlined the importance of a strengthened and 
liberalized international trading system. In this context, they noted that the successful conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations was a matter of great importance to the 
developing countries. Failure of the Round, the Leaders noted, would only further impair economic 
growth and encourage protectionist policy seriously weakening the multilateral trading system. The 
Heads of State or Government strongly urged the major partners in the Negotiations to 
demonstrate their political will and take positive steps to ensure without further delay a satisfactory 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round. They further stressed that although the main thrust of these 
negotiations in the recent past had been in respect of new issues, there was an imperative need to 
ensure that the Uruguay Round fully take into account the concerns and interests of developing 
countries. This, the Heads of State or Government stressed, was particularly important. The 
Leaders underscored the need to speedily conclude the current round of negotiations in a 
transparent, balanced and expeditious manner. They also stressed that before the conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, an evaluation of results be held from the point 
of view of developing countries.</p>
<p>57.	The Heads of State or Government expressed their concern over the increasing stock of 
anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations against the exports of developing countries and 
the new threats to a liberal trading order in the form of measures taken in pursuit of the goals 
relating to workers' rights and the environment.</p>
<p><b>PROJECTION OF COLLECTIVE POSITIONS</b></p>
<p>58.	The Heads of State or Government were of the view that greater consultations among the 
delegations of SAARC Countries in all international fora on the major issues of common concern to 
them would be in the interest of all their countries. They felt that the development of collective 
positions on such issues in the international fora would enhance the international profile of South 
Asia and would enable the countries in the region to articulate their position on them more 
effectively. They reiterated their common resolve to concert their position in all international fora 
and negotiations with a view to deriving maximum benefits from them in accordance with their 
needs and common priorities.</p>
<p>59.	The Heads of State or Government underscored the vital importance attached by their 
countries to the forthcoming Second World Conference on Human Rights in 1993, the World 
Population Conference in 1994 and the 1995 World Conference on Women. They also supported 
the convening of a World Summit for Social Development. The Heads of State or Government 
stressed the need to develop a common South Asian perspective on the issues to be discussed by 
these important international conferences. They also underscored the imperative to coordinate the 
position of SAARC countries in order to ensure a balanced equitable and action oriented outcome 
of these conferences.</p>
<p><b>OBSERVER STATUS</b></p>
<p>60.	The Heads of State or Government decided that an Expert Group of the Member States will 
examine the various requests for observer status at SAARC/SAARC meetings in all its aspects on 
the basis of a working paper to be prepared by the Secretariat and make appropriate 
recommendations to the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee. In this respect, they 
welcomed the offer of Sri Lanka to host the Expert Group Meeting.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>61.	The Heads of State or Government expressed their deep satisfaction over the positive outcome 
of the Seventh SAARC Summit and expressed their conviction that this Summit would greatly 
contribute towards strengthening the policies and cooperative actions of the Member States in 
response to the challenges of the 1990s and beyond in areas where SAARC has a distinct 
contribution to make. They also reiterated once again their determination to strengthen and enrich 
SAARC as an instrument - endowing it with a clear set of forward looking goals and objectives as 
well as all the requisite institutional capacities - so that it can continue to work to enrich not only the 
lives of its own members but also promote peace, progress and stability in South Asia in a larger 
context.</p>
<p><b>DATE AND VENUE OF THE EIGHTH MEETING OF THE SAARC HEADS OF 
STATE OR GOVERNMENT</b></p>
<p>62.	The Heads of State or Government gratefully accepted the offer of India to host the Eighth 
SAARC Summit in 1994.</p>
<p>63.	The Heads of State or Government of Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka expressed their sincere appreciation for the exemplary manner in which the Prime Minister 
of Bangladesh had conducted the Meeting and guided its proceedings in her capacity as 
Chairperson. They expressed their deep gratitude for the warm and generous hospitality extended 
to them by the Government and people of Bangladesh and for the excellent arrangements made for 
the Meeting.</p>
