<p>The Meeting was inaugurated by Secretary, Ministry of Education, A.H.M. Abdul Hye, who in his 
statement stated that the Technical Committee is not merely the forum for exchange of views and 
experiences but more importantly, a mechanism to identify areas of cooperation either through

coordinators had not been started in all countries. The Committee laid special emphasis on 
expediting the formulation of Action Plans during 1996 under the seven priority themes focusing on

make best use of the resource endowments of the region as well as the wealth of scientific and 
technological knowledge to accelerate the development of the agriculture sector in the region. 
SAARC activities, he stressed, would be much more fruitful if increasing emphasis is laid on 
result-oriented programmes in keeping with the stipulations of the SAARC Charter. He also noted 
that programmes in agricultural sector should increasingly focus on transfer of technology, human 
resources development and harnessing of natural resources in the region. Given that research and 
extension are crucial to the development of the agricultural sector, he also observed that these two 
should be the core areas of cooperation. </p>
<p>The meeting held extensive discussions on a wide range of issues. It also took a number of 
important decisions with significant bearing for regional cooperation in South Asia in the key sector 
of agriculture. It decided to prepare a precise list of priorities for its future activities and stressed 
that all its future activities should conform to this list of priorities. The meeting also recommended 
that all future activities of the Committee should conform to this list drawn up by duly taking into 
account the important common concerns of the member states. During this Meeting, the 
participants from member countries also considered a number of concrete programmes and 
projects for implementation by all member countries. Discussion on these projects highlighted the 
crucial importance of adequate funds for implementation of the projects and the necessity to make 
best use of expertise and know-how available in the SAARC countries. The participants in the 
Meeting also underscored the importance of establishing networking arrangements among 
specialists in the region and various institutions working for the sustained development of the 
agricultural sector. It was also felt that if the networking arrangements are so established they would 
significantly contribute to the improvement and interaction and communication among the identified 
focal points. The Committee also considered and adopted its Calendar of Activities for 1996-97 in 
which a number of short term activities on areas such as sustainable development of arid lands, use 
of animal wastes in vegetable cultivation, green manure and legumes, trans-Himalayan fish species, 
and efficient use of fertilizer for crop production were included. </p>

PROJECT DESIGN. </b></p>
<p>A four-day workshop, participated by representatives from SAARC countries, SAARC 
Secretariat, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) and UNDP was held

districts of SAARC countries participating in the project. These fora are conceived to help bring 
together concerned development agencies and other actors involved with the poverty eradication 
programmes at the grass-root level. The workshop recommended the ideal set up of such fora 
which could involve government institutions, local authorities, and organizations of the poor. The 
workshop also suggested the creation of a sub-regional networking of the district-level fora created 
in the participating countries. </p>
<p>The workshop recommended that the district-level fora in the six identified districts of SAARC 
member countries should be immediately constituted on a trial basis to ascertain their practicability 
and relevance in the local context in order to attain maximum impact in terms of improvement in the 
designing and implementation of poverty eradication programmes, enhanced coordination of all the 
relevant agencies and proper reflection of the priority needs of the poor in the planned activities 
through initiating a participatory planning process. </p>
<p>It was suggested that the recommendations of the workshop should be taken up by the member 
countries for further follow-up action. ESCAP and other relevant UN agencies plan to follow-up 
on the project with a number of review meetings during the current calendar year. SAARC would 
also continue to be associated with these efforts within the framework of its various activities 
devoted to eradicating poverty from the region. Active participation of the member states is 
envisaged under the Memorandum of Understanding signed between SAARC and ESCAP. </p>

many other countries which have already gone for privatisation. The deliberations during the 
discussion brought out that there were still grey areas, which would need to be sorted out through 
interaction among the government, the private entrepreneurs, financers and road users. The urgent 
need to prepare model bidding documents and concession agreement for BOT projects and also

highlighted. </p>
