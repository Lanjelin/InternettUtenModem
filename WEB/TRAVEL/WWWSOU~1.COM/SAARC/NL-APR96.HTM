Committee considered in-depth, the draft Memorandum of Under-standing for cooperation 
between SAARC and ITU. There was general consensus among the Member States on signing the 
MOU which would provide for ways and means of ensuring close cooperation and coordination of

<p><b>Technical Committee on</b> <b>Health, Population Activities and Child Welfare meets</b><br>
The Fourteenth Meeting of the Technical Committee on Health, Population Activities and Child 
Welfare was held in New Delhi on 30 April - 2 May 1996. The Meeting was inaugurated by J. C. 
Pant, Secretary, Department of Family Welfare, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India. 
The meting was attended by participants from all Member States. The SAARC Secretariat was 
represented by Director, Liaquat Ali Choudhury. <br>
The Meeting took a comprehensive set of decisions in key areas including :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) emerging problems in the field of communicable and non-communicable 
diseases and need for inter-country cooperation, and <br>
(b) improvement of nutritional standards particularly for children and women in the 
SAARC region.<br>
It also considered the possibility of planning specific SAARC initiatives in these 
areas. In this context, the Committee decided to designate the National Institute of 
Communicable Diseases (NICD) in New Delhi to collect and disseminate 
information on a number of infectious and communicable diseases such as Malaria, 
Tuberculosis, New Strains of Cholera, AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, Japanese 
Encephalitis, Dengue fever etc. The Committee designated NICD, New Delhi to 
act as the SAARC Focal Point for collection and dissemination of information on 
non-communicable diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, 
coronary artery disease, rheumatic heart diseases). On nutrition, the Committee 
stressed the need for closely monitoring the evolution in the nutrition situation in the 
SAARC region and the need for sustained implementation of National Nutrition 
Policy and Plans of Action of Member Countries focused on reducing malnutrition, 
enhancing household food security, provision of micro-nutrients and food 
fortification where necessary. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Committee also carried out Annual Review of the Situation of Children in SAARC Countries 
for the year 1995 in the light of the relevant inputs collected for the purpose from all the Member 
Countries. The Review highlighted the significant progress achieved by SAARC countries in such 
areas as infant mortality, neo natal mortality, universal child immunization and enrollment for primary 
education during the recent years. It, however, also highlighted the necessity for undertaking further 
steps to make substantial progress in certain other areas where progress have been comparatively 
modest. In this context, the Committee recommended that Member Countries should consider 
additional measures to significantly reduce maternal mortality and acute manifestations of 
malnutrition among children and women. The Committee also recommended that the Member 
Countries should also step up efforts to prevent drop out of school going children especially girls 
from academic programmes. In order to further consolidate the gains in the key area of 
immunization, especially with reference to Pulse Polio Immunization, the Committee requested 
Member Countries to have two common dates in all the SAARC countries for Pulse Polio 
Immunization Campaign. Member countries were urged to designate 7 December 1996 and 11 
January 1997 as Common SAARC Polio Immunization Days for the first phase of common 
immunisation. </p>
