<p>Trade Negotiations under SAPTA continue ,The Second Meeting of Inter-Governmental Group 
(IGG) on Trade Liberalisation was held in Islamabad on 7-8 September 1996 to carry forward the 
Second Round of Trade Negotiations under SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA). </p>
<p>The Group reviewed progress in the implementation of recommendations of its first meeting held in 
Colombo in March this year. The delegates informed the meeting of the measures being taken by 
their countries in liberalising trade and reducing tariff rates and exchanged further information among 
themselves. They also exchanged lists of products and information on trade control measures 
applicable on those products. The process of exchange of lists of products was completed during 
the meeting. </p>
<p>An exclusive session was devoted to matters specifically relating to the Least Developed Countries 
(LDCs). The meeting was unanimous in its decision that LDCs deserve special and more 
favourable treatment for the overall benefit of the whole of SAARC region. </p>
<p>The delegates conducted detailed and in-depth bilateral negotiations on trade concessions. The 
meeting agreed that all remaining preparatory work should be completed urgently in order to 
conclude the Second Round of Trade Negotiations at the next meeting of the Group to be held 
shortly. </p>
<p>The Group recommended that the Committee on Economic Cooperation (CEC) consider 
convening a separate meeting of a Group of Experts on Trade Facilitation. This Group of Experts 
should discuss relevant issues including the broad spectrum of trade facilitation measures such as 
transport, professional and financial services, ports, shipping, air transport etc. </p>
<p>The Meeting was attended by representatives of all SAARC Member Countries. Commerce 
Secretary of Pakistan, Salman Faruqui inaugurated the meeting. Highlighting the progress made in 
promoting economic and trade cooperation among the countries of the region, the Secretary in his 
inaugural address stated that the agreement to reduce tariffs on 226 HS lines, though modest, was 
of great significance and an important first step. He expressed his hope that the second meeting of 
IGG and subsequent meetings would carry forward the process to achieve the desired objective of 
creating the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). </p>
<p>The SAARC Secretariat was represented by Director, Ashok K. Attri who also addressed the 
meeting. </p>

<p>Efforts underway for <b>&quot;Joint Promotion of SAARC Region as a Tourist Destination&quot;</b> </p>
<p><b>TOURISM: </b>one of the priority areas of cooperation among SAARC Member Countries - 
participants during their meet in Colombo. </p>
<p>The Sixth Meeting of the Technical Committee on Tourism held in Colombo on 5-6 September 
1996 addressed a number of relevant issues aimed at joint promotion of SAARC region as a 
tourist destination. These include organising joint tour packages, production of joint brochures, 
production of a SAARC trade guide, production of a joint promotional film, SAARC joint 
participation in International Tourism Fairs and implementation of the SAARC Scheme for 
Promotion of Organised Tourism. </p>

tourism for the next five-year period. It recommended the establishment of an expert group to 
prepare such a strategy including quantified goals/ objectives and detailed strategies in a 
time-bound manner. It was agreed that the group should include representatives of the National 
Tourism Organisations, Civil Aviation authorities, and other relevant government agencies like 
Immigration and Customs as well as representatives of the private sector apex bodies. </p>
<p>The committee reviewed progress in the implementation of its earlier recommendations. In this 
context delegates reported on the action taken in their respective countries to implement the Action 
Plan on Tourism and discussed such issues as training, exchange of information and transportation. </p>
<p>The committee welcomed the announcement by Sri Lanka to host the first meeting of the Ministers 
of Tourism of SAARC countries in March 1997 in Colombo. It also welcomed the establishment 
of the Tourism Council of SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) and 
recommended that the Chairman of the Tourism Council of SCCI or his representative should be 
made a permanent invitee for making presentation at all future meetings of Technical Committee on 
Tourism. </p>
<p>The SAARC Secretariat was requested to explore the possibility of entering into a framework 
agreement of cooperation with Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) and World Tourism 
Organisation (WTO), Madrid. </p>
<p>The meeting was held under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Media, Tourism 
and Aviation of Sri Lanka, K. Marimuttu. All Member Countries participated in the meeting. </p>

<p><b>Tourism Council of SCCI holds a Seminar on &quot;COMMON POLICY FOR PROGRESS&quot;</b> </p>
<p>The Second Seminar of Tourism Council of SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry was 
held in Colombo on 2-4 September 1996 on the theme - &quot;Common Policy for Progress&quot;. The 
seminar, attended by delegates from all SAARC Member Countries, was inaugurated by Minister

<p><b>Seminar on the role of Mass Media in Prevention of Drug Abuse</b> </p>
<p>The SAARC Seminar on Role of Mass Media in Prevention of Drug Abuse was held in Dhaka on 
21-22 September 1996. The Seminar was attended by participants from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, 
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>Delegates presented country reports at the seminar. The two-day seminar made a number of 
recommendations, which highlighted the need to develop an effective media policy that would 
sensitise the public through dissemination of proper messages to curb the menace of drug trafficking 
and drug abuse. Such a policy should delineate the code of ethics and help ensure that messages 
through mass media are not damaging and counter productive towards awareness creation and 
prevention. The seminar urged that the media should increasingly propagate a life style free from 
drugs. It also emphasised that appropriate measures should be taken to avoid drug use being 
glamourised on cinema especially given the impact of cinema on its viewers. The seminar also 
recommended that efforts should be made to effectively use folk and traditional media for 
disseminating proper messages of drug abuse prevention in the rural areas as a vast majority of the 
people of South Asia live in those areas. </p>

<p><b>&quot;LITERACY&quot;</b> </p>
<p><strong>Special TV and Radio Programmes to be aired on 8 December 1996 </strong></p>
<p>The Fifteenth Meeting of the SAARC Audio Visual Exchange (SAVE) Committee held in 
Colombo on 3-5 September 1996 auditioned/previewed the special radio and TV joint 
productions on &quot;1996- SAARC Year of Literacy&quot; and decided to broadcast/telecast the 
programmes on 8 December 1996 to coincide with the SAARC Charter Day. Earlier in June 
1996, Colombo hosted a Meeting of Producers, which finalised details of the modalities for the 
production of the programmes. While the joint production of the radio programme was coordinated 
by India, Pakistan coordinated the production of the TV programme. </p>
<p>The committee during its annual meeting reviewed implementation of its earlier decisions. It noted 
the usefulness of the two training programmes i.e.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) Workshop on Transmitter Engineering and Modulation Systems and <br>
(ii) Workshop on Television Studio Measurements, held in Pakistan under 
SAARC-Japan Special Fund and decided to organize on a regular basis in future, 
similar training programmes covering other relevant fields. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the aegis of the Committee, Member Countries marked the &quot;Tenth Anniversary of SAARC&quot; 
by broadcasting the programme &quot;Songs from the SAARC Member Countries&quot;, and telecasting 
&quot;The Land of Music (SAARC)&quot; in all Member Countries. The committee noted that additional 
programmes were also broadcast/telecast by some Member Countries to mark the decade. </p>
<p>The Committee discussed the feedback of SAVE programmes and noted that a recent research 
carried out in Sri Lanka showed that whenever SAVE programmes were broadcast during prime 
time the response was high. Other Member Countries also informed the committee that the SAVE 
programmes are well-received in their countries. It was noted that with the inclusion of SAARC in 
the school curricula in some Member Countries, there was greater interest and appreciation among 
the youth on SAARC activities including the SAVE programmes. </p>

Minister of Media, Tourism, and Aviation of Sri Lanka, Darmasiri Senanayake, who in his inaugural 
address highlighted the important role of SAVE in creating greater awareness of the South Asian 
consciousness among the peoples of the region and emphasised the need to provide political 
leadership to the efforts of technical bodies such as SAVE to encourage them in their work. In 
addition to the regular SAVE programmes, the Committee decided to telecast on 20 Nov'96 in all 
Member Countries a special programme on children titled &quot;Children of South Asia - A vision 
beyond 2000&quot; </p>
<p>The meeting was addressed by the Chairman of Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, D E W 
Gunasekara and Director, SAARC Secretariat, Ahmed Latheef who briefed the delegates on the 
activities of SAVE, particularly since the last meeting of the committee and highlighted those issues 
that need to be addressed during the meeting. </p>
