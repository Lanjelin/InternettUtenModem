<p><strong>SAARC Agriculture Ministers Meet In Islamabad </strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>- Common Position For The World Food Summit Formulated </p>
</blockquote>

<p>THE FIRST MEETING of the SAARC Agriculture Ministers was held
in Islamabad on 8-9 October 1996 to prepare a common position of
the SAARC countries before the World Food Summit scheduled to be
held in Rome from 13 to 17 November 1996. </p>

<p>Inaugurated and presided by Nawab Muhammad Yousaf Talpur,
Minister for Food, Agriculture and Livestock of Pakistan, the
Meeting expressed serious concern at the widespread food
insufficiency and malnutrition in different parts of the world.
It also noted that greater national production supplemented by
meaningful regional and international cooperation to enhance food
production, storage, distribution and strengthening of research
capabilities of developing countries and assured transfer of
technology together with greater flow of development resources
must form the corner stone of all efforts to eradicate hunger and
famine. The Meeting adopted a comprehensive resolution calling
for action at all levels - global, regional and national to rid
the world of hunger and malnutrition. </p>

<p><b><i>SAARC AGRICULTURE MINISTERS MEETING</i></b><i>: </i></p>

<p><strong><i>Resolve to address the problem of food
insufficiency and malnutrition</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>

<p>The Meeting was also addressed by SAARC Secretary General,
Naeem U. Hasan. He drew attention to the fact that poverty
eradication, reinforced by rapid population growth, has proved to
be a daunting element of the food problems and food insecurity of
the developing countries. He stressed that it was imperative to
undertake comprehensive plans and programmes to eradicate poverty
side by side with sustained efforts to encourage rapid growth in
food grain production. The SAARC Secretary General strongly urged
the forthcoming World Food Summit to create an enabling
international environment supportive efforts of developing
countries to attain food security. The Meeting also considered
several issues on the agenda of the World Food Summit and
concrete steps to further intensify intra-SAARC cooperation to
implement effective plans and programmes to address key
agricultural concerns in the SAARC region. </p>
