<p align=center><i>The Colombo Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of the Member Countries of 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on 21st December 1991.</i> </p>
<p align=left><strong><br>
INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>1. The Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Her Excellency Begum Khaleda 
Zia; the King of Bhutan, His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck; the Prime Minister of the 
Republic of India, His Excellency Shri Narasimha Rao; the President of the Republic of Maldives, 
His Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom; the Prime Minister of Nepal, the Rt. Hon. Girija 
Prasad Koirala; the Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, His Excellency Mian 
Mohammed Nawaz Sharif and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, 
His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa met at the Sixth Summit of the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) at Colombo, Sri Lanka on 21st December, 1991.</p>
<p>2. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to the principles and objectives 
enshrined in the Charter of SAARC. They resolved to promote regional cooperation for the benefit 
of their people, in a spirit of mutual accommodation, with full respect for the principles of sovereign 
equality, independence and territorial integrity of all States and in strict adherence to the principles 
of nonuse of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes and noninterference in each other's internal 
affairs. They also reiterated their commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and 
the Nonaligned Movement.</p>
<p>3. The Heads of State or Government emphasised the vital importance of assessing the nature and 
extent of international economic interdependence and of the need for reviving the North/South 
dialogue. They noted the recent developments that had radically transformed the international 
development relationship deeply affecting the prospects for the economies of the seven SAARC 
countries. The Heads of State or Government emphasised the need for vigorously promoting 
SouthSouth economic cooperation to offset the negative consequences of international economic 
developments.</p>
<p>4. The Heads of State or Government also exchanged views on the priorities of their respective 
national economies. They identified, for the further development of their economies, the importance 
of securing less restrictive trading and marketing opportunities for their products, more extensive 
technology and resource transfers to South Asia, debt relief and access on favourable and on more 
concessional terms to resources from multilateral financial institutions. They agreed to keep an open 
dialogue on these aspects through mutual consultations.</p>
<p>5. The Heads of State or Government assessed current international developments in the political 
sphere particularly those that affected the lives of the people of South Asia. They noted the 
changing power structures in international relations and the reduction of confrontations and tensions, 
particularly among the Super Powers. These have contributed to the receding of the threat of 
nuclear confrontation and to agreements on disarmament measures. The Heads of State or 
Government hoped that these developments would restrain the pursuit of military power in all areas 
of the world. They expressed the hope that the peace dividend would be used for promoting further 
development of developing countries. They welcomed the trend towards popularly based 
democratic governments in different parts of the world including in South Asia. </p>
<p>6. The Heads of State or Government observed however that some political issues in particular the 
Palestine question, the final elimination of Apartheid as well as other problems remained unresolved 
despite efforts towards their settlement. </p>
<p>7. In regard to human rights, the Heads of State or Government observed that civil and political 
rights on the one hand and economic and social rights on the other are interdependent and of equal 
importance Human rights issues should not therefore be viewed in narrow and exclusively political 
terms. In this context they underlined the need to view the efforts of States to guarantee human 
rights in their full context, through the pursuit of development for all citizens in conditions of stability, 
which in turn guarantees the enjoyment of human rights of all persons.</p>
<p>8. The Heads of State or Government while reaffirming their commitment to democracy, human 
rights and the rule of law, emphasised the need to ensure that development remains at the centre of 
international attention.</p>
<p>9. The Heads of State or Government agreed to participate in the ongoing process of revitalising 
the United Nations as an effective universal instrument for addressing international issues on an 
equitable and democratic basis, taking full account of the interests and concerns of all states, 
including those in South Asia. Issues such as the protection and preservation of the environment 
and the equitable and sustainable management of global resources, economic development and the 
alleviation of poverty, the suppression of terrorism, drug trafficking and other international crimes 
required global responses and solutions calling for action by all states.</p>
<p>10. In the context of the SAARC Charterobjective to strengthen cooperation among 
MemberStates in international fora, the Heads of State or Government resolved to encourage 
consultations among delegations of SAARC countries at all international fora and to promote 
articulation of joint positions where such action would be in the interests of all. They felt that the 
development of a collective position in international fora would accord them greater credibility and 
enhance the international profile of South Asia. </p>
<p>11. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the Report presented by the Chairman of the 
Fifth SAARC Summit, the President of Maldives, and the Head of Government of Bangladesh on 
the adoption of a more businesslike and functional approach in the conduct of SAARC meetings, 
as well as the Report submitted by the Chairman of the Ninth Session of the Council of Ministers, 
the Foreign Minister of Maldives, on rationalizing SAARC activities. The Heads of State or 
Government also considered other proposals submitted by MemberStates and by the Secretariat to 
make the Association a more effective instrument for the realisation of the aspirations of the people 
of South Asia. </p>
<p>12. They decided that the Standing Committee should meet in special session in Colombo in April 
1992 in order to collate and study all proposals and comments in this respect and to submit a 
report with its recommendations to the Eleventh Session of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>13. The Heads of State or Government reemphasised that regional selfreliance should be resolutely 
promoted through closer cooperation among countries of the Association and that this would help 
mitigate the adverse consequences of negative international developments operating against them.</p>
<p>14. The Heads of State or Government requested the Standing Committee at its Special Session to 
study the question of cooperation between SAARC and appropriate international and regional 
organizations taking into account the evolution of SAARC activities in the core economic areas and 
to report to the Eleventh Session of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>15. The Heads of State or Government noted the progress made by the Integrated Programme of 
Action (IPA) in expanding to cover a number of sectors crucial for the economic and social 
progress of the peoples of South Asia. They were of the view that the challenge facing the IPA was 
to achieve its identified targets within specific time periods. The Heads of State or Government 
welcomed the proposals made and the discussions proceeding in SAARC to heighten the 
effectiveness of the IPA.</p>
<p>16. The Heads of State or Government accorded the highest priority to the alleviation of poverty in 
all South Asian countries. They affirmed that South Asia's poor could constitute a huge and 
potential resource, provided their basic needs were met, and they were mobilized to create 
economic growth. This requires that the poor are empowered and are irreversibly linked to the 
mainstream of development. It was noted that each South Asian country has had significant success 
cases of this approach to poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>17. Recognising that a great majority of these people remain below the poverty line, they evinced 
keen interest in a &quot;Daal-Bhaat&quot;, or assured nutritional standards approach towards the satisfaction 
of basic needs of the South Asian poor.</p>
<p>18. Deeply conscious that primary education is the cutting edge in the struggle against poverty and 
the promotion of development, the Heads of State or Government reaffirmed the importance of 
attaining the target of providing primary education to all children between the ages of 6 14 years by 
the year 2000. They agreed to share their respective experiences and technical expertise to achieve 
this goal.</p>
<p>19. The Heads of State or Government decided to establish an independent South Asian 
Commission on Poverty Alleviation consisting of eminent persons from each SAARC Member 
State to conduct an indepth study of diverse experiences of the seven countries on poverty 
alleviation, and to report to the Seventh Summit, their recommendations on the alleviation of 
poverty in South Asia.</p>
<p>20. The Heads of State or Government were pleased to note the establishment of the Committee 
for Economic Cooperation as an important outcome of the Regional Study on Trade Manufactures 
and Services. They declared their commitment to the liberalisation of trade in the region through a 
step by step approach in such a manner that all countries in the region share the benefits of trade 
expansion equitably.</p>
<p>21. The Heads of State or Government approved that the Inter Governmental Group (IGG) set up 
on the recommendation of the Committee on Economic Cooperation should formulate and seek 
agreement on an institutional framework under which specific measures for trade liberalisation 
among SAARC Member States could be furthered. It should also examine the Sri Lankan 
proposal to establish a SAARC Preferential Trade Arrangement (SAPTA) by 1997. They directed 
that the IGG should meet as early as possible and report to the Committee on Economic 
Cooperation. The Heads of State or Government accepted the offer of the Government of Sri 
Lanka to host the Second Meeting of the Committee on Economic Cooperation at Colombo in 
June/July 1992 at which the report of the Inter Governmental Group would be considered.</p>
<p>22. The Heads of State or Government recognised that the degradation of the environment has 
emerged as a major global concern. While the protection of the environment is a common 
imperative for all humankind, the main responsibility in this regard rests on developed countries 
since most of the emission of pollutants originates in those countries and since they also have 
greater capacity for taking or facilitating corrective measures.</p>
<p>23. The Heads of State or Government called on the international community to address the 
question of unsustainable production and consumption patterns and lifestyles which lead to 
environmental degradation. They were also of the view that environmental standards applicable to 
developed countries may have excessive and unwarranted economic or social costs if applied in 
developing countries.</p>
<p>24. Adequate new and additional resources are needed for developing countries to pursue an 
environmentally sensitive process of development that will banish the underlying causes of 
environmental degradation poverty, malnutrition and unemployment. Such resources should be 
transferred to developing countries on an assured basis together with environmentally sound 
technology at preferential and concessional terms.</p>
<p>25. The Heads of State or Government expressed their conviction that the framework could be laid 
for an equitable global partnership of all countries with a view to safeguarding the environment.</p>
<p>26. The Heads of State or Government noted that in preparation for the SAARC Year of the 
Environment, SAARC countries had taken various national as well as regional measures for the 
preservation of the environment.</p>
<p>27. The Heads of State or Government expressed their satisfaction at the completion of Regional 
Study on the Causes and Consequences of Natural Disasters and the Protection and Preservation 
of Environment. They urged the member countries to promote cooperation amongst themselves for 
enhancing their respective disaster management capabilities and for undertaking specific 
workprogrammes for protection and preservation of the environment.<br>
They endorsed the decision of the Council of Ministers to establish a Committee on Environment 
to: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>- examine the recommendations of the Regional Study <br>
- identify measures for immediate action <br>
- decide on modalities for their implementation and welcomed the offer of 
Bangladesh to hold the first meeting of the Committee in Dhaka.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>28. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction the decision of the Standing 
Committee concerning the time frame to finalise the regional study on the &quot; 'Greenhouse Effect' and 
its Impact on the Region&quot;. They urged member countries to consult each other on key issues 
concerning climate change, Biodiversity and Biotechnology, a global consensus on forestry 
principles, transfer of environmentally sound technology, management of waste and other issues for 
discussion at Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee and the UNCED in 1992 so that the 
concerns of SAARC countries could be effectively articulated and projected, keeping in mind their 
respective national priorities. </p>
<p>29. The Government of India renewed its offer to host a Ministerial Meeting to harmonise the views 
of SAARC countries on these issues before UNCED 1992. The Heads of State or Government 
welcomed the offer.</p>
<p>30. The Heads of State or Government noted the useful activities conducted during 1991 which 
was observed as SAARC Year of Shelter. They decided to continue to work towards the global 
objective of &quot;Shelter for All by the Year 2000.</p>
<p>31. The Heads of State or Government were of the view that Governments should play the critical 
role of facilitator and supporter of the initiatives of the people and nongovernmental agencies in the 
field of shelter. In this role, they should be involved in the provision of affordable sites with secure 
tenure, making housing finance available on an affordable and sustainable basis, providing 
infrastructure development such as water supply and sanitation, energy and waste disposal, 
increasing the supply of building materials at reasonable prices using indigenous resources, 
removing constraints to building activities, and creating maximum opportunities for public 
participation in decision making and management of shelter activities in the overall context of 
poverty alleviation. Such activities would be facilitated by the exchange of experience, personnel, 
research and information among the SAARC countries.</p>
<p>32. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the recommendation on the establishment of a 
shelter information network to be called &quot;SHELTERNET&quot;.</p>
<p>33. The Heads of State or Government accorded the highest priority to the question of child 
survival, protection and development. They welcomed the adoption of a Plan of Action on Children 
for South Asia which incorporated relevant recommendations of the World Summit on Children.</p>
<p>34. The Heads of State or Government noted in this context that some member countries had 
completed their national Plans of Action and urged other member countries to complete their 
respective Plans. They also urged Member States to ensure coordinated followup action on their 
respective Plans. </p>
<p>35. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the offer of Sri Lanka to host a Conference on 
Children in South Asia in 1992 to consider implementation of the regional Plan of Action.</p>
<p>36. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the adoption of the Plan of Action for 1991 
2000 A.D. as the SAARC Decade of the Girl Child. They requested the Council of Ministers to 
ensure an annual review of the status of implementation of the Plan of Action during the decade.</p>
<p>37. The Heads of State or Government expressed serious concern on the spread of terrorism in the 
region affecting the security and stability of all Member States and unequivocally condemned all 
acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal. They deplored all such acts for their impact on 
life, property, socio-economic development and political stability as well as on regional and 
international peace and cooperation.</p>
<p>38. They recognised that cooperation among SAARC States was vital if terrorism was to be 
prevented and eliminated from the region. In this regard they urged Member States to take all 
necessary measures to give full effect to their obligations under the SAARC Regional Convention 
on Suppression of Terrorism. They stressed in particular, the urgent need for the expeditious 
enactment of enabling legislation by those Member States which had not yet done so, for the 
implementation of the Convention and the need for a constant dialogue and interaction among the 
concerned agencies of Member States, including submission of periodic recommendations to the 
Council of Ministers.</p>
<p>39. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the initiative of the Government of the Republic 
of Maldives in drawing the attention of the international community to the protection and security of 
small states. They noted with satisfaction that the resolution submitted by the Maldives to the 
United Nations during the 46th Session of the General Assembly and cosponsored by 65 countries 
including all the members of SAARC was adopted without a vote. They agreed that small states 
may be particularly vulnerable to external threats and acts of interference in their internal affairs and 
that they merit special measures of support in safeguarding their sovereign independence, territorial 
integrity and the welfare of their people.</p>
<p>40. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction the increasing regional cooperation 
in combating the problem of drug trafficking and drug abuse. They expressed serious concern over 
the growing linkages between drug trafficking, international arms trade and terrorist activities. While 
expressing satisfaction at the signing of the SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances at the Fifth SAARC Summit at Mal&eacute;, they urged Member States which 
had not yet done so to ratify the Convention for its entry into force. They also recognised the need 
for greater cooperation, including the submission of periodic recommendations to the Council of 
Ministers.</p>
<p>41. The Heads of State or Government recalled that important initiatives had been taken at the 
Bangalore and Kathmandu Summits which had subsequently resulted in the increased involvement 
of the peoples of South Asia in the process of Regional Cooperation. They welcomed the steps 
being taken by business organisations/ professional bodies, scholars, academics, National Cultural 
Councils and the media in South Asia to form regional entities/ bodies. They called on the Standing 
Committee to expedite the formulation of guidelines for extending recognition to such groups and 
bodies.</p>
<p>42. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the setting up of a SAARC Fund for Regional 
Projects (SFRP) for identification and development of regional projects. They noted that the Fund 
would be managed by a Regional Council of Development Financing Institutions of the SAARC 
Member States and that the First Meeting of the Council would take place in India.</p>
<p>43. The Heads of State or Government requested the Secretary-General of SAARC to set up a 
panel of experts to examine the proposal of His Majesty the King of Bhutan to undertake a 
prefeasibility study for the establishment of a South Asian Development Fund, taking into account 
the views of all Member States.</p>
<p>44. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that the Scheme in regard to the 
entitled categories of Members of Parliament, Judges of the Supreme Court, Heads of national 
academic institutions and the accompanying spouses and dependent children will become 
operational from 1st March 1992. They called for expeditious action to implement the scheme as 
well as to consider other categories eligible for exemption.</p>
<p>45. The Heads of State or Government were conscious of the vast potential being afforded by 
current advances in scientific research for the application of science and technology towards the 
wellbeing of the peoples of South Asia. They agreed that for the South Asian region to derive the 
maximum benefit, scientific and technological cooperation should transcend national frontiers.</p>
<p>46. Recalling the decision of the Mal&eacute; Summit to institutionalise cooperation in the field of 
biotechnology, they welcomed the proposal for the establishment of a networking arrangement 
between Research and Development Centres in the Member States as an important step in 
advancing such cooperation. They also welcomed the emphasis on organised study tours, 
workshops and seminars proposed in the identified areas of cooperation in the field of science and 
technology.</p>
<p>47. The Heads of State or Government gratefully accepted the offer of the Government of 
Bangladesh to host the Seventh SAARC Summit in 1992.</p>
<p>48. The Heads of State or Government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and 
Pakistan expressed their deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which the President of Sri 
Lanka had discharged his responsibilities as Chairman of the Meeting. They expressed their 
profound gratitude for the warm and gracious hospitality extended to them by the Government and 
the people of Sri Lanka and for the excellent arrangements made for the Meeting. </p>
