<p align=center><i>The Islamabad Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of the Member Countries 
of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on 31st December 1988.</i> </p>
<p align=left><strong><br>
INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>1. The President of Bangladesh, the King of Bhutan, the Prime Minister of India, the President of 
Maldives, the King of Nepal, the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the President of Sri Lanka met at 
the Fourth Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation at Islamabad from 
29-31 December, 1988.</p>
<p>2. The Heads of State of Government expressed their deep satisfaction at the progress achieved by 
the Association since the last Summit. They reiterated their commitment to the SAARC Charter 
and renewed their determination to cooperate in promoting the welfare of the peoplesof South Asia 
and to improving their quality of life by eradicating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, 
unemployment and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>3. They recalled that their countries were linked by cultural, social and historical ties and they had at 
their disposal substantial human and natural resources. They recognised that these provided a 
sound basis as well as immense opportunities for regional cooperation. They therefore expressed 
their determination to make optimal use of their resources for the benefit of their people by working 
jointly to pursue their shared objectives. They were aware that by acting in concert they could 
realise the full potential for regional progress, taking into account complementarities and growing 
inter-dependence.</p>
<p>4. The leaders endorsed the decision of the Council of Ministers that any country in the region 
subscribing to the objectives and principles of the SAARC Charter may be admitted as a member 
of the Association by a unanimous decision of the Heads of State of Government.</p>
<p>5. The Heads of State of Government expressed satisfaction at the progress so far made in the 
implementation of the SAARC Integrated Programme of Action. They underlined the need for 
closer cooperation in the activities undertaken under this programme. They took note of the 
measures to streamline and re-orient various SAARC activities to make them more action-oriented 
so as to improve the quality of life of their peoples. They directed that the Secretary General may 
submit recommendation to the Standing Committee which should in turn decide how to streamline 
SAARC activities and make them more effective. They welcomed the establishment of the SAARC 
Agricultural Information Centre (SAIC), as well as the steps being taken for the establishment of 
other regional institutions.</p>
<p>6. The Heads of State of Government lauded the smooth functioning of the SAARC Audio Visual 
Exchange (SAVE) Programme which had proved to be a useful medium for promoting a South 
Asian consciousness amongst the peoples of the region. They decided that SAVE Programmes 
should also emphasise social, economic and technical themes. They also noted with satisfaction the 
successful launching of the Youth Volunteers Programme and the SAARC Chairs, Fellowships and 
Scholarships Scheme. They decided that Education may be included as an agreed area of 
cooperation.</p>
<p>7. The Heads of State of Government expressed satisfaction that the South Asian Food Security 
Reserve had become operational on 12 August 1988. The Reserve would serve as a cushion 
against food shortages and was a tangible manifestation of the spirit of cooperation in the region.</p>
<p>8. The Heads of State of Government noted with satisfaction that the SAARC Convention on 
Suppression of Terrorism had been ratified and had come into effect on 22 August 1988, thus 
reflecting the sincere desire on the part of the Member States to enter into meaningful cooperation 
to eliminate the scourge of terrorism from the South Asian region. They called for the adoption of 
enabling measures by Member States to implement the Convention at the earliest.</p>
<p>9. The Heads of State of Government expressed grave concern over the growing magnitude and 
the serious effects of drug abuse, particularly among young people, and drug trafficking. They 
recognised the need for urgent and effective measures to eradicate this evil ad decided to declare 
the year 1989 as the &quot;SAARC Year for Combating Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking&quot;. They 
agreed to launch a concerted campaign, as suited to the situation in their respective countries, to 
significantly augment SAARC efforts to eliminate drug abuse and drug trafficking. These included 
closer cooperation in creating a greater awareness of the hazards of drug abuse, exchange of 
expertise, sharing of intelligence information, stringent measures to stop trafficking in drugs and 
introduction of more effective laws. They directed that the Technical Committee concerned should 
examine the possibility of a Regional Convention on Drug Control.</p>
<p>10. The Heads of State or Government expressed their deep sense of sorrow and profound 
sympathy at the loss of valuable lives and extensive damage to property suffered during the year by 
Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan as a result of unprecedented floods, cyclones and 
earthquakes. In this connection, they recalled their earlier decision at Kathmandu in November, 
1987 to intensify regional cooperation with a view to strengthening their disaster management 
capabilities and took note of the recommendations of the meeting of the SAARC Group of Experts 
on the Study on the Causes and Consequences of Natural Disasters and the Protection and 
Preservation of the Environment, that met in Kathmandu in July 1988. They expressed the 
conviction that identification of measures and programmes as envisaged by the Group of Experts 
would supplement national, bilateral, regional and global efforts to deal with the increasingly serious 
problems being faced by the region as a result of the recurrence of natural disasters and the 
continuing degradation of the environment. They urged that the study should be completed in the 
shortest period of time so that it could provide a basis for the member countries to draw up an 
action plan for meaningful cooperation amongst the Member States. They decided that a joint study 
be undertaken on the &quot;Greenhouse Effect&quot; and its impact on the region.</p>
<p>11. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that modalities for studies to be 
carried out for cooperation in the areas of trade, manufactures and services had been worked out 
by a Group of Experts, which met in Islamabad recently. They emphasised the need for the 
completion of the studies within the agreed time schedule. They directed that the Fourth Meeting of 
Planners should examine the possibility of cooperation in agreed areas of trade, manufactures and 
services, which would promote the objectives of meeting the basic needs of the peoples of the 
region. The report of the Planners should be considered at the next Council of Ministers meeting, 
with a view to making specific recommendations to the next Summit.</p>
<p>12. The Heads of State or Government reviewed the progress on the Situation of Children in 
SAARC countries. They reiterated their commitment made in the Bangalore Declaration to accord 
the highest priority to the needs of children in national development planning and stressed that the 
concept of Human Resource Development should lay particular emphasis on the welfare and 
well-being of children, especially in the literacy and health spheres. They called for the conclusion 
and adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989. They decided to declare 
1990 as the &quot;SAARC Year of the Girl Child&quot;.</p>
<p>13. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction the effective functioning of the 
SAARC Secretariat and its role in coordinating SAARC activities. They also noted that a 
Headquarters Agreement had been signed between the Secretariat and the host Government. They 
thanked His Majesty's Government of Nepal for the assistance and cooperation extended to the 
Secretariat.</p>
<p>14. The Heads of State or Government noted that the decision to involve regional NGOs or 
professional bodies in SAARC activities, taken at the Fifth Session of the Council of Ministers, 
pursuant to the direction given by the Kathmandu Declaration, was an important step towards the 
promotion of people-to-people contact which has always been emphasised by the Association.</p>
<p>15. The Heads of State or Government stressed the need for closer and more frequent contacts 
among the peoples of SAARC. As a beginning, they decided that Supreme Court Judges and 
Members of the National Parliaments of each member State would be entitled to a special SAARC 
travel document which would exempt them from visas. They further directed the Council of 
Ministers to examine what other categories of persons should be given this facility and to submit 
their recommendations.</p>
<p>16. They further noted with satisfaction the mandate given to the Secretary General by the Council 
of Ministers at its Fifth Session on the question of contacting organisations with similar aims and 
purposes.</p>
<p>17. The Heads of State or Government expressed their determination to give concrete shape to the 
objectives of SAARC. In this context they emphasised the need to progressively carry out SAARC 
activities within a broad framework of a long-term perspective and to harmonize their efforts to 
ensure tangible benefits to the peoples of South Asia as a whole. They were conscious of the fact 
that all South Asian countries faced problems in varying degrees in areas such as food, clothing, 
shelter, education, primary health care, population planning and environmental protection. Towards 
this end they were of the view that all Member States should identity areas of core interest in their 
national perspective plans or prepare such plans and consolidate them into a regional plan to be 
called &quot;SAARC-2000 : A Basic Needs Perspective&quot;, with specific targets to be met by the end of 
the century.</p>
<p>18. They recognised that Human Resource Development is one of the means of realizing these 
objectives. In this context they welcomed the offer of the Government of Pakistan to host a Centre 
for Human Resource Development and directed the Secretary-General to set up a Group of 
Experts from Member States to examine the proposal on the basis of a paper to be prepared by 
the Government of Pakistan and to submit its recommendations to the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>19. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their abiding commitment to the purposes and 
principles enshrined in the UN Charter, particularly those enjoining respect for the sovereign 
equality, territorial integrity and national independence, non-use or threat of use of force, 
non-interference in the internal affairs of other states and peaceful settlement of all disputes. They 
reiterated their faith in the United Nations as the most important forum for the maintenance of 
international peace and security and for the promotion of international cooperation aimed at the 
progress and prosperity of mankind.</p>
<p>20. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction the relaxation of global tensions 
through intensified super-power dialogue on a broad range of international issues and welcomed the 
progress towards the resolution of protracted regional disputes and conflicts. They agreed that 
these developments had enhanced the prospects for disarmament, security, peace and progress for 
all peoples of the world. They appreciated the important role played by the United Nations in 
bringing about these positive changes in the international political environment. They also called 
upon all States to strengthen the capacity of the UN system in all respects to achieve the purpose of 
the UN Charter.</p>
<p>21. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their deep commitment to the principles and 
objectives of the Non-aligned Movement as an important force for strengthening world peace and 
harmony as well as for promoting development with justice and equity. In this context they 
expressed satisfaction over the results of the Ministerial Conference of the Non-aligned Movement 
held in Cyprus in September 1988 and expressed the hope the decisions of the Conference would 
contribute to the reduction of tensions and to the promotion of development. They hoped that the 
current discussions on the improvement in the methodology of the Non-Aligned Movement would 
result in strengthening the movement and enable it to play its role with greater effectiveness.</p>
<p>22. The Heads of State or Government believed that the escalation in military expenditure was a 
major constraint on world development. In this regard they noted that the UN Conference on 
Disarmament and Development had clearly established a link between disarmament and 
development and had provided a valuable framework for future action in this vital area. They urged 
that resources saved through disarmament measures should be diverted in particular to developing 
countries for development.</p>
<p>23. They welcomed the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on 
Intermediate Nuclear Force. They hoped this would be a precursor to further accords to reduce 
strategic nuclear arsenals drastically and to prevent an arms race in Outer Space. They called for 
the early conclusion in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament of a Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty and a Convention to Ban Chemical Weapons. They declared their intention to continue their 
efforts to contribute to the realization of the objective of halting the nuclear arms race and 
eliminating nuclear weapons. They declared their resolve to support every effort to conclude a 
treaty prohibiting vertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>24. The Heads of State or Government noted with deep concern the continued structural 
disequilibrium from which the world economy had long suffered. This had resulted in slower growth 
in the developing countries, downward trends in commodity prices, decline in the net export 
earnings of the developing countries and deterioration in their terms of trade. These developments 
combined with the overwhelming debt burdens, the reverse financial flows from the developing to 
the developed countries and the sharp rise of protectionism in the developed world had further 
aggravated the economic difficulties of the developing countries.</p>
<p>25. The Heads of State or Government emphasised the interdependent character of the economies 
of the developed and the developing countries. They called for the resumption of the North-South 
dialogue with a view to restructuring the international economic system and to establishing the New 
International Economic Order based on justice and equity. They called for coordinated actions by 
the developed and the developing counties to increase the net flow of developmental assistance, 
overcome debt difficulties, expand the access of the developing countries to the markets in 
developed countries, arrest the deterioration in terms of trade of the developing countries and 
stabilize commodity prices.</p>
<p>26. The Heads of State or Government reiterated the need for preserving and liberalizing the 
multilateral trading system with renewed efforts both within and outside the Uruguay Round of 
Multilateral Trade Negotiations. They also underscored the importance of the developed countries 
fully respecting and implementing the commitments made in Punta del Este on &quot;standstill and 
rollback&quot; arrangements. They expressed concern that on account of differences between major 
trading entities on the question of agricultural subsidies, the Montreal Meeting on the midterm 
review of the Uruguay round was inconclusive. They particularly regretted that there was no 
progress in the negotiations on issues of major interest to developing countries such as trade in 
textiles and a Safeguard System. They were disappointed that on some of the issues of interest to 
developing countries on which there was agreement, particularly tropical products, it would not be 
possible even to implement the decisions taken, from the beginning of 1989 as envisaged. They 
emphasised that the development dimension must be taken into account in the negotiations on new 
issues, particularly services and intellectual property rights. They agreed to take concerted action to 
this end in the forthcoming negotiations.</p>
<p>27. The Heads of State or Government fully supported the call for the initiation of a comprehensive 
process for the preparation of an International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations 
Development Decade as well as the proposal of the Group of 77 for convening a Special Session 
of the General Assembly in 1990 to revive growth and development in the developing countries.</p>
<p>28. The Heads of State or Government reemphasized the need for increased resource flows and 
special measures in favour of the least developed countries within the Framework of the Substantial 
New Programme of Action (SNPA) for these countries. They supported the convening of a high 
level United Nations Conference on the least developed countries in 1990 to review progress and 
formulate national and international policies and measures for accelerating the development process 
in the least developed countries during the 1990s, especially in order to help them achieve their long 
term socio-economic objectives.</p>
<p>29. The Heads of State or Government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri 
Lanka expressed their deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which Prime Minister of 
Pakistan chaired the meeting. They expressed their profound gratitude for the excellent 
arrangements made for the meeting and for the warm and generous hospitality extended to them by 
the Government and the people of Pakistan.</p>

excellent arrangements made for the Conference. </p>
