<p><i>The Delhi Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of the Member Countries of 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on 4th May 1995.</i> </p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>
<p>1.The Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, 
the King of Bhutan, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the Prime Minister of the Republic of 
India, His Excellency Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, the President of the Republic of Maldives, His 
Excellency Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the Prime Minister of Nepal, the Rt. Hon. Manmohan 
Adhikari, the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, His Excellency Mr. Farooq Ahmad 
Khan Leghari and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Her Excellency 
Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga met at the Eighth Summit of the South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) at New Delhi, India on 2-4 May 1995. </p>
<p><b>SAARC DECADE</b> </p>
<p>2. The Heads of State or Government expressed their satisfaction on the achievements of the First 
Decade of SAARC and resolved to celebrate its completion of the First Decade both in the 
individual Member States and collectively. They endorsed the proposal of the Council of Ministers 
to convene a Commemorative Session of the Council on the theme &quot;SAARC - Vision for the 
Second Decade&quot; to identify the areas on which SAARC should focus in its Second Decade. </p>
<p><b>REGIONAL COOPERATION</b> </p>
<p>3. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their resolve to intensify regional cooperation in 
order to accelerate the process of promoting the welfare and improving the quality of life of the 
peoples of South Asia. They reiterated their commitment to the principles and objectives enshrined 
in the SAARC Charter, particularly, to the principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, 
national independence, non-use of force and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. They 
recalled their conviction that in an increasingly interdependent world, regional cooperation was a 
dynamic instrument for promoting economic prosperity, mutual understanding and good neighbourly 
relations to achieve the objectives of peace and stability in South Asia. In this context, a climate of 
peace and stability would contribute to the economic growth. </p>
<p><b>ERADICATION OF POVERTY IN SOUTH ASIA</b> </p>
<p>4. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to the eradication of poverty in 
South Asia, preferably by the year 2002 A.D. through an Agenda of Action. </p>
<p>5. The Leaders endorsed the recommendations of the Finance/Planning Ministers' Meeting held in 
Dhaka in July 1994 which recommended that a mechanism should be set up which would act as a 
forum for exchange of information on poverty eradication programmes, in the context of the policies 
and strategies adopted, particularly exchange of information on technologies that are relevant to 
efforts at poverty eradication. They agreed that this process could be strengthened by sharing and 
exchanging relevant studies carried out by independent research institutions and experts. This 
mechanism would be in the form of a three-tier institutional structure as recommended in the Report 
and would meet once a year. They noted that such a mechanism has been set up enabling the 
procedures of exchange of information to commence and welcomed the offer of India to host the 
first round of the three-tier mechanism. </p>
<p>6. The Heads of State or Government directed that the next meeting of Finance/Planning Ministers 
consider the efficacy of such mechanism towards eradicating poverty in the region and report on 
the progress achieved to the Ninth SAARC Summit, through the Council of Ministers. </p>
<p>7. In this context, they decided to declare 1995 as the &quot;SAARC Year of Poverty Eradication&quot;. </p>
<p>8. Acknowledging that the abiding human qualities of dignity, creativity and productive potential are 
eroded by chronic poverty, the Heads of State or Government reiterated their commitment to 
empowering the poor for enhanced growth consistent with human development and equity. </p>
<p>9. Recognizing that poverty is a complex multi-dimensional problem with origins in both national 
and international domains, country-specific programmes to tackle poverty and international efforts 
supporting national efforts and the parallel process of creating a supportive international 
environment conducive to economic growth and social development of developing countries, are 
crucial for a solution to this problem. The World Summit for Social Development recognized the 
need for focusing the attention of the international community on and support the special needs of 
countries and regions in which there are substantial concentrations of people living in poverty, in 
particular those in South Asia and which face serious difficulties in achieving social and economic 
development. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their commitment to eradicate poverty 
and noted with appreciation the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development. </p>
<p>10. The Heads of State or Government committed themselves to addressing the fundamental 
causes of poverty and to provide for the basic needs of all. They reaffirmed their commitment to 
work for guaranteeing the realisation of the rights of all, in particular those of the poor, to food, 
work, shelter, health, education, resources and information. </p>
<p>11. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to provide expanded 
opportunities to the poor to enhance their overall capacities and improve living conditions and to 
adequate economic and social protection during unemployment, disability and old age. While 
recognising the need to improve, expand and deregulate markets to promote sustained economic 
growth they felt it was essential to mitigate any negative features created by the market forces and 
make all efforts to make the markets friendly to the poor. The Heads of State or Government 
reaffirmed the necessity to ensure that financial systems and other public policies are geared 
towards poverty eradication and warned against increase in socially divisive disparities. </p>
<p>12. The Heads of State or Government agreed that the Governments of SAARC countries will 
have to play a lead role in promoting the support structures needed for poverty eradication, 
including people's institutions and non-governmental organisations in the context of organising the 
people and fostering decentralisation and local self-governance and encouraging organisation of the 
poor, in the context of their social and economic interests. </p>
<p><b>SAARC PREFERENTIAL TRADING ARRANGEMENT (SAPTA)</b> </p>
<p>13. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that subsequent to the signing of the 
Framework Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) during their 
Seventh Summit in Dhaka in April 1993, the first round of trade negotiations to exchange trade 
concessions among Member States has been completed. They directed that all necessary steps 
should be taken to facilitate ratification by all Member States and operationalise SAPTA by the end 
of 1995 as mandated. </p>
<p>14. The Leaders reiterated their firm belief that the operationalisation of SAPTA will herald the 
beginning of a new and significant process of regional cooperation and would lend strength to 
SAARC as an institution for promoting the welfare of the peoples of South Asia. </p>
<p>15. In view of the fast changing international economic environment, creation of major trading and 
economic groupings, establishment of the World Trade Organisation subsequent to the successful 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and unilateral economic 
liberalisation measures being adopted by Member Countries, the Heads of State or Government 
emphasised the urgency of broadening and deepening cooperation within a specific and rapid 
time-frame in the core areas of trade and economic relations in the region. These developments call 
for added urgency to achieve more progress towards operationalisation of SAPTA and 
intensification of cooperation to expand regional trade. To that end, they decided that the 
&quot;Components&quot; and &quot;Additional Measures&quot; identified in Articles 4 and 6 respectively of the SAPTA 
Agreement should be implemented. </p>
<p><b>INTEGRATED PROGRAMME OF ACTION</b> </p>
<p>16. The Heads of State or Government noted the progress made through the Integrated 
Programme of Action covering a number of crucial areas and activities. </p>
<p><b>REGIONAL CENTRES</b> </p>
<p>17. The Leaders welcomed the establishment of the SAARC Documentation Centre (SDC) in 
New Delhi in May 1994 and the SAARC Meteorological Research Centre (SMRC) at Dhaka in 
January this year. </p>
<p><b>WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT</b> </p>
<p>18. Noting that increased political and social consciousness in the region had highlighted the issues 
of elimination of gender-disparity and empowerment of women which are essential for their 
socio-economic development, the Heads of State or Government underlined the urgency of 
addressing these issues through further affirmative action. </p>
<p>19. The Leaders endorsed the &quot;Kathmandu Resolution on Women and Family Health&quot;, adopted by 
the Ministerial Conference on Women and Family Health in Kathmandu in November 1993, and 
expressed satisfaction that appropriate programmes were being undertaken to implement the 
Resolution at the national level by the Member States. </p>
<p>20. The Leaders noted the progress in the implementation of the Plan of Action to mark 
1991-2000 as the 'SAARC Decade of the Girl-Child', and requested the Council of Ministers to 
conduct a comprehensive mid-decade review for presentation to the Ninth SAARC Summit. </p>
<p>21. Recognising the serious threat faced by certain groups of Girl Children in Especially Difficult 
Circumstances (GCEDC) including those orphaned, disabled and exploited, the Leaders decided 
that an urgent appraisal of the situation of these children be undertaken by the Council of Ministers 
and specific recommendations be presented to the Ninth SAARC Summit. </p>
<p>22. Considering that the exploitation of the Girl Child is a direct reflection of the status of women in 
society, the Leaders reaffirmed their resolve to take necessary measures to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination against women and girl-children. </p>
<p><b>CHILDREN</b> </p>
<p>23. The Heads of State or Government expressed satisfaction that the annual reviews of the 
situation of children in SAARC countries for the years 1993 and 1994 had been completed which 
indicated reduction in infant mortality and significant progress in the immunisation programme for 
children in the region. </p>
<p>24. Recalling the mid-decade goals of the World Summit for Children, the Heads of State or 
Government resolved to intensify their efforts both at the national and regional levels for attainment 
of these goals. </p>
<p>25. The Leaders welcomed that all Member States have become party to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. They felt that the recently held Cairo International Conference on Population 
and Development (ICPD) in September 1994 and the Copenhagen World Summit on Social 
Development in March 1995 had imparted fresh impetus to the on-going efforts for the survival, 
protection and development of children in South Asia. </p>
<p><b>YOUTH</b> </p>
<p>26. The Heads of State or Government endorsed the Mal&eacute; Resolution on Youth adopted by the 
Ministerial Conference on Youth in South Asia held in the Maldives in May 1994 and noted that 
the Conference had, <i>inter-alia,</i> served to focus attention on the status of the youth and the 
challenges faced by them. The Leaders noted with satisfaction that the Agenda for Action 
incorporated in the Resolution is being implemented by Member States with a view to integrating 
the youth into the process of national development. They noted with satisfaction that the SAARC 
Youth Resolution had been adopted and the SAARC Youth Awards Scheme has been 
established. </p>
<p>27. The Leaders expressed satisfaction on the implementation of the Plan of Action to mark 1994 
as the SAARC Year of the Youth in Member States and resolved to continue the momentum 
generated in Member States. </p>
<p><b>PERSONS WITH DISABILITY</b> </p>
<p>28. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that the Ministerial Conference on 
Disabled Persons was held in Islamabad in December 1993. They endorsed the Islamabad 
Resolution on Disabled Persons and the recommendations of the Conference and noted that the 
Conference had further increased awareness among the peoples of South Asia regarding the needs 
and problems of the disabled persons. They welcomed the activities and programmes launched by 
the Member States in pursuance of the Resolution for the protection and promotion of persons with 
disability. </p>
<p><b>SHELTER</b> </p>
<p>29. The Heads of State or Government, recognising that housing was a basic right for all people 
and that, in addition to governmental efforts, private initiatives of the people and non-governmental 
agencies should be supported, reaffirmed their commitment to work towards the global objective of 
&quot;Shelter for All by the Year 2000.&quot; </p>
<p><b>LITERACY</b> </p>
<p>30. The Heads of State or Government noted that illiteracy is one of the major causes of poverty, 
backwardness and social injustices and called on the Member States to initiate more concrete 
programmes aimed at eradicating illiteracy in the region preferably by the year 2000 A.D. They 
decided to observe 1996 as the &quot;SAARC Year of Literacy&quot;. </p>
<p><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> </p>
<p>31. Reaffirming the need for a concerted action for the protection and preservation of the 
environment, the Heads of State or Government expressed their satisfaction over the formulation of 
a common position by Member States prior to the World Conference on Natural Disaster 
Reduction and the presentation of the collective position at the Yokohama Conference. They 
recognised that international cooperation is vital for building up national capabilities, transfer of 
appropriate technology and promotion of multilateral projects and research efforts in natural 
disaster reduction. </p>
<p>32. The Heads of State or Government expressed their deep concern at the unabated degradation 
of the environment and recurrence of devastating natural disasters. They also underscored the risks 
and dangers involved in overlooking the challenge posed by these problems. They expressed their 
commitment to implementing at all levels - national, bilateral, regional and global - programmes for 
the protection and preservation of the environment and prevention of its degradation. The Heads of 
State or Government stressed the importance of continuing the on-going SAARC activities in the 
field of environment. </p>
<p>33. The Heads of State or Government noted that although some work has been carried out in the 
area of disseminating information on the problems of environmental degradation and their impact on 
the region, progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the SAARC Regional Study 
on the Causes and Consequences of Natural Disasters and the Protection and Preservation of the 
Environment and the Regional Study on Greenhouse Effect and its Impact on the Region, which 
were completed in 1992, had been slow. They stressed the importance of effective and speedy 
implementation of the recommendations of the two Studies and requested Member States to take 
all necessary steps without further delay in vital areas such as sharing and developing scientific 
capabilities to protect and manage the environment. They further directed the Technical Committee 
on Environment to monitor the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of the 
two Studies, and submit a report to the Ninth Summit through the Council of Ministers. </p>
<p>34. The Heads of State or Government recalled the decisions expressed in the Dhaka Declaration 
of April, 1993 on the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED) of June, 1992 and reiterated the urgent need to ensure the flow of new 
and additional resources that are adequate and predictable to successfully implement the 
programmes of Agenda 21. They also recalled the United Nations minimum target for developed 
countries of 0.7 percent of GNP as Official Development Assistance, a target which is yet to be 
approximated by most developed countries. The Heads of State or Government also noted that 
international actions in the area of environment protection should be based on partnership and 
collective endeavours and should reflect the principle enunciated in the UNCED, of common but 
differentiated responsibilities. Integral to such actions is the promotion of economic growth in 
developing countries, that is both sustained and sustainable and direct action in eradicating poverty. </p>
<p>35. The Heads of State or Government also noted that the Commission on Sustainable 
Development set up to monitor the implementation of the Rio agreements has met thrice since their 
earlier meeting and expressed the hope that the Commission would be able to facilitate the 
necessary flow of resources and technology. </p>
<p>36. The Heads of State or Government also noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity and 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have both come into force and the 
first meetings of the Conferences of Parties to each Convention have been held. Welcoming these 
developments they urged that developing countries should be assisted in meeting their commitments 
under the Conventions. The establishment of the restructured Global Environment Facility (GEF) is 
a beginning in this direction. However, the Heads of State or Government urged that funds of a 
much larger order would be necessary if the needs of the Conventions are to be met. </p>
<p><b>TERRORISM</b> </p>
<p>37. The Heads of State or Government expressed serious concern on the spread of terrorism in 
and outside the region and reiterated their unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and 
practices of terrorism as criminal. They deplored all such acts for their ruinous impact on life, 
property, socio-economic development and political stability as well as on regional and international 
peace and cooperation. </p>
<p>38. The Heads of State or Government once again emphasised that highest priority should be 
accorded to the enactment of enabling legislation at the national level to give effect to the SAARC 
Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism. They urged Member States, which had not yet 
done so, to enact expeditiously enabling legislation at the national level to implement the convention 
and reiterated the need for a constant dialogue and interaction among the concerned agencies of 
Member States, including submission of periodic recommendations to the Council of Ministers. </p>
<p>39. They underlined that cooperation among SAARC Member States was vital if the scourge of 
terrorism was to be eliminated from the region. </p>
<p><b>DRUG TRAFFICKING</b> </p>
<p>40. The Heads of State or Government recognised that drug abuse and drug trafficking with its 
linkages with organised crime, illicit arms trade and terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to 
the security and stability in the region. </p>
<p>41. While noting the efforts made by Member States as well as the regional cooperation underway 
to combat this pernicious trade, the Leaders stressed the urgency of further strengthening the 
process of cooperation. </p>
<p>42. The Leaders welcomed the ratification of the SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances by all Member States and entry into force of the Convention in 
September 1993. They urged all Member States to take necessary follow-up action for effective 
implementation of the Convention. </p>
<p><b>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY </b></p>
<p>43. The Heads of State or Government reiterated that cooperation in the area of Science and 
Technology should be accorded high priority. Noting that some progress had been made towards 
establishment of networking arrangements, <i>inter-alia,</i> in the fields of Bio-Technology, Genetic 
Engineering, Energy Modelling Techniques and Low-Cost Housing and Building Technologies, the 
Leaders called for further acceleration of this process. </p>
<p><b>PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACT</b> </p>
<p>44. Reiterating their earlier resolve to further promote people-to-people contact through increased 
involvement of the peoples of South Asia in the process of regional cooperation, the Heads of State 
or Government noted with satisfaction that such interaction has been taking place through various 
fora both within and outside the SAARC framework and has contributed to the promotion of 
mutual understanding in the region. </p>
<p>45. The Leaders noted that SAARCLAW (an association for persons of the legal communities of 
SAARC countries) had been accorded recognition by SAARC. The Leaders hoped that 
SAARCLAW would play an effective role in fostering closer cooperation among the legal 
communities in the region. </p>
<p>46. The Leaders noted with satisfaction that the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
(SCCI) has been functioning satisfactorily. They expressed hope that the SAARC Chamber and its 
constituent units in the Member States will do their utmost to promote trade and economic 
cooperation in the SAARC region. The Leaders commended the SAARC Chamber for 
disseminating information on the scope, content and potentials of SAARC Preferential Trading 
Arrangement (SAPTA) among the business community in the region. </p>
<p>47. The Heads of State or Government expressed satisfaction that the SAARC Visa Exemption 
Scheme is being implemented smoothly and has enhanced the scope of people-to-people contacts. </p>
<p><b>SOUTH ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND (SADF) </b></p>
<p>48. The Heads of State or Government endorsed the establishment of a three-window South Asian 
Development Fund with the merger of SAARC Fund for Regional Projects and the SAARC 
Regional Fund and a third window for social development and infrastructure development. </p>
<p><b>PROJECTION OF COLLECTIVE POSITIONS</b> </p>
<p>49. The Heads of State or Government recalled their decision taken at the Seventh SAARC 
Summit regarding development of collective positions in international fora on such issues as would 
enhance the international profile of South Asia and would enable the Member States to articulate 
their position on them more effectively. They noted that Council of Ministers had formulated a 
procedure for projection of SAARC collective positions at such international fora. </p>
<p>50. They noted with satisfaction that pursuant to the decision at the Seventh SAARC Summit, 
collective positions were formulated by Member States which were presented at the World 
Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction and the World Summit for Social Development. The 
Leaders also noted with satisfaction that a SAARC collective position will also be presented at the 
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in September 1995. </p>
<p><b>SECURITY OF SMALL STATES</b> </p>
<p>51. The Heads of State or Government reaffirming their commitment to universally accepted 
principles and norms relating to the sovereign rights and territorial integrity of all States, recognised 
that small States, because of their particular problems, required special measures of support for 
safeguarding their independence and territorial integrity. They reiterated that real protection of small 
and weaker States should be firmly rooted in the rule of law. This, they stressed should be ensured 
by all countries either severally or collectively through the pursuit of appropriate actions. </p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS</b> </p>
<p>52. The Heads of State or Government noted that the end of the Cold War had resulted in 
fundamental changes in the political landscape. It was therefore important that a new idiom be 
found to address new concerns. The disappearance of the confrontation between the two power 
blocs presented an opportunity towards building a genuine consensus for a new international order. </p>
<p>53. The Heads of State or Government had wide ranging discussions on the current global political 
trends and future prospects, particularly those issues that concern South Asia. In this context, they 
reiterated their deep commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and reaffirmed 
their resolve to strengthen the United Nations as the central instrument for peace, security, 
disarmament, development and cooperation among the nations of the world. While pledging their 
support to all constructive initiatives aimed at strengthening the United Nations, the Leaders 
emphasised that such initiatives must be undertaken with the sole objective of rendering the United 
Nations and all its organs more democratic, efficient and effective and not to limit the focus of its 
attention to a narrow and isolated range of objectives. </p>
<p>54. Appreciating the role of some SAARC Member States in the UN Peace Keeping Operations 
in various parts of the world, the Heads of State or Government felt that such participation had 
contributed towards maintenance of peace and security in the world. </p>
<p>55. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their firm commitment to the principles and 
objectives of the Non-aligned Movement and underlined the continued validity and relevance of 
these principles and objectives in the contemporary world. They recalled the stabilising role played 
by the Movement in global affairs since its inception. They expressed their deep conviction that the 
Movement's innate strength equipped it to continue to play a most constructive role in laying the 
foundations of a new world order based on the rule of law, non-discrimination, equity and 
cooperation. </p>
<p>56. The Heads of State or Government noted that while the international community had 
successfully created the norm against chemical and biological weapons, it had, unfortunately, been 
unable to do the same with regard to nuclear weapons. The Leaders were convinced that more 
needs to be done and at a far greater pace. Reiterating that the utmost priority was to be given to 
nuclear disarmament, given the danger posed by nuclear weapons, they urged the Conference on 
Disarmament to negotiate an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear 
weapons under any circumstances and undertake negotiations for the complete elimination of all 
nuclear weapons within a time bound framework. </p>
<p>57. The Heads of State or Government expressed their strong commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights. They agreed to take all necessary steps to achieve this objective. </p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES</b> </p>
<p>58. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
of multilateral trade negotiations and reaffirmed their commitment to implement fully and as 
scheduled, the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. They also 
welcomed the coming into existence of the WTO and expressed the hope that it would help to 
expand international trade, particularly that of the developing countries. They reaffirmed the 
immediate need to elaborate policies to enable developing countries, to take advantage of 
expanded international trading opportunities, in the context of the full implementation of the Round. 
They called on all countries to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with 
international law, the Charter of the United Nations and enlightened regionalism and globalism that 
creates obstacles to trade relations among States and thereby impedes the full realisation of social 
and economic development. </p>
<p>59. Recognising that the promotion of mutually reinforcing broad-based sustained economic growth 
on a global scale, as well as a non-discriminatory, and multilateral rule-based international trading 
system, provided a basis for social development, the Heads of State or Government called for the 
establishment of an open, equitable, cooperative and mutually beneficial international economic 
environment. They also called for a reduction of trade barriers and promotion of expanded access 
to global markets. </p>
<p>60. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to safeguard the basic interests 
of workers. They called upon countries to refrain from erecting trade barriers in the guise of 
promotion and protection of workers' rights. They deplored the tendency to impose any 
conditionalities on international trade, whether as a &quot;social clause&quot; or as the &quot;environmental clause&quot;, 
while reiterating their commitment to ensuring workers' rights as well as protection of the 
environment. </p>
<p><b>SPECIAL MEASURES FOR THE LEAST DEVELOPED AND LAND-LOCKED 
COUNTRIES</b> </p>
<p>61. The Heads of State or Government noted with deep concern that economic growth in the Least 
Developed Countries and Land-Locked Countries is not satisfactory and emphasised the need to 
take special measures for accelerating the process of development. They reiterated the need to fulfil 
the internationally agreed aid targets for the developing countries and the Least Developed 
Countries. They </p>
<p>emphasised on the need for exceptional finance to facilitate implementation of economic reform 
programmes in SAARC Countries. </p>
<p><b>DATES AND VENUE OF THE NINTH MEETING OF THE SAARC HEADS OF 
STATE OR GOVERNMENT</b> </p>
<p>62. The Heads of State or Government gratefully accepted the offer of the Government of 
Maldives to host the Ninth SAARC Summit. The dates would be finalised in consultation with 
Member States. </p>
<p>63. The Heads of State or Government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka expressed their deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which the Prime Minister of 
India had discharged his responsibilities as Chairman of the Meeting. They expressed their 
profound gratitude for the warm and gracious hospitality extended to them by the Government and 
the people of the Republic of India and for the excellent arrangements made for the Meeting. </p>
