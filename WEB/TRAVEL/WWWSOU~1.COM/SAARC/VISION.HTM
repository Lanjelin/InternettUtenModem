<P>On this auspicious day in December 1985, the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was born with the signing of the Charter
by the Heads of State or Government. The leaders of the seven nations of
South Asia had gathered in this City of Dhaka to create history for the
Region - the creation of an Association that would dispel inter-state rivalry,
mutual suspicion and misgiving amongst the nations and promote the welfare
of the people of South Asia, to accelerate economic growth, social progress
and contribute to mutual trust, understanding and appreciation of one another's
problems. </P>

<P>The idea of this regional grouping, conceived by Shaheed President Ziaur
Rahman in the early Eighties, took concrete shape on 8th December 1985.
That day Shaheed Ziaur Rahman's vision was translated into reality. </P>

<P>As Chairperson of SAARC, I had the unique opportunity of being closely
associated with the Association and the privilege of meeting the Heads
of State and Government during my visits to the SAARC Member States. I
am happy to say that all the leaders had expressed their firm commitment
to the principles and objectives of the SAARC Charter and their resolve
to accelerate regional cooperation for promoting the welfare of the peoples
of South Asia. </P>

<P>The Association had encountered many challenges and problems during
it's ten years of existence. It has not only survived but grown stronger.
The Association has come of age. It is time for stock-taking of our achievements
as well as our failure. It is also a time to look to the future and identify
the important areas on which SAARC should concentrate its efforts in its
Second Decade. </P>

<P>On the happy and auspicious occasion of the First Decade of SAARC, I
reiterate my Government's firm commitment to the noble principles and objectives
enshrined in the Charter of the Association and to promoting the welfare
of the peoples of South Asia through regional cooperation. </P>

<P>The South Asian countries are bound together by ancient ties of history,
geography, trade, culture and traditions. They have also been the victims
of colonialism and imperialism. Sharing the same heritage, it was only
natural that they should welcome and support the idea of a forum for regional
cooperation proposed by the late visionary President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh.
The birth of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in December
1985 heralded a new era in the region with the firm commitment of the founding
member countries to work together to improve the quality of life of their
peoples. </P>

<P>The Association during the past ten years has taken numerous initiatives
in the social, cultural, economic, and technical fields. Well over six
hundred activities have been carried out under the Integrated Programme
of Action, and four regional centres are functioning. The SAARC Food Security
Reserve has been established, and the SAARC Convention on Suppression of
Terrorism and SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances
have come into force. Several programmes to encourage greater people-to-people
contact have been implemented, and travel within the region has been eased
for some categories of persons under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. The
people of the region have taken initiatives to set-up important bodies
such as the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Association of SAARC
Speakers and Parliamentarians, and SAARCLAW which meet regularly. A breakthrough
has been achieved recently in the core economic area of trade with the
launching of the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement, which is
an important stepping stone to trade expansion in the region. </P>

<P>As we embark on the second decade of SAARC, we must turn our attention
to other core economic areas of cooperation, such as money, finance, industry
and energy, if we are to progress and prosper individually and collectively.
We must realize that we now live in a world where economic regionalism
has become the norm. Unless we in South Asia can put our act together and
cooperate, we will be marginalised by the world economy. </P>

<P>My people and I are fully committed to the principles and purposes of
SAARC. We are determined to work together with our South Asian neighbours
to make SAARC a factor for peace and development in our region. </P>

<P>The commemoration of the Tenth Anniversary of SAARC has provided this
opportunity to take stock of our achievements over the past ten years and
to set our goals for the next decade. </P>

<P>The Member States of SAARC have every reason to take satisfaction from
what has been achieved so far. We have had effective and mutually beneficial
interaction in the field of technical cooperation. As the welfare of the
people has to be the test of economic growth, our joint endeavours have
further evolved to the vital social sectors, where issues of crucial and
common concern to our people and region, such as eradication of poverty,
have occupied us. In agreeing upon the year 2002 as the target year for
poverty eradication, we have set our sights high and signalled our determination
to overcome underdevelopment and its attendant ills. </P>

<P>Before the close of the first decade of SAARC, we have embarked on an
ambitious journey in the area of economic cooperation and have shown our
determination to make rapid progress. The bringing of SAPTA into operation
has been a historic step forward and we are committed to the establishment
of a South Asian Free Trade Area preferably by the year 2000 but not later
than 2005. With enhanced trade and economic exchanges, together with expanding
technical cooperation and attention to the social agenda on which we are
already embarked, the vision of SAARC will be realised. </P>

<P>Given the imperative of regional collective endeavour, and speed of
global transformation, cooperation to mutual benefit is the only way open
to us if we have the welfare of our people at heart. The road that lies
ahead of us holds great promise. I am confident that all countries of our
region are united in this objective and will act decisively together in
SAARC towards the bright future which beckons us. </P>

<P>Ten years ago today, the leaders of the seven South Asian countries
launched the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC)
to address the common challenges of social and economic development facing
the region in a spirit of friendship and cooperation, based on mutual trust
and understanding. In a region that is characterised by racial, religious,
and cultural diversities and disparities in development, often exacerbated
by distrust and political conflict, no one doubted that the road ahead
would not be an easy one. Nor did the leaders of South Asia doubt the urgent
need for regional cooperation, in order to raise the living standards of
our peoples, promote social and economic development and strengthen self
reliance amongst the countries in the region. </P>

<P>Today, SAARC has indeed become a reality and an integral part of the
South Asian development efforts. The establishment of the SAARC Food Security
Reserve, the signing of the SAARC Regional Conventions on Suppression of
Terrorism, and on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances represent
important milestones in regional co-operation. The actions taken towards
the alleviation of poverty, the empowering of women and youth, and the
importance given to environmental preservation and disaster preparedness
further consolidate our joint endeavours. The ratification of the Agreement
on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) by all member countries,
and its entry into force as we mark the tenth anniversary of SAARC, is
a promising start for a more liberalised trading regime that will indeed
ensure tangible economic benefits to the region. </P>

<P>While we commemorate the achievements of the first decade of SAARC,
we must be mindful also of the problems that lie ahead. Endemic poverty,
resource limitations, and bilateral disputes of varying degrees continue
to act as constraints to the deepening of regional cooperation. As the
world rapidly transforms in the post cold war period, regional cooperation
in various regions of the world is being accelerated. South Asia, too,
must fall in step. SAARC must rise above historical conflicts and traditional
prejudices and contribute to greater confidence building amongst its members.
It is only in an atmosphere of peace, security and faith in good neighbourliness
that the nations of South Asia can hope to build on the past achievements
of SAARC. </P>

<P>Therefore, on this commemorative day of the coming to a close of the
first decade of SAARC, the Maldives would like to call upon the governments
and peoples of South Asia to join together in celebrating the dawn of its
second decade with a renewed commitment to greater understanding and closer
cooperation in our region. </P>

<P>It is indeed a matter of great satisfaction that South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation has made considerable progress over the last Decade
and has come of age. It has moved ahead towards achieving its objectives
to accelerate the progress of economic and social development in South
Asia. It has also considerably helped in finding solution to their common
trust and understanding based on mutual respect, equity and shared benefit.
</P>

<P>SAARC has moved further in the core areas of poverty eradication, trade
and economic cooperation. A significant step in this regard has been operationalisation
of the Agreement on the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA).
SAARC should now aim at the early realization of South Asian Free Trade
Area (SAFTA) in near future. </P>

<P>Now, as we embark on the second Decade of SAARC which, in my view, should
focus its attention to other core economic areas of cooperation such as
Trade, Industry, Tourism, and Joint Investment etc. People-to-people contact
and socio-cultural heritage in this region has to be strengthened. Time
has now come to harness invaluable resources including human resources.
Technical cooperation within the region has to be promoted for the common
benefit and betterment of the region. </P>

<P>I appreciate the endeavour of the SAARC Secretariat in taking the initiative
in issuing this commemorative souvenir, which I am sure, will help promote
goodwill and friendship amongst the people of the region. </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I am happy to learn that SAARC Secretariat is publishing a special Newsletter
to commemorate the First Decade of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation. </P>

<P>We can be rightly proud of the achievements of our Association in the
first ten years of its existence. While we take stock of the tangible results
of regional cooperation, we must remain cognizant of the less tangible
elements, for they too have provided sustenance and energy to the goal
of advancing regional cooperation. The most significant such element has
been perseverance. Our region has been marked by inequalities, socio-economic
disparities, political upheavals and a painfully slow pace of economic
development. Despite these retardive forces, our Association has remained
on track, and has exhibited great maturity on navigating these debilitating
shoals. </P>

<P>An important factor in our Association's progress has been statesmanship.
On many an occasion, the wisdom demonstrated by leaders has disentangled
complicated situations and issues. I am confident that in the rising decade,
this spirit of accommodation and mutuality will continue to characterize
the conferences and meetings of SAARC. </P>

<P>There is a new and forceful consideration, entering the portals of SAARC,
which carries the promise of even more fruitful cooperation. The increasing
involvement of experts and non-governmental sectors of the region in the
wider range of SAARC activities is a hopeful development. The deeper the
appeal of SAARC, the better its chances of consolidating regional cooperation.
While the mainstay of SAARC shall have to continue to be institutional
cooperation, the people's voice shall have to be heard, and channelized
by their representatives towards durable and realistic purposes. </P>

<P>These intangibles have, and are continuing to influence the structure
and make-up of SAARC as a forum for institutionalized cooperation. I am
certain that SAARC will move ahead, in the coming times, to higher achievements,
a process in which the Secretary General and the Secretariat will be called
upon to play an important role. </P>

<P>I would like to wish the Association and the Secretariat, on this occasion,
all success for the future. </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It is with much pleasure that I send this message on the occasion of
the Commemoration of the First Decade of SAARC. </P>

<P>SAARC is a manifestation of the determination of the people of South
Asia to work together towards finding solutions to their common problems
in a spirit of friendship and understanding based on mutual respect, equity
and shared benefits. </P>

<P>Over the last Decade, SAARC has made considerable progress in realising
the main objectives set out in its Charter, which is to accelerate the
process of economic and social development in Member Countries and successive
Summits advocated the necessity of moving quickly into the core areas of
poverty alleviation and trade and economic co-operation to realise these
objectives. A significant development in this regard has been the ratification
of the Agreement on the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA).
We see this not as a goal in itself but, hopefully, as an intermediate
step in the development of a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). However,
Governmental contribution alone is not sufficient to achieve meaningful
economic co-operation. Private sector involvement is essential and, for
this purpose, Sri Lanka hosted the first - ever South Asian Business Leaders
Meeting in August 1995 to give momentum to the efforts of the private sector
to harness the economic potential of the region. </P>

<P>Additionally, the twin menaces of Terrorism and Drug Trafficking, which
continue to pose serious threats to the security and stability of Member
Countries, have also been recognized as areas in which urgent regional
action was necessary. The SAARC Regional Conventions on Suppression of
Terrorism and on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances were the outgrowth
of this common concern. </P>

<P>While we in SAARC can look back with considerable satisfaction on SAARC's
achievements in the past Decade, much more needs to be done. To this end
I call upon the leaders of all other SAARC countries to join with me in
demonstrating sufficient political will and personal commitment to overcome
the obstructions that lie in the path of reaching our goal of tangible
regional co-operation. </P>

<B>PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA</B> </FONT></I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>Distinguished Foreign Ministers of SAARC member countries, Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen, </I></P>

<P>It gives me great pleasure to be present here at the commemoration by
the Foreign Ministers of SAARC member states on the tenth anniversary of
SAARC. This occasion is indeed a landmark for our region. A decade of this
organization formed for mutual benefit, welfare and advancement, provides
us the opportunity both to look back, and, more importantly, to look forward
to the road ahead and the distance we have to cover. </P>

<P>I believe that we can take satisfaction from the stage we have reached
in forging cooperation among ourselves. At the beginning of our journey,
a question, even if largely unspoken, hung unanswered over what lay ahead.
We had joined in a historic initiative but, at that point, as happens in
many similar ventures, the way before us was uncharted and then pace at
which we could advance was imponderable. I am convinced that ten years
down the road, any vestige of doubt has long been erased. </P>

<P>It was appropriate that we first explored the field of technical cooperation.
It offered a ready arena for fruitful interaction, our problems and challenges
being largely the same and comparable in objectives. Experts instinctively
reach out to each other, and within SAARC we made this possible in a variety
of fields, progressively increasing the scope of the networking in diverse
areas from agriculture, rural development, women in development to environment,
transport, science and technology and others. Experts from one country
have a natural curiosity to profit from the experiences, thinking, results
and goals set by fellow experts from other countries in shared areas of
striving. SAARC has done significant work in satisfying this. </P>

<P>We should, of course, continuously consider how the work of the twelve
constituted SAARC committees could be rationalised and made even more effective.
Deepening and expansion of technical cooperation between us should be an
important goal, even as we review progress from time to time to make it
substantial and effective. We could advance to developing collaborative
projects which address shared needs. This is an area of activity of SAARC
which must be continuously strengthened. </P>

<P>Over the years, our preoccupation has evolved beyond technical cooperation
directly to the social agenda. This has been an important progression because
the centrality of this concern cannot be over-emphasised. Poverty is the
core challenge before us all. Technical cooperation and economic growth
have all to subserve the upliftment of our people from the very base of
the pyramid. All our people have to have to have a share in the dividends
of economic and social progress. Sections of our people at the lowest end
of the pyramid of material benefit cannot be mere spectators to the enjoyment
of the fruits of progress only by those who are already advantaged or better
placed. Any model of development based on uneven rewards will not be supported
by those who are not beneficiaries of planning and growth strategy, and
will put into question the value of the whole enterprise of a dynamic growth
policy in which all of us are engaged. The credibility of any growth strategy
can be ensured only by the participation in it of society as a whole. Ascending
graphs and statistics have a value only in as much as they mirror the reality
of widespread human enrichment in quality of life terms. The gains derived
from any approach which does not directly respond to this core social challenge
can only be partial. </P>

<P>Member States of SAARC have embraced the logic of deregulation and liberalisation
of their economies and have gone a long way down this path. We believe
that the benefits which accrue from this should touch our population at
all points. The energies and potentialities released must create openings
for a cross-section of our people and lift their living standards through
creation of productive employment opportunities. Already foreign direct
investments are releasing resources which are flowing to the countryside.
This is the most visible linkage between attracting capital investments
required for growth from abroad and thereby better financing priority rural
sector schemes. However, all benefits take time to come into reality as
the momentum of growth gathers pace and the ambit of the productive economy
expands. What is important is national commitment to the good of all and
not of only a few. </P>

<P>The urgent task of grassroot social transformation also has to be tackled
head on as a determined and decisive parallel policy. It was in recognition
of this priority mandate, which all leaders of the region have, that the
current year was designated the SAARC Year of Poverty Eradication. We have
agreed to the target of poverty eradication by the year 2002. By this we
mean to indicate the urgency we attach to this primary goal : we do not
regard poverty eradication is convulsed in change around us and is dramatically
transforming developing societies, the communications saturation, the aspirations
of our people, all feed this urgency. We do not wish South Asia to be a
backwater for basic requirements of health, education and nutrition. We
wish for all of us the dignity of decent standards of living. We should
strive to attain this in the shortest possible time both nationally and
collectively. We should consult on and profit from each other's experience
and policies which have proved rewarding for us. We have already concluded
Conventions and Resolutions on Women &amp; Development, Youth and the Disabled
and should make full use of these instruments of cooperation and deepen
the social agenda of SAARC for collective benefit. </P>

<P>It is most heartening, for governments as for our business communities,
that before closing the first decade of SAARC we have ventured substantively
into the area of economic cooperation. For many eminently successful regional
coalitions the world over, this is the core area of collaboration. Globalisation
of economic transactions has accelerated the parallel phenomenon of regional
coalescence. Our region should not remain immune to the contemporary logic
of realising and optimising the potential synergy which we can generate
together and which is lying dormant today. The regional marketplace affords
opportunities far beyond domestic confines. As for our international trade,
what can be supplied cheaper and to equivalent standards within our reigon
will result in both lower costs and activation of hitherto unrealised trading
potential to mutual advantage. There is no reason why intra-SAARC trade,
which is only a fraction of our global trade, cannot be quickly enhanced
many times over. This has been the proven experience of other regional
economic organisations. </P>

<P>In promoting this spirit of enlightened collective regional self-interest,
we should channel commercial exchanges so that our vital interests are
promoted. Every party has a legitimate interest in preventing any negative
consequencies to its domestic economy from the opening up of the region.
We wish to move with the support and committed participation of our business
communities. But within the identified possibilities, which are enormous,
we should be moving at a much faster pace. It is a matter of great satisfaction
that the aim we set for ourselves at the New Delhi Summit this year to
make the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement operational by the tenth
anniversary of SAARC has ben realised. Even though a symbolic first step,
the coming into operation of SAPTA is a development of historic importance
for South Asia as it demonstrates our practical wilingness to forge common
cause among ourselves as a region, in the recognition that our destinies
are bound together. We have agreed not to linger at the first step. Even
before the first round of tariff concessions is given effect to, our officials
have reached agreement on launching the second and more ambitious round
in Sri Lanka early next year. This is the sense of urgency with which we
need to move, and our vision should be equal to the opportunities now available.
The vision is to work with sustained commitment towards free flow of trade
in the region, and for policies which encourage cross investments within
our economies; it is to create a supportive and enabling environment for
beneficial economic and commercial ideas to flourish by drawing strength
from one another. </P>

<P>We look ahead from the first decade of SAARC with a sense of hope, renewal,
growth and consolidation - as part of our desire to shape our destinies
ourselves, and in cooperation with one another. I wish the Foreign Ministers
assembled here all strength in this noble endeavour, which we owe to our
people and to ourselves. </P>

am deeply thankful to the Government of India for their gracious hospitality
extended to me and members of the Bangladesh Delegation and for making

<P>I deem it a privilege and honour to have the opportunity to say a few

<P>For Bangladesh the tenth anniversary of the Association on 8th December

of the seven nations of South Asia gathered in Dhaka to attend the First
SAARC Summit and put their signatures to the Charter of the Association
thus translating the late President Ziaur Rahman's vision of a regional
forum into reality. Today it may seem quite logical and sensible to us
that the nations of the region opted to create a regional grouping but
in the early Eighties such a concept was viewed with suspicion and misgiving
. The South Asia region has been historically conflict-prone although it
is bound by a common history culture, and tradition. Persistent tensions
in inter-state relations in the post-colonial history of the region continued
to impede the process of cooperation. </P>

<P>The late President Ziaur Rahman's efforts facilitated the realization
by all that the benefits of cooperation would by far outweigh the cost
of non-cooperation which had been high and would in all likelihood be much
higher in the future. Therefore in a region bedeviled with inter-state
tensions and suspicion the gathering of leaders of the seven nations of
the South Asian region and the creation of a regional grouping was undoubtedly
a major achievement. It was for the first time in the troubled and conflict-ridden
history of South Asia that an institutional mechanism for regional cooperation
was agreed upon and subsequently received the necessary support from Member
States to enable it to survive and grow. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>Our achievements in many fields have been considerable, and commendable
in the relatively short span of ten years. These could have been much greater
had it not been for certain negative forces and the wide divergence of
views between states on some issues. This is to be viewed in the context
of the fact that South Asian society is complex and pluralistic. Moreover
the size of our populations, the extent of poverty, malnutrition and illiteracy
makes our task all the more complex. </P>

<P>The divisions in this society are not location-specific. On the other
hand, even localised conflicts in South Asia have disproportionate spill-over
effects across state boundaries. In addition, historical, ethnic, linguistic
and cultural factors have created for the peoples of South Asia numerous
structural problems and conflicts. South Asia therefore, regrettably, continues
to remain at the crossroads of conflict and cooperation while other regional
cooperative groups in Asia and elsewhere are forging ahead with impressive
and meaningful progress in their own regional interaction. Today, as South
Asia faces a host of problems arising out of indigenous and extraneous
factors, dialogue and cooperation among the leaders and policy-makers is
all the more important and, indeed, imperative. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>The SAARC Charter precludes our deliberation on bilateral issues between
Member States. We have faithfully adhered to this principle during the
last 10 years. However, none of us can deny that SAARC has at the same
time contributed significantly to lessening tensions and even resolving,
to some extent, some contentious issues between its various members simply
by providing a venue at regular intervals for the leaders to meet each
other, within and outside the conference rooms. </P>

<P>It is, perhaps, time now for us to translate this hitherto passive process
into a more active and dynamic one without in any way violating the spirit
of our Charter. I think in Ten years we have developed amongst ourselves
sufficiently a &quot;SAARC Spirit&quot;. What I wish to suggest is that
outside the formal confines of our deliberations, we should henceforth
be in a position to form &quot;SAARC Conciliation Groups&quot; to try and
bring about reconciliation between Member States with disputes. Thus if
two countries have a dispute over a matter those members not involved in
the dispute could set up a Conciliation Committee at Ministerial (or even
Summit level) to try and act as honest brokers in at least easing tensions
if not resolving disputes. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>As we enter the eleventh year of SAARC's existence, let us pause and
ponder: where do we go from here? I wish to take this opportunity to share
some of my thoughts with you. It is true that SAARC has made commendable
achievements in many fields in the last ten years . However, we must also
squarely face the fact that even today fresh doubts are being expressed
about the viability of our Association, particularly in the context of
some of the stresses and strains which have increased sharply within our
region recently. </P>

<P>In the present situation, therefore, active and tangible confidence-building
measures must be accelerated. Regional cooperation in South Asia is possibly
the single most important of all such measures. While it may not be possible
to eliminate inter-state rivalry in the short-run, we cannot, any of us,
allow this to explode into conflicts which will debilitate the entire region.
We must, therefore, strive all the more for promoting regional cooperation
and people-to-people contacts which would weave together the safety net
for minimizing the risks of conflicts, reducing them, managing them and
eventually resolving them. The peoples of South Asia must not, ever, forget
that their bonds are permanent and their future inextricably intervened.
There is infact, no alternative to regional cooperation which is indispensable
for accelerating economic growth and overall development in our region.
The cost of non-cooperation is much too high to be ignored. The united
strength of countries in a geographical region and the consequent increase
in their collective bargaining power vis-a-vis other competing groupings
in the international community, greatly enhances the prospect of economic
and trade benefits which are otherwise not possible. The emergence of several
trading blocs and economic groupings all over the world is a clear testimony
to the truth that economic survival let alone the prosperity of a nation
in the increasingly competitive trading system, is crucially dependent
on its ability to integrate with other economies. Those nations that fail
to perceive these realities will have no option but to become marginalised
in the global economic community. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>Clearly, the core issues of trade and economic cooperation must be given
utmost priority by the Member States of the Association during its Second
Decade. According to some studies, low customs tariff and minimum restriction
on movements of goods and services between countries in the region can
increase intra-regional trade five-fold from the present $3 billion to
over $ 15 billion by the turn of the century. To achieve this goal the
Governments and the private sectors in our region must commit themselves
to work in tandem with each other. We must correct the existing mismatch
between production and trade specialization. We must go beyond trade in
commodities to expand trade in manufactures. We should all endeavour to
legitimise and facilitate cross border trade between ourselves to fully
utilise its growing potential. Let us encourage more intra-regional investment
flow and promote joint ventures where mutuality of benefit is transparent.
Our ultimate goal should be not only to increase intra-regional trade but
to substantially increase our region's global trade as well. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>The ratification of the SAPTA Agreement is undoubtedly a notable land
mark for SAARC, which now stands poised to take an ambitious leap forward.
Let us now boldly venture forward together, to converting SAPTA to SAFTA
- the South Asian Free Trade Area. Let us work together, resolutely, to
progressively dismantling and doing away with all remaining tariff, para-tariff
and non-tariff barriers which still shackle us and restrain us from moving
ahead with the rest of the world around us. </P>

<P><B>Mr. Chairman, </B></P>

<P>There is broad consensus that the SAARC process should not be confined
to inter-governmental cooperation only, but should increasingly embrace
people-to-people contacts and interaction at all levels across the entire
spectrum of South Asian society. I feel that our achievements in the latter
category have been less than remarkable. All of us need to shake off the
inhibitions, bred by an overwhelming security syndrome, which have for
so long held us as prisoners. Let us open up the windows of our minds and
our hearts, and let us encourage our peoples to reach out to each other,
to re-discover each other. Towards this end, I wish to flag for your consideration
the following specific proposals: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>a) Let us abolish visas between us on a progressive scale. We have made
a very small beginning. We need to be much bolder. Let us expand the present
list to include increasingly broader spectra of officials, businessmen,
educationists, intellectuals, journalists, artists and students. <BR>
b) Let us increase substantially intra-regional student mobility. Apart
from offering placements in our respective institutions for SAARC students,
as we do now, we should additionally promote study tours by students at
school, college and university level to each others' countries on a regular
basis. The Secretariat may examine and suggest ways on how this can be
initiated and institutionalised. We have set up SAARC for our younger generation.
<BR>
c) Our parliamentarians already meet at regular intervals, within the aegis
of the Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians. This Association
could perhaps develop, with the support of Governments of Member States,
into a non-legislative South Asian Parliament . Let the direction of SAARC
be jointly deliberated upon first, and subsequently determined by the peoples
representatives elected to this Parliament. <BR>
d) Let us re-invigorate the existing, but moribund, land and rail routes
between us with the aim of promoting greater intra-regional tourism. Regional
associations are meaningless without dynamic inter-active people-to-people
contacts. Such contact can increase dramatically if we can open up the
means to them for availing of a cheap transportation to each other's countries.
<BR>
e) Environmental degradation is assuming alarming proportions in South
Asia. As we all know, the environment and ecology transcend national borders
and are our common resources. In recognition of this, two Regional Studies
were undertaken at the behest of the SAARC which have made useful and valid
recommendations which we should endeavour to implement at the earliest.
<BR>
f) Water is one of our most vital and shared resources. While various regions
in the world have forged beneficial cooperation in this sector, we are
still unable to progress in this front in our region. Let us make sincere
efforts to harness to the full potential our water resources for the benefit
of our peoples, thereby changing one of the poorest regions of the worId
to a prosperous one. <BR>
g) The operationalization of SAPTA Agreement has to ensure that the Least
Developed Contracting States obtain the benefits they expect from this
agreement. Article-10 of the Agreement provides for special and more favourable
treatment exclusively to the Least Developed Contracting States which includes,
<I>inter-alia,</I> duty free access, removal of non-tariff and para-tariff
barriers. Granting of such measures would not only expand their trade but
facilitate progression to a South Asian Free Trade Area. <BR>
h) The Secretariat should be strengthened and the status of the Secretary
General should be up-graded in order to give him the necessary access and
maneuverability to more effectively discharge his function. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>While we evolve strategies and determine the priorities for the future
course of action we should at the same time, examine our record during
the First Decades so that successes can be replicated and failures avoided
during the Second Decade. Member States must develop a better mechanism
to implement the decisions and recommendations of SAARC Summits, Ministerial
meetings and Integrated Progrmme of Action (lPA). Better monitoring and
evaluation techniques are required to identify the performances for various
programmes, activities and bodies of the Association. This leads me to
another issue, that of rationalising SAARC activities especially the Calendar
of Activities under Integrated Programme of Action (lPA). I feel there
must be more selectivity and greater emphasis on result-oriented activities.
The number of activities could be reduced without seriously affecting output.
I fully endorse the recommendation of the First Special Session of the
Standing Committee which was reiterated by the Second Special Session of
the Committee that there should not be more than two activities per Technical
Committee per annum. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>Cooperation with regional and international organizations and United
Nations Agencies is now firmly on the SAARC Agenda. Greater interaction
with these organizations would benefit our Association in many ways. The
interaction must grow further and be strengthened during the Second Decade.
Similarly, the practice of formulating collective position on issues of
common interest in all international fora and consultations among delegations
of SAARC countries in these fora are important developments. We must come
closer together through this process. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>I would like to take this opportunity to convey my sincere thanks to
the Secretary-General H.E. Mr. Y.K. Silwal, for his untiring efforts and
unstinted support to the SAARC process, which has made the Association
stronger. I also congratulate H.E. Mr. Naeemuddin Hasan on his nomination
to the post of Secretary-General, which I am confident would receive the
unanimous support of all Members of the Council. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>Before concluding, allow me to reaffirm that Bangladesh remains firmly
committed to the objectives and principles of the SAARC Charter and to
pursuing regional cooperation in identified fields, particularly the eradication
of poverty and expansion of intra-regional trade. As we step into the Second
Decade of SAARC, we are committed to boldly facing the challenges awaiting
us, to grasping the opportunities that are presented to us and to building
a better future for the peoples of South Asia by intensifying regional
cooperation with visionary zeal. </P>

<P><B>I thank you. </B></P>

<P><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, Excellencies, Ladies and
Gentlemen, </I></P>

<P>Ten days ago, in Thimphu, we celebrated the completion of a decade of
SAARC. I vividly recall that historic day, on 8 December 1985 in Dhaka,
when the leaders of our countries signed the Charter establishing our Association.
There was a distinct air of history about those heady days, and a feeling
of hope tempered with caution that together we could cross the many hurdles
that had for so long impeded the progress of our region. Since then, we
have crossed some of the hurdles but many more still remain, and it is
only fitting that as we cross the tenyear milestone in the history of our
fledgeling Association, we should take stock of our past achievements and
failures and chart new strategies and priorities for the future. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>May I, at the very outset, express our complete faith in your stewardship
of our Council? With your great wisdom and experience, we are confident
that you will give our Association a fresh impetus and a new sense of purpose
and direction in the days ahead. I would also like to express our appreciation
to the Prime Minister of India, His Excellency Shri Narasimha Rao, for
his eloquent inaugural address which reflects his deep and abiding faith
in the cause of regional cooperation. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome Foreign Minister Dr. Prakash Chandra
Lohani of Nepal to our fold. I look forward to working closely with him
in pursuing our common objectives. Our outgoing Secretary General Mr. Y.K.
Silwal deserves our highest commendation for the exemplary manner in which
he has carried out his manifold responsibilities. The Association has benefitted
greatly from his considerable knowledge and experience of regional and
international affairs. We wish him every success in his future endeavours.
</P>

<P>I would like to thank the Government of India for the warm and generous
hospitality extended to me and my delegation, and for the meticulous arrangements
made for this meeting. All those in the Government of India and the SAARC
Secretariat who have prepared the documentation for our meeting deserve
our special thanks. And last but not least, our thanks go to the able officials
and Foreign Secretaries of our governments who have laboured so hard to
produce the documents which have lightened our task. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>As I look back at the past ten years, I am struck by the numerous initiatives
we have taken in the social, economic, cultural, financial and technical
fields. The scope of regional cooperation has been expanded to cover important
areas such as environment, poverty alleviation, and trade liberalization.
Over six hundred activities have taken place under the Integrated Programme
of Action. The SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism and
the SAARC Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances have
come into force. The SAARC Food Security Reserve has been established,
as also four regional centres. The scope of the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme
has been expanded. A number of studies on economic, environmental and other
issues have been carried out and have resulted in followup action. And
significantly, NGOs and Regional Apex Bodies such as the SAARC Chamber
of Commerce &amp; Industry, Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians
and SAARCLAW have successfully taken the initiative to obtain our recognition,
while several other influential NGOs and Regional Apex Groups have sought
recognition. </P>

<P>Countless meetings at the officials and ministerial levels have helped
to create understanding and build confidence, while the Summits have provided
valuable opportunities for bilateral meetings at the highest political
level. Our Association has also shown considerable resilience by weathering
several grave crises. All in all, the performance of SAARC during the first
decade of its existence has been quite impressive, and given the bitter
legacy of the past it would have been unreasonable to expect more. The
foundation for accelerating the pace of cooperation is in place. Vision
and political will, will now determine the scope and speed of future progress.
</P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>The reasons for the shortcomings of our Association are not hard to
find. Our region lacks political and social cohesion and is beset with
bilateral problems. The popular domestic politics of neighbour-bashing
is not conducive to regional cooperation. The dismal political climate
of the region continues to cast a long shadow over all our activities.
Many of our countries are faced with a grim environmental situation due
to the rapid erosion of our natural resource base and a high rate of population
growth. We have not given adequate attention to socioeconomic concerns
because of the primacy of the political factor which dominates policymaking.
</P>

<P>The greatest challenge before SAARC today is how to generate the necessary
political will to move SAARC from the non-controversial areas which while
useful confer little tangible benefits to the core areas of cooperation,
such as, money, finance, energy, industry, and trade. In this context,
the people of our region must make a determined break with the most damaging
legacy of the colonial era, namely, the process of fragmentation and disintegration
of the South Asian Community which was, until the onset of colonialism,
in the process of evolving a unique identity transcending race, religion,
language and culture. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>A South Asian Community of history, civilization and tradition, of shared
fundamental values, and an indivisible ecosystem have linked our countries
together for centuries. The task before us is to reactivate that Community
and enlarge its scope to fit the ethos and needs of modern times. The highest
priority should go to the formulation of a collective strategy for the
development of our countries as constituent parts of an integrated region.
We can forge ahead rapidly only if we open up to each other, and define
terms of cooperation which can benefit us individually and collectively.
</P>

<P>Some of the critical problems which need to be addressed urgently are
chronic and dehumanising poverty of a large proportion of our population,
slow economic growth and uneven economic development between different
regions and different strata of our societies, high rates of population
growth, extensive erosion of our natural resource base due to environmental
degradation, social polarisation and conflicts, and high defence expenditures.
</P>

<P>What is required is a sustainable development strategy to overcome the
multifaceted crises facing South Asia today, a strategy which combines
human development, growth, equity and technological change with a wiser
and more creative use of local resources and knowledge. The development
strategies followed hitherto based on western models of economic development
do not offer a viable path to the accumulation process in our context.
Elements of this strategy would have to face the biggest challenge facing
South Asia today, namely, the high level of population growth, for the
problem of poverty is inextricably linked with that of population growth.
We must move ahead from SAPTA to SAFTA or a South Asian Free Trade Area,
for increase in intraregional trade will expand production and employment
in all our countries, bring down costs of living and help reap the benefits
of a larger market. The private sector will have to play a crucial role
in the industrialization drive and expansion of trade. If all the member
countries of our Association are not ready to participate in a sustainable
development strategy for the region, the mechanism of subregional cooperation
through Action Committees as laid down in the Charter should be activated.
</P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>As we stand on the threshold of our second decade, we have to realize
that there is no viable alternative to regional cooperation. We are living
in a rapidly changing world where fierce competition and economic regionalism
are the norm. Economic considerations now transcend political factors in
the calculations of most nations. Unless we join hands and promote collective
selfreliance in our region, we will be increasingly relegated to the margins
of the world economy and international politics. </P>

MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OF INDIA</FONT></I></B><I><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT></I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It has been ten years since we adopted the SAARC Charter, and called
our Association into being, long enough for us to judge if it has become
what we had hoped it would, if it has given us what we expected of it,
and, perhaps the hardest question to ask and answer, if we as Governments
have put into SAARC the investment of time, care, effort and vision which
so important an experiment demanded. We did not form SAARC simply to make
a South Asian contribution to the acronyms of the world, or because others
had associations, and we had none. No, we came together in SAARC because
we decided that collective effort was essential to improve the lot of our
people; for SAARC, as for the other regional associations that have been
successful, this is the yardstick by which it must be measured, this is
the reason for its existence. SAARC is about people and the overwhelming
need and desire of our countries to promote the welfare and quality of
their life. That is the ideal we have to constantly hold before us and
assiduously pursue and attain. </P>

<P>In these ten years, SAARC has become the established institution of
regional cooperation, and its achievements have been considerable. Its
purpose and agenda have grown and widened the scope of regional cooperation
to include diverse sectors. We have set up twelve committees on technical
cooperation and four regional centres in various SAARC capitals. The widening
of the agenda has included primary social issues of women and family health,
youth, the disabled and poverty eradication. In the past ten years, we
have steadily built a solid foundation and continue to consolidate our
gains. The combined efforts of Member States during the past decade of
its existence has brought SAARC to the threshold of new vistas. If we compare
the first ten years of SAARC with those of other regional organizations,
we would have reason to hope that, like them, SAARC is now ready to take
off. </P>

<P>The operationalisation of SAPTA earlier this month heralds a historic
step forward for SAARC and has shown the way towards the creation of a
South Asian Free Trade Area. The strategies for economic development pursued
by Member States can be meshed with intraregional economic cooperation,
including trade, investments and establishment of joint ventures. Through
telling regional economic cooperation and by harnessing the collective
strengths of the region, SAARC can productively respond to the evolving
global economic paradigm. </P>

<P>While we have given ourselves the goal to work towards a free trade
area in South Asia and we have also rightly agreed that this should be
done in stages we have to ensure that these stages do not stretch out the
process too long. I would propose that we should work with the commitment
required so as to definitely realise the South Asian Free Trade Area by
the end of the second decade of SAARC. We believe that we should strive
to try and achieve it even by the year 2000, the beginning of the next
millennium. Our endeavour should be to have achieved zero tariffs by then
in the majority of product groups and minimal tariffs in others. It should
also be our endeavour to remove most Quantitative Restrictions by then.
We should charge the Committee on Economic Cooperation to regard this as
a mandate by establishing a high level task force for the purpose. Trade
facilitation and logistics, including the visa regime and customs and importexport
licensing procedures, should be kept in step with this committed liberalisation
process. The Inter-Governmental Group (IGG) is already mandated to examine
tariff removal and reduction product by product, by sectoral product groups
or across the board, as feasible, when they meet early next year. </P>

<P>SAFTA will produce a common market of over a billion people. That in
itself will be a phenomenon that will make the rest of the world sit up
and take notice. The political impact this will have, on how we see ourselves
and how the world sees us, will be difficult to overstate. </P>

<P>Our export industries might still be competitive rather than complementary,
the range of products we can presently sell each other might be narrow,
but for many industries in all our countries, the opportunities would be
vast. In this, India will not be the main beneficiary; the largest market
that will be opened will be our's, for our partners in SAARC to exploit.
In SAARC, we will then progress automatically to a higher level of interaction
with the regional groupings and trade blocs to whom the bulk of our exports
will still go. We can hope for a collective strength in bargaining with
others who have for some decades recognised that their future lay in collective
endeavour. </P>

<P><B><I>Excellencies, </I></B></P>

<P>East Asia, now extremely prosperous, has given the world the technique
of selfdefence known as the power of the empty hand. In South Asia our
hands are also empty, though, sadly, in a different sense, but it is entirely
possible for us also to turn our weaknesses into our strengths. Poverty,
illiteracy, poor health and nutrition are what hold our populations back
from reaching their potential. If we can collectively tackle these problems
in SAARC, South Asia will have a vibrant population of 1.2 billion, onesixth
of the world, as talented, productive and hard working as any other set
of people, and therefore, likely to be just as successful. To expand to
South Asia an image which has recently been used about India by an eminent
German banker, the South Asian elephant, once it gets going, will be far
more formidable than any Asian tiger. </P>

<P>That, Excellencies, must be the vision that drives us. Our region, richly
endowed in natural and human resources, has so far not been able to fully
use these to our common advantage. When the whole world is moving ahead
in cooperative endeavour it is imperative that the SAARC region also does
so on the basis of optimising the vast potential that exists, through regional
and subregional cooperation as envisaged in the Charter. This historic
meeting, which marks the completion of ten years of SAARC's existence should
charge our experts with the responsibility of identifying specific areas
for moving forward, with the objective of improving the quality of the
lives of our peoples and accelerating socioeconomic development. </P>

<P>For SAARC to achieve its full potential, we need collectively to eradicate
the curse of poverty and all the deprivations that go along with it that
have dragged the region down. India supports the various measures outlined
in several expert reports on poverty alleviation. We once again renew our
determination to pursue the SAARC objective of eradicating poverty in the
shortest possible time. For our part, the Government of India has adopted
a programme of economic reform that stimulates growth but recognises the
human being and the poorest among them as the centre of our concerns. Economic
growth measured in terms of cold numbers is not enough, not that these
are unimpressive. As our Prime Minister emphasised at the last SAARC Summit
and in his recent address, our development strategies and efforts are predicated
on keeping the human being firmly as the subject of our polices. We believe
that this is a shared aim for all countries in our region. </P>

<P>In the Charter of SAARC we took an eminently wise decision to ensure
progress in areas of cooperation by differentiating them from bilateral
and contentious issues which could weigh down progress in the crucial areas
of economic, social and technical cooperation. We feel that the advance
we have made and the vistas which are opening before us in all these areas,
for the benefit of our people, underscore the correctness of this approach.
Joint efforts to make these areas one of collaborative endeavour can be
pursued with vigour on all sides. </P>

<P>To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of SAARC, we have
drawn up a ten point programme. This includes, among other items, a tree
planting ceremony by Foreign Ministers, organizing of a SAARC Trade Fair,
a SAARC handicrafts exhibition, awareness of SAARC through TV and Radio
and release of a postage stamp to commemorate the anniversary. </P>

<P>As we enter the second decade of SAARC's existence, we need to respond
to new challenges and opportunities by enriching and casting wider our
agenda of interaction and by evolving concerted strategies in relation
to global economic developments of common interest or concern to us all.
</P>

<P><B><I>Excellencies, </I></B></P>

<P>The time has come when we can no longer put off taking a collective
decision on how SAARC should evolve. The people of South Asia whom we have
the privilege to represent, expect leadership from us. We will be failing
them if we do not take SAARC into its second decade with the determination
to use it to make South Asia an area of the world that will become one
of the poles of economic power in the next century. We can do this, but
in order to do this, we must get over the reservations of the past, over-narrow
prejudices or unreasonable fears. For each one of us seven, your poverty
is my poverty, my future prosperity will also be yours. </P>

<P><I>Honourable Prime Minister, Honourable Ministers, Mr. Secretary General,
Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen </I></P>

<P>At the outset, I would like to join my colleagues in expressing my sincere
gratitude to the Government of India for the warm hospitality that has
been extended to me and my delegation since our arrival in this beautiful
city of New Delhi. </P>

<P>I welcome to our midst the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nepal, His
Excellency Dr. Prakash Chandra Lohani; while recalling with appreciation
the important contributions made to this Council by his predecessor. </P>

<P>I also wish to extend a very special tribute to our Secretary General,
His Excellency Mr. Y. K. Silwal, who will complete his tenure of office
at the end of this year. His dedicated efforts during the last two years
in promoting the cause of SAARC and strengthening the functioning of the
Secretariat deserve commendation and appreciation. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Prime Minister, </I></B></P>

<P>We are greatly honoured by your presence at this Commemorative Session
of the SAARC Council of Ministers. Your association with SAARC goes back
to the very early days of its formation as an institutionalised regional
framework, and we do acknowledge the valuable contribution made by you
personally, at different times and in different capacities, during the
last ten years. It is gratifying to see you continuing your support to
our organisation and, from the seat of the Head of your Government, and
with the confidence of a leader who had learned from experience, hear you
reiterate your commitment to the principles upon which SAARC was founded.
Thank you Mr. Prime Minister for all you have said in your inspiring speech.
</P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues,</I></B> </P>

<P>At this session of the Council of Ministers we are commemorating the
tenth anniversary of the establishment of this regional forum; the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. </P>

<P>It is indeed a happy occasion worthy of celebration; not only because
we have been able to fulfil a dream, but also because we have made considerable
progress in bringing our peoples together into a framework of cooperation
through a series of well conceived programs, and by generating a new spirit
of mutual trust and confidence. </P>

<P>Today we are convinced, more than ever before, that this Association
and what we are striving for are feasible, and that they are beneficial.
Ours may not be yet the regional organisation with the most comprehensive
collection of programmes; but we certainly have the potential for a model
for the world to see a model of seven countries so dissimilar in size,
population and resources, working jointly to improve the socio economic
conditions of their peoples; by alleviating poverty, eliminating trade
barriers, aligning and harmonising their technical pursuits, and engaging
at all times the traditions of a bountiful and a civilised South Asia,
ultimately reconciling their differences and making their own contribution
towards world peace and justice. </P>

<P>Obviously, we have passed across some very rough turf during the last
ten years, as we continued building and consolidating our cooperative regime.
But the achievements we reached so far are testimony to the continuing
commitment and determination of our political leaders to the objectives
embodied in our Charter aimed at the social and economic development of
our peoples, based firmly on mutual respect and a spirit of co operation,
understanding and friendship. SAARC will remain as a true manifestation
of our collective will to build a more prosperous and self reliant South
Asia. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>A decade of cooperation amongst South Asian countries has indeed brought
forth a number of tangible benefits. Ten years ago, when we launched the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, there were many who were
sceptical about our prospects. They saw only the differences in our region;
they focused only on unresolved conflicts between some of our members;
and they questioned not only our commitment but also our ability to sustain
a programme of regional cooperation. </P>

<P>Yet, today, no one doubts the actuality of SAARC. We have risen beyond
our differences; we have demonstrated that regional cooperation in South
Asia is a meaningful exercise, despite many unresolved conflicts. Indeed,
SAARC is today a reality that has come to be accepted as the voice of South
Asia at many international fora. </P>

<P>Through the Integrated Programme of Action, numerous SAARC activities
are held each year under the umbrella of the various Technical Committees
set up in the agreed areas of cooperation. These activities help promote
friendship and understanding amongst our officials in various fields. A
number of Ministerial meetings and Conferences focusing on such socioeconomic
themes of critical relevance to the region as environment, women and family
health, children, youth, and the disabled have helped raise the awareness
of the people to the regional dimensions of these problems and provided
a common ground for exchanges of information and experiences. </P>

<P>We can also take pride from the two regional Conventions, one on the
Suppression of Terrorism and the other on the Prevention of Narcotic Drugs
and Psychotropic Substances that have been signed by Member States. We
have also established a Food Security Reserve that may be used to meet
emergencies in a member country. The Agreement on South Asian Preferential
Trading Arrangement SAPTA is now in force, promising a more liberalized
trading regime in our region in the future. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>These are only some of the many notable and perhaps tangible achievements
of SAARC in its first decade. However, of no less importance is the sense
of shared identity and regional consciousness that it has helped evolve
in our region through increased interaction amongst our peoples at all
levels. The numerous Summits and Ministerial level meetings held under
the aegis of SAARC have provided invaluable opportunities to exchange views
even on some of the bilateral issues, and dissolve differences through
quiet diplomacy. This is not to say that SAARC has not provided answers
or solutions to the many disputes that ravage South Asia. Indeed it has
certainly acted as a catalyst in diffusing tension on a number of occasions
amongst members in the region. This, in South Asia, is no mean feat. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>In its early years, SAARC has tended to concentrate on areas of cooperation
that have been of a technical and functional nature. It is only recently
that our focus has moved towards the more substantial areas of economic
cooperation. </P>

<P>This is understandably so, given the inherent sociopolitical and economic
difficulties prevalent in the region. There are those who may not feel
happy with this slow pace of evolution of SAARC, but I believe that rather
than be discouraged, we should take encouragement from the fact that our
movement has been consistently positive, even if slow. It has given us
time to reflect and assess each others concerns, identify common problems
and chart out regional action plans in a number of areas. We are thus better
suited today to move from the periphery to the core areas of cooperation
with greater confidence. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>South Asia is not only the most populous region, numbering over a billion
people, but it is also the worlds poorest. Poverty, illiteracy and inadequate
access to some of the most basic amenities in life are a common feature
in South Asia. Indeed, nearly half the worlds poor are concentrated in
the South Asia region. We can ill afford to ignore such widespread deprivation
in our midst, not merely on humanitarian grounds but also from the standpoint
of regional stability. Furthermore, historical conflicts, fanned by traditional
prejudices, ethnic differences and religious intolerance have tended to
exacerbate instability both within and between South Asian countries, resulting
in the diversion of critically needed developmental resources towards the
build up of armaments for defence and security needs. Indeed, South Asia
is also one of the most volatile regions in the world. </P>

<P>It is rather disappointing that our region continues to be beset with
serious problems holding up our progress towards complete regional integration.
Yet, these hindrances notwithstanding, we have embarked upon the path of
regional cooperation, convinced of the benefits that will accrue to our
peoples through concerted action taken together. Ten years have elapsed
since we took that historic decision. As we mark the tenth anniversary
of SAARC, it is only befitting that we should pause to look thoughtfully
ahead to the future, with a view to consolidating our past achievements.
Where do we go from here? </P>

<P>Indeed, in charting out a future course of action, we must not only
be aware of the limitations learnt from the past experience, but also aim
at strengthening our Organisation to realise the full potentials of regional
cooperation. The scope of our activities need not only to be widened, but
deepened in such a way that tangible benefits from our endeavours reach
the common man. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>While we may take heart from the entry into force of SAPTA in our region,
we must at the same time be fully aware that this represents but only a
small step in the right direction. SAPTA does indeed offer us a window
of opportunity that we should exploit and expand in the future, in order
that we may reap the benefits of closer regional economic integration.
</P>

<P>The subject of poverty has also been receiving increasing attention
since the Sixth SAARC Summit held in Colombo. The designation of 1995 as
the &quot;SAARC Year of Poverty Eradication &quot; and the adoption of
a Plan of Action to Eradicate Poverty by the Year 2002 are reflective of
the increasing importance being given to the subject by member countries.
The three tier mechanism proposed by the Finance Ministers in Dhaka in
1994 is now in place, the first two tiers having met earlier this year
and the third tier, is due to be initiated in the near future. These efforts,
we hope will pave the way towards addressing the concerns of the poor in
the region, helping to harness their productive capacity through self reliant
development. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>The Secretary General's report has highlighted the need to strengthen
the Secretariat due to the increasing demands being made on the Secretariat
as a result of new initiatives undertaken by SAARC. </P>

<P>While we fully appreciate that the Secretariat must be adequately equipped
to fulfil the tasks entrusted to it in an efficient manner, we must also
be mindful of the limitation of resources the member states have. The Second
Special Session of the Standing Committee has reviewed the role and functioning
of the Secretariat earlier this year and their recommendations in this
regard should be adopted. Indeed, in strengthening the SAARC Secretariat,
our focus should be on identifying innovative and flexible ways of enhancing
the efficiency of the Secretariat with minimum financial burden on member
countries. At the same time, we must also ensure that the Secretariat is
allowed to function impartially and independently, its primary role being
the promotion of regional cooperation in agreed areas. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>The world today is changing with such rapidity that unless we fall in
step with the times, we in South Asia will be left behind. As we move towards
the turn of the century, the trend towards regionalism in all parts of
the world is gaining momentum. It would appear that, in the post cold war
era, the major players in the world will be the regional bodies that have
emerged or are about to emerge in the future. </P>

<P>The traffic of influence will no doubt flow both ways; but I feel that,
the opportunities that we will be getting, as a regional body, to influence
on events affecting the lives of our peoples will increase. So let us strengthen
our organisation and move forward with confidence and resilience. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Colleagues, </I></B></P>

<P>SAARC Charter has confined us from dealing with what is termed as &quot;contentious
issues&quot;. The circumstances prevailing at the time of the inception
of SAARC may have necessitated such a provision. However, it is becoming
increasingly evident that such an exclusion has tended to deprive us from
seizing the opportunities to exploit the potential of our regional institution,
in any manner, to resolve issues of high sensitivity in the region. </P>

<P>I agree that the forum of SAARC should not be the place to discuss &quot;contentious
issues&quot;, and interfere in bilateral issues of member countries. Nevertheless,
if problems persist, and member countries are unable to resolve the differences
through dialogue and negotiation, and if perpetuity of a dispute is perceived
as an abridging factor to our cooperative undertaking, then, there should
be a way we could help in generating an environment of trust and compromise
which will impel away prejudices, and attitudes of intolerance. The creation
of a mechanism of exploratory nature to deal with acute problems in the
region may be an advantageous exercise in raising the regional cooperation
in South Asia to a higher plane. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, </I></B></P>

<P>We have indeed come a long way from the time when the late President
Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh first conceived the idea of a regional arrangement
in South Asia for the social and economic benefit of the peoples in the
region. Yet, it is also apparent that regional cooperation is still in
its formative stage in South Asia. The road ahead is replete with challenges
and opportunities. As the world approaches the new millennium, and we in
South Asia witness the dawn of a new decade of SAARC, let us renew our
commitment and rededicate ourselves to bring new vigour and dynamism to
our association of regional cooperation. </P>

<P><B>Thank you.</B></P>

<P><I>Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, Distinguishes Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
</I></P>

<P>Allow me to begin, Mr. Chairman. by expressing my personal appreciation
and that of my delegation to H.E. Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, Prime Minister
of India for his important inaugural address. The Prime Minister's address
has set the tone for our deliberations at this session. It is a matter
of satisfaction that our Association has had the benefit of the Indian
chairmanship at this juncture when SAARC has completed ten years of its
existence and entered the second decade. </P>

<P>It is a pleasure to see you, Sir, chair the Sixteenth Session of the
SAARC Council of Ministers. Your wide experiences, knowledge and wisdom
will be important assets to our endeavour to set agenda for SAARC in the
years to come. </P>

<P>I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express my delegation's
appreciation to the friendly Government and people of India for the warm
welcome and generous hospitality accorded to us and our appreciation of
the arrangements made for this meeting. </P>

<P>May I also take this opportunity to pay warm compliments to H.E. Mr.
Y.K. Silwal, SecretaryGeneral of SAARC, for the excellent and dedicated
manner in which he has carried out his responsibilities. As Mr. Silwal
approaches the completion of his tenure, we thank him and wish him all
the best. His Majesty's Government of Nepal welcomes nomination by the
Government of Pakistan of H.E. Mr. Naeemuddin Hasan for the post of Secretary-General
of SAARC. We look forward to welcoming him in Kathmandu and assure him
our full cooperation. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>We have before us the report of the twentyfirst session of the Standing
Committee together with the report of the SecretaryGeneral on the activities
of the Association. I will comment briefly on some items in these reports
before moving on to the other items on our agenda. </P>

<P>Entry into force of the Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement
(SAPTA) on December 7 is a milestone in the history of our Association.
South Asia has onefifth of the total world population. It's share in total
world output and in the world trade is, however, minuscule. InterSAARC
trade itself constitutes a very small fraction of the international trade
of the member states. The successive rounds of GATT negotiations in the
Uruguay Round have culminated in agreements on reducing tariff and on establishment
of a single regulatory organization. The process of strengthening existing
economic blocs and zones and creating new ones has gathered further momentum.
Against these developments, SAPTA is an important, albeit modest, beginning.
We must make sure that its effective implementation does not get bogged
down in official formalities and bureaucratic procedures. Apart from the
content it is implementation that is important for progress in achieving
the benefits of regional economic cooperation. Success of SAPTA, could
then provide the basis for more advanced forms of regional cooperation
in the future. </P>

<P>It is a matter of satisfaction that the two of the threetier mechanism
on poverty eradication have held their meetings and the Finance and Planning
Ministers from the SAARC countries are scheduled to meet in New Delhi in
early January next year. Upon completion of this exercise, Nepal would
like the outcome and efficacy of the mechanism to be evaluated thoroughly.
There cannot be one single route to poverty eradication. Each of our seven
countries will have to evolve national strategies suited to individual
circumstances and existing institutional mechanisms. We, however, have
many problems in common and sharing of experiences will strengthen national
efforts. Our efforts within SAARC should be directed towards facilitating
regional macroeconomic stability which stimulate economic growth in each
member state. Creation of productive employment opportunities is the best
answer to the challenge of poverty. SAARC should also facilitate implementation
of human resources development schemes in member states. Declaration of
the 1990s as the SAARC Decade of the Girlchild represents our special commitment
to the most vulnerable group in our society. Nepal hopes that the forthcoming
middecade review will be an occasion for deliberations on further concrete
programmes for the benefit of the girlchild. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>We have noted that you have been continuing your consultations with
the European Union and the ASEAN to promote cooperation between SAARC and
these important regional organizations. It is also satisfying to note that
SAARC has signed memorandums of understanding with a number of international
and regional organizations and similar action with some other organizations
is under active consideration. In this context, I wish to underline the
need to keep the focus of cooperation with these organizations on the agreed
priorities of SAARC. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>Outside our region the world is changing rapidly. Regional integration
is no longer a simple political aspiration; it has become an economic necessity.
With rapid strides towards economic integration in Europe, North America
and East Asia, a region rather than a nation state is emerging as the key
arena for policy making in the political and economic spheres. The present
trends indicate that trade, investment, information and technology will
flow increasingly within and between regional markets. Those left out face
the prospect of stalled economic development. Given this scenario, unless
the economic growth rate of our region increases along with a rise in intraregional
as well as inter regional trade, South Asia runs the danger of being increasingly
marginalized in the future. Despite bonds of geography, history and culture
and despite common adherence to the principles of the United Nations and
the NonAligned Movement, South Asia has been slow in grasping the enormous
potential of a joint approach to collective wellbeing. With SAPTA, we have
taken the first step towards the process of regional Integration, but there
is a long way ahead. In line with the emerging trend in the world economy,
a South Asian economic perspective that allows international investors
to take a regional view in their investment decisions in areas like energy,
infrastructure etc. could also be visualized. This is essential since a
great deal of faith and reliance on international institutions like the
World Bank has at times proved to be an inadequate strategy for countries
in this region. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>It might be pertinent to recall that the Second SAARC Summit had identified
a number of new areas of cooperation. The SAARC Chairs, SAARC Fellowships
and SAARC Scholarships Schemes need to be rescued from the limbo they have
descended into. We need to expand education links, emphasis being given
to scientific, technical and vocational education and to the development
of managerial and entrepreneurial skills. We could think in terms of designating
and supporting selected institutions as centres of excellence to provide
training to students from the region. The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme could
be broadened to cover tourist and business travels and promote peopleto-people
contact. We ought to implement the earlier agreed programme to set up a
special clearing account, as the foreign exchange is a constraint, to facilitate
tourist travels. We should work out cooperative programmes to develop the
service sector with the objective of creating an adequate infrastructure
in telecommunication, informatics and development of producer services
with close links to productive sector and improvement of trade balance
in services. Similarly we should not hesitate to take advantage of opportunities
for sectoral cooperation in the form of regional investment projects in
areas like energy and water resources. Likewise efforts for the establishment
of the South Asian Development Fund requires our attention along with a
plan to secure external contribution. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>Poverty is the scourge of South Asia and it cripples creative capacity
of the people. Poverty is, first of all, a matter of domestic institution
that discriminates structurally and systematically against the poor. Doing
something about poverty calls for hard decisions about land tenure, rural
reconstruction, basic needs strategies, education, productivity incentive
and corruption. The fight against hunger, diseases and illiteracy cannot
be left to market forces alone. The fundamental responsibility for providing
social welfare and services will remain with the governments, whatever
the configuration of economic systems. We have to concentrate all our energy
and resources to place human beings at the centre of our development efforts.
Empowerment of the poor alone can ensure their productive participation
in development efforts. We also need a sustained economic growth that is
employment oriented for only in an expanding economy that can generate
adequate jobs can mass poverty be eradicated. Through SAARC we should work
for a vision of development that can inspire and mobilize the people. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>The vision of a better, peaceful and prosperous South Asia would require
infusion of resources on a massive scale. The basic component of our renewed
efforts must be our own resources, individual and collective. Nature has
blessed our countries with complementary resources; South Asia has a rich
pool of capital resources, scientific and technical skills. Their prudent
use through a cooperative mechanism can be made to yield benefits to all
our countries. In this context, the idea of setting up a South Asian Economic
Conference to examine various facets of regional cooperation needs to be
explored. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>It is time now to think about the role of SAARC SecretaryGeneral and
the Secretariat in promoting regional economic cooperation in the future.
Are we satisfied with the presently assigned role of the SecretaryGeneral
and his staff? Do we want them to play an active role in taking initiatives
and recommending new courses of actions to promote regional cooperation?
This is an important question that should receive attention, if we want
the next ten years to be a period of concrete achievements. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>It has been ten years since SAARC came into existence. It is time that
we try to evaluate the performance of the organisation and see if it measures
to our expectations. But what were our expectations and aspirations when
the organisation was launched ten years ago. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies and Gentlemen, </I></B></P>

<P>SAARC was started with the simple objective of promoting the welfare
of the people of South Asia through effective regional cooperation between
the seven countries in the region. It was a bold vision in view of the
fact that there are difficult political problems between the countries
in the region and also great asymmetry in size, population and resources.
Even though SAARC countries share many strands of common civilization and
culture, there had been little feeling of a regional community and regional
interest. In this setting the vision of SAARC represented the willingness
to, explore new and uncharted territory for the benefit of all the people
in the region. The last ten years towards regional Cooperation in South
Asia has been marked by a series of cautious and hesitating steps in the
direction of identifying areas of cooperation that are least intrusive
in terms of their effects on the policies and programmes of individual
member states. We have to overcome the reluctance to explore the advantages
of the economics of neighbourhood for it would require some degree of coordination
in the economic policies and programmes of individual member states. </P>

<P>In the coming decade the challenge is to gradually overcome this reluctance
to benefit from the economics of neighbourhood, setting aside political
issues that defy quick and easy solutions. This is going to be difficult
but certainly not impossible if there is enough political will among the
member states of the region. </P>

<P><B>Thank you.</B></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>Mr. Chairman ,Distinguished Colleagues ,Mr. SecretaryGeneral ,.Excellencies
</I></P>

<P>It is a privilege for me to have this opportunity to address this historic
commemorative session, on the occasion of the First Decade celebrations
of our Association. We have rightly chosen the theme for this Special Session
to be &quot;Vision for the Second Decade&quot;. While we must appreciate
as well as critically examine the passing decade, it is to the future that
we must now give our full attention. </P>

<P>South Asia is home to onefifth of mankind. It is endowed with a rich
heritage. It is the meltingpot of many diverse cultures and traditions
which make up its inherent strength. Our peoples share the common aspiration
of economic wellbeing. They aspire for a life of peace and dignity. Our
countries confront the common challenge of sustainable economic and social
development. </P>

<P>There is a certain urgency in the need to meet these challenges. No
nation, no region can afford to remain unconcerned about the pace of progress
that other regions have achieved. It is apparent that great and momentous
changes are taking place in the global scene. </P>

<P>South Asia cannot remain immune to the transformation of the international
environment. The countries of the region are already moving towards economic
liberalisation in varying degrees. While we can draw lessons from the experiences
of others, we must tailor them to our own needs and unique requirements.
Through our combined efforts the full potential of South Asia can be realised.
There is no dearth of talent or resources to help us to move in this direction.
</P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman </I></B></P>

<P>In the coming Decade, our Association must move forward to consolidate
the gains of the first Decade. The shared vision and idealism of SAARC
must remain intact. We must strive to strengthen the institutional mechanism
that we have so painstakingly built. The strong foundations that we have
put down, are ready to support the house of SAARC. It is on building this
house that we must now concentrate. </P>

<P>We can rightly be proud of our Association. Notwithstanding a degree
of scepticism, SAARC has moved ahead. Concerted efforts have been made
by Member States in the march towards the goal of poverty eradication.
Our combined efforts are bound to benefit our people. By designating 1995
as the &quot;Year of Poverty Alleviation&quot;, Member States have reaffirmed
their abiding commitment to jointly eradicate poverty. As we enter the
Second Decade, we must carry this crucial effort forward. We are confident
that, through mutual cooperation and support, this objective, though difficult,
will be eventually attained. </P>

<P>The region has turned a new leaf with the establishment of SAPTA. In
due course of time, its benefits will be confirmed. The process has been
gradual. Yet, the effort has not been in vain. </P>

<P>We have noted with satisfaction the progress made in the domain of trade
and economic cooperation, particularly following the last meeting of the
CEC. Likewise, the new agreements signed with other organisations and institutions
will pave the way for substantive cooperation. </P>

<P>The establishment of the South Asian Development Fund (SADF) will open
a new and viable channel for the inflow and management of regional financial
resources. </P>

<P>SAARC has been productively engaged in a whole range of important activities.
To mention but a few, these encompass the areas of agriculture, rural development,
women in development, science and technology and control of drugtrafficking.
These have served to strengthen the fabric of cooperation among Member
States. </P>

<P>We need to translate SAARC's achievements into tangible benefits for
our citizens. We need to ensure that SAARC remains relevant to our peoples
to their aspirations and legitimate hopes. This would require patience
and perseverance. Above all, it will require commitment. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>In striving to do all this, we will have to remain sensitive to the
needs and limitations of the smaller economies. The push to development
must remain an equitable endeavour and must ensure an equal distribution
of opportunities. In building on the achievement of SAPTA, the interests
of LDCs must remain uppermost in the minds of the negotiators. In formulating
the Integrated Plan of Action, it must be ensured that all Member States
have an opportunity to participate in the Plan. In negotiating cooperation
agreements with international and regional organisations, the interests
of the smaller economies must be protected. I say this because it is evident
to us that unless the region can move forward as an integrated whole, with
minimum internal disparities, it will not be possible to derive the optimum
benefits of regional cooperation. </P>

<P>The coming Decade of SAARC will carry our Association into the next
millennium. Worldwide, there is a special focus on this historical metaphor.
The transition to the 21st century is a moment of anticipation, a time
of reflection, a period of stocktaking, as much of looking ahead. Worldwide,
nations are gearing up to face the expected challenges of the next century.
The primary impulse in this new age is the search for prosperity and political
stability. The end of the Cold War provides us an opportunity to marshal
our resources anew, and to liberate ourselves from the political constraints
of the bygone era. </P>

<P>Nations which do not have the confidence or courage to ride this new
wave, will be left standing on the shores of despair. Indeed, Regions which
do not grasp the direction of this rising impulse, will be left by the
wayside as destitute and mendicants. SAARC, as an association of States,
cannot afford to ignore the global trends. SAARC cannot continue to depend
upon the minimal commitment of resources and means, if it is to keep pace
with the new global trends. </P>

<P>I am confident that this is a vision we all share. In the coming Decade,
we will have to find the resources to give substance to our aims and objectives.
We will have to devise failsafe mechanisms to ensure the success of our
efforts. We will have to mobilize the regional resources and tap the indigenous
expertise, both of which are adequately available. </P>

<P>Further progress will require more innovative and resultoriented strategies.
SAARC will have to be institutionally reenforced and strengthened so that
it can become an effective vehicle for common regional cooperative efforts.
Mutually supportive interaction among Member States through the evolution
of such institutionalised mechanisms would give greater content to SAARC.
</P>

<P>Not only must we strengthen the SAARC Secretariat, we must energise
the other institutions of SAARC that we have established. In order to do
so, greater resources, both financial and technical, will have to be committed
by Member States. Areas that will require our special attention include:
trade; investments; infrastructure; environment and social development.
These are areas which require application of mind, technology and resources.
Our region will be able to make advances in these areas only through institutionalised
cooperation. Regional efforts will have to supplement and complement national
efforts. SAARC will have to reach out to other regions as well, to benefit
from the global march towards progress and prosperity. </P>

<P>As we look ahead, we must be inspired by a bold vision of a future South
Asia which has carved its rightful place in the comity of nations. As Member
States, we must exhibit a genuine will and commitment to bring peace and
prosperity to our region. A durable peace would require the courage to
address the basic issues and differences that impact on our relations.
There is no reason why this common forum of ours should not be used for
removing such impediments. We owe this to our people. We cannot shy away
from this responsibility. We cannot afford not to rise to this challenge.

<P>Pakistan joins its partners in SAARC in felicitating the governments
and people of the region on the occasion of the commemoration of the completion
of the First Decade. </P>

<P>At the national level a series of activities and programmes were held
in Pakistan to commemorate the occasion. These included a SAARC walk, cultural
shows, painting/photographic exhibition, tree plantation, quiz contest,
and an official reception. We propose further to organise essay writing
competitions and symposia and seminars. A health education campaign is
planned to be conducted on the civic and medical aspects of blood donation.
A postage stamp will be issued on the occasion. Special programmes broadcast
by Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television included one on the First Decade
of SAARC and another on Poverty Eradication. </P>

<P>As we look to the future, I would like to assure you, on behalf of the
government and people of Pakistan, that we remain committed to taking the
SAARC process forward. We will not be found wanting in our effort to strengthen
the Association for the common benefit of all our peoples. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr. Chairman </I></B></P>

<P>I should like to take this opportunity to place on record my government's
sincere appreciation for the dynamic role that His Excellency Mr. Y.K.
Silwal, Secretary General has played in the progress of the Association.
His sagacity and wisdom have significantly contributed to SAARC as an institution.
He has set very high standards for his successors. I wish him all success
in his future life. </P>

<P>Before I conclude, I should like to thank, on behalf of myself and the
members of my delegation, the Government and the people of India for the
warm hospitality extended to us. We are also grateful for the excellent

<P><I>Mr Chairman, Your Excellencies, Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, </I></P>

<P>As we meet to commemorate the first decade of SAARC's existence, let
me begin by stating how greatly honoured we were by the presence of His
Excellency Shri Narasimha Rao, Prime Minister of India as the Chief Guest
at this Inaugural Session. His address has been both inspiring and thought
provoking and sets the tone not only for our current sessions but also
offers guidance as we seek to chart a course for the second decade of SAARC.
</P>

<P>I would also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to His Excellency
Mr Y K Silwal, SecretaryGeneral of SAARC, who will be leaving us at the
end of this year at the conclusion of his term of office, which has seen
a number of significant developments, notably the ratification of SAPTA.
We thank him for his valuable contribution and wish him well in his future
endeavours. </P>

<P>I would like also to express our sincere thanks to the Government of
India for their generous hospitality, and to compliment all those who have
contributed to the excellent arrangements made for our meeting. It has
been our good fortune to be able to avail of both that hospitality and
of that managerial efficiency, earlier this year as well, when the 8th
SAARC Summit was held in Delhi. </P>

<P>Mr Chairman, ten years ago in Dhaka, in the Assembly Hall of the Parliament,
in the presence of an impressive and representative gathering, the Leaders
of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka affixed
their signatures to a document which sought to create a framework for regional
cooperation in South Asia. The day was 8th December 1985 and the document
was the SAARC Charter. It was in this wise that South Asian regional cooperation
became a reality. </P>

<P>When structured South Asian regional cooperation was first envisaged,
it was widely recognised that we in the region were enmeshed in historical
legacies of mistrust and disputation. The central issue facing those concerned
with forging SAARC was twofold on the one hand whether cooperating in the
practicalities of socioeconomic interaction would help generate the trust
and confidence which alone can underpin a shared political perception on
the other, whether we would first have to get to that point of a common
vision in order to impart the necessary momentum for meaningful cooperation
in core areas of socioeconomic interaction. The decision of the pioneers
of regional cooperation was to proceed simultaneously and vigorously along
twin tracks. </P>

<P>On one plane it was to develop to the greatest extent feasible projects
and programmes of interaction in as wide as possible a range of activities
in socioeconomic and technical fields. On another plane, it was hoped that
by preparing for frequent and regular meetings of regional leaders and
their ministers, the necessary process of &quot;getting to know you&quot;
could be initiated, with a view to developing mutual understanding, confidence
and trust. </P>

<P>Certainly, during its 1st decade SAARC has been able to set in place
the necessary institutional measures for functional cooperation in several
economic and social sectors. These include agriculture, communications
and transport, science and technology, tourism, culture and sports, education,
health and population activities etc. Apart from this SAARC has also made
progress in creating an awareness as to the problems faced by the more
vulnerable segments of society in South Asia, specifically women and children,
the disabled and the youth. </P>

<P>At the same time, it would not be correct to see SAARC as having, during
the past decade, confined itself only to social and economic issues. SAARC
was bold enough to discuss the issue of terrorism and agree on a Regional
Convention for its suppression, as far back as 1987. This decision of SAARC
was at that time perhaps in advance of the comparable measures taken by
other regional organisations and intergovernmental groupings. However,
it must be accepted that up to now the full effect of this Convention has
not been realised, because not all the MemberStates have enacted the necessary
enabling legislation to meet their obligations under the Convention. This
lacuna, I hope Mr Chairman, would shortly be redressed. Indeed, may I say
that it is gratifying that the G7 in its recent Ministerial Declaration
on Countering Terrorism adopted in Ottawa on 12th December, has envisaged
measures very similar to the provisions of our own Regional Convention.
</P>

<P>Trafficking in narcotic drugs is closely related in our region to the
activities of terrorist movements. The funds realised by this illicit trafficking
have been used by terrorist groups to threaten the interests of States
and to destabilise their legal governments. In our regional Convention
on this subject we have an effective mechanism to combat this menace. It
is imperative that we make full use of the institutions established up
to now under these two Conventions, namely, the SAARC Terrorist Offences
Monitoring Desk and the SAARC Drug Offences Monitoring Desk. </P>

<P><B><I>Mr Chairman, </I></B></P>

<P>In the second half of its first decade we saw SAARC venturing out into
core areas of economic cooperation. The most significant in this regard
was the commencement of trade liberalisation through SAPTA. We can congratulate
ourselves on the fact that SAPTA has now become operational. Due to various
factors, of which we are all too aware, the initial round of concessions
under SAPTA had to be more of a symbolic nature. The current international
climate however requires that for our regional economic growth, we need
to move beyond these symbolic concessions. At the same time our experience
in negotiating SAPTA and its first round of trade preferences has, I believe,
given us the necessary confidence that we can indeed do much more. This
confidence certainly manifested itself during the meeting of the Commerce
Secretaries last month in New Delhi. </P>

<P>The Commerce Secretaries agreed that the first round of trade negotiations
for widening and deepening the existing tariff cuts could now begin through
the mechanism of a further round of InterGovernmental Group Meetings. Besides
further tariff reductions there has also been agreement that the new IGG
would focus on the elimination of nontariff barriers and other trade control
measures. I believe we all realise, Mr. Chairman, that unless these barriers
to trade are eliminated, the mere reduction of tariffs would not amount
to anything more than the left hand taking away what the right hand has
given. The second round of IGG Meetings therefore could be even more important
than the first round. The Council of Ministers too could contribute substantially
to the success of the second round of the IGG by reiterating its call for
the speedy and timebound elimination of trade barriers. </P>

<P>While in this process of trade liberalization the Governments are taking
the necessary institutional and fiscal measures, the private sectors of
our countries must themselves resolve to take advantage of this enabling
climate, particularly in view of our common adoption of a free market developmental
pattern. The establishment of the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry
and its recognition by SAARC as a regional apex body was certainly a very
positive development. I am happy to inform the Council that in this context
of generating interaction amongst business communities in our countries
we in Sri Lanka were also able to make a further contribution through the
convening of a Business Leaders' Forum in Colombo. It is the aggregation
of such efforts, both at the governmental level and private sector levels,
which will in the final analysis determine the success of our endeavours.
</P>

<P>In regard to meaningful cooperation in core economic areas we will,
however, be affected by an inescapable factor applicable to us all. I refer
to the assymetry of the Membercountries of our region in terms of physical
and material resources, managerial and technical expertise and levels of
development. All cooperation is at heart a matter of give and take. Where
a significant assymetry prevails, it is necessary for those who have to
give rather more. That sort of exchange can only stem from a prior attainment
of mutual confidence and friendship, which will encourage such generosity.
It is at this point that the other plane of SAARC activities becomes relevant.
It had been hoped that the frequent and regular meetings of leaders and
other ministers under the SAARC umbrella would be availed of by the participants
to indulge in informal confidential exchanges amongst themselves. This
would have helped to disabuse their minds of misunderstandings and suspicion,
and to develop common perceptions regarding their situation and their future.
Regrettably the record of success in this venture has been patchy. One
recalls the exchanges between the Indian and Pakistani Prime Ministers
at the 1988 SAARC Summit. One also recalls the earlier bilateral exchanges
between the Indian Prime Minister and the Sri Lankan President at the 1986
SAARC Summit. Notwithstanding the arrangement where by this process had
been encouraged by expressly excluding bilateral disputes and contentious
issues from formal deliberations at SAARC Meetings, a lack of mutual confidence
has prevented these issues being considered even privately and informally.
</P>

<P>However, unless the opportunities of these meetings are exploited by
the participants, we are unlikely to move forward with any discernible
success in developing mutual confidence and trust. There are suggestions
even now that SAARC should embark upon an open and frank consideration
of contentious political issues which would prepare the participants for
further free and frank exchange. </P>

<P>One practical way out of this difficulty is of course for SAARC ministers
and officials to meet as frequently and regularly as circumstances warrant,
to forge common viewpoints and decisions in our interaction with the outside
world. There was a beginning of this process when a Ministerial Meeting
in Dhaka prepared a common SAARC position for the 4th Women's Conference
in Beijing. Another instance will arise at the projected meeting of the
SAARC Food Ministers in anticipation of the World Food Summit in 1996.
</P>

<P>In this context, it now gives me great pleasure formally to propose
that Sri Lanka hosts a Ministerial Meeting in the field of Housing, by
way of preparation for a common SAARC position at the Habitat II Meeting
to be held in Istanbul in June 1996. </P>

<P>As we enter the second decade, the challenge before us in SAARC is twofold:
firstly, to realise the full potential of our collective endeavours and
secondly thereby to fulfil the expectations of our peoples. What this requires
in the final analysis, Mr. Chairman, is for us, the Leaders and Ministers
of the region to manifest the courage of our convictions. </P>
