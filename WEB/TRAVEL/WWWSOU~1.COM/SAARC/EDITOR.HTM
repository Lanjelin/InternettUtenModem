<p><em>Dear readers, </em></p>
<p>On 8 December 1995, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) completed its 
first ten years. During this relatively short period we have witnessed the regional organization come 
of age. The Association, which was born in Dhaka with the signing of its Charter a decade ago by 
the leaders of the seven South Asian countries has come a long way since then. Member countries 
have been able to lay down a firm foundation to strengthen cooperation within the region for the 
betterment of their peoples. SAARC as a regional organisation has provided the much needed 
institutional framework for cooperation in a region which on the one hand is bound by a common 
cultural heritage and on the other marked by diverse socio-economic features. </p>
<p>Given these realities, SAARC has always moved ahead with a cautious step-by-step approach, 
which is the key to the steady progress made by the Association over the years. Considerable 
advances have been made in several important areas, most notably, in the social sector and now 
increasingly in the economic and trade areas. With the operationalisation of South Asian 
Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) member countries are moving forward to realise a 
South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) preferably by the year 2000, The bold initiative taken at 
the highest political level to meet the challenge of eradicating poverty from the region preferably by 
the year 2002 has been followed up by member states with appropriate policies and programmes 
at the national level with an effective monitoring and evaluation mechanism set up at the regional 
level within the SAARC framework. </p>
<p>Recognising the importance of creating greater awareness of the initiatives of SAARC to address 
the pressing issues faced by the peoples of South Asia, we at the Secretariat are making continuous 
efforts to disseminate as much information as possible both within and outside the region. Since 
1990 the Secretariat has been bringing out its quarterly SAARC Newsletter which has provided 
useful information on SAARC activities. Beginning from January 1996, the quarterly SAARC 
Newsletter has been replaced by a monthly Newsletter with the aim of providing more up-to-date 
information to our readers. Through our regular press releases effort is made to keep the public 
informed of the on-going activities of the Organisation. The programmes under the SAARC Audio 
Visual Exchange (SAVE), initiated in 1987, have also been effective in generating better 
understanding of the commonalities in the region. </p>
<p>This first issue of SPECTRUM- the magazine of SAARC Secretariat is being published at an 
important juncture in the evolution of regional cooperation in South Asia. SAARC having 
completed its first decade is now moving forward to meet the challenges ahead. It is in this context 
that we decided to dedicate this issue to mark the Tenth Anniversary. In this issue we have tried to 
highlight the programmes and activities organised by member states both at the national and 
regional level to mark the decade. In the future issues of the magazine, we will attempt to provide 
the reader with more indepth information on our work. We also intend to cover in the magazine, the 
socio-economic and cultural aspects of member countries, to foster greater understanding and 
appreciation of the commonalities in the region. </p>
<p>In our endeavor to improve the magazine, we would welcome from our readers, comments, 
suggestions and more importantly contributions in terms of articles, write-ups on relevant subjects. </p>
