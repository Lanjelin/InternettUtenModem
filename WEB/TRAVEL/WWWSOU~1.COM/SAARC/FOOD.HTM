<p>Assuring food security for its people is an important goal for all the member countries of SAARC 
and the timely availability of adequate food on affordable terms is an important indicator of the 
progress made in this regard. Significant progress achieved by the SAARC countries in this context 
needs sustained efforts. It also calls for regularly monitoring various key indicators relating to 
agriculture production, and continuously adjusting our development programmes to pragmatically 
address our various concerns regarding food production, their supply and marketing. </p>
<p>Within the SAARC framework, Technical Committees on Agriculture and Rural Development have 
been focusing on these issues to implement concrete regional programmes of cooperation. SAARC 
has also established a Food Security Reserve to extend assistance to member countries in times of 
emergencies. Several other initiatives are also at different phases of implementation to supplement 
collaborative efforts in this key area. One such area identified was the necessity to regularly update 
the foodgrain status of SAARC member countries on a continuous basis to facilitate policy 
formulation and implementation of appropriate programmes in the area of agriculture, especially 
food production. </p>
<p>To fill up a very important knowledge-gap in this area, the Governing Board of SAARC Food 
Security Reserve suggested during its Fifth meeting that SAARC Secretariat should regularly bring 
out a bulletin entitled &#147;Foodgrain status in SAARC member states&#148;. The first compilation of the 
information received from Member States is published in this issue of SPECTRUM. It is hoped that 
policy makers and development administrators would find the figures not only revealing but also 
useful in their work. </p>
