<p align=left>&#160;<b>UNDCP-SAARC WORKSHOP ON DRUG TRAFFICKING AND DRUG ABUSE 
CONTROL <br>
</b>UNDCP-SAARC Workshop on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse Control was held in Colombo 
on 15-17 May 1996. The Workshop inaugurated by Secretary, Ministry of Defence of Sri Lanka, 
Chandrananda de Silva, was attended by participants from all SAARC member countries. 
Consultant at the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board and former Vice-Chancellor of the 
University of Colombo, Prof. Nandadasa Kodagoda made the opening presentation and the UN 
Resident Coordinator in Colombo Arve Ofstad made the Welcome Address. SAARC 
Secretary-General, Naeem U. Hasan and Director, R.P. Jayasooriya from the SAARC Secretariat 
also participated in the Workshop and made statements. Chief of the UNDCP Regional Section for 
Asia &amp; Pacific, A. Latif also spoke at the inaugural session. </p>
<p>The Workshop which was chaired by Dr. Diyanath Samarasinghe focused on the critical areas of 
drug control and demand reduction, in particular sub-regional strategies to address them. The 
Workshop while drawing up strategies, also recommended Plans of Action in these two areas for 
implementation at the national and regional levels. </p>
<p>The strategy relating to drug control is aimed to prevent cultivation, production, manufacture, 
trafficking and consumption of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, through regional 
cooperation among the SAARC countries, to a measurable extent within 2-3 years and a 
continuing reduction thereafter bringing about a progressive reduction in drug related crime, 
accidents, and imprisonment in the region. The Plan of Action drawn up includes strengthening the 
existing SAARC Drug Offenses Monitoring Desk (SDOMD) established in Colombo, taking steps 
to enhance drug law enforcement through improved mobility, communication, surveillance 
techniques and laboratory capacity. </p>
<p>Considering that demand reduction is an essential element in overall drug control, the strategy to 
address this issue recommended by the meeting stresses on participatory preventive action 
addressing, particularly youth, school-goers, workers and female population. It also includes 
research and development on preventive education and treatment/ rehabilitation modalities, with a 
view to making the procedure more scientific and more effective. The Plan of Action proposes 
SAARC/UNDCP action for exchanging information and training, especially with regard to 
innovative and promising approaches developed within the region, better inter-country 
co-operation, and improving the NGO activity within the region. </p>
<p>The Workshop, which was the first activity organised since SAARC and UNDCP signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding in August 1995, is an important step in furthering cooperation 
between the two organisations in the critical area of drug control and drug abuse.</p>

<p><b>NATIONAL FOCAL POINTS (NFPs) DEALING WITH SAARC DOCUMENTATION 
CENTRE (SDC) MEET</b> <br>
The First Meeting of the National Focal Points dealing with the SAARC Documentation Centre 
was held at Kathmandu on May 21-22, 1996. The meeting was attended by the Coordinators 
from all Member Countries and Director, Tahir Iqbal Butt from the SAARC Secretariat. </p>
<p>While inaugurating the meeting, National Planning Commission Member from Nepal, Dr. Bal Gopal 
Vaidya stated that most of the developing countries are not able to allocate sufficient resources in 
the generation and dissemination of information and Member Countries in the SAARC region 
should therefore make collective efforts to strengthen cooperation in the vital field. </p>
<p>The meeting discussed the role of Coordinators in strengthening the system and made a number of 
important decisions to enhance their </p>
<p>role. They also discussed the availability of Information Resources in their respective countries. 
Noting that there was sufficient information available in the region, the meeting discussed and 
agreed upon strategies to effectively disseminate information about these resources. They include 
streamlining the communication channels between the SDC and NFPs and establishing a proper 
mechanism to publicise the activities and programmes in this field. </p>
<p>SAARC Documentation Centre was established in New Delhi in May 1994 as the third regional 
centre under the SAARC framework. The Centre which functions as the hub of the SAARC 
Documentation System (SDS) has its repositories in the member states, the SAARC Secretariat 
and other SAARC regional centres. </p>

<p><b>SUB-GROUP OF CASAC MEETS IN KATHMANDU</b> <br>
The Sub-Group of the Executive Committee of Coalition for Action on South Asian Cooperation

for 1996, the meeting reviewed developments relating to South Asian Regional Cooperation since 
November 1995. The meeting also discussed and made a number of decisions regarding further 
steps to strengthen the linkage between the SAARC Secretariat and CASAC. </p>

read out the Secretary-General's statement, in which he highlighted the important role of 
independent groups such as CASAC in supplementing the efforts of SAARC in strengthening 
regional cooperation in South Asia. </p>
<p>CASAC is an independent group working to accelerate progress of South Asian Regional 
Cooperation through national and regional level activities. </p>

<p><b>SAARC-UNDP COOPERATION ACCELERATES</b> <b>GROUP VISIT TO SYANGJA 
ORGANISED</b> <br>
SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan; Resident Representative of UNDP in Kathmandu, 
Ms. Carroll Long; SAARC Ambassadors in Nepal and selected Ambassadors of donor countries 
and regional agencies as well as representatives from the media, participated in a field visit to 
Syangja - a district in Nepal - organised by UNDP from 24-25 May 1996. The trip provided an 
opportunity for the participants to gather first-hand information on the poverty alleviation 
programme being implemented by UNDP under the project No. RAS/96/600. </p>
<p>The programme of the three-day trip included visits to Shreekrishna Gandaki Village Development 
Committee of Syangja District; Kaligandaki Hydropower Project office at Beltari; Drinking water 
project at Barichaur; Kaligandaki project; Jaipate High School; as well as meetings with village 
specialists at Jaipat and village organisation members at Mirmiphant; </p>
<p>On May 25, 1996, the participants visited the District Development Office, Arjun Chaupari 
market; Arjun Chaupari High School. They met with village organisation/women's organisation at 
Chaupari and witnessed a cheque handing over ceremony for the construction of a village road. </p>
<p>In the context of their poverty alleviation programme, UNDP has been trying to promote 
self-sufficient village organisations which would be able to undertake and sustain development 
works for their members. Resource generation through appropriate saving/credit scheme is at the 
very core of the programme and UNDP is encouraging these organisations to be self financing in 
nature. Only in some exceptional cases, UNDP is providing seed money to the members of the 
village organisations. </p>
<p>The visit also gave a unique opportunity to assess first-hand the UNDP led initiatives to promote 
social mobilisation in the member countries to eradicate poverty. UNDP has undertaken this 
initiative to follow up on some of the relevant decisions taken by the SAARC Heads of State or 
Governments in the context of specific SAARC commitment to eradicate poverty from the 
SAARC region, preferably by the year 2002 A.D. </p>
<p>UNDP has recently established a special Unit in Kathmandu to monitor and coordinate 
SAARC/UNDP cooperation in poverty eradication. </p>

<p><b>SECRETARY-GENERAL ATTENDS WILTON PARK CONFERENCE MEETS WITH 
SENIOR BRITISH OFFICIALS AND THE COMMONWEALTH 
SECRETARY-GENERAL</b> <br>
SAARC Secretary-General Naeem U. Hasan attended the Wilton Park Conference in London 
from 7-10 May 1996 as a guest speaker representing SAARC. The Conference, which had &quot;India 
and her Neighbours&quot; as the subject for discussion, was attended by over fifty participants from 
different fields. </p>
<p>Speaking on the subject &quot;How can regional trade and economic interaction best be promoted&quot;, the 
Secretary-General summarized some important developments that have taken place in the direction 
of greater commercial and economic cooperation within SAARC. He also highlighted a number of 
obstacles existing in the region, such as reliance of member states to meet their import requirements 
from within the region, and constraints to trade expansion within the region due to restrictive 
policies and other impediments. While sharing his impressions and ideas as to how SAARC could 
further promote regional cooperation in the economic and trade fields, the Secretary-General 
expressed his view that economic cooperation among the SAARC countries can be significantly 
stepped up by addressing the problems identified in the Trade Manufactures and Services Study 
conducted by SAARC in a committed and sustained manner. </p>

in South Asia lay in combining effective economic initiatives with confidence building measures and 
the promotion of dialogue at every level. </p>

for the Secretary General which included calls on the Deputy Speaker of the British Parliament, 
Michael Morris, Minister of State Jeremy Hanley and other senior officials of the British Foreign
