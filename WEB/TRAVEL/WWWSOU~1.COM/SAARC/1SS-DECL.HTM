<p align=center><i>The Dhaka Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of the Member Countries of 
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on 7th December 1995.</i> </p>
<p align=left><strong><br>
INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p align=left>1.The President of Bangladesh, the King of Bhutan, the Prime Minister of India, the President of 
Maldives, the King of Nepal, the President of Pakistan and the President of Sri Lanka met in 
Dhaka on 7 and 8 December 1985.</p>
<p align=left>2. The Heads of State or Government underscored the historic significance of their first ever South 
Asian Summit meeting. They considered it to be a tangible manifestation of their determination to 
cooperate regionally, to work together towards finding solutions towards their common problems in 
a spirit of friendship, trust and mutual understanding and to the creation of an order based on 
mutual respect, equity and shared benefits.</p>
<p align=left>3. They recognized that periodic meetings at their level were central to the promotion of mutual 
trust, confidence and cooperation among their countries.</p>
<p align=left>4. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed that their fundamental goal was to accelerate the 
process of economic and social development in their respective countries through the optimum 
utilization of their human and material resources, so as to promote the welfare and prosperity of 
their peoples and to improve their quality of life. They were conscious that peace and security was 
an essential prerequisite for the realization of this objective.</p>
<p align=left>5. The leaders of the South Asian countries reaffirmed their commitment to the UN Charter and the 
principles governing sovereign equality of States, peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference 
in internal affairs and non-use or threat of use of force against the territorial integrity and political 
independence of other States. They reiterated that the United Nations constituted the most 
important forum for the resolution of all issues affecting international peace and security.</p>
<p align=left>6. They also reaffirmed their deep conviction in the continuing validity and relevance of the 
objectives of the Nonaligned movement as an important force in international relations.</p>
<p align=left>7. The Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the countries of South Asia, who 
constituted one-fifth of humanity, were faced with the formidable challenges posed by poverty, 
underdevelopment, low levels of production, unemployment and pressure of population 
compounded by exploitation of the past and other adverse legacies. They felt that, bound as their 
countries were by many common values rooted in their social, ethnic, cultural and historical 
traditions, regional cooperation provided a logical response to these problems. They were 
conscious of their individual and regional strengths, their potential as a huge market, their substantial 
human and natural resources and the complementarities of their economies. They were confident 
that with effective regional cooperation, they could make optimum use of these capacities for the 
benefit of their peoples, accelerate the pace of their economic development and enhance their 
national and collective self-reliance. They were convinced that their countries, which had made 
important contributions to the enrichment of human civilization, could together play their due role in 
international relations and influence decisions which affected them.</p>
<p align=left>8. The Heads of State or Government emphasised that strengthening of regional cooperation in 
South Asia required greater involvement of their peoples. They agreed to increase interaction and 
further promote people-to-people contacts at various levels among their countries. To this end, 
they decided to take steps to create awareness and public opinion in the region.</p>
<p align=left>9. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the progress already made in the implementation 
of the Integrated Programme of Action in the nine mutually agreed areas. They expressed their 
desire to consolidate and further expand cooperative efforts within an appropriate institutional 
frame work in a spirit of partnership and equality.</p>
<p align=left>10. The leaders were convinced that they could effectively pursue their individual and collective 
objectives and improve the quality of life of their peoples only in an atmosphere of peace and 
security. In this context, they expressed concern at the deteriorating international political situation. 
They were alarmed at the unprecedented escalation of arms race particularly in its nuclear aspect. 
They recognized that mankind today was confronted with the threat of self extinction arising from a 
massive accumulation of the most destructive weapons ever produced. The arms race intensified 
international tension and violated the principles of the UN Charter. The leaders called upon the 
nuclear weapons-states for urgent negotiations for a comprehensive Test Ban Treaty leading to the 
complete cessation of testing, production and deployment of nuclear weapons. In this connection, 
they welcomed the recent meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev in 
Geneva and expressed the hope that the meeting would have a positive effect on international 
peace and security.</p>
<p align=left>11. The Heads of State or Government expressed deep concern at the continuing crises in the 
global economy. They underscored that deteriorating economic and social conditions had seriously 
retarded developing countries. Sharply falling commodity prices, deterioration in the terms of trade, 
intensification of protectionist measures, spiralling debt burden and a decline in the flow of external 
resources, especially concessional assistance, had caused a serious setback to the economic 
development of the developing countries. These had been compounded by natural disasters and 
precarious world food security situation affecting developing countries. They also expressed 
concern over the diminishing capacity of international financial and technical institutions to respond 
effectively to the needs of the disadvantaged and poorer countries and regretted that the spirit of 
multilateral cooperation had begun to falter and weaken. This was particularly disturbing in the face 
of increased interdependence of developed and developing countries and the fact that economic 
revival of North was closely linked to economic progress in South. They believed that 
developments during the past decades had clearly demonstrated the structural imbalances and 
inequities inherent in the existing international economic system and its inadequacy to deal with 
problems of development.</p>
<p align=left>12. They strongly urged that determined efforts should be made by the international community 
towards realization of the goals and targets of the International Development Strategy as well as the 
Substantial New Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries. They called for urgent 
resumption of the North-South dialogue and early convening of an International Conference on 
Money and Finance for Development with universal participation.</p>
<p align=left>13. The Heads of State or Government were conscious of the historic importance of the Dhaka 
Summit and reiterated their conviction that the launching of the South Asian Association for 
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which they had established at this meeting, would place regional 
cooperation on a firm foundation, play an important role in accelerating the pace of economic and 
social development of their countries, promote the objectives of individual and collective self 
reliance and further the cause of peace, progress and stability in their region and the world.</p>
<p align=left>14. The Heads of State or Government of Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka 
were deeply appreciative of the exemplary Chairmanship of their Meeting by the President of 
Bangladesh. They expressed their profound gratitude for the warm and gracious hospitality 
extended to them by the Government and the people of Bangladesh and for the excellent 
arrangements made for the meeting.</p>

approved that the Standing Committee should set up a Study Group to examine the problem of 
terrorism a it affects the security and stability of Member States of SAARC. They further directed 
the Council of Ministers to consider the report of this Study Group and submit recommendations to 
them as to how best the Member States could cooperate among themselves to solve this. They also 
approved that a similar exercise be carried out with regard to the problem of drug trafficking and 
abuse. They decided that the Member Governments should concert their views on the ongoing 
discussions on New International Economic Order and the improvement of the World Trading 
System through GATT taking particularly into account the interest of the least developed among the 
developing countries. For this purpose it was decided to convene a Ministerial level meeting. The 
Standing Committee should convene a meeting to prepare for it. The Heads of State or 
Government gratefully accepted the offer of the President of Pakistan to host both these meetings. 
The Heads of State or Government emphasized that women should increasingly participate in 
activities at the regional level within the framework of SAARC and that Programmes and Projects 
should be devised to ensure their active participation in the development process. They therefore 
directed the Standing Committee to convene a Ministerial Level Conference on the subject to 
identify the areas of activities and plan a Programme of Action. They gratefully accepted the offer 
of the Prime Minister of India to host such a conference. The Heads of State or Government who 
have decided that the Association shall have a Secretariat directed the Foreign Ministers to 
consider details regarding its location, structure, functions and financing and submit those for the 
consideration of Heads of State or Government. The Heads of State or Government decided to 
hold their next meeting in November, 1986. They gratefully accepted the offer of the Prime 
Minister of India to host that meeting. They also gratefully accepted the offer of the King of Bhutan 
to host the Annual SAARC Summit of 1987. The Heads of State or Government unanimously 
accepted the recommendation of the Fourth Meeting of Foreign Ministers on the emblem of 
SAARC.</p>
