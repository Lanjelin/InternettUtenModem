<p><em>The Bangalore Declaration of the Heads of State or Government of the member countries of 
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation issued on November 17, 1986.</em></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>1.The President of Bangladesh, the King of Bhutan, the Prime Minister of India, the President of 
Maldives, the King of Nepal, the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the President of Sri Lanka 
assembled at the second SAARC Summit in Bangalore on 16 and 17 November, 1986.</p>
<p>2. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their desire of promoting peace, stability, amity 
and progress in the region through strict adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter 
and Non-alignment, particularly respect for the principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, 
national independence, non-use of force and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States 
and peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>
<p>3. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed the will of their peoples and Governments to 
work together in accordance with the SAARC Charter to devise common policies and approaches 
for finding common solutions to the shared problems that all of them face. They stressed that mutual 
trust, goodwill and understanding must animate their cooperative effort under SAARC. Progress 
and prosperity in each country would redound to the benefit of others. This was what constituted 
the SAARC spirit.</p>
<p>4. The leaders reaffirmed that the principal goal of SAARC was to promote the welfare of the 
peoples of South Asia, to improve their quality of life, to accelerate economic growth, social 
programmes and cultural development in the region and to provide all individuals the opportunity to 
live in dignity and to realize their full potential.</p>
<p>5. The Heads of State or Government recalled that the countries of South Asia had been linked by 
age-old cultural, social and historical traditions. These had led to enriching interaction of ideas, 
values, culture and philosophies. These commonalities constituted solid foundations for regional 
cooperation for addressing more effectively the economic and social problems.</p>
<p>6. The Heads of State or Government recalled that the South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation was the most populous regional grouping in the world. The countries of the region had 
large, rich and varied human and natural resources. They expressed their determination to achieve 
the optimum utilization of these resources by intensifying their cooperation, bearing in mind the 
immense present and potential complementarities among their economies. They recognised that this 
would require increasing exchange among their countries, on the basis of mutual benefit, of ideas, 
experience and technology as well as goods and services, which utilize and enhance the productive 
capacity of each of their countries and build their collective self reliance. They were convinced that 
the countries of South Asia which had been the cradle of human civilization and culture could, 
acting together co-operatively and cohesively, once again play their due role in the comity of 
nations.</p>
<p>7. The Heads of State or Government reiterated the great importance of the increasing involvement 
of the people for ensuring the success of regional co-operation. They emphasized the need for 
promoting greater contacts among the peoples of the region through such action as regular and 
frequent interchange of scholars, academics, artists, authors, professionals and businessmen as well 
as facilitation of tourism</p>
<p>8. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that considerable progress had been 
achieved in the implementation of SAARC Integrated Programme of Action. They expressed their 
firm commitment to consolidate and streamline further the implementation of the IPA. They agreed 
that a progressive movement towards more concrete and action-oriented projects and programmes 
was essential to ensure more tangible benefits from SAARC to the peoples of the region. The 
Heads of State or Government emphasized the importance of expanding cooperative endeavours 
under SAARC. They welcomed the establishment of the Technical Committees on Women in 
Development, and on the Prevention of Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse.</p>
<p>9. The Heads of State or Government welcomed the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding 
on the establishment of the SAARC Secretariat by the Council of Ministers and their decision to 
locate the Secretariat in Kathmandu and appoint Ambassador Abul Ahsan of Bangladesh as the 
first Secretary-General of SAARC. They were convinced that the establishment of the Secretariat 
would assist in the coordination of SAARC activities and more fruitful implementation of its 
programmes and projects.</p>
<p>10. The Heads of State or Government recognised that meeting the needs of all children was the 
principal means of human resources development. Children should, therefore, be given the highest 
priority in national development planning. The Heads of State or Government underlined the 
importance of enhancing public consciousness and building a national political consensus on the 
rights of the children. In this context they called for an early conclusion and adoption of the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. They subscribed to the goals of universal immunization by 
1990, universal primary education, maternal and child nutrition, provision of safe drinking water and 
adequate shelter before 2000 A. D. They also believed that it should be possible to ensure at the 
end of the century, that no child need die or be denied development, for reasons of material 
poverty in the family. They directed the Standing Committee to undertake annual reviews of the 
situation of children in the SAARC countries, monitoring of programmes and exchange of 
experience.</p>
<p>11. The Heads of State or Government agreed that co-operation among SAARC States was vital 
if terrorism was to be prevented and eliminated from the region. They unequivocally condemned all 
acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and deplored their impact on life and property, 
social economic development, political stability, regional and international peace and co-operation. 
They recognized the importance of the principles laid down in UN Resolution 2625 which among 
others required that each State should refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in 
acts of civil strife or terrorist acts in another State or acquiesing in organized activities within its 
territory directed towards the commission of such acts.</p>
<p>12. The Heads of State or Government expressed their concern at the crisis facing the United 
Nations system. They reiterated their deep commitment to the purposes and principles of the 
United Nations Charter and their support for and faith in the United Nations as the most important 
international forum for addressing issues of peace, disarmament and development and an essential 
instrument for bringing about justice and equity in international political and economic relations. 
They resolved to concert their efforts in all multilateral fora within the United Nations system to 
preserve and strengthen the Organisation and to prevent erosion of its role, functions and principles.</p>
<p>13. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their deep commitment to the principles and 
objectives of the Non-aligned Movement and underlined the historic role the Movement had been 
playing in strengthening international peace, promoting development, establishing equitable and just 
economic relations and strengthening international co-operation in all fields. The success of the 
Harare Summit of the Non-aligned countries was yet another demonstration of the strength and 
unity of the Movement and the increasing respect that it had come to command in the international 
community. They affirmed full support for the decisions adopted at the Summit and called for their 
early implementation.</p>
<p>14. The leaders of the South Asian countries were convinced that an environment of peace, 
security and respect for international law was essential for their growth and stability. Unfortunately, 
this environment had become increasingly adverse for the pursuit of their cherished goals. The 
international political scene was marred by strife and tension due to Great Power policies and 
practices of domination and intervention as well as the increased resort to the treat or use of force, 
aggression, occupation, pressure, economic coercion and interference in flagrant violation of the 
principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. The arms race, particularly the 
nuclear arms race, had escalated to a point where it jeopardizes the most fundamental of all human 
rights - the right to live.</p>
<p>15. The Heads of State or Government noted with deep disappointment that the promise held out 
by the Reykjavik Summit could not be realized. They, however, noted with satisfaction that the 
proposals made at the Summit were still on the table. They expressed the earnest hope that the 
negotiations would be resumed without delay so that a decisive step could be taken towards 
realizing the ultimate goal of eliminating nuclear weapons altogether. The Heads of State or 
government called for the early conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p>16. The Heads of State or Government were deeply concerned that the world economy continued 
to be in the throes of crisis, with particularly harsh and severe consequences for the economies and 
development prospects and aspirations of the developing countries. They endorsed the Declaration 
of the SAARC Ministerial Meeting on International Economic Issues held in Islamabad and its 
analysis of the exceptionally adverse external economic environment which retards the development 
of the South Asian and other developing countries. These negative factors include depressed 
commodity prices, rising protectionism, global recession, lower export earnings, net outflow of 
financial resources from developing countries and an aggravated debt crisis.</p>
<p>17. The Heads of State or Government noted that the rates of growth in the developed countries 
had turned out to be much lower than what was earlier projected and that the projection for future 
growth in these countries was not at all encouraging. They expressed their concern at the 
implications of these trends for the development prospects of the developing countries. They 
welcomed the recent recognition by the developed countries that the chronic problems of massive 
payment imbalances, high interest rates, unstable exchange rates and high unemployment are 
structural in nature. In view of global interdependence, the co-ordination of macro-economic 
policies, contemplated at the Tokyo Summit of the seven major industrialized countries, cannot be 
effective in achieving sustained global economic growth unless it encompasses the developing 
countries.</p>
<p>18. The leaders urged that the recent retreat from multilateralism should be urgently reversed 
through a revival of the North-South dialogue which is responsive to the changed circumstances in 
the world economy. This must include a process of reform of monetary and financial system, 
through an International Conference on Money and Finance for Development, and urgent measures 
for preserving and strengthening the multilateral trading system. In the search for revival of global 
growth, priority must be accorded to exploiting the vast potential for expanded production, 
consumption and trade which exists in the developing countries. In all these endeavours, high 
priority should be accorded to supporting the development of the least developed countries, in 
particular, through the full and effective implementation of the Substantial New Programme of 
Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1980s.</p>
<p>19. The Heads of State or Government noted with satisfaction that at the SAARC Ministerial 
Meeting on International Economic Issues a number of priority objectives of the SAARC countries 
have been identified. These include: enlarged concessional assistance, the doubling in three years of 
the financial flows for the development of developing countries, amelioration of official debts, trade 
liberalization, especially in textiles and agriculture, commodity price stabilization, transfer of 
technology and special treatment for least developed SAARC countries. The Heads of State or 
Government agreed that the SAARC members should closely and regularly consult and co-operate 
in relevant international economic conferences and institutions in order to promote the above 
mentioned objectives. They recognised that an important opportunity in this context would be 
provided by UNCTAD VII.</p>
<p>20. The Heads of State or Government were of the view that the forthcoming New Round of 
Multilateral Trade Negotiations posed a challenge for their countries as well as an opportunity to 
accelerate their development through the expansion of their exports. They underlined the 
importance of the effective implementation with immediate effect and continuance until the formal 
completion of the negotiations, of the commitment to observe a standstill on protectionist measures 
and to roll these back under multilateral surveillance. They also expected that the principles of 
transparency and differential and more favourable treatment for the developing countries would be 
applied systematically and in concrete terms in the negotiations. They decided to concert their 
positions in these negotiations with a view to deriving maximum benefits from them in accordance 
with their national objectives and priorities.</p>
<p>21. The Heads of State or Government expressed their conviction that the Bangalore Summit had 
helped in consolidating the gains of regional co-operation activities so far undertaken by SAARC 
while, at the same time, exploring new avenues and possibilities for such co-operation. The 
Bangalore Summit had made a significant contribution to strengthening and streamlining the 
institutional basis for such co-operation.</p>
<p>22. The Heads of State or Government reiterated their determination and will to expand and 
strengthen their co-operation under SAARC. They underlined their belief that SAARC reflected a 
resurgence of the South Asian consciousness which had inspired the peoples of this region over 
several millenia. The leaders expressed their deep conviction that South Asian regional 
co-operation would not only have a salutary effect on bilateral relations between the countries of 
the region, but also impart strength and stability to these relations.</p>
<p align=left>23. The Heads of State or Government of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka were deeply appreciative of the exemplary manner in which the Prime Minister of India 
discharged his responsibilities as Chairman of the Meeting. They expressed their profound gratitude 
for the warm and gracious hospitality extended to them by the Government and people of India and 
for the excellent arrangements made for the Meeting.</p>

<p align=center><strong>JOINT PRESS RELEASE</strong></p>
<p align=center><em>Joint Press Release Issued an November 17, 1986 at the End of the Second SAARC Summit, 
Bangalore.</em></p>
<p>1.The President of Bangladesh, the King of Bhutan, the Prime Minister of India, the President of 
Maldives, the King of Nepal, the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the President of Sri Lanka met in 
Bangalore on 16 and 17 November, 1986.</p>
<p>2. They issued the Bangalore Declaration. A Memorandum of Understanding on the Establishment 
of the SAARC Secretariat was signed by the Foreign Ministers of the SAARC countries in their 
presence.</p>
<p>3. They welcomed the announcement by His Majesty's Government of Nepal that the Secretariat 
would be inaugurated in Kathmandu on 16 January, 1987. They decided that the first 
Secretary-General of the SAARC Secretariat, His Excellency Mr. Abul Ahsan, would assume 
charge of this office from that date.</p>
<p>4. They also considered several new ideas for expanding and strengthening the co-operative 
programmes under SAARC. While approving the following ideas in principle they directed that 
these be elaborated and concretized through expert level examination to be completed by March 
1987, so that the reports there on could be considered at the next Meeting of the Council of 
Ministers : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) A South Asian Broadcasting Programme covering both radio and television 
should be launched.</p>
<p>(b) In keeping with the emphasis that the Heads of State or Government have laid 
on people-to-people contacts concrete steps should be taken to facilitate tourism in 
the region, including facilities for limited convertibility of national currencies for 
tourists from SAARC countries.</p>
<p>(c) The Heads of State or Government emphasized the importance they attach to 
students, scholars and researchers in their countries having ready access to reliable 
and up-to-date information on technical, scientific and developmental matters. This 
need could be best met by a SAARC Documentation Centre as the repository of 
such information.</p>
<p>(d) The Heads of State or Government considered that it was essential to promote 
increasing cross-fertilization of ideas through greater interaction among students, 
scholars and academics in the SAARC countries. They, therefore, directed that a 
concerted programme of exchange of scholars be formulated and action taken for 
an early institution of SAARC scholarships, SAARC Fellowships and SAARC 
Chairs. </p>
<p>(e) The Heads of State or Government stressed that the idealism of youth must be 
harnessed for regional co-operative programmes. Nothing would be more 
conducive to the resurgence of South Asian consciousness than the involvement of 
the youth of each country with the development programmes of the other. An 
Organized Volunteers Programme should be established in SAARC under which 
volunteers from one country would be able to work in other countries in the fields 
of agriculture and forestry extension work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5. The Heads of State or Government recalled that the planners of the SAARC countries had met 
in 1983. This had provided a useful opportunity for an exchange of ideas and experience in the 
formulation of development strategies and methods of plan implementation. They directed that 
another meeting of the planners of the SAARC member countries be convened at the earliest.</p>
<p>6. The Heads of State or Government took note of the recommendations of the Standing 
Committee on the financing of the institutional costs of regional institutions. They decided that for 
regional institutions where all the Member States are directly involved and benefit, the formula 
proposed by the Standing Committee should be used. However, in the case of projects which 
affect only a certain number of Member States, the formula should be used as an indicative one, 
which could be suitably modified on the basis of consultations among the Member States.</p>
<p>7. The Heads of State or Government also decided that the next Meeting of the Council of 
Ministers would be held in India in May 1987. They directed that this Meeting should undertake a 
detailed review of the proposals for the establishment of regional institutions. The member countries 
which have undertaken to prepare concept papers, pre-feasibility or feasibility studies on these 
proposals, should complete them well before the convening of the Meeting. The SAARC 
Secretariat should establish and submit to the Ministers, an order of priority among these proposals 
having regard to their costs, benefits, readiness for implementation, and other relevant factors.</p>
<p>8. The Heads of State or Government gratefully accepted the offer of the King of Nepal to host the 
Third SAARC Summit in 1987.</p>
<p>9. They also accepted with gratitude the offer of the President of Sri Lanka to host the Fourth 
SAARC Summit in Sri Lanka in 1988. </p>
