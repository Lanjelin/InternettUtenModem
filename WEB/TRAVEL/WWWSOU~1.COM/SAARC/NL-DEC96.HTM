COUNTRIES </strong></p>

<p>The Technical Committee on Women in Development, during its
eleventh meeting held in New Delhi on 4-5 December, 1996,
reviewed the implementation of the Plan of Action for the SAARC
Decade of the Girl Child (1991-2000 A.D.). </p>

<p>The mid-decade review prepared by the Committee based on
country reports on the implement-ation of their national plans of
action, showed that considerable progress was made in improving
the health status of the Girl-Child, through strengthening of
service delivery systems and child health programmes. This was
reflected in a number of indicators particularly the Infant
Mortality Rate which had declined substantially in many
countries. However, the study also showed that reduction of
maternal mortality and acute manifesta-tions of malnutrition had
remained modest. Recognising the gender discriminatory attitudes
in the family resulting in the socio-economic disadvant-ages for
the Girl-Child, the Committee underscored the necessity to
increase the regularity of awareness genera-tion campaigns to
project positive images of the Girl-child and to change the
negative socail attitudes and indidual mind-sets. The Review will
be presented to the Ninth SAARC Summit in the Maldives in May
1997. </p>

on Women. Member Countries presented their status reports on the
progress. In order to standardise the reporting procedure, the
Committee decided that the format prepared by Bangladesh for the
purpose of reporting on the implementation of the Plan of Action
would be used in future. </p>

<p>The Committee also considered the follow-up action by Member
States on the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing and in
this regard noted that the UNIFEM had convened a regional meeting
of South Asian countries to commemorate Beijing on 9th September
1996 in New Delhi. The meeting had provided a platform for the
Member States to have detailed discussions on issues of women's
empowerment in the region and sharing information on examples of
best practices. It also helped to identify possibilities as well
as major challenges and lacunae in the wake of the Beijing
Conference. </p>

<p>&quot;Women in the Informal Sector&quot; was the theme decided
for the Fourth Issue of the SAARC Solidarity Journal. The
Committee decided that Maldives would publish the journal to
coincide with the Ninth SAARC Summit to be held in the Maldives
in May 1997. </p>

<p>The Committee held detailed discussions on various aspects of
the Girl Child in Especially Difficult Circumstances (GCEDC) with
a view to assist the Council of Ministers undertake an urgent
appraisal of the situation of GCEDC and submit specific
recommendations to the Ninth SAARC Summit. Based on the findings
and the recommenda-tions of the GCEDC Workshop held in Colombo in
November 1995, the Committee prepared a set of recommendations on
the subject for consideration of the Standing Committee and the
Council of Ministers. </p>

<p>The Meeting reviewed the Calendar of Activities for 1996 and
took note of important recommendations that had emerged during
the Workshops on the Mid-decade Review and Women in Sustainable
Develop-ment held in New Delhi and Islamabad respectively during
