<p align=left><em><b>PREAMBLE:</b></em> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Whereas the right of the youth for a healthy and balanced development in an 
environment of equity, harmonious family relationship and social peace is 
recognised, <br>
-Whereas social and economic opportunities like education, marketable skill 
acquisition, gainful employment, sound health and healthy recreation for youth 
create an appropriate atmosphere for peace, growth of democratic ethos and 
achievement of social justice,<br>
-Whereas inadequate provision of such social and economic opportunities to the 
youth necessary for their participation in self and national-development process not 
only hurts their aspirations but also results in anomie, violence, gender insensitivity, 
drug abuse, health hazards and social degeneration, <br>
-Whereas the youth have to be developed both as a productive human resource 
and harbingers of ethical, spiritual and cultural values to facilitate their active 
involvement in the development process, <br>
-Whereas cooperation in the region is promoted by the cultural exchanges and 
friendly contacts between the youth of SAARC member nations, </p>
</blockquote>
