<p>SAARC Secretariat has been acquiring new databases on trade, investment and trade control 
measures. The information/data contained in these databases is being disseminated to interested 
individuals/institutions both within and outside the region for promotion of exports from the SAARC 
region. This is an important exercise being carried out by the Economic and Trade Division of the 
Secretariat when having operationalised SAPTA, member countries are moving ahead to realise the 
objective of a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) within the mandated time-frame. </p>
<p><em><strong>Currently, databases installed in the Secretariat are</strong></em></p>

<b>(ii)</b> CD-ROM PC-TAS developed by International Trade Centre (ITC), 
UNCTAD/WTO; <br>
<b>(iii)</b> DBI (Doing Business with India) developed by the Government of India; and <br>

<p><b>CD-ROM TRAINS </b>(Trade Analysis and Information System) for Windows. The latest version 
3.0 compatible with Windows 95, contains information, inter-alia, on trade and trade control 
measures of sixty-seven countries of the world. TRAINS for Windows now provides historical 
data for a five-year period on trade control measures (TCMs) and import statistics from 1990 to 
the most recent year available. It is designed to render compatible the presentation and analysis of 
six different databases by utilizing the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System 
comprising 5,018 basic items, as the common classification. The SAARC Countries covered in 
TRAINS are Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Under the MOU signed with 
UNCTAD, the obligations of the Secretariat, inter-alia, are to update the Database on Trade 
Control Measures in respect of SAARC Member States and disemination of information on 
TRAINS.</p>
<p><b>CD-ROM PC-TAS</b> contains statistical data (Import Tabulation System) with five-year time-series 
and trend analyses based on COMTRADE Database of United Nations Statistical Office. 
Coverage of data in this CD-ROM includes: import/export/re-export data for five years from 1989 
to 1993; data in respect of 46 reporting countries and territories, most members of OECD and 
NICs; all partner trading countries and territories; all SITC Rev.3 products at the 1-, 4- and 5-digit 
respective levels (3,869 items). It is a user-friendly data retrieval system by reporting country, 
partner trading countries, products, imports, exports, minimum value. Data can be transferred to 
other computer programs for file management and statistical and graphic analyses. Out of SAARC 
countries India and Pakistan have been covered as the Reporting Countries and all SAARC 
countries figure as partner countries. </p>
<p><b>&#147;DBI (Doing Business with India)&#148; </b>developed by the Government of India gives information,

System (HS System) has been received in the Secretariat with the cooperation of World Customs 
Organisation, Brussels. </p>
<p>Secretariat is in the process of obtaining similar relevant databases from other international 
organisations and Member Governments of SAARC in order to strengthen its capability to provide 
information from economic and trade databases. </p>
