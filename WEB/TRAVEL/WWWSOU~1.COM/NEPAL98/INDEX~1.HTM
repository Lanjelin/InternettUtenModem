<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong><a name="1">1. INTRODUCTION</a></strong></font></p>

<p>On April 12, 1996, His Majesty&#146;s Government declared the
year1998 as Visit Nepal &#146;98 in order to further enhance the
image of Nepal as a special destination for the visitors. To
accomplish the programme objectives, various organisations and
agencies both within and outside the tourism industry, have come
together hand in hand to formulate a strategy to make Visit Nepal
&#146;98, a success.</p>

<p>The programme strategy has been formed taking into
consideration that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>more airlines will operate more international flights by
        1998 and more airline seat capacity will be available</li>
    <li>there will be an atmosphere conducive for travelling
        internationally</li>
    <li>there will not be major socio-political instability in
        the region</li>
    <li>there will be political stability and current tourism
        policies will continue its direction</li>
    <li>programmes and activities so designed shall have an
        infrastructure to handle the expected number of visitor
        arrivals</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This campaign is a process and is to bring continued results
even beyond 1998. Thus, its momentum must begin now and continue
with the same vigour well beyond the year of the event.</p>

<p>To achieve the objectives of Visit Nepal &#146;98, various
programmes related to infrastructure development, product,
special events and activities development and publicity /
promotion have been identified.</p>

<p>The programme demands the undertaking and co-ordination of
activities by different organisations in the tourism sector, i.e.
government and private, other business sectors of the economy,
other sectors of government, municipalities and local
governments, NGOs, International organisations, self-help groups
and most importantly the involvement of the people of Nepal.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong><a name="2">2. OBJECTIVES AND
TARGETS</a></strong></font></p>

<p>It is of paramount importance that Visit Nepal &#146;98 is
regarded and positioned as an event of national significance,
supported by all. While the project will be co-ordinated and
implemented by the tourism sector, all sectors of society will be
mobilised actively during the implementation of the project.</p>

<p>The main objectives of Visit Nepal &#146;98 are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>increase the number of visitor arrivals from 363,000 in
        1995 to 500,000 in 1998</li>
    <li>lengthen the average duration of stay from 11.3 nights in
        1995 to 12 in 1998</li>
    <li>enhance the average spending per visitor from US$ 42 in
        1995 to US$ 50 in 1998 </li>
    <li>Further vitalize the image of Nepal as a unique visitor
        destination </li>
    <li>provide an impetus to improve and develop infrastructure,
        specially in relation to tourism-related areas</li>
    <li>address issues and problems of the aviation and tourism
        industries and act to improve its overall quality</li>
    <li>create intense local awareness of the benefits of tourism
        to the nation and to communities touched by it</li>
    <li>Encourage &amp; promote the domestic tourism </li>
    <li>to improve the quality of current tourism products,
        develop diverse eco-friendly and value based tourism
        products and effect regional development</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These objectives will be fulfilled mainly through concerted
effort of the private sector and the government sector tourism
organisations working in partnership, with the active support of
other sectors. His Majesty&#146;s Government will provide the
leadership and budgetary support to effect implementation. </p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong><a name="3">3. THEME AND
PROMOTIONAL SLOGAN</a></strong></font></p>

<p>Theme of Visit Nepal&#146;98 is :</p>

<p>&#147; A sustainable habitat through sustainable tourism&#148;</p>

<p>The theme encapsulates the very essence of a value based
tourism, whereby tourism&#146;s yield and contribution must
further strengthen the economy and socio-cultural fabric of
Nepal. Tourism development must be sustainable and work towards
bringing a better quality of life for the people. People of Nepal
must also know and feel that tourism brings tangible benefits
towards improving their lives.</p>

<p>The Promotional Slogan of Visit Nepal &#146;98 is :</p>

<p>&#147; A World of Its Own&#148;</p>

<p>The slogan is short and is meant to impress the potential
visitor that Nepal consists of many wonders. The Everest is only
one of them. A living heritage, exotic fauna and flora, a wide
range of events and festivals, a most friendly and hospitable
people, unique trekking routes, exciting adventure and a
diversity of ecotourism products consist a &#145;world&#146; of
its own here in Nepal. A world where there is a unity of theme
and a diversity of attractions.</p>

<p>The use of the slogan should be uniform and its printing
should be using the font style Avent Guard Light. Colour used for
the logo will be deep blue and deep red. Its position with the
logo and font size, should be in proportion as follows:</p>

<p>A World of Its Own</p>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>4.1<a name="a"> Infrastructure improvement
and development</a></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Infrastructure for tourism in Nepal is an integral
    component in Nepal&#146;s economy as well. Being a land
    locked country with limited land access via the neighbouring
    countries, the most important mode of access is by air.
    Currently Nepal&#146;s only international airport is the
    Tribhuwan International Airport located in Kathmandu. Due to
    its location and the constraints on take off, only aircraft
    of limited size and capacity can now land at this airport.
    This makes long haul flight operations to Kathmandu
    relatively more expensive. Currently, there are ten
    international airlines operating in Nepal. In addition there
    is a weekly charter operation from Germany. Apart from the
    capacity limitation due to the physical factor, there are
    also limitations in frequency of operations and points of
    origin. In order to facilitate the implementation of the
    Visit Nepal &#146;98 targets, HMG is implementing plans to
    liberalise access to other international carriers, encourage
    Nepali private operators to fly to international sectors and
    liberalize the existing charter policy. The issue of
    international air access remains an important factor in the
    equation to develop tourism.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>With a liberal policy towards operation of domestic
    services by private sector operators, there are now seven
    domestic airlines and six of them operate helicopter services
    as well. Three more airlines are to start operations in the
    near future. His Majesty's Government has recently granted
    permission to private airlines to operate in international
    sectors as well. Several of the leading operators run
    efficient services but are constrained by limited facilities
    at domestic airports. This has attracted the attention of the
    HMG and work is underway to improve runway and terminal
    facilities at several domestic airports.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Airport facilitation such as ground handling, immigration
    and custom services need to be improved and is identified as
    a priority area for action for Visit Nepal &#146;98. Training
    and motivation and even streamlining the services through
    making them closed services are among the recommendations. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The road network to and within Nepal require improvement.
    Proper land use along road reservations is necessary to
    ensure long term improvements. Visit Nepal &#146;98 is
    expected to be a strong catalytic agent in effecting both
    long term and short term solutions to seeking improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Infrastructure in the servicing of other tourism related
    activities such as internal transport, guiding, trekking,
    rafting, national parks and wild life reserve operations need
    focus for further improvement as well. The solutions mostly
    lie in training and motivation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>4.2 <a name="b">Product improvement and
development</a></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The tourism product of Nepal in the past has consisted of
    a combination of several unique elements. Heritage tours of
    the Kathmandu Valley, where seven world heritage sites are
    located in close proximity, mountain flights or tours to
    vantage points to view mount Everest and the Himalayan range,
    trekking tours of some of the world&#146;s most adventurous
    routes, river rafting on challenging waters, interaction with
    ethnic communities and wild life and nature tours have been
    the major features of the product. Although there is immense
    diversity of product elements and range, Nepal&#146;s tourism
    operators in the past ,have not made the most of it by
    offering similar product packages. There has been a comfort
    factor in everyone following a successful leader. The result
    was a lack of diversity and specialisation and a tendency to
    indulge in severe price competition to sell to the same
    market segments. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another constraints has been the seasonality factor.The
    months between May - September are regarded as monsoon months
    and considered as the off season. Although, there are
    intermittent rains during this period, it is nowhere close to
    monsoon conditions. Action needs be taken to correct this
    image.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Visit Nepal &#146;98 will attempt to diversify the
    products offered with a view to make the so called &#147;off
    season&#148; attractive to visitors too.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While, visitor numbers and demand for niche products have
    grown in the international market place (with strong growth
    from Asian markets), Nepal in the recent past, has not been
    able to respond adequately with strong and appropriate
    product packaging. Visit Nepal &#146;98 will give priority
    attention to enhancing the quality of the current product and
    in addition, introduce a range of diverse product segments to
    meet the demands of the new market niches. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The new products that are being developed for Visit Nepal
    1998 and onwards range from cultural attractions , adventure
    tours to special interest tours and cover additional tourism
    sites in the kingdom. Such cultural tours include the
    exploration of additional cultural sites in the Kathmandu
    valley and beyond, anthropological tours in the southern
    plains and northern settlements. Staging of various
    traditional , cultural events and activities and hosting of
    many regional and international conventions in 1998 is
    supposed to offer a distinct touch on the living cultural
    heritage of Nepal . New offers of alpine meadow tours, honey
    hunting, bird - watching, farm tourism, cave culture tourism,
    musk deer tour, circuit pilgrimage tours etc. will attract
    special interest tourists to Nepal in 1998 and in the future
    years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>4.3 <a name="c">Events and activities</a></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Peoples participation is a key factor for the success of
    Visit Nepal &#146;98. Between now and 1998, it is necessary
    to create an exciting festive atmosphere in Nepal. In Nepal,
    there are many significant cultural, religious, national and
    regional festivals which will be of interest for visitors. In
    addition, it is proposed to create special events for
    implementation during 1998.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The official inauguration of Visit Nepal &#146;98 will
    take place on 1st January 1998 in a grand and nation wide
    manner. The commencement of VNY'98 will also be marked by
    organising month - long numerous other festivities
    corresponding with the commencement of Nepalese New Year
    Calender in April 1998.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A detailed Visit Nepal &#146;98 Calendar Festivals, Events
    &amp; Activities will cover all activities taking place
    during 1998, containing the dates, the event&#146;s
    significance and elements of interest to visitors. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>4.4 <a name="d">Promotion and Publicity</a></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Re-positioning of Nepal&#146;s image as a visitor
    destination is an important element in the Visit
    Nepal&#146;98 promotional strategy. The current image of
    Nepal as an exotic travel destination is marred by the
    association of it being known as a cheap destination. With
    improvements to infrastructure, products and services, the
    re-positioned image will seek to establish that Nepal is a
    unique and exotic destination where value for money and
    quality products and services are offered.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since there are only limited financial resources for
    international promotion, more attention will be focused on
    publicly efforts. Mobilising friends of Nepal, implementing
    projects such as Bring a Friend Home in &#146;98 will
    supplement paid advertising and promotions at travel marts
    and trade shows. Support will also be sought from
    international and regional organisations such as PATA. WTO,
    IOTO, SAARC, ASEAN to promote VNY'98 through their networks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Promoting Visit Nepal &#146;98 among the population of
    Nepal is considered as a high priority activity. Local media
    and other community resources will be mobilised for this
    effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>4.5 <a name="e">Training and Motivation</a></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Achieving Visit Nepal &#146;98 objectives of delivering
    quality products and services, depend largely on training and
    motivation of those interacting with visitors. While
    motivating the whole population is most necessary, training
    immigration and customs officers, taxi drivers, and all
    others who come in contact with the visitor is vital and
    extensive programmes are planned to achieve this objective.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Training and motivation will not be limited to skills
    development, and will cover the need to develop a quality
    culture at all levels of tourism operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>4.6 Related Support Programmes
of other Government Agencies</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Visit Nepal &#146;98 is a national effort of all Nepal and
    is only co-ordinated by the tourism sector. It is therefore
    extremely important that the project has the support and
    assistance of the whole HMG machinery. All government
    agencies are expected to work towards the success of the
    project and the co-ordination of these support programmes
    will be handled by the Office of the Prime Minister. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4"><strong><a name="5">5. IMPLEMENTATION
ARRANGEMENTS</a></strong></font></p>
