<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>On April 12, 1996, His Majesty&#146;s Government declared the
year1998 as Visit Nepal &#146;98 in order to further enhance the
image of Nepal as a special destination for the visitors. To
accomplish the programme objectives, various organisations and
agencies both within and outside the tourism industry, have come
together hand in hand to formulate a strategy to make Visit Nepal
&#146;98, a success.</p>

<p>The programme strategy has been formed taking into
consideration that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>more airlines will operate more international flights by
        1998 and more airline seat capacity will be available</li>
    <li>there will be an atmosphere conducive for travelling
        internationally</li>
    <li>there will not be major socio-political instability in
        the region</li>
    <li>there will be political stability and current tourism
        policies will continue its direction</li>
    <li>programmes and activities so designed shall have an
        infrastructure to handle the expected number of visitor
        arrivals</li>
</ul>

<p>The programme demands the undertaking and co-ordination of
activities by different organisations in the tourism sector, i.e.
government and private, other business sectors of the economy,
other sectors of government, municipalities and local
governments, NGOs, International organisations, self-help groups
and most importantly the involvement of the people of Nepal.</p>

<p>Peoples participation is a key factor for the success of Visit
Nepal &#146;98. Between now and 1998, it is necessary to create
an exciting festive atmosphere in Nepal. In Nepal, there are many
significant cultural, religious, national and regional festivals
which will be of interest for visitors. In addition, it is
proposed to create special events for implementation during 1998.</p>
