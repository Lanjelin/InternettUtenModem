<p><strong>VNY'98 DOMESTIC TOURISM SYMPOSIUM IN GORKHA &amp;
BANDIPUR</strong></p>

<p>Symposium on Domestic Tourism Development was held in Gorkha
in Gorkha Bazar recently under the convenorship of Hon'ble Member
of Parliament Jeevan Prem. The programme was participated in by
local intellectuals, hoteliers, businessmen, NGOs, members of
local Chamber of Commerce and members of VNY'98 Gorkha
Co-ordination Committee.</p>

<p>Co-ordinator of VNY'98 Co-ordination Committee Karna Sakya
expressed the need of promoting domestic tourism in order to
boost up international tourism in various attractive tourist
destinations in Nepal. And he called upon the local committees to
undertake the responsibility to implement VNY'98 programmes such
as Gorkha Festival in Gorkha as it has been included in the
VNY'98 Calendar of Festivals, Events and Activities.</p>

<p>Director General of Tourism Department Prachanda Man Shrestha
highlighted on the developments of tourism during the last four
decades and its present structure. He suggested that it was now
high time to bring about a change in the concept of tourism and
he added that tourism products should be developed by targeting
the promotion of international, regional and domestic tourism
separately. Specifying the responsibilities of local community,
and government at the central level DG of DOT appealed the VNY'98
local co-ordination committee to design and implement the
infrastructure and human resources development programmes in
close co-ordination with District Development Committee. </p>

<p>The symposium finally agreed to draft a brochure on touristic
importance of 'Gorkha' and send the same to the VNY'98
Secretariat for publication. It was also agreed that local
co-ordination committee would take necessary steps to mobilise
the community to create wider awareness.</p>

<p>The participants of the symposium also recommended that about
twenty willing house-owners be identified by the local committee
and help them develop 'Family Stay' (Pahuna Ghar) by introducing
Paying Guest system.</p>

<p>This symposium was also participated in by NATA treasurer
Gopal Kakshapati, VNY Publicity member Mani Joshi, Pushpa
Thapaliya of Gorkha Tourism Development Committee &amp; Hariraj
Joshi of 'Image Nepal'.</p>

<p>Similarly, on 2nd of January another interaction programme on
Tourism was held in Bandipur participated in by local
intellectuals, tradesmen, teachers, members of District
Development Committee (DDC), Village Development Committees(VDC)
and also the members of local Tourism Development Co-ordination
Committee.</p>

<p>DG of Department of Tourism expressed that Bandipur has
immense potentiality to develop as a touristic destination and
since this area has an already built up necessary infrastructure,
it would be appropriate to involve and mobilise the local
community for the promotion of domestic tourism.</p>

<p>Karna Sakya, co-ordinator of VNY'98 Co-ordination Committee
suggested to explore and identify the local products &amp;
publicise them through print and other available national media.
Drafting of a conceptual masterplan for the tourism development
of the region was another point raised by Karna Sakya and he
agreed to depute an expert for the purpose on behalf of VNY'98
and Nepal Heritage Society.</p>

<p>All the participants agreed that the old market area of
Bandipur, locally produced dry vegetables, dry meat, orange
marmalade and the prehistoric caves could be some of the
interesting tourism products of Bandipur. The age old tradition
of &quot;Sheep pulling competition&quot; could also be developed
as special product to draw greater number of tourists to
Bandipur, the participants felt. The meeting further agreed to
organise an essay competition among the students of Bandipur VDC
to help raise the mass awareness on tourism.</p>

<p>Finally, the meeting came up with the view that the old market
area should be declared a monument zone and plying of motor
vehicles be restricted in the area. And, a separate road be
constructed for necessary linkage in co-ordination with DDC,VDC
and local tourism development committees. </p>
