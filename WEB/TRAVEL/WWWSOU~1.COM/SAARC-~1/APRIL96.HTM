<p>Tourism is the fastest growing industry in the world. It is estimated to be generating more than 
3 trillion dollars in gross output. In South Asian Region, despite the fact that every country of 
the region has been repeating the potential and need for attracting more tourists, this industry 
has not been able to generate the desired level of output. The region, home to one fifth of the 
world population attracts less than 1 percent of the world tourist arrivals. </p>
<p>The region with its ethnic and cultural diversity, eye catching scenic beauties has a tremendous 
potential to attract tourists in large numbers. One of the main economic woes of South Asian 
countries is the prevailing unemployment or underemployment of its huge population. Tourism / 
hospitality industry is capable of generating employment in huge numbers as automation in 
many areas of this industry is practically impossible. So this sector has the potential to generate 
employment in large numbers and effectively raise the living standard of the local people. </p>
<p>The potentials for the development of the tourism related business activities has been enhanced 
by the fact that Asia, especially its eastern part is witnessing a very fast economic growth at 
present. As a result of this more and more East Asians are embarking on foreign visits. The 
highest growth of tourism has been witnessed in this region. South Asia is not only in 
geographical proximity with this region but has histirical and cultural ties with East Asia. So its 
potential to attract East Asians in very large numbers is there, but we feel that this has not been 
realised to the extent possible. Besides, even in South Asia the trend to see new places is very 
much visible. More and more South Asians are going abroad. Until now, the preference of the 
visitors from the region seems to go outside the region. But we are of the view that with 
appropriate changes in rules governing the visit and infrastructure development more and more 
south Asians can be lured to visit the countries of the region. </p>
<p>Increased flow of tourists will lead to increase in the people to people contacts in the region. 
These contacts result not only to increased cooperation in the economic arena but increased 
mutual understanding and thus, reduction of tensions and solution of many of our problems. 
Having realised the importance and scope for promotion of tourism in the region, the SAARC 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) from the time of its inception has recognised 
tourism as one of its priority area of action. Tourism and other six areas were recognised by 
SCCI as areas for establishment of product councils and each member organisation of SCCI 
was to take the initiative to establish the product council assigned to it. In the first General 
Assembly meeting of SCCI held in Dhaka, Bangladesh FNCCI was assigned the task of 
establishing the Tourism Council. </p>
