<p align=center><font size=4><b>Report of</b> <b>the First Seminar of SAARC Tourism Council </b></font><b><br>
held in Lahore, Pakistan</b> (<b>4 August 1996)</b></p>
<p>The first seminar on current status and existing policies of tourism industry was held in Lahore, 
Pakistan on 4 August 1996. Delegates from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka 
participated in the meeting. The list of the delegates participating in the seminar is given in 
annex 1. </p>
<p>The seminar started with the inaugural programme. The inaugural session was presided over by 
Senator Ilyas Ahmad Bilour, President, FPCCI. Mr Riaz H Quraishi, Chairman, Pakistan 
Tourism Development Corporation was the chief guest of the programme. Mr Hasan Raja 
Pasha, Additional Secretary and In-charge, Youth and Tourism Division, Government of 
Pakistan was scheduled to be present in inaugural session. But due to unavoidable 
circumstance he could not be present during the morning. He joined the seminar later on the 
day. Mr Salman Javed, General Manager, Tour Promotion and Project, PIA, conducted the 
sessions. The inaugural session was started by recitation of the holy quoran. After this, Senator 
Ilyas Bilour delivered the welcome / inaugural speech. In his welcome speech, Senator Bilour 
expressed happiness for the opportunity to inaugurate the seminar. He hoped that the event will 
be useful for exchange of ideas, and opinions among the participants from SAARC countries 
and come up with proposal for exploiting to the maximum the existing potentials of the industry 
in the region. He was of the view that SAARC had a variety of tourist attractions and could 
become a very attractive place for international tourists. He called on the council to promote 
SAARC region as a tourist destination and prepare proposals for joint participation in 
international fairs. He also called on the council to study the existing policies and try to suggest 
uniformity in them. He also called on the airlines of SAARC countries to cooperate and evolve 
a joint strategy for optimising the use of aircrafts of all the member countries. Towards the end 
of his speech he thanked Mr Seikh Jamil Mahboob Magoon, Vice President, SCCI for 
providing the opportunity to address the meeting. He was also thankful to the guests from 
Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka and wished them a comfortable stay. </p>
<p>After Senator Bilour, Mr Padma Jyoti, Vice President, SCCI and Chairman, SCCI Tourism 
Council Governing Board was invited to speak. Mr Jyoti highlighted on the ongoing and 
planned activities of the Tourism Council. He expressed the view that inspite of having one-fifth 
share of the humanity and having all the attributes for becoming a very popular tourist 
destination, SAARC region's performance in this sector was rather poor. He cited the figures 
of tourist arrivals of each country of SAARC and informed the house that the share of all 
SAARC countries was less than 1 percent of the world in both tourist arrivals and tourism 
receipts. He expressed the hope that the initiative shown by the SAARC Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry in the field of tourism will help to raise the level of co-operation 
among the private sector involved in this field and boost the tourist arrivals and tourism receipts 
of SAARC countries. He also hoped that the council will be able to complement the activities 
of government. He gave brief account of the history of formation of SCCI Tourism Council 
and went on the highlight on the programmes planned in the near future. He highlighted the fact 
that tourism was one of the product areas which were being focused by the SCCI for their 
development. According to him the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry was entrusted to co-ordinate efforts for formation and activation of the Tourism 
Council. He told the gathering that the next seminar of the SCCI Tourism Council was being 
held in Colombo, Sri Lanka where the discussion would be on common problems and the 
council will try to thrash out a common policy and common strategy for progress. The next 
programme was being planned in Delhi where real business would be discussed. He thanked 
FNSt for providing financial support to take ahead the activities of the Tourism Council. He 
also thanked Mr Magoon and other Pakistani hosts for their warm hospitality and the 
co-operation in organising the seminar. </p>
<p>Mr Ashok K Atri, Director, SAARC Secretariat also spoke in the inaugural session. Mr Atri, 
thanked the SAARC chamber and its Tourism Council for inviting him to attend and present 
his views. He gave account of the activities of the SAARC Technical Committee on Tourism. 
He informed the gathering that the Technical Committee has decided to produce a SAARC 
travel guide and produce a promotional film. He was of the view that without significant 
involvement of the private sector, it would not be possible to make meaningful progress in the 
tourism sector. Towards the end of the speech, he conveyed the best wishes of H E Mr 
Naeem U Hasan, SAARC Secretary General for the success of the seminar. </p>
<p>Mr Riaz H Quraishi, Chief Guest of the Ceremony and Chairman, Pakistan Tourism 
Development Corporation delivered the inaugural address. In his address he narrated the role 
and mandate given to the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC). He expressed 
the view the PTDC was established to supplement the activities of private sector in the field of 
tourism. Then he went on to highlight the main features of the National Tourism Policy of 1990. 
The benefits and incentives which were available to other industries were accorded to this 
sector also by the Tourism Policy of 1990. The policy, also provided other incentives and 
framework for development of tourism in Pakistan. Mr Quraishi ended his speech by thanking 
the chair. The inaugural session ended. </p>
