<p>- International tourist arrivals during 1995 were 567.4 million (in world-wise) </p>
<p>- International tourism receipts during 1995 were US $ 372.6 billion. </p>
<p>- Tourism receipts have grown at a faster rate (12.7%) than commodity exports (11.5%) since 
1960. </p>
<p>- International travel has grown at a compound rate of 6.2% between 1961 to 1995. In 
today's senario, tourism accounts for more than 30% of international trade in services, about 
12% of the world GDP and over 8% of the world's export </p>
<p>- International tourist traffic is expected to grow at a compound rate of growth of about 3.1% 
from 1995 to 2000 and reach 661 million tourist arrivals by 2000 A.D. </p>

<p><b>3 Comparative study </b></p>
<p>- Arrivals in India are 0.39% of world arrivals. </p>
<p>- Receipts are 0.51% of world receipts. </p>
<p>- Small countries like Singapore and Thailand receive over 5 million tourists. </p>
<p>- The average duration of stay of tourists in India is, however, one of the highest. It is about 30 
days as compared to 3 days in Singapore and 7 days in Thailand. Thus the estimated tourist 
nights were about 50 million in India as compared to 16 million in *Singapore* and 36 million 
in *Thailand* during 1991. </p>
<p>- But the average duration of stay of tourist is high (average 30 days) in India. 'Tourists stays', 
therefore are higher than countries like Singapore, Thailand though 'arrivals' are lower. </p>
<p><b>4 Resources </b></p>
<p>- India has all the tourist attractions sought by the tourists anywhere in the world including 
natural attractions, like land scapes, scenic beauty, mountains, wild life, beaches, rivers and 
glaciers and manmade attractions, like monuments, forts, palaces, havelis etc. as well as 
pilgrims. </p>
<p><b>5 TOURISM PRODUCT</b> </p>
<p>Tourism comprises the activities of persons travelling to and staying in places outside their usual 
environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes. 
These persons invariably seek a pleasant and delectable experienceon their trips. The most 
desired tourism product thus consists of : </p>
<p>- an environment of peace and stability. </p>
<p>- an assurance of safety and security. </p>
<p>- an affable host society. </p>
<p>- an industry and a Government that provide the requisite services with a smile. </p>
<p>- absence of extortions and hostility. </p>
<p>- accessible tourist attractions and </p>
<p>- an integrated system of physical infrastructure that does not fail these include : </p>
<p>- international air seat capacity </p>
<p>- internal transport system </p>
<p>- hotels and restaurants and bars* </p>
<p>- entertainment and recreational avenues </p>
<p>- shopping and communication facilities </p>
<p>- well preserved monuments with tourist amenities </p>
<p>- basic amenities like drinking water, toilets, snack bars etc at the tourist sites. </p>
<p>Just like raw materials get converted into finished products by moving through various 
machines in a processing system, the different components of tourism supply should be so 
organised that the expectations of the tourists while planning the trip get converted into full 
satisfaction and pleasant memories on his return. It means there should be perfect 
co-ordination and linkages in the availability and performance of all components of tourism 
infrastructure. Tourism is being seen as a priority sector and 124 proposals involving foreign 
investment of rs. 1892.63 crores were approved till the end of September 1995. </p>
<p><b>6 MANPOWER RESOURCES</b> </p>
<p>Tourism industry consists of several activities starting from air transportation to guide services. 
Each of these segments need trained manpower to ensure their availability in good measure 
and quality. The airlines need highly trained pilots, engineers, air hostesses and a host of other 
technicians. The immigration officers at the airports need to be smart, personable and capable 
of handling both security and public relation functions efficiently. </p>
<p>The taxi drivers, coach operators and other grass root level workers need to be trained to 
behave well with the tourists. Hotels, restaurants, travel agents, tour operators and other 
providers of tourist services need professionally trained man power at all levels. Training is also 
to be imparted to guides and watch and ward staff of monuments, wild life sanctuaries etc. to 
make them more responsive to the tourists. Development of manpower resources is thus a 
major activity in the promotion of tourism. </p>
<p>In order to harness the resources and provide a central thrust, the ministry of Tourism 
established to National Council for Hotel Management and catering technology in 1984 with 
the objective of expanding and modernising the training capabulities of Hotel and catering 
education institutes. The ministry also established the Indian Institute of Tourism &amp; Trvel 
management(IITM) in 1983 to develop and promote education training and research in travel 
and tourism and to provide trained manpower to that sector. </p>
<p><b>7 OFFERS</b> </p>
<p><b><i>7.1 AT PRESENT</i></b> </p>
<p>- Except for a few approved hotels, the tourism infrastructure presently available is very weak. 
It is particularly so in the case of *transport*, entertainment and shopping facilities. Even the 
available *infrastructure*usually fail to function during the hours of need. </p>
<p>- Airline services are often curtailed during peak season </p>
<p>- Rail links are normally over-crowded and poor in quality. </p>
<p>- Bad roads and inferior transport vehicles. </p>
<p>- Even basic amenities like toilets and drinking water are not available at sites of most of </p>
<p>monuments. </p>
<p>- Standard shopping places are almost non-existent. There are several complaints of cheating 
by unethical shop-keepers and traders. </p>
<p>- Airports, railway stations and tourist sites are infested by touts and anti-social elements. </p>
<p>- Teasing and cheating of tourists by taxi drivers, guides and others are very common at most 
places. </p>
<p><b><i>7.2 IN THE PAST</i></b> </p>
<p>The developmental activities have been taken-up through State/UT Governments in view of the 
fact that the infrastructural systems like land, roads, water and electricity supplies etc are 
mostly under their control. The Central Government has been acting almost as a funding 
agency without exercising much of planning ofperformance checks. As a result the tendency 
has been to take up a large number of small projects of peripheral nature in as many centres as 
possible. Thus, there has been very little impact on the development of tourism infrastructure in 
any specific destination. No attempts were made earlier to integrate the activities in various 
segments particularly transport systems and site facilities leading to infrastructural inbalances. A 
policy of 'Choose, Plan and Execute' is therefore necessary to develop tourism. </p>
<p><b>7.3 NEEDED</b> </p>
<p>The 'Drawing Room' concept - selected sectors/sites, invested with saturation level facilities. 
(As is being planned in 'Industrial Model Towns'/ 'Industrial Parks'/ 'Technology parks') </p>
<p>The National Action plan for Tourism was presented in parliament in May 1992, which 
specifies various actions to be undertaken for a directed development of tourisms in the 
country. </p>
<p><b><i>7.4 A CLOSER LOOK</i></b> </p>
<p>According to a survey conducted during 1988-89, there were 38places in the country, each of 
which was visited by at least onepercent of the foreign tourists arrived during that year. The 
infrastructural facilities available in these centres however do not measure upto the level of 
tourist traffic. The data clearly reveal that :- </p>
<p>- There has not been any co-ordinated approach for tourism development so far. </p>
<p>- Environmental planning and area development has never been attempted in any of the tourist 
centres. </p>
<p>- The transport infrastructure is not planned according to tourist traffic. </p>
<p><b>8 INVESTMENT IN TOURISM</b> </p>
<p>- Adequate investment is necessary to take advantage of immense tourism potential that exist in 
the country. </p>
<p>- Investment in tourism creates more jobs than in several other sectors. The labour/capital ratio 
is more favourable in the case of tourism than many other industries. The comparative ratios of 
some of the economic sectors per million rupee of investment at 1985-86 prices are as given 
below :- </p>
<p>0<b><i>Sector Labour/Capital ratio</i></b> </p>
<p>Agriculture 44.7 <br>
Manufacturing 12.6 <br>
Mining and Quarrying 2.6 <br>
Railways 0.9 <br>
Other transport 13.8 <br>
Hotel and restaurants 89.0 </p>
<p>- Investment in tourism ensures the overall development of the area and better facilities to local 
population and as such the investment is never exclusively meant for tourists. </p>
<p>For various scehdules to be implemented by the Directorate General of Toursim an allocation 
of Rs. 272 crores was approved by the planning commission for the Eighth Five Year Plan 
(1992-97). For the year 1994-95, Rs. 92.81 crores mere approved by the Planning 
Commission. </p>
<p><b>9 HOW TO PROCEED</b> </p>
<p>- Tourism development is a composite subject and it does not necessarily mean the 
development of only the tourism facilities like hotels, restaurants, recreational activities etc. </p>
<p>- The creation of tourism infrastructure will be meaningful only if the area has the minimum 
basic amenities and infrastructure like roads, water, electricity, sewerage and 
tele-communication facilities. Thus, there must be a total area development plan before 
attempting to promote tourism. The different components of the area development plan will fall 
within the purview of different agencies. All there agencies have to work together and earmark 
adequate funds for such development. The first step, therefore, will be to identify the specific 
tourism zones and their development needs in the form of an area development plan. </p>
<p>- Formulate such area development plans as Tourism-Sub plans and earmark funds for the 
execution of various components of the sub-plans by the respective departments within a 
specified time period. </p>
<p>- The necessary plan allocation should be made available both by the Planning Commission 
and State Planning Departments for the Sub-Plan. </p>
<p>- The Central Department of Tourism should play a more positive role in the formulation and 
monitoring of such sub-plans. A monitoring mechanism must be established in the *Department 
of Tourism in this regard. </p>
<p>- The air, rail and road links to the sub-plan areas should be improved by the concerned 
Central/State Departments according to the integrated area plan. </p>
<p>- Specific steps should be taken to augment international air seat capacity to India. </p>
<p>- Priority must be given for the development of manpower for tourism activities. </p>
<p>- The development of Tourism should be recognised as a joint responsibility of all the 
Ministries and Departments in the Central Government and the States. </p>
<p><b>10 TARGET</b> </p>
<p>Given the dimensions and tourist attractions that exist in the country, a target of 5 million 
tourists by 1996-97 is achievable if the necessary infrastructural facilities are provided. </p>
<p><b>The benefits that would accrue on realisation of the target in comparison to 1992-93 
are as indicated below :</b> </p>
<p><b><i>1992-93 1996-97</i></b> </p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Earnings (Rs. Crores) 3,990 14,000 (at 1993-94 prices) <br>
Value Added (Rs. Crores) 1,479 5,415 (at 1993-94 prices) <br>
Employment (Million Persons) 1.48 5.18 <br>
Tax revenue (Rs. Crores) 503 1,764 </p>
<p>Note : The estimates are worked out on the basis of value added, labour-output and indirect 
tax ratios. </p>
<p>Target - 5 million tourist arrivals (by 1996-97) <br>
Base - 1.87 million (1992) <br>
Growth - 20% </p>
<p>(The number of 'tourist-days' also needs to be set.) Projections based in 5 million tourist 
arrivals </p>
<p><b>11 STRATEGY</b> </p>
<p>The strategy for attaining 5 million tourist arrivals by 1996-97 include : </p>
<p>- Increasing the international air seat capacity to India. </p>
<p>- Increasing the passenger handling capacity of existing *international airports* and opening of 
new international airports at *Bangalore, Hyderabad and Goa*. </p>
<p>- Upgradation of facilities at national airports to allow the landing of wide bodied aircrafts for 
taking the tourists closer to their place of interest through charters. </p>
<p>- Increasing the domestic air seat capacity. </p>
<p>- Improvement of rail and road transport facilities in those segments connecting major tourist 
centres and introduction of new tourist trains </p>
<p>- Improvement of tourist facilities at the four metro cities to international standards according to 
integrated tourism sub-plans. The components of the sub-plan will include upgradation of 
airport facilities and transport infrastructure particularly cars and coaches, refurbishing of 
monuments and beautification of areas around them with provision for basic amenities, 
air-conditioned shopping complexes, parks and pedestrian paths, activity centres and 
information counters, proper signages etc. </p>
<p>- Undertake environmental planning and development of 40 popular tourist centres according 
to tourism sub-plans. These centres should have adequate basic amenities and tourism 
infrastructure. </p>
<p>- Develop 27 new tourist centres including 5 major pilgrim centres which are having high 
potential for meeting the demand for diverse tourism products, like, beach resorts, wild life 
monuments, pilgrim centres etc. While 70% of the tourists visiting India would continue to be 
attracted by cultural and pilgrim motivations, about 20% have to be serviced by beaches and 
the rest by wild life sanctuaries and others. </p>
<p>- Refurbishing of important monuments and provision of basic amenities around them. </p>
<p>- Provision of tourist facilities around important wild life sanctuaries and national parks in 
consonance with the environmental guidelines and carrying capacity. </p>
<p>- Provision of basic amenities, and essential tourism facilities in the pilgrim centres. </p>
<p>- Provision of adequate tourism infrastructure like hotels, restaurants, shopping complexes, 
entertainment and information centres etc. in all the tourist centres taken-up for product 
development. </p>
<p>- Development of adequate man power resources in all sectors connected with tourism. </p>
<p>- Improvement of tourist facilitation services and removal of visa and entry restrictions. </p>
<p>- Protection of tourists from touts, unethical taxi drivers and traders and other anti social 
elements in all the tourist centres through greater vigil by law enforcing agencies and effective 
use of the provisions of *Consumer Protection Acts and Rules*. </p>
<p>- Provision of a package of incentives and facilities for attracting private investment to develop 
tourism infrastructure. </p>
<p>- Implementing aggressive and effective marketing and promotional strategies in the major 
tourist generating countries. </p>

<p><b>14 INDIAN TOURISM</b> </p>
<p>Tourism is the fastest growing industry in the world. However, India's share is stagnating at a 
small 0.3 per cent with almost seven major faiths and a population exceeding 800 million, India 
celebrates one festival or another every day of the year. But we have hardly been able to sell 
these festivals. </p>
<p>The only festivals which have attracted tourists are the Pushkar festival in Rajasthan, Hemis in 
Leh and the Khajuraho dance festival. But the Boat race on Onam and elephant race also has 
potential if promoted properly. Holi is not attractive due to health hazards associated with it. If 
it can be developed on proper lines, it can be a big draw. The Brazilian carnivals are sold out 
one year in advance, but now, even the Goa Carnivals are becoming popular. Durga Puja, 
Ganesh Utsav, Navratri, Holi, Diwali, all have great </p>
<p>potential. </p>
<p>The cultural diversity of India has resulted in a wide variety of handicrafts, which creates lot of 
interest among p73 foreign tourists. India has traditionally been a shoppers' paradise. 
Foreigners make a bee line for brassware, silk, carpet and jewellery etc. Most of the people 
come to India with two suitcases one of which is empty. But the absence of any kind of 
shopping system is a big drawback, as tourist often feel cheated. </p>
<p>By and large, Indians are not so mobile as people in the west, as most of them are 
economically poor. So they visit pilgrimage places or native and other places whenever they 
find time or are obliged by necessary socio-religious reasons. </p>
<p>However, of late, among the elite and the burgeoning upper middle class, people do find time 
to visit places of tourist interest either on their own or on leave travel allowance they get and 
enjoy vacations. Also, when people are on social or business tour, they do some sight-seeing 
around; they hardly go on tours- planned tours as such. But now with changing times, this trend 
towards tourism is also gradually picking up as can be seen from the increasing number of 
tour-operators and tourist agents in the country. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, pilgrim flows account for a very large chunk of domestic tourism. Most of the 
traditional pilgrims are from the lower middle and poor classes, who are often unmindful of 
hard-ships, in the journey. It does not mean that they do not like affordable facilities and 
amenities if provided. </p>
<p>Some of the well-known pilgrim places like *Tirupati, Shirdi*, *Veerpur*, etc do provide 
reasonable facilities for transport, lodging and boarding at affordable rates. But most of the 
traditional rest resorts like dharmashalas are often in bad conditions with poor sanitary 
amenities owing to financial constraints and management apathy. Under the circumstances, 
basic amenities like lighting, fans, drinking water and cleanliness provided at lodging and 
boarding places, will be most welcome, even if charged. </p>
<p>The need for promoting domestic tourism by offering for example Alibag in place of Agra with 
low budget decent boarding and lodging facilities provided. While reliable data are not 
available, the volume of domestic touists in the country was officially placed at around 63 
million in 1990, this is much larger than the flow from abroad. The government has made 
significant contribution in the service sector which is best left to private initiative and investment 
both domestic and foreign, for accelerated growtll within the broad guidelines and incentives 
and fiscal concessions. In order to stimulate growth of accommodation at tourist places, the 
government has given a large number of concessions for hotels to come up in rural areas, hill 
station pilgrim centres and special tourism destinations. There are a larger number of places 
even in rural areas which can be collveniently converted into heritage hotels. A paying guest 
accommodation scheme can be introduced to provide affordable and hygienic accommodation 
both for domestic and foreign tourists. </p>
<p>With a view to attracting tourists and generating employment, craft villages like Surajkund 
Mela, Shilpagram, Udaipur and Bhujudi in Kachahah can be set up in different parts of the 
country which will also boost the traditional handicrafts of the regions. </p>
<p><b>15 PROBLEM</b> </p>
<p>India's 6000 kms long coastline traces a shining garland of sand, rocks and pebbles around her 
outline and is dotted with several pristine beaches and world class beach resorts. Beaches are 
good, considering the size of the water, but there is a marked lack of infrastructure. If the same 
can be established, these can become the best beaches in the world. </p>
<p><b><i>15.1 BIHAR</i></b> </p>
<p>India, being the land of Buddha, holds special attraction for tourists from *Japan, Korea, 
Taiwan* and other countries which have a large Buddhists following *Bodh Gaya, Nalanda, 
Rajgir, Sarnath and Sanchi* are revered by the followers of Buddha. The Japanese have 
donated generously to develop these places but even then the tourist inflow remains miniscule. 
They have been coming but not in numbers that were expected. Except for 2013 places, the 
accommodation is so bad that can't even stay there. Food is poor. In many in Bihar, even large 
distances have to be covered by road, which are so terrible that by the time half of the distance 
is travelled, air conditioner stops functioning. There have been security problems also. It is a 
must to improve the infrastructure to make this circuit grow in a big way. </p>
<p>15.2 GOA </p>
<p>Goa has gained tremendous popularity since the past 2-3 years but it is getting saturated now. 
But many other beaches can also be promoted in the same way. Kovalam is the best beach in 
India, and can be developed on the same line as that of Goa. It is lack of infrastructure, which 
is the main problem. There are excellent beaches in Orissa, but the airport facilities are to be 
upgraded, where at present only Boeing 737 can land. </p>
<p>15.3 ANDAMAN NICOBAR </p>
<p>For Andaman there are only three flights from Calcutta and four from Madras per week, which 
are full of local passengers. This island should be opened up for direct flights from places like 
Thailand, Lakshdeep has an airport at Agalti, but it takes only Vayudoot flights. Maldives, 
which is almost same as that of Lakshdeep receives so many direct charter flights from Europe. 
To overcome this the Department of Tourism has approved two luxurycruiser vessels for 
Andaman and Nicobar Islands. </p>
<p>15.4 KASHMIR </p>
<p>Stretching along the northern borders of India is the world's highest mountain chain - The 
Himalayas. India is a true mountaineering country with snow covered peaks, undulating 
forested foothills, mountain streams and an infinite variety of flora and fauna. Unfortunately, 
Kashmir was the only destination, which was promoted among hill stations, where terrorism 
has now taken over the natural beauty. </p>
<p>15.5 PROBLEM OF INFRASTRUCTURE </p>
<p>The problem is the same lack of infrastructure. There are hardly an hotels in Kulu. Compare it 
with Kathmandu, which has so many hotels, good surface transport and numerous flights. One 
of the most beautiful states in India, Sikkim, still doesn't have an airport. North-east is the most 
beautiful, but one should not be tempted to market if without proper infrastructure. It is clear 
that with the development of infrastructure tourism will have all the making of a booming 
industry. The government expects the foreign exchange earnings to improve Rs. 1000 crore by 
the end of the century. It expects the Indian share of tourism market to improve to 1 per cent 
from 0.3 per cent. </p>
<p>15.6 DESERTS </p>
<p>Even our deserts can prove to be a great attraction. Jaisalmer has already been established as 
a popular tourist destination. Muscat, Dubai and Sharjah has developed the desert tourism, 
should follow them to develop this kind of tourism. </p>
<p>India's vast geographical diversity provides an immense variety of outdoor thrills. Trekking 
altitudes range from 9,000 ft. to 14,500 ft. above sea level and in Ladakh goes upto as high as 
18,000 ft. above sea level. Trekking is very popular. Part of the trekking traffic may be 
diverted to India, if we make efforts for the same. Water skiing on Srinagar, Dal and Nagin 
lakes is popular. Trout fishing is a delight in Kashmir, Himachal and Uttar Pradesh. India 
provides the cheapest ski holiday anywhere in the world. Skiing usually starts by the end of 
December and lasts till the end of March. There are gentle ski runs for beginners as well as 
exhilarating steep runs for advanced skiiers. </p>
<p>15.7 SPORTS </p>
<p>The adventure sports is the segment, where experts visua lise a possibility of India emerging on 
the top, but here too infrastructure is needed. You can't take adventure trips without expert 
and proper equipments as there is a risk to life. Still the positive fact is that equipments are not 
exhorbitantly costly and these can always be imported. </p>
<p>The country has a wide variety of wildlife. It's geo-graphic climatic and vegetational diversity 
makes it the home of over 1200 types of birds ancl 350 animals spices, many of which are 
unique to the subcontinent. India has 53 national parks and 247 sanctuaries spread over 
90,000 sq.Km. Wildlife capable of attracting tourists independently or is it only a 
supplementary product offered in the other packages. Probably we have a much inferior 
product to offer in comparison to *Kenya and Tanzania*. It is not capable of being promoted 
as a main product. Now due to climatic changes, Bharatpur, is not attracting many birds from 
Siberia, which it used to attract many years ago. Also the lions found in our parks are not as 
attractive as the African Lion. In Tanzania, you may find Lions in groups of twenty, but in India 
two lions. </p>
