Kingdom Nepal is an agricultural land with its predominant semi-feudal
system for the development of national economy. So the root economy
of the country is definitely agriculture. In 1995 about 80 percentage
of the total population was engaged in agriculture and it produce
46 percentage of the GDP. The manufacturing and construction industries
were poorly developed, which gave only about 8.4 percentage in
the GDP of the country. Nepal has very big reserve of hydro resources
in the world - that is above 80,000 MWT, but it has not been used.
It had succeeded to harness only 238.3 MWT which is 0.287 percentage
of the total hydro potential. The transport is very insufficient.
The country has 8,025 km of motor way in which 3,082 km are of
black-topped, the reminds are of gravelled and weathered roads.
There are only 52 km of rail-way. On the export list of Nepal,
the major place is occupied by the lively production, handicraft
(like artistic goods, ethereal oils, herbs etc.); and on the import
list is mainly manufactured goods. The trade balance of Nepal
is characterised with a chronic deficit. The passive balance is
obviously growth from 2.8 billion NRs. in 1980 to 19.0 billion
in 1991. As a whole the level of economic reforms remains very
low. It is caused by the fragmentariness of national economy,
presence of semi-feudal survival or anachronism, the insufficient
of financial resources and skilled workers (manpower) and the
improper management toward the skilled workers.
<P>
Kingdom Nepal is an ancient country. It has numerous interesting
God gifted natural resources and rich cultural and historical
inheritance which are potentially important circumstance for the
development of mobile international tourism. The beginning of
mass tourist travel to Nepal may accept 1962, when 6.2 thousand
tourists are sojourn in the country. Their number increased to
345 thousand (approximately) in 1995 and economically the percentage
share of inbond tourism in GDP was the achievement of 3.8 percentage
for the year 1992. 
<P>
Nepal proves to be an attractive center for the development of
active tourism with its diverse nature, rich culture, hospitable
people, interesting national cuisine and irreproachable services
in the hotels. In 1975 the country received 92440 foreign tourist,
in 1992 it increased to 334353 tourists, (but being the cause
of political recession and environment pollution in 1993 and India's
Plague disease in 1994 it decreased to 293567 and 326531 tourists
respectively. But in 1995 it increased to 354 thousand, in which
322749 are by air only. Among them 63.51 percents are foreigner
and 36.49 percents are Indians.
<P>
The total volume of foreign exchange earnings from tourism in
the last few years matured from 51.632 million US Dollars in 1980
to 63.701 million US Dollars in 1990 and 88.195 million US Dollars
in 1994. The all-in-all volume of foreign exchange earning from
tourism for the period of 1980-1994 is increased by 1.71 times
i.e. a sheer increment by 1.42% per annum whereas the total volume
of tourist flow to Nepal is increase by 2.07 times i.e. a mean
increase by 6.2% per annum.
<P>
Besides that the average income per tourist decreased from 422.5
US Dollars in 1980 to 339.74 US Dollars in 1994 and the average
income per visitor per day got diminished from 38 US Dollars in
1980 to 33.97 US Dollars in 1994. It comes to prove us that the
tourism in Nepal is eventually developed by extensive or Budget
tourism. On another side the percentage share of the income of
convertible foreign exchange from tourist's expenditure decrease
from 23.26% in 1980 to 12.36% in 1994 which is not favourable
for the entire economic development of Nepal. It shows that the
government revenue from Tourism got decreased by 9.77 point during
the period of 1980-1994. The percentage share of foreign exchange
income in relation to the total &quot;invisible income&quot; is
calculated as 42.67% in 1994 which made tourism the second big
resources of &quot;invisible income&quot; for the country.
