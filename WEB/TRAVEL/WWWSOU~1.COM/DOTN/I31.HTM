Nepal has a population of over eighteen million, made up of an
assortment of race and tribes living in different regions, wearing
different costumes and speaking different languages and dialects.
They live under quite diverse environmental conditions, from the
low plains at the border of India, northward through the middle
hills and valleys and up to the flanks of the great Himalayan
range where there are settlements at altitudes of up to 4,800
meters.
<P>
The Himalayan settlements of Tibetan speaking peoples are found
perched precariously on mountain ledges and slopes. Life here
is a delicate balance of hard work and social merrymaking, tempered
by a culture steeped in ancient religious traditions. The best
known of the high mountain peoples are the Sherpas who inhabit
the eastern mountains of Nepal.
<P>
The midlands are inhabited by various Tibeto-Burman and Indo-Aryan
peoples, such as Brahman, Chhetri and Newar.
<P>
The Rai, Limbu, Tamang, Magar, Sunwar, Jirel, Gurung, Thakali
and Chepang are other Tibeto-Burman speaking Mongoloid peoples
living in the middle hills. They each have their own distinct
social and cultural pattern.
<P>
The Dun valleys and the Terai are inhabited by the Brahman, Rajput,
Tharu, Dunuwar, Majhi, Darai, Rajbansi, Satar, Dhimal and Dhangar.
<P>
Though Nepal is a veritable mosaic of dozens of ethnic groups,
they are bound together by the ideas of peace, democracy and nationalism.
