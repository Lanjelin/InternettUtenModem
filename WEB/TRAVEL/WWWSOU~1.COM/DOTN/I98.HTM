<P>
All the travel agencies of Kathmandu have licensed English speaking
guides, however, many agencies have also guides who can speak
other international languages for the convenience of tourists.
As unlicensed guides are not allowed to serve clients it is advisable
to confirm that your guide has valid licence.
<P>
There are numerous registered travel agencies in Nepal which are
specialized in handling the sightseeing programs for the tourists.
To have a quality service it is recommended to arranged the sightseeing
programs only through the government registered travel agencies.
