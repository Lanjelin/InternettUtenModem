Nepalese religious architecture is another are medium that is
an important part of the country's cultural heritage. There are
three broad styles - the pagoda style, the stupa style and the
shikhara style.

<B>The Pagoda Style</B>

This style refers to multi-roofed structures with wide eaves supported
by carved wooden struts. Windows, either latticed or grilled,
are usually projecting, while the roof is generally topped of
by triangular spires enclosing an inverted bell of stucco or burnished
gold. The pagoda style shows the architectural genius of Nepal.

<P>
A young architect-sculptor-painter named Balbahu, (or Arniko as
the Chinese call him), led a delegation  of 80 Nepalese artists
to Tibet during the  late thirteenth century at the invitation
of the Chinese Emperor Kublai Khan. The pagoda style was soon
adopted in China and from there spread to  other Asian countries.
<P>
The best example of the pagoda style in the Kathmandu Valley is
Kasthamandap, a wooden pagoda built in the Malla period, and from
which the name of the capital city is said to be derived. The
nine-storey Basantpur Palace built by king Prithvi Narayan Shah
is another outstanding pagoda specimen. The Pashupati, Taleju
and Changu Narayan temples are also notable examples.
<P>
<B>The Stupa Style</B>
<P>
The Swayambhy and Boudhanath shrines are Nepal's first examples
of the stupa or chaitya style. This style is purely Buddhist in
concept and execution. The outstanding feature of the stupa is
a hemispherical mound topped by a square base supporting a series
of thirteen circular rings. Narrowing towards the top, the rings
are crowned by a parasol. The four sides of the square base, or
the harmika, as it is called, are often painted with pairs of
mystic 'all-seeing eyes'. The stupas in Patan, said to have been
built by King Ashoka, are considered to he most ancient stupas
of Nepal.
<P>
<B>The Shikhara Style</B>
<P>
The Shikhara style forms yet another architectural design found
in Nepal. The super-structure is a tall curvilinear or pyramidal
tower whose surface is broken up vertically into five to nine
sections. The final section consists of a bell-shaped part at
the top. The Krishna temple in Patan, consecrated by King Siddhi
Narayansingh Malla, is the finest specimen of the relatively less
popular shikhara style.
