<h3><B>Flora and Fauna</B></h3>
<P>
Nepal is a land of geographical extremes, ranging from near sea-level
elevations in the southern Terai to the world's highest mountains.
The country contains a variety of ecosystems: treeless subalpine
pastures and dense fir forests of the high valleys, oak and rhododendron
woods of the middle hills, and tall <I>sal</I> forests of the
south. Along the southern borders of Nepal are preserved much
of the lowland jungles and grasslands that once covered this part
of the subcontinent. Here one can see birds and mammals found
nowhere else. Although animal habitat has been somewhat depleted
as a result of agriculture, deforestation and other causes, through
Nepal's extensive and effective park and reserve system, the country
still has more varied flora and fauna than any other area in Asia.
<P>
1) Tropical Deciduous Monsoon Forest. This includes the Terai
plains and the broad flat valleys or Duns found between hill ranges.
The dominant tree species of this area are <I>Sal</I> (Shorea
robusta), sometimes associated with <I>Semal</I> (Bombax malabricum),
Asna (Terminalia termentosa), <I>Dalbergia</I> <I>spp</I>. and
other species, and <I>Pinus</I> <I>roxburghi</I> occurring on
the higher ridges of the Churia hills, which in places reach an
altitude of 1,800 meters. Tall coarse two-meter-high elephant
grass originally covered much of the Dun valleys but has now been
largely replaced by agricultural settlement. This tropical zone
is Nepal's richest area for wildlife, with gaurs, wild buffalo,
Four species of deer, tiger, leopard and other animals. Rhinoceros,
swamp deer and hog deer are found on the grasslands and two species
of crocodile and the Gangetic dolphin inhabit the rivers.

2) Subtropical Mixed Evergreen Forest. This includes the Mahabharat
Lekh which rises to a height of about 2,400 meters and comprises
the outer wall of the Himalayan range. Great rivers such as the
Karnali, Narayani, and Sapta Koshi flow through this area into
the plains of the Terai. This zone also includes the so-called
'middle hills', which extend northward in a somewhat confused
maze of ridges and valleys to the foot of the great Himalaya.
Among the tree species characteristic of this region are <I>Castenopsis</I>
indicia in association with <I>Schima</I> <I>wallichii</I>, and
other species such as <I>Alnus</I> <I>nepalensis</I>, <I>Acer</I>
oblongum and various species of oak and rhododendron, which cover
the higher slopes where deforestation has not yet taken place.
This zone is generally poor in wildlife. The only mammals which
are at all widely distributed are wild boar, barking deer, serow,
ghoral and bear. Different varieties of birds are also found in
this zone.
<P>
3) Temperate Evergreen forest. Northward, on the lower slopes
and spurs of the Great Himalaya, oaks and pines are the dominant
species up to an altitude of about 2,400 meters. Above these are
found dense conifer forests of <I>Picea</I>, Tsuga, Larix, and
<I>Betula</I> <I>spp</I>. <I>Abies</I> and <I>Betula</I> are usually
confined to higher elevations, with Betula typically making the
upper limit of the tree line. At about 3,600 to 3,900 meters,
rhododendron, bamboo and maples commonly mingle with the conifers.
The composition of the forest varies considerably, with coniferous
predominating in the west and eracaceous in the east. The wildlife
of this region includes the Himalayan bear, serow, ghoral, barking
deer and wild boar, with the Himalayan tahr sometimes being seen
on steep rocky faces above 2,400 meters. 
<P>
The red panda is among the more interesting of the smaller mammals
found in this zone; it appears to be fairly will distributed in
suitable areas of the forest above 1,800 meters. The rich and
varied avifauna of this region includes several spectacular and
beautiful pheasants, including the Danphe pheasant, Nepal's national
bird.
<P>
4) Subalpine and Alpine Zone. Above the tree line, rhododendron,
juniper scrub and other procumbent woody vegetation may extend
to about 4,200 meters where they are then succeeded by a tundra-like
association of short grasses, sedge mosses and alpine plants wherever
there is sufficient soil. This continues up to the lower limit
of perpetual snow and ice at about 5,100 meters. The mammalian
fauna is sparse and unlikely to include any species other than
the Himalayan marmot, mouse hare, tahr, musk deer, snow leopard
and occasionally blue sheep. In former times, the wild yak and
great Tibetan sheep could also be sighted in this region and it
is possible that a few may still be surviving in areas such as
Dolpa and Humla. The bird life at these altitudes includes several
interesting species such as the lammergeyer, snowcock, snowpartridge,
chough and bunting, with redstarts and dippers often seen along
the streams and rivulets.
