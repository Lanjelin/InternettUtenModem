<h3><B>Shopping</B></h3>
<P>
Shopping can be very rewarding and exciting in Kathmandu Cities.
There are numerous tourist shops on the main streets and in the
arcades of hotels, bursting with tempting jewelleries, images,
carpets, clothes and typical Nepalese crafts. And there are small
shops, some spread by the wayside, where it is possible to still
find old, original objects, and clothes shops filled with authentic
Nepalese designs. Carpet shops that will send your purchases anywhere.
And vivid shops filled with every requirement and bric-a-brac.
In some of the small village shops like Thimi one can obtain attractive
traditional masks and beautiful potteries. Antiques can be taken
out of the country with special permission only. Traditional Craftmans's
Colony in Patan is also a famous shopping center for Nepalese
handicrafts.
