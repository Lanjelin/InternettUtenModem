<h3><B>Festivals and Events</B></h3>
<P>
The rich cultural heritage of Nepal is best expressed in the many
large and small festivals that occur throughout the year. Though
the Nepalese have diverse beliefs and ethnic background, all unite
in the celebration of the year's major festivals. There are many
kinds of festivals: some honor certain Hindu and Buddhist gods
or goddesses, some recreate important events from ancient mythology
and epic literature, some herald the seasons or mark important
times in the agricultural calendar, and others propitiate the
minor deities that populated the spirit world of the country.
Festivals such as Dashain and Tihar are of national significance;
some such as Bisket or Red Machhendranath Jatra, belong to the
traditions of the old Valley towns; and still others, such as
Mani Rimdu, are celebrated only in particular countryside community.
It has been said that in Nepal, &quot;every other building is
a temple and every other day is a festival.&quot; Whatever time
one visits Nepal, there is certain to be a colorful and rewarding
festive experience.
<P>
The annual dates for the festivals were fixed long ago on specific
days of the ancient lunar calendar. Obviously these do not coincide
with the solar calendar currently used in Nepal, nor with Gregorian
calendar. Calendars are printed each spring at the beginning of
the Nepalese year which show all three dates - the lunar, the
Nepalese and Gregorian. The Nepalis skip nimbly from one to the
next while Westerns flounder in confusion.
<P>
Thus, unless one is a learned astrologer, possessed of mathematical
genius, there is no way to foretell the exact date for next year's
festivals. 
<P>
<B>The Nepalese Calendars:</B>
<P>
The calendar question, in Nepal, is a little complex. Indeed,
in addition to the Western (Gregorian) calendar, which is merely
tolerated, there are four different 'time computers'.
<P>
a) The official calendar, mandatory in all public acts and correspondence.
It is called &quot;Vikram Sambat Era&quot; comes from the name
of Vikramaditya, which started on Feb. 23re, 57 B.C. But the year
begins in Mid-April. 
<P>
b) The Newar community, in Kathmandu Valley in particular, are
traditionally and sentimentally attached to their own calendar
which is, paradoxically, called 'Nepal Era'. This Nepal Era started
in 879-880 A.D. The year begins on the festival called Tihar that
takes place on the new moon night of the month of Kartik (Oct./Nov.).
<P>
c) The third calendar is the 'Sakya Era', which began in 77-78
A.D. under King Raja Nanda Deva, a descendant of King Amsuvarma,
the founder of the Licchavi dynasty. This new era is said to have
been introduced in commemoration of Nanda Deva's access to the
throne.
<P>
<B>The Nepalese New Year's Day- (April)</B>
<P>
On this day a popular festival takes place in the 3 rd city of
Kathmandu valley Bhaktapur, where a gigantic pole installed with
two long flags hanged on the top will be laid down (rooted out)
in a great pomp and show. This will last for a week, many chariots
festivals of Gods and Goddesses will be celebrated with open joys
and cheers.
<P>
<B>Red Machhendranath Jatra (April)</B>
<P>
This festival is the biggest socio-culture event for the town
of Patan. It begins with the chariot journeys of the most widely
venerated deity of the Nepal valley, who resides in his twin shrines
at Patan and Bungamati. His popular name is Bunga Deo, but non
Newars call him also by the name of Red Machhendranath. The wheeled
chariot is prepared at Pulchowk and pulled through the town of
Patan in several stages until several month later it reaches Jawalakhel
for the final celebration of this festival called the Bhoto Dekhaune.
The two Machhendranath of Patan and Kathmandu form part of same
cult of Avalokiteswara in the Mahayan religion.
<P>
<B>Buddha Jayanti (May)</B>
<P>
This day which falls on the full moon of the month of Baisakh
is celebrated to commemorate the birth attainment of enlightenment
and the death of Gautam Buddha, the founder preacher of Buddhism,
more that 2500 years ago. Prayers are sung and worship is offered
by the Buddhists in leading Buddhist shrines throughout the country
including Lumbini in the Rupandehi district, which is the birth
place of Buddha. There is a great fare held at Lumbini on this
day.
<P>
<B>Janai Purnima (Rakchshya Bandhan) (August)</B>
<P>
The full moon of the month of Shrawan, the day when this festival
is observed is considered sacred all over Nepal and is celebrated
in different manner by various groups of people of Nepal. However,
the most widely accepted mode of celebration is that on this day
all the twice-born caster take ritual bath and they change their
sacred thread. Everyone gets strings of thread on his wrist from
the Brahmans as a protective mark for the whole year. This day
is also held sacred for bathing in Gosainkunda. One can also see
a pageantry of the Jhankris attired in their traditional costume
as they come to bathe at Kumbheshwor at Patan. These Jhankris
also visit the temple of Kailinchowk Bhagwati in Dolkhas district
where they go to bet for their healing powers as they are the
traditional healers of the Nepalese villages.
<P>
<B>Gai Jatra (The cow festival) (August)</B>
<P>
In this festival teen-aged boys addressed up as cows, parade the
streets of the town. This costume springs from the belief that
cows help the members of the family who died within that year
to travel to heaven smoothly. Some are also dressed up as an ascetic
or a fool for achieving the same objective for their dead family
members. Groups of mimics improvise short satirical enactment
on the current social scenes of the town for the entertainment
of the public. The week beginning from Janai Purnima actually
unfolds a season of many good religious and cultural activities.
All the Buddhist monasteries open their gates to the visitors
to view their bronze sculptures and collection of paintings for
a week. At Patan, one observes the festival of Mataya at this
time. The festivity of Gai Jatra itself lasts for a week enlivened
by the performance of dance and drama in the different localities
of the town. The spirit of the old festival is being increasingly
adapted by cultural centres, newspaper and magazines to fling
humour and satire on the Nepalese Social and Political life.
<P>
<B>Krishnaastami (September)</B>
<P>
The day is celebrated as the birth anniversary of Krishna, one
of the incarnations of Vishnu. Religious fast is observed and
Krishna's temple visited by the devotees on this day. A procession
goes around the town displaying the pictures of Lord Krishna,
a practice which was started in the recent years by a social organisation
called the Sanatan Dharma Sewa Samiti.
<P>
<B>Teej (September)</B>
<P>
This is a festival for the ladies. On this day the Nepalese women
go to Shiva temple in colourful dresses to worship Shiva. In Kathmandu
Valley they go to Pashupatinath and then worship Shiva (Hindu
God of Destruction) and whatever they wish that will by fulfilled.
<P>
<B>Indra Jatra (September)</B>
<P><img src="DANCE1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/dotn/dance1.jpg" align=right>
Like Gai Jatra, this also heralds a week of religious and cultural
festivity in Kathmandu. There are several face of this festival.
On the night when this festival begins members of the family in
which death has taken place within one year, go round the town
 limits of Kathmandu burning incense and putting lamps along the
route. The same morning a tall wooden pole representing the statue
of Indra and large wooden masks of Bhairab are put on display
in the bazaar. Several groups of religious dance like the Devinach,
Bhairava and Bhakku as well as Mahankalinach come into life during
this week. The week also commences with pulling of chariot of
Ganesh, Bhairava and Kumari in Kathmandu. On this historical day,
King Prithwi Narayan Shah made a victorious march with his troops
into the town and ascended the throne of Kantipur the old name
for Kathmandu displacing the Malla King Jaya Prakash Malla.
<P>
<B>Ghatasthapana - Bada Dashain (Vijaya Dashami) (September -
October)</B>
<P>
It is truly the national festival of Nepal. Every Nepali is stirred
by the prospects of the joy that this festival is supposed to
bring with it. The change of mood is also induced psychologically
by the turn of autumn season after a long spell of monsoon, introducing
clear and brilliant days, an azure blue sky and a green carpet
of fields, the climate is also just ideal at this time, it is
neither being too cold nor too warm. The Nepalese cherish their
Dashain as time for eating well and dressing well. Each house
also sets up a shrine to worship the Goddess at this time. Barley
seeds are planted on the first day in every household and nurtured
for nine days. During this period Goddess Durga Bhawani is worshipped
and offered a lot of blood sacrifices. Buffaloes, goats, chickens
and ducks are killed by the thousands at the temples at military
posts and in every household. One of the main centre that witnesses
the animal sacrifice in a large scale at this time is the Hanuman
Dhoka palace on the night of the eighth day and morning of the
ninth. On the concluding day of the festival called the Tika,
the elders of the family give Tika to their junior members and
to other relatives who may also come to seek their blessings.
The fresh shoots of the barley are also given. Family feasting
and feting of guests is a common practice at this time.

It lasts for five days and is marked by worship to different animals
such as crow, the dog and the cow, five various days. The most
important day is Laxmi Puja. The most endearing sight of this
festival is presented by the illumination of the entire town with
rows of tiny flickering lamps on Laxmi Puja. In the evening of
this day, the Goddess of Wealth, Laxmi is worshipped at every
household and it is in her welcome that myriad of lamps are burnt.
On the fifth day sisters show their affection towards their brothers
with a puja and feed them with delectable food. They pray for
their brothers long life to Yama, the Hindu God of death.
<P>
<B>Bala Chaturdasi (November - December)</B>
<P>
For one Year after the death, the soul of the dead wanders around
awaiting entrance to the under world and it is the inescapable
duty of living relatives to provide it with substance, comfort
and peace once or twice each year and Bala Chaturdasi is one of
them. The relatives pay homage to Pashupatinath and offer grains
while taking a round of the temple.

its northward Journey in its heavenly course on this day, thus
announcing the commencement of the Uttarayana. In the Nepalese
