<P>
Reflecting its ethnic diversity, Nepal's people speak a hodgepodge
of languages and dialects, anywhere from 25 to well over 100,
depending on which source you consult. Like the people, languages
can be divided into two groups: Sanskrit-based Terai tongues like
Maithili and Bhojpuri, and the Tibeto-Burman languages of the
hill tribes, which often appear in regional sub-dialects.
<P>
The <I>lingua franca</I> and national language in Nepali, an Indo-Aryan
tongue related to Sanskrit and similar to Hindi. It is derived
from the ancient language of the Khas hill tribe of northwest
Nepal. Probably 60 percent of the people speak it as their mother
tongue, and another 30 percent are fluent in it. As public schools
teach only in Nepali, it is increasingly replacing tribal language
and the cultures they represent.
<P>
Like Sanskrit and Hindi, Nepali is written in the Devanagri script.
Most of the tribal languages are unwritten. A special case in
Newari, a linguistically unique language vaguely related to the
Tibeto-Burman group and spoken by many residents of the Kathmandu
Valley.
<P>
While Nepali is a rewarding and relatively easy language to learn,
the casual traveller will find plenty of eager English speakers
in tourist destinations and along the main trekking routes. Indeed,
it's hard to pick up much Nepali in Kathmandu, as everyone seems
bent on practising their English.
