<B>Some Do's and Don'ts</B>
<P>
The Nepalese people are friendly and hospitable by nature and
the tourists in general will have no difficulty in adjustment.
All the same, one may be confused regarding some customs, traditions
and manners as in coming into any unfamiliar society. Nepal like
any other country, has its own ways of regulating life though
it might be different in degrees to each individual visitor. We
want visitors to observe and see the way to Nepalese people live
and share that with them. It is in this spirit that we offer some
practical guidelines that could help to make the stay delightful,
homely and rewarding.
<P>
<B>The Religious way of life:</B>
<P>
Religion is an integral and deep-rooted part of Nepali life. Temples,
images, sacred paintings are to be seen everywhere. Majority of
the people are Hindus in Nepal, nevertheless, Buddhism has also
important place in this country. Hinduism and Buddhism are so
closely connected in Nepal that it would take a life time's study
to understand the complexities of country's religious life. All
deities are worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists alike and feasts
and festivals are shared. For centuries both have cherished mutual
regard and respect for one another's tradition. The following
are some hints regarding religious matters.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Visitors to Hindu temple or Buddhist shrine are expected to be unshoed as a mark of respect. In fact, a pair of open sandals is more convenient and comfortable while visiting the temples and stupas. 
<LI> In some of the temples entrance may be prohibited for the non-Hindus.
<LI> Leather articles are prohibited to be taken inside the temple precinct.
<LI> It is better not to touch offerings or persons when they are on way to shrines.
<LI> Beef is strictly prohibited among both the Hindus and Buddhist. No female animal is killed for food.
<LI> Walking around temple or stupa is traditionally done clockwisely.
<LI> Generally temples, stupas and monuments are permitted to be photographed but it is better to ask authorized persons to have permission before using the camera.
</OL>
<P>
<B>Health Advices</B>
<P>
There is little AIDS in Nepal at the moment. You are most at danger
from casual sex with fellow travellers. If lust wins over better
sense then the male partner should wear a condom.
<P>
<B>Social Outlooks:</B>
<P>
Since the majority of our people live in rural areas, they have
an outlook of life that is simple and traditional. In fact, they
take special delight in the company of foreign visitors but there
are certain things that are aline or embarrassing to our people.
Here are few things to keep in mind;
<P>
<OL>
<LI> It is better to be decently clad when visiting any place. Sun and beach wear is not the ideal when roaming around the city or village. Briefs, shorts, bare shoulders and backs may not be appreciated. One need not to be stiff and overdressed, but just comfortably and decently covered.
<LI> Do not take seriously if a Nepali lady hesitates to shake hands. In Nepal, people, and specially the ladies, do not normally shake hands when they greet one another, but instead press the palms together in a prayer-like gesture known as &quot;Namaste&quot;.
<LI> Public displays of affection between man and woman are frowned upon. Do not do something that is totally alien to our environment.
<LI> We are hard on drug abuse, trafficking and possession of drugs are taken as serious offences.
</OL>

<B>Beggars:</B>
<P>
Cheap charity breeds beggars but does not solve their basic problem.
Therefore do not encourage beggary by being benevolent.
<P>
<B>Tourist Police</B>
<P>
There is a special provision of Tourist Police unit in Nepal to
deal with the problems of tourists. One can contact the Basantapur
Tourist Information Center, Airport Tourists Information Center
and the Department of Tourism - Babar Mahal for the service of
Tourist Police.
