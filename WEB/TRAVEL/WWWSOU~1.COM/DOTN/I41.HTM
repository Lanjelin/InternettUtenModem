<B>History</B>
<P>
Before Nepal's emergence as a nation in the latter half of the
eighteenth century, the designation 'Nepal' was applied only to
the Kathmandu Valley. Thus up until the unification of the country,
Nepal's history is largely the history of Kathmandu Valley.
<P>
References to Nepal in famous Hindu epics such as the Mahabharat,
Puranas and also Buddhist and Jain scriptures, establish the country's
antiquity as an independent political and territorial entity.
The Vamshavalis or chronicles, the oldest of which was written
during the fourteenth century, are the only fairly reliable basis
for Nepal's ancient history. The Vamshavalis mention the rule
of several dynasties-the Gopalas, the Abhiras and the Kiratas-over
a stretch of centuries. However, no extant historical evidence
has yet authenticated the rule of these legendary dynasties. The
documented history of Nepal begins with the Changu Narayan temple
inscription of King Manadeva I (c. A. D. 564) of the Lichchhavi
dynasty.
<P>
<B>The Lichchhavis</B>
<P>
The Lichchhavis are said to have migrated into Nepal from north
India in around A. D. 250. The first Lichchhavi king of historical
importance was Manadeva I.
<P>
Another  important Lichchhavi monarch was Amshuvarma, who opened
trade routes to Tibet. One of his daughters, Bhrikuti, who was
married to the Tibetan ruler Tsrong-tsen Gompo, was instrumental
in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China. Amshuvarma has been
referred to as a man of many talents in the accounts of the Chinese
traveller Huen Tsang, who visited India in the seventh century
A. D.
<P>
Narendradeva, another Lichchhavi king, initiated friendly relations
with China and his successors laid the foundations of friendship
with India by entering into matrimonial alliances with the Indian
royal families. For several hundred years after the fall of the
Lichchhavi kingdom in A. D. 879, there are no written records.
Frequently called the Transition period, this era was marked by
continued refinement of stone and bronze sculpture and the early
development of architecture.
<P>
<B>The Mallas</B>
<P>
Malla rule began with Ari Malla in the thirteenth century. Over
the next two centuries a large empire was built before  disintegrating
into small principalities, later known as the Baisi (the twenty-two
principalities) This was more or less coincidental with the emergence
of the Chaubisi (twenty-four principalities) to the west of Kathmandu.
The history of these principalities remains shrouded up until
the time when they joined other kingdoms, both large and small,
to form the unified Kingdom of Nepal.
<P>
Jayasthiti Malla, with whom commences the later Malla period in
the Kathmandu Valley, reigned towards the end of the fourteenth
century. Though his rule was rather short, his place among the
rulers in the Valley is eminent for his various social and economic
reforms such as the 'Sanskritization' of the Valley people and
new methods of land measurement and allocation.
<P>
Yakshya Malla, the grandson of Jayasthiti Malla, ruled the Kathmandu
Valley until almost the end of the fifteenth century. Afger his
demise, the Valley was divided into three independent kingdoms
Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan -- in about A.D. 1484. This division
led the Malla rulers into internecine wars for territorial and
commercial gain. Mutually debilitating wars gradually weakend
them and by the time of Prithvi Narayan Shah's invasion of the
Valley, they had by themselves reached the brink of political
disintegration.
<P>
The last rulers were Jaya Prakash Malla, Tej Narsingh Malla and
Ranjit Malla of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur respectively.
<P>
<B>The Shah Dynasty: Unification of Nepal</B>
<P>
Prithvi Narayan Shah (1769 - 1775), with whom we move into the
modern period of Nepal's history, was the ninth generation descendant
of Dravya Shah 91559 - 1570), the founder of the ruling house
of Gorkha. In 1743 Prithvi Narayan Shah succeeded his father,
King Nara Bhupal Shah, to the throne of Gorkha, a small kingdom
in central Nepal. Sagacious and farsighted, King Prithvi Narayan
Shah was quite aware of the political situation of the Valley
kingdoms as well as of the Baisi and Chaubisi principalities.
He foresaw the need for unification the small principalities and
set himself to the task accordingly. His assessment of the situation
among the hill principalities was correct, and the principalities
were subjugated fairly easily. King Prithvi Narayan Shah's victory
march began with the conquest of Nuwakot, which lies between Kathmandu
and Gorkha, in 1744. After Nuwakot, he occupied strategic points
on the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley. The Valley's communications
with the outside world were thus cut off. The occupation of the
Kuti pass in about 1756 stopped the Valley's trade with Tibet.
<P>
Finally, King Prithvi Narayan Shah entered the Valley, after the
victory over the hilltop town of Kirtipur, King Jaya Prakash Malla
of Kathmandu sought help from the British, and the East India
Company responded with a contingent of soldiers under Captain
Kinloch in 1767. The British force was defeated at Sindhuli by
King Prithvi Narayan Shah's army. This defeat of the British completely
shattered the hopes of King Jaya Prakash Malla.
<P>
The capture of Kathmandu (September 25, 1768) was dramatic. As
the people of Kathmandu were celebrating the festival Indrajatra,
Prithvi Narayan Shah and his men marched into the city. A throne
was put in the palace courtyard for the king of Kathmandu. Prithvi
Narayan Shah sat on the throne and was hailed by the people as
the king of Kathmandu. Jaya Prakash Malla managed to escape with
his life and took asylum in Patan. When Patan was captured a few
weeks later, both Jaya Prakash Malla and the King of Patan, Tej
Narsingh Malla, took refugee in Bhaktapur, which was also captured
after some time. Thus Kathmandu became the capital of modern Nepal
in 1769.
<P>
Once the foundation of the Kingdom of Nepal was laid, Prithvi
Narayan Shah turned his attention towards the east. The Sena kingdom
of Chaudandi was acquired in 1773 and Vijayapur, another Sena
kingdom, was annexed shortly after.
<P>
Prithvi Narayan Shah died in January, 1775, at the age of 52.
The Kingdom of Nepal then extended to the Marsyangdi river in
the west and to the Mechi and Kankai rivers in the east and comprised
more than one third of the present territory of the Kingdom of
Nepal.
<P>
King Prithvi Narayan Shah was successful in bringing together
diverse religio-ethnic groups under one national banner and inculcating
in them a sense of national pride and belonging. He was a nationalist
in his outlook and was in favor of adopting a closed-door policy
with regard to the British. Not only his social and economic views
guided the country's socio-economic course for a long time, but
his use of the image, 'a yam between two boulders' in Nepal's
geo-political context, formed the principal guideline of the country's
foreign policy for future centuries.
<P>
King Prithvi Narayan Shah was succeeded by his eldest son Pratap
Singh Shah (1775 - 1777) who had a quite brief rule.
<P>
King Pratap Singh Shah was succeeded by his infant son Rana Bahadur
Shah (1777 - 1799). The guardianship of the infant King was at
first given to Bahadur Shah, the King's uncle. But later, Rajendra
Laxmi, the widowed queen mother, took over the regency herself
and forced Bahadur Shah into exile. Most of the Chaubisi principalities
were annexed to the Kingdom of Nepal during her regency.
<P>
Bahadur Shah came back from exile a few days before the queen
mother's death and took up the regency in 1785. The rest of the
Baisi and Chaubisi principalities were annexed to the Kingdom
of Nepal during his regency (1785 - 1749).
<P>
Nepal's boundary in the west was extended as far as Kumaon (Almorah)
in 1792, when the country become entangled in a war with China
following Nepal's armed attacks on Tibet in 1788 and 1791 over
a trade dispute. The war was concluded with the signing of a peace
treaty between Nepal and China. After this war, the extension
of territory to the west was resumed and the areas up to Kangra
were occupied by Nepalese forces by the first decades of the nineteenth
century.
<P>
<B>The War with the British</B>
<P>
The Nepalese had differences of opinion with the East India Company
regarding the ownership of land in the western Terai, particularly
Butwal and Seoraj. The outcome of the conflict was a war with
the British. The British launched their attack on the Nepali forces
at Nalapani, the westernmost point of Nepal's frontier, at the
close of 1814. Though the Nepalese were able to inflict heavy
losses on the British army on various fronts, the large army and
the superior weapons of the British proved too strong. The Nepali
army evacuated the areas west of the Mahakali river and ultimately
the treaty of Sugauli was signed with the British in 1816. Among
other things, this treaty took away a large chunk of the Terai
from Nepal, and the rivers Mahakali and Mechi were fixed as the
country's western and eastern boundaries.
<P>
At this time, King Girvana Yuddha Bikram Shah occupied the throne
of Nepal, and the power of state was in the hands of Prime Minister
Bhimsen Thapa, who wielded enormous power during the rule of this
King and his son King Rajendra Bikram Shah.
<P>
<B>The Rana Century (1846 - 1951)</B>
<P>
Bhimsen Thapa's death in 1839, combined with the loss of the hold
on state affairs by King Rajendra Bikram Shah, ultimately led
to a power struggle among the nobles in the court. In this power
struggle, Jung Bahadur, the founder of the Rana oligarchy in Nepal,
emerged as the most powerful leader. The notorious Kot Massacre
of 1846, in which Jung Bahadur put a large number of his rivals
to death, was the most sanguine step on his rise to power. He
dethroned King Rajendra Bikram Shah, and his son Surendra Bikram
Shah (1847 - 1881) was made king. He appointed all his brothers
to the key posts of the country. Later on, through a royal edict,
the Prime Ministership was institutionalized in the Rana family.
