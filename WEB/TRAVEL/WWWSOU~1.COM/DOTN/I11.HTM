<I><B>Namaste</B>!</I> Welcome to a land you will never forget
- a land of snow-capped mountain and quiet river valleys of ancient
preserved cities and towering pagoda temples, of friendly people
and fascinating folkways. Nepal offers unique pleasures for everyone
-- tourists trekkers, wildlife enthusiasts, mountaineers, art
connoisseur, poets and those in search of a personal <I>Shangri-La</I>.
<P>
Tucked within the borders of this small country is an astounding
variety of animals, plants and geologic formations. The world's
tallest point, the summit of Sagarmatha (Mt. Everest), commands
the north, while the luxurious jungles of the Terai, filled with
birds and beasts, command the south. In nearly a dozen wilderness
parks and reserves you can find everything from the majestic Royal
Bengal tiger and the Great One-horned rhinoceros to the nimble
Musk deer and the elusive Snow leopard.
<P>
Nepal is a land for all seasons -- year around there are a myriad
places to go, people to meet and sites to see. Year around there
are exciting adventure activities: trekking, white water rafting,
biking, mountaineering and jungle safaris. And year around there
is a delightful, never-ending procession of colourful festivals.
<P>
Nepal is a land where the arts and culture are as well preserved
as the valleys and forests -- temples enriched with wood carving
and bronzes, millennium-old statues standing along the wayside,
songs and dances unchanged for centuries, and entire cities preserved
in their medieval splendor. And it is a place where craft traditions
are as vital as they were a thousand years ago, a place where
one can buy wood carvings. statues, gems and weaving similar to
those of the ancient world.
