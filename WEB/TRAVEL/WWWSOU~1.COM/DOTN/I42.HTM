<B>The Dawn of Democracy</B>
<P>
Popular protests against the Ranas has started gaining some momentum
from as far back as the early 1940s. In 1940, a number of young
men were put to death, and long-term rigorous jail sentences were
meted out to several others seeking to bring about political changes.
An organized underground movement against the Ranas became stronger
with the passing years. The independence of India in 1947 also
consolidated the movement against the Ranas in Nepal. Bound as
was the fate of the Ranas with that of the British rule in India,
the termination of the British rule sealed the fate of the Rana
rule in Nepal. And, in the meanwhile, the popular movement against
the Ranas had gathered momentum.
<P>
Tensions went on mounting against the ruling Rana regime, which
resulted in the collapse of their rule in February, 1951. Rana
oligarchy gave way to democracy and King Tribhuvan returned to
kathmandu from New Delhi to reassert the political power. Eight
years later on February 18, 1959, the first ever general election
on the basis of multiparty democratic system was held in Nepal.
At that time, the Nepali Congress party was voted into power and
a new government was formed. Shortly thereafter, on December 15,
1960, the parliamentary system of democracy was replaced by the
Partyless Panchyat system.
<P>
In response to the interests of the people, on May 24, 1979, His
Majesty King Birendra announced a national referendum, in which
the people were urged to vote their choice between a multi-party
system or the continuation of the Panchayat system with timely
reforms. Approximately one year later, on May 2, 1980, polls of
the national referendum were held. The party-less Panchayat system
with timely reforms was voted in by a simple majority.
<P>
From the beginning of 1990, the movement for the restoration of
parliamentary democracy accelerated and gained popular support
through the country. All the parties previously banned formed
a joint front to overthrow the Panchayat system and restore multi-party
democracy. On April 8, 1990, the ban on political parties was
lifted and multi-party democracy was restored with a midnight
announcement following a dialogue between His Majesty King Birendra
and the leaders of the major political parties. The day following
the announcement the restoration of multi-party democracy was
celebrated throughout the country.
<P>
On April 19, 1990, an interim government, composed of representatives
of the major political parties, intellectuals and independents,
was formed under the Prime Ministership of Mr. Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai. After planning and discussion, the new democratic constitution
of the Kingdom of Nepal was promulgated on November 9, 1990. This
paved the way for the general election which was held on May 12,
1991. In the general election, the Nepali Congress Party secured
the majority with 110 seats out of 205 to the House of Representatives.
The Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist) won 69 seats
and became the major opposition party in the House. On May 26,
1991, Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala was appointed the new Prime Minister
of Nepal and subsequently a 15 member Council of Ministers was
constituted under his Chairmanship. 
<P>
Three years later mid term poll held on 1994 (BS 2051, 29th Kartik)
and the government was formed  by the Communist Party of Nepal
- United Marksist-Leninist (CPN-UML) which continued for 9 months.
Six months later, the CPN-UML government dissolved the House of
Representatives and announced the mid term poll, but three months
later of dissolving the House  the Supreme Court of Nepal reinstalled
the House of Representative on 28th August 1995 (BS 2052, 12th
Vadra). Then the new Coalition Government was formed by Nepali
Congress Party, Rastriya Prajatantra Party and Sadvabana Party.
