In Nepal, religion permeates every facet of life with festivals,
daily rituals, family celebrations and religious observances.
At every step one can see temples and shrines, processions and
devotional music. Although Nepal is famous as the world's only
Hindu Kingdom, it is an intricate and beautiful tapestry woven
of Hindusm, Buddhism and other faiths living together in tolerance
and harmony.
<P>
<B>Hinduism:</B>
<P>
Hinduism is a complex religion with a variety of teachers, doctrines
and, it is said, millions of gods and goddesses. Though Hinduism
is frequently described in philosophical terms as a Trinity of
three gods -- Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva
the Destroyer, in everyday religion numerous gods and goddesses
are worshiped depending on the special day of observance, the
affinity of the person or the family for a particular deity, and
the purpose of the worship. Certain deities are particularly important
in Nepal.
<P>
Shiva, the Destroyer, is historically the god most worshipped
in the country. He may be worshipped as the holy ascetic, depicted
with his consort Parvati and holding a trident and a small drum.
or more often in the form of the Linga, an elongated stone representing
his generative powers. The most important Linga is situated in
the holy shrine of Pashupatinath to the west of Kathmandu. In
front of Shiva temples one usually sees a statue of Nandi, the
divine bull that serves as Shiva's vehicle. Another popular form
of Shiva in Nepal is the terrifying Bhairav. Different aspects
of Bhairav play major roles in many of the Valley's festivals.
<P>
Vishnu, whose primary duty is to assure the preservation of the
world and all living forms, is believed to have visited the earth
ten times, each time as a different incarnation or avatar. He
is often depicted as a boar, a tortoise, a man-lion and a fish
-- his four animal incarnations. Throughout South Asia he is most
often worshipped in two well-known human forms: prince Ram, the
hero of the epic Ramayana, and the pastoral god Krishna. In Nepal
he is often worshipped in his omnipotent form of Narayan, and
in some of his most lovely images is seen astride the man-bird
Garuda, his vehicle.
<P>
The archetypal mother, or female, goddess is of particular importance
in Nepal. She is worshipped in many aspects: as Durga, protectress
and slayer of the buffalo demon, as Taleju, patron deity of the
Valley rulers, and as the Kumari, the living virgin goddess. Other
female goddesses include Laxmi, goddess of wealth, and Saraswati,
goddess of learning and the arts.
<P>
Another widely venerated god is elephant-headed Ganesh, the remover
of obstacles and the bringer of god fortune. Other deities, such
as Red Machhendranath, are special to Nepal alone, and are celebrated
with unique local festivals.
<P>
<B>Buddhism:</B>
<P>
There is a variety of Buddhist practices in Nepal: the Buddhism
of the endemic Newari people, perhaps related to the ancient Buddhism
that passed out of India one thousand years ago; the Buddhism
of the Sherpa, Tamang and Tibetan peoples; and the relatively
modern incursion of Theravadin or Southern Buddhism.
<P>
The central beliefs and practices date back to the time of its
founder, Prince Siddhartha Gautam, who was born in Lumbini in
the southern Terai in about 543 B.C. Until the age of 29, the
young prince led a sheltered life in the royal palace of his father,
completely unaware of the problems and suffering of the world
outside his palace walls. One day he convinced his charioteer
to take him outside the palace, where he was shocked at the sight
of an old man, a sick man, a corpse and an ascetic. The realization
of the true misery of the world persuaded the prince to abandon
his luxurious life and go into the forests to seek enlightenment
to end human suffering. For many years, Gautam practiced asceticism
without success. One night beneath a pipal tree in the forest
of Bodh Gaya he became enlightened. Henceforth known as Lord Buddha,
the 'enlightened on', he travelled northern India and southern
Nepal preaching the Middle Path to enlightenment. At the age of
eight he passed into the final enlightenment, <I>parinirvana</I>.
<P>
His teachings spread throughout the world, changing and evolving
as all religion do. The Southern School retained the basic teaching
of the Buddha according to the Sutras, written down some years
after his death. The Northern, or Mahayana, School emphasized
the role of the Bodhisattva, the person who forgoes final and
absolute enlightenment until he has guided all other being to
enlightenment first. This school predominates in China and Japan.
In India at the end of the first millennium A.D. the Vajrayana
School arose.
<P>
Incorporating both Southern and Mahayana doctrines, it added new
forms of meditation, elaborate rituals, new aspects of the Buddha
in the form of Tantric gods and goddesses, and a philosophy that
emphasized the use of all aspect of the human experience as material
for enlightenment. While Buddhism declined in India with the Muslim
invasions, it retained its vigor in nearby Nepal. Nepal served
as a seed for the establishment of Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet.
<P>
In addition to Hinduism and Buddhism, a small minority of Nepalese
adhere to Islam and Christianity. Muslims and Christians believe
and practice in Nepal as they do throughout the world.
