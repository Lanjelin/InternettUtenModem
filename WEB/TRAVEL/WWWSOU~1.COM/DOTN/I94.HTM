<h3><B>Entertainment</B></h3>
<P>
Although an old city when it comes to historic monuments, Kathmandu
is only just beginning to develop recreational activities. Perhaps
one reason for this is that the country's many festivals also
serve as entertainment, with their exhilarating dramas, dances
and pantomimes. The festivals of Gai Jatra and Indra Jatra, for
example, feature exciting mask dances, while festivals such as
Ghanta Karna act out ancient myths in drama form. Family ceremonies
such as marriage and pasni, feeding an infant his first rice meal,
are also a source of merriment and entertainment.

<B>Radio</B>
<P>
Radio Nepal established in 1951 broadcasts different programs
in both short wave and medium wave transmissions through three
sessions in a day from 6.00 A.M. to 11.00 P.M. Presently His Majesty
Government has privatised the license of FM radio services. The
Radio Nepal has already started the FM services for the Kathmandu
valley. It broadcasts the programme in differnt

<B>Television<U>:</U></B>
<P>
Nepal Television started its operation in 1985, December 28. It
transmits from 7.00 A.M. to 8.00 A.M. and 7.00 P.M. to 10.00 P.M.
On Saturday special entertaining programme are transmitted at
12.00 Noon to 4.30 P.M.
<P>
<B>Theater</B>
<P>
Nepal's theater tradition dates back to the Malla period, when
plays used to be enacted in palace courtyards and within temple
precincts. It seems that the most popular forms of theater at
this time were skits, comedies and adaptations from Sanskrit dramas.
Theater entertainment was then neglected for several centuries
and only became popular again in the 1930s with Balakrishna Sama's
famous play Mukunda Indira. Since this time, it has flourished
so that there are now three venues in Kathmandu where plays are
shown regularly. These are: 1) The Rastriya Naachghar near Rani
Pokhari, 2) The Royal Nepal Academy at Kamaladi and 3) The City
Hall, opposite the Exhibition Ground.
<P>
<B>Music</B>
<P>
Since the beginning of Nepal's history, the Himalayas have been
a rich treasure-house of folk songs representing the country's
varied topographical and ethnic characteristics. As one could
perhaps expect, Nepalese music has strong religious roots: many
religious processions are accompanied by instrumental music (mainly
percussion instruments) while Bhajans, or hymns, are often part
of temple ceremonies. The latter are usually accompanied by the
harmonium.
<P>
Apart from religious music, folk songs have long been a source
of entertainment both in towns and villages. These are either
song by local residents or by travelling musicians who make their
living this way. Over the past few years, Ratna Recording Coronation
has assembled and categories many varieties and examples of Nepalese
folk music, and has made them available on cassettes and records.
<P>
Over the last two decades, Western music has lent its influence
to what could be termed 'modern Nepalese music.' This can be heard
live in most of Kathmandu's four-or five-star hotel restaurants
and in recorded form on Radio Nepal, the country's main radio
station.
<P>
<B>Folk Dance</B>
<P>
The masked dances of the Kathmandu Valley, such as the Lakhe,
Devi and Mahakali dances, which have earned the status of classical
dances, are all strongly tied to the ritualistic worship of divinities.
There are also various traditional dances performed in the Hill
and Terai regions of the country. Nepalese folk dances are characterized
by a strong, rugged individuality, and show joy and sorrow, fear
and aspiration. Geographical and ethnic factors have enriched
this folk traditional with a variety of expression.
<P>
Folk dances can be seen regularly around town. Cultural dances
can also be seen at higher standard hotels and lodges in Royal
Chitwan National Park and, on arrangement, in Bhaktapur and Pokhara.
A kathmandu travel agency should be consulted for more exact details
of programme locations and other arrangements.
<P>
<B>Cinemas</B>
<P>
There are about forty movie houses in Nepal, including nine in
Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. Although Western films are occasionally
shown, Nepal's main supplier of feature films is neighboring India.
The Royal Nepal Film Corporation, a government undertaking set
up in 1971, has been entrusted with the promotion of Nepal's film
industry.
<P>
<B>Discotheques</B>
<P>
At present, Nepal has only one discotheque, known as the Damaru,
in the Hotel Woodlands on Durbar Marg. Disco-style dancing, along
with more traditional forms of dancing, also takes place from
time to time at special programs organized by Kathmandu's large
hotels.
<P>
<B> Casino</B>
<P>
Four Casino are located on the premisses of the five star hotels,
Soaltee Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Hotel - Casino Nepal, Yak &amp;
Yet - Royal Casino, Everest Hotel - Everest Casino Hotel De l'Annapurna
- Anna Casino are open 24 hours a day and features games such
as roulette, pontoon, flush, blackjack, baccarat and paplu. The
Casino provides free transportation to and from any major hotel
in Kathmandu.
<P>
<B>Sports</B>
<P>
Football, basketball, table tennis and badminton are some of Nepal's
most popular sports. A national league competes annually in championship
events. Regional football tournaments with neighboring countries
are quite frequent. 
<P>
Most of Kathmandu's four-and five-star hotels offer sports facilities
- mainly tennis, billiards and swimming. Even though one is not
a resident guest, it is possible to use the facilities at the
same or slightly higher rate. Enquire at hotel reception desks
to contact Kathmandu's various sports association such as the
All Nepal Tennis Association, the Nepal Cricket Association and
the Amateur Athletics Association.
<P>
Kathmandu has a number of swimming pools open to the public. The
National Stadium in Tripureshwor has a large and well-kept pool.
There is also a public swimming pool adjoining Balaju Water Garden
to the north-west of Kathmandu.
