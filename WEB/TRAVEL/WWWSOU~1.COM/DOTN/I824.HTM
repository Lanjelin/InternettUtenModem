<h3><B>Ballooning</B>  </h3>
<P>
To look up into the sky and see the peaks of Himalaya is awe inspiring
and certainly a valid and popular reason to come to Nepal. To
walk among those mountains is more wonderful still. But to glide
silently among them, this is perhaps the most thrilling experience.
The commercial hot air ballooning in Nepal is now a reality.
<P>
Propane gas is fired into the balloon or envelope as it is called,
which heats the air and causes it to rise. Once the balloon fills
with enough hot air, it is the wind which decides where the balloon
goes. Altitude is controlled by adding more or less hot air to
the envelope and in this way air currents can be ridden to reach
a desired destination.
<P>
&quot;The Kathmandu Valley is ideally situated for ballooning&quot;,
says a balloon operator. The balloon will float at about 4000
to 5000 ft above the Valley, which will bring passengers close
to 10,000 ft . From this altitude entire Himalayan range will
be in sight - 360 degree of visibility is what the balloon affords,
as well as fantastic downward views of the Kathmandu Valley itself.
After 15 minutes or so at this altitude enough time for people
to take their photos and convince their jaws  to close again,
the balloon will descend for gentle flight over the sights of
Kathmandu Valley. By the time the basket sets down again, roughly
one hour after take-off, the balloonists will have experienced
Kathmandu and the mighty Himalaya from an entirely new perspective.
