<P>
There is perhaps no country in the world where traditional architecture,
painting and sculpture are as well preserved. For 1500 years,
Nepal has been famed as a center of temple building, metalwork
and wood carving, and for centuries has sent its precious art
objects to other centers of civilization. Today, many of its craft
skills are undiminished. To better understand the deep and complex
roots of Nepalese culture, it is necessary to look at Nepal's
ancient past.
<P>
<B>Around the Kathmandu Valley</B>
<P>
Most of the works of art in Nepal are found in the Kathmandu Valley.
Although there are some interesting works of art dating back to
Lichchhavi Period in the 5th century found in such places as the
temple of Changunarayan, almost all of other work dates from the
Malla period which lasted from 14th to 18th centyry. It was immediately
after the only Moslem invasion of the valley in 1346 that an era
began which resulted in the creation of numerous works of art.
The valley was divided into three independent kingdoms and art
received royal patronage. The works of art of this period include
temples and other buildings of the Durbar Squares of the three
cities such as Taleju and Nyatapola. During the Shah period which
started in the 18th century the works of art created were less
impressive. In the first half of the period, Nepal was expanding
its territorial limits. In the second half from mid 19th to mid
20th century during the Rana regime, the European style was introduced
which resulted in the construction of Rana palaces including Singha
Durbar and Gaddi Baithak in Kathmandu Durbar Square. It is believed
in Nepal that the pagoda style of architecture originated in the
country and later went to China and Japan. This style is illustrated
by most of the temples in Nepal including the Taleju in Kathmandu
and Nyatapola in Bhaktapur. The Shikhara style is represented
by Krishna Temple in Patan.
<P>
<B>Beyond the Kathmandu Valley</B>
<P>
<B>Tilaurakot:</B>
<P>
Over the past few decades archaeological work has been conducted
in the Terai region of the country where Nepal's first settlements
were probably located. Tilaurakot, for example, used to be the
capital of the Shakya dynasty and is situated in Kapilavastu district
in western Nepal. The present archaeological site extends over
an area of more than five square kilometers. The central portion,
measuring approximately five thousand meters by four thousand
meter, is surrounded by a citadel built at three different periods.
The first and second ancient citadel walls are made of mud and
date from 600 to 200 B.C. while the third wall appears to have
been constructed with kilnburnt bricks around 150 B.C. The eastern
gate, the eastern stupa, the Ashita Apsidal Stupa and a defence
wall were first discovered at the site. More recent excavations
brought to light the majestic western gateway complex including
the watchman's room, six meter wide rods of different periods
(with cart-track impressions), the moat on the east and west,
three periods of defence walls and the northern twin stupas made
and enlarged between the fourth and second centuries B.C. The
central portion of the site has also been excavated and various
brick structures from the third century B.C. to the second century
A.D. have been unearthed. Water storage tanks, big jars, brick
and terra-cotta ring wells and a fire-altar have also been found.
Other antiquities discovered at the site are human and animal
terra-cotta figurines (dated 400 B.C. to A.D. 200), silver punch-marked
coins, early cast coins with symbols, Mitra coins with different
symbols, Kushan coins, and pieces of Sunga and Kushan pottery.
Apart from these antiquities, practical items such as terra-cotta
cart whells, iron implements, nails arrowheads, bone and copper
rods, dice and fishing hooks have been found.
<P>
<B>Gotihawa:</B>
<P>
These ancient ruins are situated eleven kilometer south of Tilaurakot
and six kilometers southwest of Taulihawa, the present district
headquarters. To the north of the Gotihawa village, there is an
ancient brick stupa and an Ashokan pillar. The lower portion,
with its square granite base stone, is still intact but the crowning
features and inscriptional portions are missing. The site can
be safely identified as the Nirvan stupa of Kukuchhanda Buddha
(one of the previous Buddhas), whose hometown lies within one
kilometer of this stupa-pillar complex.
<P>
<B>Sagarhawa:</B>
<P>
This site is located two kilometer north of Tilaurakot on the
bank of the Banganga river. It was excavated in 1986 and seventeen
miniature stupas were found there.
<P>
In the same general region, sites of ancient civilization have
been identified at Lumbini, Banjarhi, Nipaniya and Kadyatawa,
to mention just a few. Several important sites have also been
excavated in the eastern region of the country, the most important
of which are Bhediari, Varahakshetra, janakpur and Simaraongarh.
<P>
<B>Bhediari:</B>
<P>
Located nearly ten kilometers south of Biratnagar, the ancient
ruins at this site include many important brick temples, one of
which has been fully excavated. It appears to have been built
in the Sunga period and shows two phases of construction. There
is a two-meter high rectangular platform supported from the inside
by cross walls. So far no image either of stone or terra-cotta
has been found during the excavations; however, a number of silver
punch-marked coins have been found.
<P>
<B>Varahakshetra:</B>
<P>
This is another important temple site located at the confluence
of the Koka and Koshi rivers. The site is known to belong to the
period of later Guptas, who had issued a copper grant for the
two Varaha images found there. There are also many miniature Gupta
period temple replicas, which suggest that many such temples and
idols were made during the sixth and seventh centuries A.D.
<P>
<B>Narasingha Tappu:</B>
<P>
Some years ago, while cultivating lands at Narasingha Tappu, close
to the present town of Itahari, an idol of Vishnu was discovered.
The image belongs to the fifth or sixth century A.D., and is of
the Gupta tradition. It is now kept inside a local Shiva temple.
The site, according to local people, also contains pottery items,
indicating that is was inhabited as early as the Gupta dynasty
(fourth-fifth century A.D.).
<P>
<B>Janakpur:</B>
<P>
At Ram-Janaki temple complex near Janakpur there is an important
image depicting Uma lying on a bed and feeding a baby. Ganesh
and Kumar are also depicted in the panel while on the top of the
scene is a Shiva Linga. The piece dates from the twelfth or thirteenth
century A.D. and belongs to the Karnatakas of Simaraongarh.
<P>
<B>Simaraongarh:</B>
<P>
This was the old capital city of the Karnatakas of Mithila and
was built by King Nanyadeva in A.D. 1097-98. The ruins of the
city extend over an areas of 16 kilometers which is still surrounded
by a high wall of kiln-burnt bricks. There are more than one hundred
images and sculptures scattered throughout the area. Most are
made of black schist stone and are nicely polished; a few are
made of sandstone. The images at the site are of Vishnu, Narayan,
Laxmi-Narayan, Shankarsana, Garudopari Vishnu, Uma-Maheshwara,
Durga, Shiva and Surya. In different parts of Simaraongarh, there
are remains of temples and gateways of the old city.
<P>
Other sites bearing Karnataka images and sculptures are Kanchanpur
(near Rajbiraj), Murtiya (west of Janakpur) and Valmiki Nagar
(near the Gandaki barrage), as well as several other places between
the Gandaki and Sapta Koshi rivers.
<P>
<B>Gorkha Durbar</B>
<P>
This small hill town is a ritual importance far beyond its size
as the birthplace of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the 18th-century unifier
of Nepal and founder of the present ruling dynasty. The immense
square building in the centre of town is Tallo Durbar, the 'Lower
Palace' (as opposed to the Upallo Durbar on top of the hill).
Built in the mid 18th century, it served as the seat of local
administration. Gorkha's main sight, the old Shah palace, broods
above a hill overlooking the town. It is a stiff half-hour climb
up a seemingly endless stone staircase.
<P>
The palace is smaller than the ornate durbar of the Kathmandu
Valley, but remains a fine example of Newari woodwork and architecture,
unspoiled by Rana-era additions. It seems the Gorkha preferred
to concentrate on warefare and let their conquered people do the
building, thus preserving traditional styles long past the dates
of conquest. Constructed during the region of Ram Shah (1606-36),
it was expanded by successive rulers. The palace's tremendous
historic and ritual significance explains its excellent condition.
<P>
There are plenty of erotic strut carvings, especially in the small
lower palace called the Raj Durbar, the old living quarters, sanctified
as the birthplace of Prithvi Narayan Shah. Adjoining it is Kalika
Durbar, centred around a powerful Kali temple which is the scene
of frequent animal sacrifices. Worshippers prostrate themselves
in devotion in front of the locked doors, which are opened only
on the eight day of each lunar fortnight. This section of the
palace is the holy of holies, with police posted to prevent tourists
from entering and ritually defiling it.
<P>
The palace complex abounds with other shrines to Hindu deities,
including Shiva, Guyheswari, and a 'cave shrine down a short flight
of steps which is sacred to Gorakhanath. This 12th century yogi
is said to have lived and meditated here; gradually he was deified
into a cult figure and patron of the Shahs. He is linked with
Shiva, obvious from the array of tridents inside.
<P>
<B>Tansen</B>
<P>
Tansen is the largest of the trading posts established by Newars
in Nepal's middle Hills. It lies in the middle of Magar country,
an ethnic group usually described as one of Nepal's most appealing
peoples. The town is the old capital of the Kingdom of Palpa,
the last of the independent kingdoms of Nepal, annexed only in
1806. It is located on a hillside a few kilometer off the Siddhartha
Highway between Pokhara and Bhairawa, Tansen is definitely off
the beaten track. 
<P>
Built on the southern slope of a hill rising above the Madi Valley,
Tansen comprises a maze of narrow lanes lined with red-brick buildings
set with carved woodwork. It remains an important bazaar town,
with hill people coming in to buy cooking oil, salt, tea, cloth
and other provisions, and to enjoy the teashops and sociability.
The quiet streets resound with the clack of the loom: Tansen's
boldy patterned Dhaka cloth, used for topis and Shawls, is considered
the finest in Nepal.
<P>
The centre of town is dominated by the rambling pink Tansen Durbar,
the former seat of the Rana governor, today housing government
offices. Behind it is a temple to Bhagwati, and further east the
exceptionally fine Amar Narayan temple to Vishnu, where drums,
bells and horns are sounded in worship each morning and evening.
<P>
<b>Painting:</b>
<P><center><img src="THANKA1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/dotn/thanka1.jpg"></center>
Two media that reveal a lot about Nepalese culture, both past
and present, are painting and sculpture. Fortunately, there are
many fine and well-preserved pieces that have survived the passage
of time and thus enable detailed research to be made. Looking
briefly at the history of Nepalese painting, it appears that ancient
icons and religious paintings entered the Valley during the Lichchhavi
period. Lichchhavi inscriptions inform us that traders, monks
and Brahmans, as well as artists from neighboring areas, visited
Kathmandu Valley from the mid-fifth century A.D. The visitors
may have brought religious icons and paintings with them which
served as models for local artists.
<P>
The chines envoy, Wang Hsuan Tse, who came to Nepal in the seventh
century A.D., described quite eloquently the houses in the Valley,
which at that early time were embellished with sculptures and
paintings. Although there are no surviving examples of paintings
from the Lichchhavi period, it can be surmised that the murals
or wall-paintings noticed by the Chinese envoy were just as sophisticated
as the surviving pieces of culture from this period.
<P>
The earliest examples of Nepalese painting are in the form of
manuscript illustrations on palm leaves. Nepalese manuscripts
go back to the ninth century; however, not all early manuscripts
were illustrated. The earliest known example of an illustrated
manuscript is the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita, dated A.D. 1015.
<P>
These manuscripts invariably consist of narrow folios of palm
leaves about thirty centimeters long, depending on the text, but
not wider than fine centimeters. The manuscripts are perforated
in two places, loosely held together with sting and protected
by wooden covers on both sides. These wooden covers, a large number
of which have survived, are more lavishly painted than the manuscripts
themselves. In palm leaf manuscripts the scribes left spaces for
the artist to later paint in the figures of divinities.
<P>
After the introduction of paper, palm leaf became less popular'
however it continued to be used until the eighteenth century.
Early paper manuscript imitated the oblong shape but were wider
than the palm leaves.
<P>
<B>Influence of Religion on Painting </B>
<P>
All surviving  illustrated manuscripts, whether Buddhist or Hindu,
are illustrated with hieratic images of gods and goddesses. A
large number of manuscripts are devoted to the principal events
from the life of Buddha or the hieratic  representations of Vahrayana
deities which bear little relation  to the text. During the early
medieval period, Prajnaparamita, the personification of wisdom,
became one of the most popular deities in Nepal. Manuscripts consecrated
to this deity were repeatedly copied. Besides these Buddhist manuscripts,
of Hindu divinities such as Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Kartikeya and
Ganesh were also frequently represented.
<P>
Manuscripts continued  to be painted and copied for centuries,
 for the act of donating a manuscript to a monk, priest, monastery
or temple was considered by both Hindus and Buddhists to be an
act of great virtue. Early illustrated manuscripts were  executed
in the same basic style, but later examples, particularly paper
manuscripts, clearly show signs of deterioration in quality.
<P>
<B>Thangka and Paubha Painting</B>
<P>
Religious paintings worshipped as icons are known as paubha in
Newari and thangka in Tibetan. The origin of paubha or thangka
paintings may be attributed to Nepalese artists as early as the
ninth or tenth century.
<P>
Realizing the great demand for religious icons in Tibet, these
artists, along with monks and traders, took with them from Nepal
not only metal sculptures but also a number of Buddhist manuscripts.
To better fulfill the ever-increasing demand, Nepalese artists
initiated a new type of religious painting on cloth that could
be easily rolled up and carried along with them. This type of
painting became very popular both in Nepal and Tibet and has remained
popular to this day. One of the earliest specimens of Nepalese
thangka painting dates from the  thirteenth or fourteenth century
and shows Amitabha surrounded by Bodhisattvas. Another Nepalese
thangka with three dates in the inscription (the latest one corresponding
to A.D. 1369), is one of the earliest known thangkas with inscriptions.
The 'Mandala of Vishnu', dated A.D. 1420, is another  fine example
of the painting of this period. Early Nepalese thangkas are simple
in design and composition. The main deity, a large figure, occupies
the central position while surrounded by smaller  figures.
<P>
<B>Influence of Tantrism on Paintings</B>
<P>
From the fifteenth century onwards, brighter colors gradually
began to appear in the Nepalese thangka. Because of the growing
importance of the Tantric cult, various aspects of Shiva and Shakti
were painted in conventional poses. Mahakala, Manjushri, Lokeshwara
and other deities were  equally popular and  were also frequently
represented in thangka paintings of later dates. The embrace of
male and female is another common motif of the Trantric Buddhist
art of this period.
<P>
<B>Sculpture</B>
<P>
An art form that traces Nepalese culture from its early beginnings
right up to modern times is sculpture. As previously mentioned,
many carved artifacts have been found in the Terai region of the
country, providing an insight into the religion and culture of
early times. As with painting, nearly all Nepalese sculptures
are of a religious character. It seems that the artists themselves
were greatly imbued with a feeling of religious devotion.
<P>
<B>The Golden Age of Nepalese Sculpture</B>
<P>
Nepalese sculpture reached its zenith in the Lichchhavi period
(A. D. 330-879).Stone, copper and bronze images from this period
show  round faces with slated eyes. A distinguishing feature of
Lichchhave sculptures is their simplicity. The use of clothes
and ornaments was quite restrained: many Hindu deities, for example,
are shown wearing only a dhoti ( skirt-like lower garment). Buddhist
deities were carved to show them wearing long sanghatis (a saffron-coloured
robe that the Buddhist wear hanging from the shoulders). Lichchhave
period sculptors most often used basalt for their work, first
chiselling and then smoothing and varnishing, perhaps with iron
dust. The limbs of Lichchhavi period idols were so beautifully
executed that it is not possible to find one specimen with a chisel
 mark. Some of the best examples of Lichchhavi art are the images
of 'Sleeping Vishnu' in Budhanilkantha, located eight kilometers
north of Kathmandu; and the Vishnu Vikranta, or Dwarf Incarnating,
found near Lazimpat in Kathmandu.
<P>
<B>Woodcarving</B>
<P>
Besides stone sculpture another art form worth mentioning is woodcarving.
No visitor to  the Kathmandu Valley can fail to be impressed by
the numerous extremely beautiful windows, doors, temple roof-struts
and other intricately carved artifacts. As wood is vulnerable
to the ravages of time, w ell-preserved specimens date back only
to the fourteenth  century. Woodcarving has been an integral part
of Nepalese architecture, some of the best examples being the
old royal palaces of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur and a number
of different Viharas (monasteries) around the Valley.
