There are a number of shops in Kathmandu which rent mountain bikes
and a number of agencies which take out biking tours all the year
around. Mountain biking is a fascinating way to travel the byways
of the Valley, visiting little-known villages, sacred groves and
out-of-the-way temples. Tours may go out for just the day, or
may spend two or three days, staying at the scenic viewspots of
Dhulikhel or Nagarkot. Longer tours go from kathmandu all the
way to the southern Terai region and Royal Chitwan National Park.
Groups with experience bikers can even fly up to Lhasa, Tibet,
and mountain bike all the way back to Kathmandu.
