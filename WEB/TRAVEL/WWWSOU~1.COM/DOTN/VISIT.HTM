<p><b><i>APPEAL </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>To trekkers and nature lovers</i></b> </p>
<p>Visit Nepal '98 requests you to observe the following trekking rules: </p>
<ul>
<li>In your trek, you will come in contact with many village schools. Please communicate your 
conservation ideas, knowledge and experience with the local school teachers so that a 
multiplier effect of conservation message could be radiated to all the children. If possible, 
please also try to make the children know how to respect nature and natural resources. </li>
<li>Never encourage children to beg. It might give you momentary satisfaction but the begging 
child could also turn a professional begger tomorrow ! </li>
<li>Try to be friendly with your porters and guides. You will enjoy your trip more. </li>
<li>While taking photographs be sure that you are not intruding onto public privacy. </li>
<li>Respect the villagers and their traditions. In turn they will give you warm hospitality. </li>
<li>When you trek, ultimately, you enter wilderness. There, you are alone with your porters and 
the fragile nature. The slightest negligence and misunderstanding on your part can directly 
have a jarring cumulative impact on the delicate balance of nature. Please do not spoil this 
natural heritage by thoughtless negligence. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Carry enough kerosene or fuel for your cooking. Never buy fuel wood from the 
villagers: It will encourage villagers to cut down more trees and stock them 
unnecessarily. </li>
<li>We discourage the use of camp-fires. If you really need one, you can ask your porters 
to collect dead branches and twigs from the ground. Be sure the fire is out and the 
refuse is buried before leaving the camp-site. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never buy any wilflife trophies animal products from the local poachers. <ul>
<li>Do not collect any wild flowers, plants, fossils, orchids, rocks etc., unless you have the 
permission from the concerned office for scientific research. </li>
<li>Cutting trees, shooting wildlife and fishing without licences is strictly prohibited. </li>
<li>Always camp at the prescribed sites. If there is no arrangement as such, then camp on 
open ground or on the bank of a river. Do not camp inside a bush cutting away 
branches of trees. </li>
<li>Never pollute the clear mountain water or litter the path with cigarette butts, tin cans, 
toilet papers, etc, Please bury them. </li>
<li>Do not mark initials on trees and rocks. Nature is more beautiful when left undefiled by 
human hands. </li>
<li>In some areas, local communities have established their own conservation practices. 
Please make an effort to understand them and to observe them. </li>
<li>Finally, we sincerely request you to enlighten your porters, sherpas, guides, villagers to 
respect nature and how to conserve it. With your help, our natural beauty will be alive 
for generations. In turn, Nepal's gift to you will be vibrant living memories. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><b><i>A Visitor's Guide</i></b> <b><i>to Sacred Sites</i></b> </p>
<p><b>Namaste and Welcome to Nepal</b> </p>
<p>The serenity and grandeur of the rich culture and natural heritage attract many visitors like you to 
Nepal every day. The cultural heritage of Nepal is a living entity. Many religious shrines are in daily 
use and their potency is realized through the veneration expected ofthe believers and the visitors. </p>
<p>Though Buddhist and Hindu traditions differ in their religious practices, Nepal has had such a long 
history of harmonious syncriestic development of both the traditions alongside each other that many 
Hindus revere and visit Buddhist shrines just as many Buddhists revere and visit Hindu shrines. You 
are welcome to visit all our shrines. By following some guidelines you can be a helpful visitor in our 
time honoured way of life. These, we believe, can make your visit more pleasant and meaningful to 
you as well as to us. </p>
<ul>
<li>Entry to most temples, stupas and shrines is not restricted. However, some sensitive religious 
enclosures and sites may prohibit entry. Signboards are displayed. </li>
<li>If you wish to enter a shrine, where allowed, you may go around in a clockwise direction. 
We believe in putting our Gods to our right when circumambulating the shrine. </li>
<li>The front side of the shrines are usually marked by a lotus carved stone on the pavement or a 
slightly recessed square pit. The image of the carrier of the diety or symbol may be seen on 
the pedestal in front. These define the territoriality of the shrine. Reverence to these elements 
will put you in a proper perspective. </li>
<li>Photography is generally not prohibited. However there are some facades or images where 
photography is restricted. Watch for these or ask the guards. If you wish to be more 
considerate, do not use flashlight inside the shrines when someone is worshipping. </li>
<li>Do not take any photograph of someone performing his ritual withoug a prior permission. </li>
<li>Nepal's attitude towards religion is very tolerant one, and many different religions flourish and 
mingle here. </li>
<li>Leather products, such as leather belts, jackets, shoes and bags, are prohibited in most 
religious places. Please leave them outside. Your friend or the watchman will take care of 
these while you are inside. </li>
<li>We advise you not to touch offerings or persons when they are on the way to shrines or are 
in the process of worshipping. Keep a respectful distance. </li>
<li>Apart from worshipping of the image, many sensitive rituals are also practised by the 
believers around the shrines. These may be related to festive occasions or sombre situations. 
By carefully watching the behavious of local onlookers, you can your self behave sensitively 
and not be an encroachment. </li>
<li>If you have meat in your lunch pack, we advise you to eat at some distance from the shrine 
precincts. Some of our Gods do not permit animal sacrifices! </li>
<li>Do not encourage beggars or roaming artefacts' vendors around the shrines by giving money 
or bargaining as you walk. </li>
<li>Please do not accept as gifts or buy objects of art, manuscripts, images etc. Which have 
antique value. These need to stay here not only for ourselves but for future visitors like 
yourself who would like to share the experience. Whether something is antique or not can be 
established by the Department of Archaeology. </li>
<li>In respect to our sacred sites, appropriate attire is requested. Your body should be 
adequately covere. </li>
