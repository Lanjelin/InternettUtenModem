A day trek to Panauti, an ancient riverside town via Namo 
Buddha Stupa or to Palanchowk Bhagawati is very popular 
among our guests. A trip to the Tibetan border or to the hot 
Sulphur Spring at Tatopani (80 km) by car is also 
rewanding.<IMG SRC="6.JPG" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/Dhulikhel/6.jpg" width=123 height=126 border=1 align=left>
 Tafting along the Bhotekoshi river (down the 
valley) that originates from Tibet is quite adventurous. A 
full day excursion to Jiri (170 km) - the starting point of the 
Everest trek or up to Charikot (120 km) only on the Jiri 
road is most spectacular for its beautiful landscape and 
Himalayan Ranges. It is quite interesting to take these 
excursions. All these services can be acquired from the 
resort. Please contact at the reception for information.<P>
