Dhulikhel Resort is situated 30 km east of Kathmandu in a 
small town famous for its scenic beauty and old traditions. 
As you drive along the Arniko Highway heading you are 
rewarded with a sight so spectacular that even and artist 
would struggle to convey its real beauty. Once you are in 
your room, you can relax and enjoy the full extent of the 
scenery.<P>

The Resort is located at the top of a valley some 1525 m 
(5000 ft) above sea level. You can admire the ingenuity of 
the rice terraces lining the valley with a vast range of 
greens and browns. Beyond, lies the majestic range of 
white Himalayan Peaks. At day break the horizon is 
transformed into a magnificent panorama  bathed in 
exquisite colours from Langtang in the northwest to Mt. 
Karyolung in the far east.<P>
