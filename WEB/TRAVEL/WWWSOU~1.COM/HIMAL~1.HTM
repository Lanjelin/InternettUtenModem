<h1 align=center>South Asia's Very First Magazine</h1>
<p>This region of 1.3 billion people - stretching in an arc from Afghanistan to Burma - needs a 
common voice, even to listen to itself. Southern Asia is a zone of great cultures, varied geography 
and historical affinity. Yet, neighbours barely talk to each o ther. </p>
<p>Petty nationalism and short-term geopolitics have kept South Asians apart and hindered progress. 
By highlighting rifts, an insular press has reinforced prejudice. </p>
<p>South Asia falls in the media blind spot between international newsweeklies and Hong Kong-based 
magazines preoccupied with Pacific Asia. </p>
<h3 align=center>South Asians need their own magazine. They need it now.</h3>

</td><td>Himal South Asia - the new, independent, world-class magazine for South 
Asians. A monthly that spots trends and offers analyses from a 
non-nationalist, regionwide perspective. It tells Pakistanis about India, 
Indians about Bangladesh, Bangladeshis about Sri Lanka, and the rest of 
the world about this long-neglected region. <p>HSA raises issues long before they make headlines. Each monthly issue of 
HSA offers dispatches and commentaries from correspondents all over 
South Asia and overseas. There is no other way to keep in touch with this 
large and diverse region. </p>
<p>Going well beyond day-to-day journalism, HSA offers tough investigative 
reporting, presents informed opinion of cross-border cultural and social 
movements, and reviews books, the arts and satellite programming. </p>
<p>As a voice for a region that has remained dormant for much too long, HSA 
is a magazine whose time has arrived. </p>
