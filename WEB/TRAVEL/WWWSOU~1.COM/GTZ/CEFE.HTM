</strong></font><font size=5><strong>THE CEFE APPROACH</strong></font></h3>
<p>SBPP has been able to initiate a global movement in small business creation. The CEFE approach 
of GTZ, with an NBC core, is now been implemented in over 70 countries. The approach was 
developed, tested, and adapted through SBPP experiences since 1983. Average start up rates of 
2,300 trainees of the program show 53% success. One NBC package for 20 persons results in ten 
new enterprises, 70 new jobs, and US $70,000 in investment. A version of the following article 
appeared in the Vol. 6 No. 2 June issue of <i>Small Enterprise Development</i>, Cranfield Institute of 
Management, regarding the CEFE approach. </p>
<p>Competency-based Economies Through Formation of Entrepreneurs (CEFE) is a GTZ program 
that has been operating world-wide since 1988, especially in developing countries. In August 1993, 
BMZ (German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development) initiated a year-long 
evaluation study of the program's effectiveness. The report appeared in December 1994. The 
evaluation team, made up of four independent human resources experts, visited well-established 
programs in five countries: Vietnam, Philippines, Chile, Kenya, and Brazil. CEFE activities in other 
countries were evaluated through the appraisal of mission reports, project status reports, and 
interviews with personnel.</p>
<h4>POSSIBLE WAYS OF IMPROVING CEFE (NBC)	</h4>
<ul>
<li>Greater impact and reduction of cost could be achieved through: </li>
<li>expansion of CEFE programs to rural and marginalized regions </li>
<li>more cooperation with efficient local institutions </li>
<li>setting up and strengthening of network structures between local institutions </li>
<li>reduction of spending on trainers, materials, and organization </li>
<li>an increase in course fees </li>
<li>and a more cost-efficient system of carrying out business environment </li>
<li>studies, monitoring, evaluation, and impact analysis. </li>
</ul>
<p>CEFE is defined by program managers as a &quot;comprehensive set of training instruments designed to 
stimulate small and medium enterprise development through the use of ex- perimental learning 
methods. Its focus is to enhance competence and potential of entre- preneurs. It helps them 
improve business performance.&quot; </p>
<p>Over the last six years, CEFE's international programs have involved more than 2,000 participants 
in 70 countries. Evaluators find that 30 to 50 percent start new enterprises. Based on a sample of 
156 CEFE graduates, the confirmed rate of those starting up busi- nesses after participating in the 
program is 38%. As a number of trainees are still in the process of setting up business, the success 
rate could eventually reach 45%. CEFE training also shows a strong impact on working 
entrepreneurs: evaluation showed that 80% of the participants achieved an income increase 
between 20 and 50%. 60% were able to boost the number of their employees. In general, 
evaluators considered that a five year &quot;incubation&quot; period should elapse before making any 
significant assessment of the overall impact. </p>
<p>The evaluation report claims that CEFE did not introduce local adaptations of the concept: a 
standardized package was used for different cultures and values. If adaptations were made, they 
were a result of the efforts of local partner institutions. </p>
<p>Evaluators emphasized on the selection of local partner organizations because &quot;the success of 
training programs largely depends on them.&quot; Considering benefit aspects, the selection of 
organizations should be the main priority before starting CEFE programs. Evaluators define efficient 
partner organizations as those with vision, motivated and professional staff, specialization, 
management capacities, transparent and decentralized decision-making processes, productive and 
innovative staff, resource potential, and a good networking with other institutions. </p>
