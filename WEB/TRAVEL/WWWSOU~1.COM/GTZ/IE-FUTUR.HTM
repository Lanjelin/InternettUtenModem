Future Possibilities</b> </font></font></p>
<p>Given the will to establish such an Institute among the various stakeholders including the 
Parliament and the Council of Ministers, hopes are running high that the IEDI will have a 
considerable positive impact on the industrial development efforts of the country. It may be 
necessary here to have a look at the potentials which exist given the establishment of the IEDI 
taking into account the process of enactment and related developments in the environment. </p>
<p><b><i>A Resource Centre for Industrial Development</i></b> </p>
<p>A role that could be played by the new Institute would be to act as a resource centre on 
industrial development. It could provide the government with the required information to take 
effective policy decisions, formulate alternative strategies that could be followed and give 
advice to the private sector and donor agencies interested in supporting this sector. </p>
<p><b><i>An Umbrella for Support Organizations</i></b> </p>
<p>The Institute may also fulfil the role of an umbrella under which various organizations and 
projects in the field of industrial development could reside. This will ensure a better sharing of 
experiences and information and provide the numerous support organizations with a shared 
vision and help formulate strategies to realize it. It would also contribute a lot towards reducing 
duplication and overlapping of development efforts in the field. The fact that centres and 
projects under this umbrella would retain their autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis the Institute would ensure 
that the constituent organizations function in a flexible and professional way. </p>
<p><b><i>A Medium for Decentralized Industrial Development</i></b> </p>
<p>The Institute, in addition to the power to establish various centres and projects to promote 
various aspects of industrial development, also has the authority to form governing boards for 
these centres. This is a potent instrument that can be used for localized industrial development. 
In addition to having the national level actors on board, it is essential that the importance and 
ownership of the services are taken at the local level. Industrial Development Centres could be 
formed in municipalities with the governing board consisting of local business people, 
representatives of the municipality, promotional offices, local chambers and other stakeholders. 
Given the imminent announcement of the decentralization policy and forthcoming act which 
devolves power to the grassroots these local centres could play a leading role there. </p>
<p><b><i>A Common Forum for Industrial Development</i></b> </p>
<p>The Institute as an autonomous body not aligned with any sector or interest can play the vital 
role of providing a forum for discussions and debates related to industrial development. The 
human and institutional resources at its disposal would also ensure that technical and 
professional inputs would be given to any such discussions. </p>
