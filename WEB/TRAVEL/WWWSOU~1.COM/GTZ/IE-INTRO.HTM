<p align=left><b>Introduction</b> </p>
<p align=left>His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, granted royal assent to a bill to establish the 
Industrial Enterprise Development Institute, on 4 November 1996, after its approval by both 
Houses of Parliament. This was the culmination of a near decade long series of parallel efforts 
to institutionalize the programmes and activities of the Nepal-German Small Business 
Promotion Project on the one hand; and to rationalize the support structure for cottage and 
small enterprise promotion in the country on the other. </p>
<p align=left><b>Institutionalizing the Small Business Promotion Project</b> </p>
<p>The Small Business Promotion Project (SBPP) emerged as an independent programme from 
the Nepal-German Bhaktapur Development Project in 1983. It was jointly implemented by the 
Ministry of Industry on behalf of the Nepalese Government and the Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Technische 
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) - the German Agency for Technical Cooperation - on behalf of the 
German government. </p>
<p>The SBPP's target group consisted of existing and potential micro, cottage and small 
entrepreneurs from all areas of manufacturing, processing and service oriented businesses; 
including tourism, agro-based industries and commerce. The innovative activities focused on 
continuous development, testing and dissemination of an integrated package consisting of new 
business creation and management trainings, small business consultancy and linkage services. 
The approach pioneered and developed in Nepal, due to its positive impact, is being marketed 
abroad by GTZ under the brand name of CEFE (Creation of Enterprises, Formation of 
Entrepreneurs) in over 70 countries in Asia, Africa and South America. </p>
<p>Taking note of the achievements of the SBPP and the need to multiply the impact of the 
approach, HMG of Nepal and the Government of FRG decided to institutionalize the project 
as a permanent and autonomous institution. Along these lines HMG of Nepal by a decision of 
the Council of Ministers, approved the formation of the Industrial Enterprise Development 
Centre (IEDC) in May 1995 under the Development Committee Act 1956. A notice to this 
effect was published in the Rajpatra - the government gazette - on 3 July 1995 whereupon the 
organization came into being. The staff, assets as well as the programmes, activities and 
methodologies of the former SBPP were transferred to the new centre. </p>
<p><b>Rationalizing the Support Structure for Cottage and Small Industries</b> </p>
<p>Looking at the promotional organizations, various organizations had been providing technical 
and consultancy services in the field of technical (skill oriented), entrepreneurship and 
management development for the promotion of the cottage and small enterprise sector. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, the SBPP had developed several approaches towards introducing 
effective methods of micro, cottage and small enterprise development. It not only offered such 
services to potential and existing entrepreneurs, but also through other institutions and projects 
based on local needs in many areas. SBPP designed promotional systems and pilot 
programmes for them, trained their staff, cooperated in strengthening such service delivery 
institutions and followed up to ascertain the results. Furthermore, SBPP carried out action 
research to develop replicable models of business promotion for rural areas and special target 
groups. </p>
<p>The agencies at the forefront of delivering training and support services to the target group are 
the Department of Cottage and Small Industries and the Cottage and Small Industries 
Development Board. They at present function in 27 and 48 districts respectively and possess 
considerable organizational infrastructure and human resources. Their full potential had not 
been utilized due to the absence of an institution to develop and test new approaches to 
entrepreneurship and management development based on the identification of needs and on 
demand. </p>
<p>In addition, skills development programmes have been imparted by the Department of Cottage 
and Small Industries; and there specifically by the Training for Rural Gainful Employment 
Project (TRUGA) now succeeded by TRE - Training for Rural Employment Project. Such 
programmes are also delivered by the Cottage and Small Industries Development Board and 
the Skills Training Centres of the Ministry of Labour. Although the present programmes are 
being conducted as expected, their trainings are not fully effective for various reasons. Among 
them, the main reasons are the inability to vary subjects according to demand and potential and 
the absence of entrepreneurship and management inputs into the process. </p>
<p align=left><b>Some Achievements of Support to the Cottage and Small Enterprise Sector</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Programmes in the field of entrepreneurship development and small business 
development have been developed and implemented in Nepal since the last decade. 
Due to its effectiveness, the developed &quot;enterprise development programme&quot; is well 
known in Nepal and abroad. </li>
<li>The ability to transfer entrepreneurship and enterprise development and training skills, 
according to the needs of the target groups and partner institutions, to various institutions 
involved in the sector has been developed. </li>
<li>Action research has already been conducted to develop easily replicable and sustainable 
entrepreneurship and management development packages especially for the rural areas. </li>
<li>As a result of small business development training and various consultancy services the 
country has been assisted in business development and new employment creation. </li>
<li>An effective model of skills training has been developed and implemented. Furthermore, 
the method is low cost and easily replicable. </li>
<li>Able and committed professionals who contribute to technical, entrepreneurship and 
management development have been developed. </li>
<li>The trust of small business people has been gained because the successful programmes 
are being formulated and implemented on the basis that others can only carry out 
detailed studies, obtain information and suggest ways of improvement and not act for the 
business person (no spoon feeding). </li>
<li>According to the objectives of HMG and donor agencies the target group has been 
directly involved in various phases of programme planning and implementation. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Rationale for the Centre</b> </p>
<p>Although numerous achievements had been made, there were also future opportunities that 
were identified. For instance, the successful approaches researched and piloted by SBPP had 
not been replicated nation-wide, the delivery capability of the CSIDB and the DCSI had not 
been fully used and skills development programmes were missing an entrepreneurial input. </p>
<p>It is here that the two aims of institutionalizing the Small Business Promotion Project and 
rationalizing the support structure for cottage and small industries came together. The Industrial 
Enterprise Development Centre was envisaged as an institution to enhance the capability of 
service delivery institutions in the small enterprise sector so as to provide quality services to the 
cottage and small industries in Nepal based on approaches created and applied by SBPP. It 
would develop and facilitate the provision of integrated services through service delivery 
institutions such as the Department of Cottage and Small Industry, the Cottage and Small 
Industry Development Board, local government, chambers, associations and NGOs. To 
ensure the participation of various actors and their ownership of the new institution, the 
governing board of IEDC was evenly divided between the private and public sector. </p>
<p>The fact that the new Centre would still require some support during its formative period led to 
the continuation of German support through GTZ on a project basis. The SBPP represents 
here the final phase of German support to the IEDC. Although the name of SBPP still remains, 
its tasks have undergone large changes. From a project that used to implement programmes 
itself with the target group, the Project now plays the role of supporting the institutional 
development of IEDC. It will provide the necessary technical advisory support, consultancies, 
equipment and staff development programmes for the effective functioning of the IEDC. In 
addition, it will grant orders for programmes to be carried out by the IEDC as another donor. 
Both steps have the aim of preparing the IEDC for sustainability once the SBPP ends in 1999. </p>
<p><b>From the Centre to the Institute</b> </p>
<p>As mentioned above, the formation of the IEDC was brought about by two parallel 
developments. On the one hand, it provided a means to institutionalize the human resources 
and methodologies of the SBPP; and on the other, it found itself in the role of acting as a 
resource centre for both governmental and non-governmental service delivery organizations. 
However, the momentum of change was continuing. Due to various reasons, positioning the 
IEDC under the Development Board Act was not seen to be the optimal situation. </p>
<p>Legally speaking the Board Act usually provides for temporary organizations of the 
government. In addition, any changes, including its dissolution, can be made by a decision of 
the Council of Ministers and a notification in the gazette. Personnel and financial rules are also 
more closely aligned with government regulations. In other words the autonomy essential for 
effective functioning was not fully guaranteed. </p>
<p>On the operational side, the working area of the IEDC was more confined than that which the 
rationalization of the support structures would demand, taking this process to its logical 
conclusion. What was required was a truly autonomous institution which could act as a 
resource centre and an umbrella organization at the same time for different support services for 
entrepreneurs and enterprises. This idea of the umbrella organization would ensure total 
autonomy of the support services as well as coordination and communication at the policy 
level. It would in fact function as a think-tank for the government on matters related to the 
industrial sector. </p>
<p>A further development was the setting up of new centres and projects by the government in the 
periphery of the IEDC to deal with different aspects of industrial development. The 
Technology Park Project (TPP) was set up to promote software development and computer 
know-how in Nepal. It will be establishing an information technology park for both domestic 
and international firms to manufacture and programme computer software and hardware. 
Similarly, the Technology Transfer and Development Centre (TTDC) was set up to develop 
and disseminate appropriate technology as well as technical skills. Due to the absence of an 
umbrella organization, both these organizations were set up as autonomous bodies, with their 
own budgets, but under the direction of the Executive Director of the IEDC. The problem of 
coordination was self-evident and would have continued as long as IEDC was a board. </p>
<p>With these facts in mind, the Ministry of Industry and the IEDC initiated steps to present a bill 
in parliament which would provide for the establishment of the Industrial Enterprise 
Development Institute. The objective and rationale of the bill as presented in Parliament in 
November 1995 by the Hon. Minister for Industry, Mr. Dhundi Raj Shastri read as follows: </p>
<p><i>&quot;With a view to achieving the all round economic progress of the nation through the 
medium of industrial development, it is imperative that the required entrepreneurship, 
quality management, technology transfer, technical information and technical human 
resources essential for the development infrastructure be provided to the entrepreneur 
from one location and such services should be increased and improved.&quot;</i> </p>
<p>This Bill was passed by the House of Representatives in January 1996 and the National 
Assembly in June 1996. It was enacted after HM King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah granted 
royal assent on 4 November 1996. </p>
