<p>The IEDI has been established under a special act of Parliament and this arrangement gives the 
institution the maximum possible autonomy and flexibility as well as permanence. The power to 
form personnel and financial rules has been given to the Institute for flexibility and autonomy. 
The provision of a special act also gives the institution a higher profile as this instrument is used 
to establish institutions which have a vital role to play in national development (e.g. NIDC, 
ADB/N, RNAC etc.) on a long term basis. The enactment procedure which involves 
discussions on a clause wise basis in both houses of Parliament ensures that national consensus 
has been reached on the need and importance of the Institute. </p>
