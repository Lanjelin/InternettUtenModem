INTRODUCTION</strong></font></font></p>
<p>Every year, more than three hundred thousand people seek employment opportunities in Nepal. 
Many of them are involved in agricultural activities already, 80% of the Nepalese people depend on 
farming and livestock cultivation, but look to supplement their incomes. They seek jobs in 
government organizations, non-government development organizations, manufacturing enterprises, 
schools, travel and trekking agencies, etc. </p>
<p>However, there are not enough jobs in the county to fulfill the needs of every Nepalese and provide 
him or her with economic and social security. Therefore, the need for an or ganization that can help 
strengthen the national economy by creating more enterprises and jobs is intense. In order to partly 
satisfy this need, His Majesty's Government (HMG) introduced Bhaktapur Development Project's 
Economic Promotion Unit (BDP-EPC) in the 1980s with the objective of developing new 
approaches to enterprise creation and promotion. </p>
<p>As the unit performed excellently, the need for further development and promotion of small-scale 
businesses increased and, seeing the successful approaches adopted by BDP- EPU to promote 
new enterprises in Nepal, Ministry of Finance, HMG, and Federal Ministry of Economic 
Cooperation (BMZ), Germany, considered the creation of a project that would promote small 
businesses in Nepal. After bilateral negotiations and stud- ies, a decision was made and in October 
1983 the Small Business Promotion Project (SBPP) was formed.</p>
<p>The goals and intentions of SBPP were outlined in advance and its contributions were to be 
significant. SBPP would work to promote and increase the number of independent 
micro-enterprises in the country through human resource development and proper utilization of raw 
materials. Since micro-enterprises play a major role in increasing per capita income and the GDP of 
Nepal, thousands of individuals would develop skills and contribute to the country's national growth 
by providing employment opportunities for others. (Recent studies show that Nepalese small and 
cottage industries account for 7.=% of GDP, 66% of exports, 85% of industrial employment, and 
represent 95% of the total number of industrial units). Special focus would be on the country's less 
developed regions. With the growth of small businesses, migration to urban areas would decrease 
and a sounder distribution of economic resources would be assured. Since lack of data on 
micro-businesses registered with the Ministry of Industry had made evaluation of their 
performances difficult, SBPP would organize research programs according to the needs of 
entrepreneurs and the market situation. Based on this information, it would evaluate the 
performances of small businesses and give constructive feedback to develop better marketing 
strategies and technical and management knowledge and skills. With a staff structure that could 
conduct surveys on district potential, it could encourage enterprise development through useful 
guidance and concretely contribute to a better growth and sustainability of enterprises in Nepal.</p>
<p>SBPP management was to be overseen by a project manager deputed by the Ministry of Industry 
and an advisory team from GTZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH, 
the German development agency) would also be a part of the decision-making process. So began 
the first phase of decade-long contribution of Small Business Promotion Project.</p>
<p align=center><font color="#CA6500"><font size=4><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></font></font></p>
<p>During <b><i>Phase I,</i></b> October 1983 to August 1986, SBPP opened its head office in Kathmandu. It 
deputed personnel from well-established organizations and created five branch offices in 
Bhaktapur, Butwal, Bhairawa, Dharan, and Pokhara. These offices worked on four main topics: 
New Business Creation, Small Business Consultancy, Complementary Credit, and Ceramics 
Promotion. Ceramics Promotion became, in 1986, an independent project called the Ceramics 
Promotion Project. During these years, SBPP worked to create able staff and to improve upon its 
services so they would best benefit the entrepreneur. Establishing a revolving fund in Agricultural 
Development Bank (ADB) helped entrepreneurs start or expand their enterprises. Since ADB is 
among the most wide-spread banks of Nepal, the credit is disbursed to rural areas: 80% of SBPP's 
focus. </p>
<p><b><i>Phase II</i></b><i>,</i> August 1986 to August 1989, saw the establishment of two more branch offices in 
Nepalgunj and Narayanghat. Technical Advisory Service and Research, Design, and Testing were 
added to the four core topics that the project highlighted. Linkages with other organizations and 
institutions engaged in similar activities were strengthened and while interacting with them, a new 
sector &quot;Services to Institutions&quot; was formed. </p>
<p>By the time SBPP reached<b><i> Phase III</i></b>, August 1989 to August 1992, many trainers prepared by 
the project were working to promote the small businessperson and to improve his/her management 
skills. Experience showed that the New Business Creation (NBC) approach worked well for target 
groups that had little education. The project, in joint collaboration with the Canadian Center for 
International Studies and Cooperation (CECI) started the Micro Enterprise Creation and 
Development Program to deliver the NBC package to the rural poor via local NGOs. At this time, 
the project's focus was to encourage Nepalese women to enter the business field. SBPP conducted 
three NBCs exclusively for women and formed an alliance with Developing Women 
Entrepreneurship in Tourism to facilitate this work.</p>

<p><b><i>Phase IV</i></b>, August 1992 to August 1995, brought internal changes in SBPP. The focus was 
towards institutionalization. As long as SBPP remained a project, sustainability was not guaranteed. 
It was important, however, that the work being carried out by the project should be continued or 
even expanded by a more permanent institution. In order to assure a longer life to SBPP, a branch 
office was established in Kathmandu in mid-1992 and a Planning and Business Information Division 
was set up. Project decision-makers hoped to establish the organization as an autonomous 
non-profit institution working for the betterment of the small entrepreneur. The project constructed 
its main office in autumn 1994 and, by this time, possessed a significant amount of property that 
could be handed over to a more permanent organization. In view of its impending 
institutionalization, a greater focus was put into making the project self- reliant. A higher proportion 
of its operating costs were realized through training and services as demanded by the market.</p>
<p><b><i>Phase V</i></b>, SBPP was institutionalized on July 3, 1995. The institution now has firm legal status and 
its main body is called Industrial Enterprise Development Center (IEDC). SBPP is now a joint 
project of IEDC and GTZ and the staff and the property have been passed on to the center. An 
executive board representing the Secretary of Ministry of Industry, Representative of Ministry of 
Finance, President of FNCCI, President of ANSCI, and Executive Director of IEDC has been 
formed. GTZ will continue to support its development efforts and His Majesty's Government will 
also grant full support. In this way, continuity of services to future and existing entrepreneurs has 
been assured. See the IEDC profile on the internet for more information.</p>
