INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
<p>GTZ-Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Techni-sche Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH, German Technical 
Cooperation, with its Head Office in Eschborn, Germany, was established in 1974. The company 
is owned by the German Federal Government and its mandate is to undertake specialist planning 
and implementation of technical cooperation measures with partner countries. </p>
<p>GTZ is a service organization with the legal status of a private limited company (GmbH) under 
German law, the Federal Republic of Germany being the sole shareholder. In line with its Articles 
Association, the GTZ undertakes commissions from the German Federal Government, partner 
country governments and also from international financing institutions and clients involved in 
cooperation for development. </p>

<h3><font color="#623100">OBJECTIVE</font></h3>
<p>German Technical Cooperation serves the prime goal of improving people's livelihood basis and 
stabilizing the earth's natural carrying capacity. GTZ's corporate mission is to assist economics and 
people in mobilizing knowledge and skills, in strengthening people's self-help capacities, and 
establishing the general economic and social conditions they need to create an environment 
conducive to progress. The core aim of support is to help raise people's own capacity for initiative 
and self-help. </p>
<h3><font color="#623100">ORGANIZATION</font></h3>
<p>The activities implemented to support the partner's projects combine sectoral expertise available in 
Germany and other countries abroad and in the region with traditional local know-how and 
experience, to obtain an optimal solution to country and region-specific problems. More than 170 
in-house sector specialists in over 40 specific sector areas join with about 1600 field staff 
expatriates, some 5000 locally employed staff and numerous local consultants and consultancy 
companies in about 135 countries to form a high-performance pool of professionals and 
management staff with global experience. This ensures that project assistance is appropriate to the 
social and economic frame-work in the given country. </p>
<h3><font color="#623100">PARTNERS</font></h3>
<p>GTZ sees itself as one link in a chain of partnership, made up of clients and funding organizations, 
project-country implementing organizations, other cooperating institutions, and suppliers. These 
partners often have different interests. GTZ is committed to making </p>
<p>the interests transparent and combining them into a viable compromise in each case. Commonly 
defined goals and full participation of all affected and involved people and institutions are major 
elements for success. </p>
<p>GTZ is closely cooperating with the Credit Bank for Reconstruction (KfW) in Frankfurt/Main, who 
is commissioned by the German Federal Government to plan and implement projects of financial 
cooperation (loans and grants). The German Development Service (DED) is another important 
cooperation partner of GTZ. </p>
<h3><font color="#623100">OPERATION</font></h3>
<p>In Nepal GTZ can look back on more than twenty years experience in planning and executing 
Technical Cooperation projects and programs on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany, 
jointly with Nepalese partners. Measures have been implemented in numerous sectors in the past 
including agriculture, livestock, forestry, energy, industry, infrastructure, health, education, and 
apprenticeship training. </p>
<p>Given the high rate of poverty, the magnitude of economic, social, and ecological problems facing 
Nepal now, the main agenda of German Technical Cooperation with His Majesty's Government is 
poverty alleviation, thereby focusing joint efforts on: </p>
<ul>
<li>rural development, agriculture and community forestry </li>
<li>urban development </li>
<li>health care </li>
<li>private economic sector development </li>
</ul>
<p>The various projects and programs, ongoing and under preparation, are listed in the sectoral 
overview as shown in the chart behind. Major emphasis and criteria of support is given to: </p>
<ul>
<li>raise the capacity for self-help and initiative of the people involved, the beneficiaries </li>
<li>strengthen the capabilities and capacities of implementing agencies </li>
<li>improve the conditions and chances especially for women to get better access to and control 
over the resources and services, finally striving for gender equity and </li>
<li>protect the environment and use natural resources in a sustainable manner. </li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed information about the various projects can be received from the GTZ-Office or the GTZ 
project support units. For financial cooperation, FRG is commissioning KfW. There is close 
cooperation between KfW and GTZ in the Town Development Fund. In the field of Primary Health 
Care, a joint appraisal of KfW and GTZ is planned regarding possible collaboration. </p>
<h3><font color="#623100">GTZ-OFFICE IN NEPAL</font></h3>
<p>The GTZ-Office in Nepal is assigned by the GTZ-Head office to function as liaison to the German 
Embassy, to the various Nepalese partner institutions, and to the international bilateral and 
multilateral donor community. It is supporting the preparation of new projects, assists the ongoing 
projects in financial, administrative and logistic matters, manages the implementation of projects 
(German contribution) without GTZ-team leader and facilitates the networking amongst the 
GTZ-supported projects in Nepal. In order to keep the inputs for the projects economical and to 
promote the project outputs and objectives to become viable, the GTZ-Office is fostering one of 
the major objectives of technical cooperation that local resources and know-how are used by the 
project management to the best extent. Further details on GTZ can be received from the 
GTZ-Office in Nepal. </p>
