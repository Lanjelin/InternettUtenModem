<p><img src="IEDC2.JPG" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/gtz/iedc2.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=0 width=188 height=124>Today, IEDC is represented by a committee formed by the 
Secretary of Ministry of Industry (Chairman), Representative of 
Ministry of Finance (Member), President of FNCCI (Member), 
President of ACSCI (Member), and the Executive Director of 
IEDC (Member Secretary). </p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of involving FNCCI and ACSCI in the committee is 
to promote and develop cordial relations between the center and business chambers and small 
cottage industries in Nepal,&quot; says Kapil Ghimire former executive Director. &quot;We realize that IEDC 
cannot function alone on government aid. Therefore, it is necessary to shift responsibilities 
between the private and government sector and introduce comprehensive goals that can be met by 
entrepreneurs in the country. In fact, most developing countries today depend on private 
enterprises for fulfilling economic and social needs. It is estimated that 80% to 90% of economic 
growth is rendered by the private sector.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Today we wish to strengthen the role of private entrepreneurs in the country and conduct market 
studies to control inflation and create more job opportunities. The committee hopes to encourage 
competition and promote entrepreneurial skills among individuals and organizations. Our 
experience with SBPP has taught us that spoon feeding creates dependency among entrepreneurs 
rather than developing their skills and individuality. The committee is encouraging entrepreneurs to 
be less dependent on IEDC and work for the most, on their own.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;In a developing country like Nepal proper market research and analysis is needed. Keeping this 
in mind, the committee will be organizing surveys that will keep entrepreneurs well informed on 
changing market trends and consumers' needs. We also hope to strengthen infrastructural growth 
whereby entrepreneurs may have easy access to raw materials, technology, and human 
development skills.&quot; </p>
<p>Rudolf Guthier who was appointed by GTZ (German Agency for Technical Cooperation) as 
Advisor to IEDC says, &quot;The need for competitive entrepreneurs in the country is great, therefore 
the committee is focusing on the needs of target groups and providing courses in production 
management, marketing, accounting, and personnel management and development. To encourage 
entrepreneurial competency projects that encourage new business creation are identified and 
selected. Today, the committee's database supports entrepreneurial development and business 
feasibility studies. Every year 160 potential entrepreneurs are trained while 210 receive trainings in 
accounts, general management, marketing, finance, production, and salesmanship. By the end of 
each year 200 are provided small business consultancy services. Until now 125 former NBC 
training participants have been contacted to evaluate their progress and find out the difficulties they 
may be facing. These follow up programs play an integral part of IEDC for through such services 
we can assess the performance of entrepreneurs and our own staff.&quot; </p>
<p>The committee receives funds from HMG, foreign governments, organizations, and individuals. 
However, before accepting cash, goods or other services from these sources prior permission is 
required from HMG. &quot;It is in our best interest to utilize the money for business entrepreneurial 
trainings and consultancy services,&quot; continues Guthier. &quot;Today efforts have been made to establish 
a sound costing and pricing system for NBC and SBC trainings. Amounts received for industrial 
enterprise development are not frozen and usually depending on the economic conditions of target 
groups, services are levied to recover full or partial cost of programs.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The committee's income and expenditure are recorded according to the policies adopted by 
HMG who may examine the accounts during any time in the year,&quot; says Guthier. &quot; HMG has the 
power to audit the committee's finances if it provides more than 50% of grants. If more than 50% 
of funds come from other donor agencies the committee is allowed to appoint an auditor (who 
may also represent a company) from the income tax department to perform such duties. However, 
the same individual or company cannot be nominated for more than three years in a row.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The committee meets four times in a year and the date, time, place are determined by the 
Chairman. However, during emergencies one third of the committee members may ask the 
Member Secretary to call for a meeting after he/she receives permission from the Chairman. Until 
now this system has worked well as decision making powers are indirectly distributed among 
members and problems that require immediate attention are efficiently dealt with. Other important 
functions of the Member Secretary is to provide committee members with a detailed agenda of 
forth coming meetings and notify members of the committee's decisions.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The chairman presides over all meetings and in his absence members select among themselves an 
individual who will take the place of the Chairman and perform his/her duties. Usually issues are 
decided on a majority basis. But in case of a deadlock the Chairman casts a decisive vote. Only 
when 50% of members are present during a meeting is a quorum fulfilled.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Today, the committee has several sub-committees working under its main body. Usually when 
the committee is overloaded with responsibilities it delegates all or some of its power to members, 
the Executive Director, and the sub-committee. This has helped the center to perform well and 
keep up the standard of training programs and workshops,&quot; explains Guthier who is satisfied with 
the committee's performance so far. Today the committee works with HMG through the Ministry 
of Industry. </p>
<h3 align=center><font color="#800000">Appointment of the Executive Director</font></h3>
<p>HMG will appoint an Executive Director on the recommendation of the committee. The individual 
should have five years of experience in the field of industrial enterprise and hold a masters degree 
in business management, commerce and public administration. The term of office for the executive 
director is four years and his/her salary, duties, power, and service conditions are determined by 
HMG. </p>
