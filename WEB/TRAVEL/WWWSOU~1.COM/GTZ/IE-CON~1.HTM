<p>It is clear that the enactment of the Industrial Enterprise Development Institute in November 
1996 is just a beginning. The event was brought together by the need to institutionalize the 
former Small Business Promotion Project, and by the need to rationalize the support structure 
for industrial development. The establishment of this Institute has opened the door towards 
introducing innovative features that will ensure professionalism, flexibility and autonomy in line 
with current thinking on macro- and micro-economic industrial development. This is a process 
that will become an ongoing exercise with an objective to mobilize the full potential of industrial 
development of Nepal in cooperation with the public and the private sector at all levels and in 
all parts of the country. </p>
