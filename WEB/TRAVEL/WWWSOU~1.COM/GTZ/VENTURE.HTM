<p>By Kapil Dev Ghimire </p>
<p>The greatest drawback of newly-established entrepreneurs is insufficient financial backing. Though 
many are enthusiastic about opening their own firms or service-oriented organizations, they are 
often discouraged or left without hope due to lack of funds. The enterprises that are near collapse 
do not get adequate capital to push them back on their feet and though a few may break through 
the pressure, most do not survive. This is why internationally, in this fast-paced and highly technical 
world, venture capital has been introduced as a life-saving body that revives sick enterprises when 
they are suffering great losses or facing bankruptcy. Venture capitalists are the role models of 
entrepreneurship and are a capitalistic body that maintain well-being and mature attitudes among 
entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>In a narrow sense, venture capital can be defined as start up or development capital provided to 
small but growing firms. In broader terms, venture capital refers to that capital which is provided to 
set up new firms with new ideas and technology. </p>
<p>In a country like Nepal, the venture capital idea may work well with newly established enterprises 
and it may be able to revive sick enterprises. The concept of Nepalese entrepreneurship only lately 
became popular and many individuals are nowadays involved in beginning small businesses. 
However, many enterprises have not been able to secure a market or invest wisely. Without proper 
guidance, they have been trapped unknowingly into a situation from which they cannot rise. 
Therefore, the foremost concern of country developers is to begin planning a venture capital body 
and initiate positive responses from other offices in the government. Though some awareness has 
been created among banks and finance companies to take a step in this direction, unless the need is 
expressed fully for the requirement of this kind of body, it will take a long time before something 
concrete is done about the establishment of venture capital in Nepal. </p>
<p>Since venture capitalists provide necessary skills, strengthen an enterprise's weak financial status 
with adequate funds, plan a viable marketing approach for better management, and impart 
entrepreneurial skills to employees, they will help encourage economic growth. In every stage of 
enterprise development, whether helping an idea take root or securely establishing an idea that has 
recently been implemented, venture capital should be available. But one must, however, realize that 
funds are not the only part of venture capital. Along with finances, venture capital focuses on 
providing managerial skills for the smooth running of an enterprise in production, marketing, human 
resource development, and fund stabilization sectors. </p>
<p>Basically, ignorance on the part of entrepreneurs regarding the advantages and disadvantages of 
venture capital may be a main reason why the concept has never been developed in this country. 
The government's liberalization policy and its support towards privatization may appear enough but 
when it comes down to really putting words into action, there is not enough of official 
encouragement to actually make things happen. </p>
<p>However, in time developers will have to think seriously about the problems that many 
entrepreneurs are facing with finance and management and resolve the problems to stabilize their 
conditions. SBPP is seriously thinking about promoting Venture Capital. </p>
