<p><b><i>New Business Creation</i></b><i>: </i>This program aims to develop knowledge, skills, and the attitudes that 
are necessary to start a new business. A needs analysis precedes the training program. Careful 
selection of candidates and adaptation of the curriculum as per the needs of participants assures 
good success rates. The training program concentrates on motivation, business idea generation, and 
development of business proposals (plans). Business schemes are then presented to the banking 
community and fellow participants for constructive criticism. Trainers write a report after the 
training and they monitor and support the progress of new entrepreneurs. Currently SBPP conducts 
about 20 NBC courses per year. Follow-up workshops ensure that participants can access 
continued support. The follow-up program aims at improving and varying the services offered by 
SBPP. It analyzes the existing services and their results. It elaborates, tests, and introduces new 
approaches to training and monitors international and national research progress on 
entrepreneurship development issues. For this purpose, it establishes links with research and 
development institutions in Nepal and abroad and carries out commissioned research and surveys 
in the field. Various manuals and publications are produced. NBC results in the creation of 50 to 
200 new enterprises a year. </p>
<p>Follow-up conducted after three years show 53% of participants starting out as entrepreneurs. 
They employ an average of five to seven people and have an investment of Rs. 350,000 ($ 7000). 
So this approach creates well over 1,000 jobs per year. SBPP's follow-up statistics show between 
4,500 to 6,000 jobs created through direct NBC activities during ten years of operation. SBPP 
plans to maintain this level of activity and even envisions activities enabling others in Nepal to 
duplicate the approach. An NBC program lasts five weeks and total costs which include follow-up 
is $7000 for 20 participants. Four senior professionals supervise the program. </p>

<p><b><i>Small Business Consultancy: </i></b>The program assists newly created or established small 
businesses. It offers, after an initial diagnosis of the enterprise, consulting services in the following 
areas: marketing, financial management, accounting, and production management. If required, 
SBPP Business Information Services' technicians can provide advice. Over 200 consultancies are 
carried out by the project branch offices annually. SBPP also conducts area census surveys and 
consultants prepare manuals for client use. In addition by 1994, about 1,720 people had benefited 
from this service through 94 training programs. A SBC program lasts eight weeks.</p>
<p><b><i>Services to Institutions: </i></b>SBPP cooperates with many organizations in the implementation of 
effective income generation and entrepreneurship programs. It trains the staff of other agencies, 
conducts planning workshops, and helps these organizations and institutions find appropriate 
approaches to micro-enterprise development. It introduced, for instance, ex-servicemen of the 
British Gurkhas and ex-trainees of technical institutions to the world of business. It familiarizes 
village-based trainers and extension workers to concepts and methods of income generation. The 
integrated service packages of SBPP have become so successful that a rising demand has to be 
satisfied. Interaction with a variety of NGOs, donor agencies, banks, and government institutions 
allows SBPP to attain the multiplier effect and the organizations are increasingly willing to pay for 
the services. This activity is of importance in the context of the project's institutionalization because 
it hopes to obtain an increasing share of its operation costs through services provided to institutions.</p>
<p><b><i>Planning and Business Information: </i></b>Planning plays a key role in ensuring smooth operation of 
an enterprise and a definite direction can be achieved only through careful planning. The division 
coordinates the planning and budgeting processes of His Majesty's Government and the 
Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. Planning involves the identification of strategies 
for the institutional development of the project. The provision of collecting business information 
helps SBPP staff in executing their tasks. They consult other professionals to provide specific 
answers to entrepreneur's problems. Local experts, a question and answer system, and publications 
provide further information and about 80 technicians are advisors to SBPP. They visit clients to 
solve technology-related problems on a cost-sharing basis. SBPP's library has over 3,000 titles as 
well as relevant magazines and periodicals on small business promotion and other technical 
subjects. A microfiche reader makes it possible to pursue the Appropriate Technology Library and 
other documents. </p>
<p><b><i>Complementary Credit Program: </i></b>This program maintains a revolving fund for credits (up to Rs. 
200,000) to new and existing entrepreneurs. The fund (Rs. 12,500,000) is administered by the 
Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal. A chartered accountant examines its progress every six 
months. The revolving fund requires that the entrepreneur provides a collateral (building, land). </p>
