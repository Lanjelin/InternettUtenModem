GERMANY</strong></font></font></h3>
<p><strong><i>Introduction:</i></strong><i> </i>Germany is 356,733 square kilometers in size and one of the largest countries in 
central Europe. It is 869 kilometers at its longest and 628 kilometers at its widest. It is divided into 
five main regions: North German Plains, Central Highlands, South German Hills, Black Forest, and 
Bavarian Alps. North German Plains is average 91 meters above the sea level and it is the largest 
region in Germany. Along its sea coast are lands rich and fertile. The south is heavily cultivated as 
well as densely populated. Old German cities like Bonn and Cologne are set here. Plateaus form 
the landscape of Central Highlands. The soil is poor here and rocky. Rushing rivers have created 
rugged gorges and among them the Rhine River Gorge is considered one of the most beautiful 
sights on the planet. South German Hills are long parallel ridges extending from north to south. 
Sheep rearing is popular here and the best farmlands of Germany are located in the valleys between 
the ridges. Black Forest is named after dark fir and spruce trees. The region has many mountains 
and the area features in many German fairy tales and legends. In the extreme south, Bavarian Alps 
are a part of the largest mountain range in Europe. The highest peak in Germany, Mt. Zugspitze at 
2,963 meters, is here. People find the region's scenery, lakes, and streams ideal to holiday in. 
Because Germany is located near the sea, the nation has a moderate climate. The coldest month is 
January and the average temperature is -1* C. Sometimes cold winds from eastern Europe lower 
the temperature sharply: but this is only for short periods. July is the hottest month and the 
temperature may reach 18* C. </p>

France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Germany is a member of the UN, NATO,
