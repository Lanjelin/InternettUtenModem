<p><img src="IEDC-1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/gtz/iedc-1.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=0 width=198 height=119>In order to consolidate the work of Small Business Promotion 
Project, it was necessary to institutionalize the project. 
Accordingly, on July 3, 1995, SBPP was institutionalized as 
IEDC (Industrial Enterprise Development Center). </p>
<p>The successful entrepreneurship development training courses 
researched and piloted by SBPP could continue through IEDC 
and at the same time the institute could encompass other relevant sectors that are conducive to 
entrepreneurial and industrial development. The center also seeks to secure further cooperation 
from the Ministry of Industry, other government organizations, and the international community. </p>
<p>Order issued by His Majesty's Government of Nepal is the most important step towards 
institutionalization. </p>
<p>The newly appointed Executive Director of IEDC, Dr. Nirmal K. Bista, is confident that the past 
efforts of SBPP can be further diversified so people are more confident about becoming 
employers rather than employees. &quot;The scope of IEDC is immense in imparting managerial and 
entrepreneurial skills,&quot; comments Dr. Bista who is also the President of Management Association 
of Nepal (MAN). </p>
<h3 align=center><font color="#800000">INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF SBPP</font></h3>
<p>The Industrial Enterprise Development Academy Bill 2052 was presented to the House of 
Representatives by Minister of Communications and Information, Chirinjivi Wagle on November 
30, 1995. Later, the bill was passed after it was presented by the Minister for Industry, Dhundiraj 
Shastri on January 2, 1996. In the next session, the bill will be presented to the National Assembly 
and after approval will be enacted upon Royal Assent. This will allow the Industrial Enterprise 
Development Center to function as a permanent autonomous institute for the development of 
industrial development in Nepal. Further developments will be added to this profile in due time. </p>
<p>Today, IEDC has three departments - SBPP, the Technology Transfer Center, and the Data 
Bank Program. SBPP will function as before (see the SBPP profile on internet) while the 
Technology Transfer Center and Data Bank Program are new systems that will help individuals 
find information on opening and managing new enterprises. Technology Transfer will specifically 
assist entrepreneurs to look for information regarding recent development and findings on 
technology and resources for raw materials and machinery. Other topics like adaptation to buyer's 
needs, cultural impact of products, environmental and economical studies including export and 
import issues will also be dealt with. Emphasis will be given on sustainable studies as well. Further, 
HMG has recently decided to create Technology Park Project (TPP) under IEDC. </p>
<p>The primary objectives of TPP are to develop infrastructure which can be utilized by professionals 
and companies to promote, develop, and export informative technology products (for example 
software). It is expected one-stop services to carry out research and developments in the 
information technology field will significantly contribute to the foreign exchange earnings of Nepal. </p>
<p>IEDC's Technology Transfer Center will also exhibit spare parts of computers, electrical 
appliances, and other technical gadgets for entrepreneurs and the general public. Interested 
persons will be informed on how to use the devices and their different parts. Entrepreneurs can 
also purchase the goods from the center. </p>
