</strong></font><font size=5><strong>NEPAL GERMAN TRADE RELATIONS</strong></font></font></h3>
<p>Nearly 40% of Nepal's total exports go to Germany. The Kingdom imports 3% of its needs from 
Germany. Germany still remains as the biggest buyer of Nepalese rugs today and imports more 
than 85% of Nepal's carpets. Besides carpets, Nepal also exports handicrafts, jewellery, garments, 
leather, woollen goods, lentils, tea, spices, and essential oils to Germany. Recently, a few 
non-traditional products have been developed in Nepal and are being exported to Germany. 
Though they form a small part of the export, they have been welcomed by the German market. 
These items include knitwear, electric transformers, alcoholic beverage, button and button 
materials, and food products. Lately, a Nepal German joint venture company, Nepal Bayern 
Electric has started to export high technology micro-transformers to Germany. This is the first high 
technology export from Nepal. Altogether, ten Nepal German joint venture projects are registered 
so far. Six units with Rs. 180 million investment are in operation and most of them are in the tourism 
sector. Nepal imports sixty products from Germany. They are machinery parts, industrial raw 
materials, telecommunication equipment, scientific and research equipment, chemicals, etc. German 
machinery and technology have been successfully used in big hydro-power projects and beer and 
cement plants. Germans are the largest number of tourists to come to Nepal from western 
countries. In 1995, more than 44,000 German tourists visited Nepal (12% of the total tourist 
arrival). </p>
