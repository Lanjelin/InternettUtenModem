<p>During the past years NGCCI has helped bring about significant improvements in the country's 
trade, tourism, and investment relations with Germany. It is always providing assistance to initiate 
sound policies or to activate business organization enhancement. <b><i>NGCCI/DEG Service 
Agreement:</i></b> NGCCI has been working in association with DEG (Deutsche Invistitions and 
Entwicklugs), a semi-governmental development bank of Germany. It signed the NGCCI/DEG 
service agreement on November 1991. The joint advisory service's foremost objective is to assist 
and develop private business and small and medium enterprises in Nepal and render services to 
them. Also, it aims to enhance productivity, technology, and human resource of companies and 
gives advice to entrepreneurs on how to keep their businesses stable and financially secure. Thus it 
conducts jointly business development and advisory programs to fulfill its objectives. Under the 
ongoing NGCCI/DEG advisory program, Nepalese companies have been receiving 
product/market development and entrepreneurship services. Several workshops, seminars, and 
symposiums have been organized to promote and develop trade and investment in and outside the 
country. With its help, more than 50 Nepalese companies have received help and expanded 
business relations to Germany and Europe. The Germany Ministry of Economic Cooperation and 
Development has been providing financial support to operate the program. The NGCCI/DEG 
service agreement expires in December 1996. </p>
<p><b><i>Promotion of trade and transfer of technology:</i></b> To promote trade between Nepal and 
Germany, NGCCI organizes visits of business persons to both countries. To encourage export, 
the chamber presents annual awards to the best exporter and exporter of new products. In 1995 
it initiated an award to the best importer of Nepalese products. Also, joint economic ventures and 
transfer of technology are main concerns of its conferences and seminars. </p>
<p><b><i>Protection of Nepalese and German business interests:</i></b> As an advisory body, the chamber 
protects the oommon interests of Nepalese businesses in Germany and German business interest 
in Nepal by liasioning with the government and concerned sectors. It settles business disputes or 
takes necessary action to solve problems. Regarding the ban on AZO dyes, NGCCI feels that a 
competent organization should start providing certificates to give credibility to garments and other 
goods from Nepal.</p>
<p><b><i>Nepal German Export Promotion Project:</i></b> On April 11, 1994, NGCCI and GTZ signed an 
agreement to establish Nepal German Export Promotion Project with the objective of promoting 
exports, particularly non-traditional and manufactured goods, to Germany and European 
countries. Small and medium manufacturing and exporting companies of Nepal were to be 
targeted. The project is scheduled to start operation soon. </p>
<p>Communication: A non-profit organization, NGCCI also facilitates communication between 
German chambers of commerce and other related professional bodies and keeps both the 
Nepalese and German business communities updated on the latest changes in the trade, 
investment, and related policies. Every now and then, bilateral economic issues are discussed 
thoroughly during seminars. Likewise, the chamber also disseminates current economic and 
business information and services. Experts are invited to lecture on topical issues of interest to 
both Nepalese and German business communities. NGCCI has been organizing many workshops, 
symposiums, and trainings in the past years. Enquiries of participants are answered and many are 
given counseling on how to start businesses in Nepal. The chamber also publishes and distributes 
news bulletins and brings out papers on topical issues. An information and documentation center 
has been set up for dissemination of business information and NGCCI also acts as a research 
institution and collects statistics and information relating to business, economic cooperation, and 
tourism. </p>
<p><b><i>Trade Fair Participation:</i></b> NGCCI organizes and participates in many industry and trade fairs 
and exhibitions. It renders pre-shipment and related services to exporters and organizes 
buyer's-seller's meetings. </p>
<p><b><i>Social Commitment:</i></b> Besides focusing on trade, investment, industry, and tourism-related issues, 
NGCCI is also concerned about the social conditions and problems of the country. To the best of 
its ability, NGCCI tries to support development organizations in fulfilling their objectives. The 
chamber helps the country in cases of natural disasters: during July 1994, it provided financial 
assistance to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund to provide relief and rehabilitation to flood victims in 
the central terai area. Similarly, it provided financial assistance to a Nepalese cultural troupe which 
presented cultural programs in Sttutgart during Nepal Promotion Week. In addition, NGCCI 
coordinated the establishment of the National Society for Protection of Environment and Children 
after questions were raised in Germany and other Western countries regarding child labor. 
NASPEC was officially registered on August 15, 1994, and since then, it has provided welfare 
and rehabilitation schemes for children of factory workers and children released from factories. 
Journalists and child welfare organizations from BENELUX to Nepal during 1995 confirmed that 
there were no child laborers in the country. </p>
<p><b><i>Environment Protection:</i></b> NGCCI is concerned about today's environmental issues and 
emphasizes on promoting eco-awareness among the Nepalese people as well as industrialists. It 
has initiated environment related movements and organized a national seminar on &quot;Environment 
Protection&quot;. As a result, the National Industrialists' Environment Protection Council was 
established and its objective is to safeguard the environment from the pollution created by the 
country's various industries. </p>
<p>Development of Trade and Industry in Remote Regions: The chamber is making programs that will 
expand the carpet industry to the country's remote areas. Relocation of factories has become a 
major concern for country developers as more and more industries are crowding around city 
areas. It is felt that a suitable infrastructure is required for expansion purposes and industrialists 
and business people will be invited to inspect the new locations. </p>
<p><b><i>Activities outside Kathmandu</i></b><i>: </i>With the aim of encouraging other regions of the country to 
partake in the tourism sector's development, NGCCI, in association with JCCI (Janakpur 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry), organized a one day business seminar on &quot;Janakpur as a 
tourist destination&quot;. 56 entrepreneurs and representatives from NGCCI, JCCI, and regional 
chambers of Dolakha, Sindhuli, Mahottari, and Jaleswor participated in the seminar. Discussions 
covered development of Janakpur as a tourist destination. It was noted that the district has several 
places of historical and archaeological importance but basic tourist infrastructure and facilities have 
to be developed. The team NGCCI sent to study Janakpur presented their recommendations 
during the seminar and expressed confidence regarding Janakpur's potentiality as a tourist area. 
NGCCI in association with DEG and Narayangarh Chamber of Commerce organized a one day 
regional business workshop on June 5, 1996. The workshop presented the activities of 
NGCCI/DEG business advisory prog~am to the business community and also discussed trade, 
industry, and tourism problems and prospects. 11 chambers of commerce as well as local 
business persons were invited to the workshop and participants from DEG and SBPP (Small 
Business Promotion Project) were also present. </p>
<p><b><i>Future events: </i></b>Nepal German Week exhibition will be held in October. During this week 
NGCCI will coordinate business houses and oversee the management of the business sector 
exhibitions. Interested parties should contact NGCCI for further details and information. </p>
