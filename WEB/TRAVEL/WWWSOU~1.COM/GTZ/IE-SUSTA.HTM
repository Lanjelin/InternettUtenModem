<p>The experience of the former SBPP and the Industrial Enterprise Development Centre shows that 
promotional services for entrepreneurs do not necessarily have to be completely funded by the 
government. In the IEDC, 30% of its operating cost was obtained from contracts awarded to it by 
other donors, local chambers, businesses and even individual entrepreneurs. A similar cost sharing 
mechanism will have to be worked out between the stakeholders and the constituent centres and 
projects on the one hand; and the centres and the Institute on the other. As mentioned above 
considerable funds will be placed in the hands of local authorities and they could be interested in 
contributing to such promotional measures. After all, a more prosperous locality means more 
revenue for the local authority and consequently improved infrastructure. Thus it is a cyclical 
process. </p>
