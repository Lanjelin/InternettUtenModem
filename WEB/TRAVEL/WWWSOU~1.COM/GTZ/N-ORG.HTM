<p>The chamber's highest policy making body is the General Assembly and it is represented by all 
members. Elections are held every three years for an Executive Board. The present Executive 
Board was elected in May 1994 and its 16 members will represent Nepal's trade, tourism, and 
industry sector from 1994 to 1997. A team of professionals will implement all plans. The 
secretariat is equipped with modern equipment and amenities and has an Information and 
Documentation Cell which has the latest news and information relating to business. The chamber 
also hires consultants to help complete research work and collect data. </p>
<p>NGCCI supports itself with membership fees, donations, grants, financial assistance received from 
benefactors, and fees charged for services rendered. It takes loans or accepts monies from other 
sources. Prominent Nepalese business houses and industries, who have trade and economic 
relations with Germany, have joined NGCCI and so have German companies doing business in 
Nepal. The chamber has 137 members.</p>
