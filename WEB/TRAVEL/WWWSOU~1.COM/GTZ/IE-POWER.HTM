<p>Reviewing the situation when the Industrial Enterprise Development Centre was functioning as a 
Development Board, it was clear that its relationship with other centres and projects in its periphery 
had to be streamlined. This Act gives the Institute the power to form centres and sub-centres as 
well as branches and sub-branches to achieve its objectives. </p>
<p>The immediate impact of this is that the formerly loosely coordinated centres and projects now 
have an umbrella organization for coordination and exchange of experience. On the practical side it 
means that there are at the moment 4 organizations under the umbrella of the Institute. These are: 
the Enterprise Development Centre (EDC) - in essence the former IEDC under the Development 
Board Act, the Small Business Promotion Project (SBPP), the Technology Transfer and 
Development Centre (TTDC) and the Technology Park Project (TPP). The provision for 
establishing centres also allows the Institute to carry out promotional activities for the industrial 
enterprise sector as a whole instead of confining itself to cottage and small enterprise promotion 
and providing linkage services for other required inputs. These new fields could involve; providing 
policy advice to the government, formulating strategies for industrial enterprise development, 
coordinating support activities in the sector and functioning as a think-tank on various aspects of 
industrial development. </p>
