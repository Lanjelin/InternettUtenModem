The Governing Board </b></font></font></p>
<p>It is vital that all stakeholders in the industrial sector are represented on the governing board of the 
Institute. The 9 member board provided for in the Act is evenly divided among the private sector, 
the government and specialists. While the Minister or Minister of State for Industry is the chairman, 
the other government representatives are the Secretaries of the Ministry of Industry and the 
Ministry of Finance. The Presidents of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and 
Industries (FNCCI) and the Federation of Nepalese Cottage and Small Industries (FNCSI) and a 
business person represent the private sector. A management expert, an environmental expert and 
the Executive Director of the Institute comprise the group of specialists. </p>
<p>This balance of government and private sector representation is expected to result in an effort that 
will jointly address government priorities as well as private sector interests. This is one of the rare 
instances where these two sectors together with specialists will be brought together on a single 
platform to discuss their needs, potentials as well as possible action and strategies. It will encourage 
dialogue between the two sectors and help both to understand and consolidate each other's 
viewpoint and direction. The idea of a common platform has been strengthened by the fact that the 
Executive Director of the Institute is not appointed by the government but by the board. Therefore 
ownership of the development efforts can be taken over by the stakeholders concerned. </p>
