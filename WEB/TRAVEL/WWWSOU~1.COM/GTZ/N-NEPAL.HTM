<p><font color="#8080C0"><font size=4><b>Introduction</b></font></font><font size=4><b><br>
</b></font>The Kingdom of Nepal is one of world's most attractive countries in the world. It stretches eight 
hundred kilometres east to west and is an average seventy kilometres wide. Within such a small 
area, the country covers three important geographic belts. To the north is the Himalayan range. The 
climate there is usually sub-zero, most of the land snow-covered, and the elevation ranges from 
3,000 to 8,848 metres. The vegetation is mostly shrubs and lichens and animal life includes the 
snow-leopard, yak, and a variety of pheasants. Eight of the world's ten tallest peaks, including 
Everest, are in this belt and the area is inhabited by mongoloid people. Mid- country is mostly hills. 
These cover 70% of the total terrain and elevations range from 500 to 3,000 meters. Most of the 
country people live in this region and the capital of Kathmandu is also located among the hills. The 
people are mongoloid and Indo-Aryan and their major occupation is agriculture and livestock 
rearing.</p>

<p>There is wide range of flora and fauna in this region and the leopard, bear, deer, and bison are 
some of them. The hills have moderate climates and have seen human settlement for two thousand 
years. International visitors find the cultures and trekking areas of this region most attractive. The 
southern plains are the most fertile in Nepal. Much of the successful farming and forestry is done in 
this region. The elevations range from 400 to 70 meters above the sea level and the plains have 
some of the most important wildlife parks of South East Asia. The animal life includes the Royal 
Bengal tiger, one-horned rhino, and the gharial crocodile. The vegetation is mostly sub-tropical. 
The people are mostly Indo- Aryans and distinctive Tharu and Maithila cultures of the terai have 
attracted much attention internationally. The climate is sub-tropical and the development in this 
region is proceeding at a very fast pace because of the amenable topography. </p>
<p><font color="#8080C0"><font size=4><b>Neighbors</b></font></font><b><i><br>
</i></b>China (Tibet) is located to the north of Nepal and the Himalaya separate the two countries. They 
share a cordial relationship and in the past bilateral trade was most necessary for the well-being of 
the Tibetan Plateau and the upper-hills of Nepal. The cultures of the region are highly influenced 
and many of the deities and religious practices are similar. India is to the south, east, and west of 
Nepal. Relationships are cordial between the two countries. Many cultural, development, and 
ethnic similarities exist between China, Nepal, and India. Both neighbours actively help in the 
development activities of the Kingdom. Since Nepal is land-locked and access to the sea-ports is 
through India, the country's positive policies towards Nepal is exceedingly important. </p>

<p><font color="#8080C0"><font size=4><b>History</b></font></font><b><i><br>
</i></b>The oldest engraving found in Nepal goes back to the fifth century AD and the text describes the 
wise King Man Dev and his activities. However, statues have been discovered dating back even 
later, to the second century BC. Though the civilization in this region is relatively young, it has 
produced many beautiful areas and sophisticated cultures. In the past 1,000 years, these have been 
the most important historical areas: in the west the Khas Kingdoms, in the mid-west the Gurung and 
Magar Kingdoms, in the mid-east the Newari Kingdoms, and in the east the Kirati Kingdoms. 
These rulers controlled the mountain and the hills, the plains, however, were mostly under the rule 
of the Maithila Rulers. All these kingdoms were consolidated into a single nation by Prithvi Narayan 
Shah more than two hundred years ago. The diverse cultures of Nepal have attracted many visitors 
and scholars. 77% of the travellers to Nepal stay within the Kathmandu Valley where three of the 
Newar kingdoms were located. They contain accomplished wood, metal, and stone craft dating 
from the second to the nineteenth centuries AD and the Valley alone contains seven World 
Heritage Sites. The Shah dynasty rules the kingdom today and the monarchy operates under the 
national constitution. Most of the executive powers are handled by the prime minister who is 
elected by the parliament. The multi-party parliament is democratic. </p>
<p><font color="#8080C0"><font size=4><b>Economy</b></font></font><b><i><br>
</i></b>It is estimated that ninety percent of the Nepalese people are dependent on agriculture. Agriculture 
and livestock provide food, clothing, cash, and other necessities to them. Other major earning 
sectors are tourism, garment, carpet, and manufacturing industries. Since the advent of multi-party 
democracy in 1990, there has been a sharp increase of enterprise within the country. Though the 
per capita income of an average Nepali is about US$ 200, most own their own home and some 
agricultural land besides. His Majesty's Government, along with donor countries, has made major 
contribution towards the improvement of the living standards of the people. The German 
Government has been a major partner in the development field for forty years now. German 
Embassy, GTZ, and Goethe Institute, among other German organisations are operating in Nepal. It 
is to be noted that approximately 85% of the Nepalese-Tibetan rugs manufactured in Nepal are 
marketed to Germany alone. </p>

<p><font color="#8080C0"><font size=4><b>Foreign Investment</b></font></font><b><i><br>
</i></b>Nepal's foreign investment has been most significant in the development sector. Many visitors like 
the country because of its friendly people, beautiful scenery and excellent adventure travel 
opportunities. Among the activities that a visitor may wish to enjoy are mountaineering, trekking, 
jungle safaris, rafting, cultural tours, and ballooning. Recently, many foreign individuals and 
companies are showing interest in investing in Nepal. Since labor is cheap and the government is 
actively encouraging investors, Nepal may yield high and reliable profits to investors. </p>
