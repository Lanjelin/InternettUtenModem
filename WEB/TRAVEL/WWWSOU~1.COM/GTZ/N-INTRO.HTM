<p>Nepal German Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established in October 1990 in 
Kathmandu to strengthen and expand economic and trade ties with Germany. The organization is 
the first of its kind in the Himalayan kingdom. Its main objective is the development of trade, 
investment, tourism, and industry with the Federal Republic of Germany. During the past five 
years, it has extended all possible support to promote these specific areas and has maintained a 
keen interest in their progress. NGCCI as a bilateral chamber represents the interests of both 
Nepalese and German business communities in the two countries. Also, NGCCI maintains close 
professional relations with German chambers of commerce and trade related services are 
exchanged. In fact, the services are not only given to members but also to other non-member 
capable companies. Overall, the chamber is constantly on the look out for ways and means with 
which to help nurture business relations between Nepal and Germany.</p>

<p>In the past, Nepalese traders experienced a need to develop a business forum to promote further 
business relations with Germany. Opportunities to expand business ties between both countries 
existed but without a proper medium. Because of this most business persons felt it would be 
difficult and insecure to start new enterprises related to these two countries. Exporters and 
importers who had already benefited from the business between Nepal and Germany were keenly 
interested in promoting and expanding it further. Thus, it was felt that a sound body was required 
to develop better interaction between both parties as well as to establish cordial business ties. It 
was important that this body keep the business communities of both countries abreast of new 
changes in trade policies, rules, and opportunities so that business persons could have a clear 
understanding of the trade situation and make appropriate business decisions. In addition, Nepal 
was also interested in bringing German technology and investment into the country in order to 
enhance the Kingdom's industrial sector. Thus, the creation of NGCCI was considered essential 
as it would fulfill both the objectives of the nation and its business persons.</p>
