<p><img src="IEDC3.JPG" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/gtz/iedc3.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=0 width=191 height=124>Today, IEDC has formed an organizational body where job 
descriptions and functional profiles have been determined in such 
a way that the institute is run in a non-bureaucratic and flexible 
manner. The organizing body is encouraged to adapt to the needs 
of demand based and marketable programs and to keep an open 
mind for continual change,&quot; says Kapil Ghimire. </p>
<p>IEDC has introduced a monitoring system that analyzes service packages and their cost 
effectiveness. In the future, we hope to develop the system and introduce better training packages 
that cost less. This will encourage more entrepreneurs to partake in IEDC's entrepreneurial 
development programs and workshops. </p>
<p>At present, IEDC's computer networking system has also been improved and better organized. 
Branch offices have been connected with the head office in Kathmandu making communication 
fast and easy. The networking system within the head office has also been completed and the 
center has access to internet. </p>
<p>With internet Nepalese business persons can obtain information that is relevant for them and their 
organizations. Such information can be disseminated throughout the country. Nepalese business 
persons will also be able to compete internationally since they will have access to business 
information and technology used abroad. IEDC and SBPP activities will also receive global 
coverage and attract continued support for its activities from other agencies. The presentation on 
the web will be informative and useful for clients and organizations interested in the center's 
entrepreneurial training programs. </p>
<p>However, for more interested parties a promotional video on IEDC's activities, ongoing programs, 
workshops, and seminars has been prepared. Introductory brochures are also available for each 
of IEDC's service packages. It is our main concern to inform local and foreign bodies and 
individuals to get a clear picture of our objectives and our role in entrepreneurial skills 
development. By the end of this year a folder and <i>Briefing Kit</i> on IEDC will also be available. </p>
<p>Besides accepting funds from donors we also encourage donor agencies to use the facilities and 
services of the center in their enterprise development and income generation programs. A unit has 
been developed in IEDC to study the activities and interests of donor agencies and prepare 
project proposals for competitive bidding. </p>
<p>The infrastructure at IEDC has improved and today, six vehicles are available for operational use. 
Adequate training equipment has also been procured. It is hoped that with better infrastructural 
growth IEDC can branch out to more areas in Nepal and in particular rural communities. </p>
