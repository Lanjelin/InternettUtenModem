.<b>..There is no region as such  in the world, where else can you 
find so many of the world’s highest mountains, together with communities of 
people living among them </I> <I>in perfect mother nature harmony   .....
</b><p>

So, the area has become one of the most beautiful / picturesque classic Mt. Everest 
high valley trek.<P>

Usually the way  most trekkers reach Khumbu is by flying into Lukla (9,300ft.).  
But many prefer to avoid chances of Altitude difficulties due to the abrupt altitude 
approach. Unacclimatized people can become ill and don’t enjoy the holiday.<P>

We start our trek driving first to Jiri (1,867m.) a 170 Km. mountain run.  The trek 
then begins, walking with a climb to the ridge top at 2400 metres then drop down to 
Shivalaya (1,768m.) and towards Bhandar (2,194m.).  <I>Since reaching this village 
we have been in Sherpa Country and will continue through land populated by these 
hardy ethno clan as far as the upper most of pasture lands beneath Mt. Everest.</I>  
After Bhandar we follow the route going down through the lower fields of the village, 
then follow  Likhu Khola to pass through Sete then to the village of Junbesi.  The first 
village Junbesi (8,755ft.) with its gomba (monastery), new school and the large homes, 
almost Swiss like houses found here-abouts.   Above the valley we will see a peak 
called the Shorong Yul Lha (22,826ft.) “ Country God of Solu ”, also called the 
Numbur.  From Junbesi, we walk Southward and cross the Junbesi Khola (river) and 
take the upper trail leading Southeast and up the ridge toward Takshingdo, Kharikhola.   
Now we will be doing some uphill walking - heading toward the village of Puiyan 
passing through Bupsa and the Dudh Kosi gorge..  The trail levels on to Surkye, then 
climbs again towards steep slopes above the Dudh Kosi (river of milk), side-tracking 
East of Lukla to join the mail trail following up the Dudh Koshi river valley towards 
Namche, the Sherpa capital of the Khumbu region peaks are fantastic.<P>

Namche (3,436m.) the famous Sherpa capital of the Khumbu region.  After taking 
1-2 days rest to get acclimatized, we continue towards famous sherpa villages like 
Thame, Khumjung and Theso-Thama.  We also visit  interesting monasteries of this 
region and the Khunde hospital, established and supported by Sir Edmund Hillary’s 
Himalayan Trust.   The view from this area is superb: Thamserku, Kwangde and 
Amadablam soaring towards the sky-line.<P>
Gokyo, a one time yak pasture land is blessed with two beautiful high lakes, with a 
majestic view of Cho Oyu (8,201m.), another 8000 metre peak of the region.  We 
climb Kala Pattar (the black rock 5,545m.) or Gokyo Ri (5,483m.) at Gokyo, to view  
the Western shoulder of Mt. Everest, Lhotse,  Nuptse and far away Makalu.  We 
continue on toward Na and Phortse to join the main Everest trail at Pangboche. 
Pangboche is another big sherpa village which has produced many internationally 
renowned mountaineers.<P>
After taking a day’s rest at Pheriche, we continue toward Khumbu Glaciers 
stopping at Lobuje and Gorakshep.  We will climb another Kala Pattar (5,545m.) to 
get the close-up view of the Mt. Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse.  Changatse in Tibet is 
also visible from the summit.  We also get a good panoramic view of Amadablam, 
Tawoche and Kusum Kanguru, completely in a different angle.<P>

We also have the option to visit Everest Ice fall or Expedition Base Camp, 
depending on how fit we are when we are at Gorakshep.<P>

Return journey is made via Dingboche, Thyangboche ( a famous monastery site 
much highlighted in the media by photographers, journalists and the heritage societies 
), Namche and finally to Lukla to conclude this Mt. Everest trek, as an experience of a 
life time. <P>
