In the mid-west of Nepal, lies the great Himalayan range of Annapurna (8,091m.), 
offering several 7,000 metre sister peaks on its shoulder. It’s Southern flank is very 
green and gets the highest precipitation, making the land therefore fertile and 
inhabitable by different ethnic groups for centuries. <P>

The Southern flank of Annapurna is very popular trek route, passing through 
several beautiful villages and dramatic view points, leading to North of Modi Khola 
Valley and up the canyon between Hiunchuli (6,441m.) and Machhapuchhare  ‘ 
Fishtail ’  mountains.  This valley floor or basin rarely receives more than seven hours 
of sunlight even on a clear day. The inhabitant of this area are mostly the Gurungs, one 
of the ethnic groups of the Himalayan hills, they are peasant farmers and shepherds. 
And this is the  very region from where the fearsome Nepalese Gurkha soldiers (especially 
the ethnic Gurungs) hail.  <P>

The mighty soldiers whose names have been written down in golden letters in the 
book of HISTORY, for their bravery in the great world wars, winning medals of valor - 
‘ the Victoria Cross ’ and that too not only few, but many.  <P>
Annapurna area was first recede by the British Adventurer, Col. James O.M 
‘Jimmy’ Roberts in the year 1956 and exposed to the World as the ‘Sanctuary of 
Gods’. The Sanctuary has been so Christened as “Annapurna Sanctuary” ever 
since.<P>

Our 15 days adventure trip to the Annapurna Sanctuary starts from Pokhara, a 
scenic spot.  Our trek combines spectacular mountain scenery with incredible ethnic 
and cultural diversity and traverses through very strange locales.   The Gurung villages 
enroute are particularly colourful and absolutely you can expect to meet strange but 
friendly, little shy and smiling  ethnic people of the high hills and get wonderful 
mountain views.   <P>

The trail lead us towards the deep gorge between the peaks - Hiunchuli and 
Machhapuchhare and through the dense rain forest and bamboo jungles of the narrow 
Modi Khola river valley then to the Sanctuary with scattered summits and immense 
walls of the mountain fortress.  It is a wall of mountains roughly in circular formation, 
culminating in Annapurna (26,545ft. / 8,091m.).  Other major peaks overlooking the 
Sanctuary include the Annapurna South <P>
( 23,693ft. / 7,219m.), Gangapurna (24,457ft. / 7,455m.) and the Annapurna III 
(24,787ft. / 7,555m.).  You should note that, this area is also referred to as the 
Annapurna Base Camp and the Machhapuchhare Base Camp. In the Sanctuary itself, 
one can stay or also camp for 1/2 days to enjoy the beautiful view and mountain 
serenity.<P>

On our return journey, we descend through the lush terraced Modi Khola and 
Mardi Khola river valleys to finally concluding our adventure at Pokhara, a  popular 
destination with its famed Phewa Lake, dominated by towering 8,000 metre  Peaks of 
Annapurna and Dhaulagiri just 15 to 20 kms. distance away.<P>
<b>Please refer to the  Annapurna Circuit for details about the flora and fauna of the area.</b>
