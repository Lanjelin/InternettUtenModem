<b><i>...  There is no region as such in the world, where else can you find so 
many of the world’s highest mountains, together with communities of people living among 
them in perfect harmony with mother nature   ....</i></b><p>

So, the area has become one of the most beautiful/picturesque high altitude trek in 
Nepal.<P>

Our trek starts from Lukla (2,762m.), following up the Dudh Koshi river valley towards 
Namche, the Sherpa capital of the Khumbu region.  After taking 1-2   days rest to get 
acclimatized, we continue towards famous sherpa villages like Thame, Khumjung and Theso-
Thama.  We also visit  interesting monasteries of this region and the Khunde hospital, 
established and supported by Sir Edmund Hillary’s Himalayan Trust.   The view from this area 
is superb including Thamserku (6,623m.), Kwangde (6,011m.) and Amadablam (6,812m.) 
soaring towards the sky-line.<P>

Gokyo, a one time yak pasture land is blessed with two beautiful high lakes, with a majestic 
view of Cho Oyu (8,201m.), other 8000 metre peaks of the region.  We climb Kala Pattar ( the 
‘Black Rock’) or the Gokyo Ri ( 5,483m.) at Gokyo, to view  the Western shoulder of Mt. 
Everest (8,848m.), Lhotse (8516m.),  Nuptse (7855m.) and far away Makalu (8463m.).  We 
continue on towards Na and Phortse to join the main Everest trail at Pangboche.  Pangboche is 
another famous sherpa village which has produced many internationally acclaimed 
mountaineers.<P>
<P>
After taking a day’s rest at Pheriche, we continue towards Khumbu glaciers stopping at 
Lobuje and Gorakshep (5,160m.).  We will climb another Kala Pattar (the black rock) 5,545 
metres, to get the close-up view of the Mt. Everest, Lhotse and Nuptse.  Changatse in Tibet is 
also visible from the summit.  We also get a good panoramic view of Amadablam (6,812m.), 
Tawoche (6,501m.) and Kusum Kanguru (6,367m.), completely in a different angle.<P>

We also have the option to visit Everest Ice fall or Expedition Base Camp, depending on 
how fit we are when we are at Gorakshep.<P>

Return journey is made via Dingboche, Thyangboche ( a famous monastery site much 
highlighted in the media by photographers, journalists and the heritage societies ), Namche, and 
finally to Lukla to conclude this Mt. Everest trek, as a experience of a life time. <P>

The Area being National Park itself, boasts of its varieties of <B>flora and fauna </B>- 
The spectacular wet rhododendron forests are interspersed with other various species. 
“<B>Rhododendron</B>” the national flower reaches heights of 18-19 metres and ranges in 
colour from white, Pinkish Red and Blood Red. There are over 30 species of Rhododendron in 
Nepal. The other species are <B>Hemlock, Oak, Yews, Silver fir, Blue pine, Spruce, 
Broad-leafed Maples, Laurels, Birch and under wet conditions Dwarf Bamboo and Shrub 
Rhododendron, in dry areas Juniper species. </B>Whereas vegetation<I> above 4,000 
metres to snowline</I> are in extreme diversity and only such species survives like - 
<B>the Primula, Gention, Saxifrage, Butter cups, Eldeweiss and of course the 
Stellard.</B><p>

<U>Birds</U> - <B>Golden Eagle, Eurasian Kestrel, Goshawk, Red billed, Yellow-
billed choughs, Flocks of snow-pigeons, Impeyan pheasant, Blood pheasant, crimson-
horned Pheasant and the Tibetan snow-cocks screeching among the dwarf Juniper and 
vultures - Himalayan Griffon and Lamergeir and the famous Himalayan Monal every 
where.</B><p>

<U>Animals</U> - <B>barking deers</B> at lower elevation, often heard 
calling (for the mate) rather than seen. <B>Musk Deers </B>and <B>herds of ‘ 
Himalayan Tahrs”</B> (wild mountain goats), are quite visible from the trekking trail 
through Gokyo, Khumjung and Phortse to Dingboche.<P>

<B>The Sagarmatha National Park</B>, is a World Heritage Site. So, its your heritage 
also - therefore, lets keep the area clean and  pollution free.<P>
