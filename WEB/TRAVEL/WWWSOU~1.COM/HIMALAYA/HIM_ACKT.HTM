<b>Annapurna Circuit </b>”, the only trek that makes Nepal so special ...

The popularity of the Annapurna region is entirely understandable as one can see 
and   enjoy the most dramatic breathtaking scenery than any where else in 
the world.<p>

The dramatic deep valleys and mountain scenery is the reason for this trek, and the 
experience is truly awe-inspiring.  With our trekking crews we will be plodding on into 
this region exploring through rarely trekked high altitude routes.
<P>
This is definitely going to be a strenuous trek, passing through a 
<B>tremendous 
range of ecological zones </B>from sub-tropical to alpine.  It is also culturally diverse 
and we will be meeting Hindu Gurung and Magar people in the South, Buddhist 
Manangis or Manangba  and Thakali in the Northern part of the zone.  <B>It is or will 
be the real Circuit  for us.</B> <P>

We should be now prepared for <B>hot</B> going and early starts.  
Adventure starts from Gorkha (3,937ft. / 1,200m.) - the hillock town, that is 18 km. (5 
hours drive) away to North from Kathmandu city. Gorkha was the name given to the 
fearsome Nepalese soldiers, as the world famous Gurkha soldiers hail from this place 
so  the name has derived in the  same way for this place. To highlight one  out of many, 
is the spectacularly situated fortified Durbar (palace) at Gorkha is well worth seeing, 
which was built by the great King Ram Shah.  And the Great Prithvi Naryan Shah is 
the founder of the modern Nepal unifying the scattered kingdoms from the famous 
palace of Gorkha, hence it is the ancestral home of the Shah Kings of Nepal. Gorkha 
Durbar is certainly one of the most outstanding examples of Nepalese architecture.<P>

Our route follows two major river valleys the Marshyangdi and the Kaligandaki, 
later crossing between them over the high Thorang La Pass (5,416 metre.).<P>

We will be going up the Marshyangdi valley alongside the river banks.  A scenic 
side trek through the wild back-country side.  <B>Enroute high lights</B> - are the 
strange villages of the area, that was not opened to foreign travelers until 1977. As you 
will see/find out for yourself the country is very arid, dominated by weird cliffs of 
yellow rock eroded into dramatic pillars alongside the trail and by the lowering heights 
of the Himalaya across.  <B>Manang</B> as one. <B>Manang</B> village is 
situated on a plateau at 3,535 metres. We will be spending a day here in Manang 
village for rest.   The people of the villages of Manang are Buddhists by religion - and 
they are traders, many of them world travelers and some of them may have traveled 
farther on the globe than any one of you or  me. <P>

We continue further  ascending again, following the river banks up towards the 
Thorang La Pass at 17,769ft./ 5,416m., the highest Pass on this trek.  The views from 
the Pass itself are outstanding high Himalayan breathtaking scenes, perhaps even more.  
The Pass can be very difficult or impossible in the winter.  Crossing this Thorang La 
Pass is a major undertaking, unless we have the requisite experience, equipment and 
adequate clothing.<P>

Crossing this Berlin Wall like Himalayan High Pass 5,416 metre, we enter to a 
completely new world of the Kaligandaki valley. We stop at Muktinath for a day 
before descending down toward the Kaligandaki Gorge passing, through several 
interesting villages like Jomsom ( 2,713m.), Marpha (2,665m.), Tukuche &amp  Ghasa 
(2.042m.), popularly known as Thak Khola Valley as well.<P>

At Tatopani (1,520m.) we cross the deepest gorge in the world at 2,000 metres, 
walled by two highest <B>Himalayan Pyramids; <B>Annapurna I 
(8,014m) and Dhaulagiri I (8,000m</B>), thereby exiting the Northern flank of the 
<B>ANNAPURNAS</B>. We enter the forest belt at Ghorapani (2,850m.). 
Ghorapani, <I>perhaps one of the best few view points in Nepal,</I> offers most 
majestic views of the Dhaulagiri and Annapurna Massif and finally we are completely 
at the Southern flanks of the <B>Annapurnas. </B>Certainly this trek has given us 
every bit of the circuit-trek environment. </B><P>

The trek finally takes through many interesting villages to arrive at Pokhara, a 
most popular destination with its famed Phewa Lake dominated by towering 8,000 
metre Peaks of Annapurna &amp  Dhaulagiri just 15 to 20 km distance away.<P>

<B>Flora and Fauna</B> --- The spectacular wet rhododendron forests are 
interspersed with other various species. “<B>Rhododendron</B>” the national flower 
reaches heights of 18-19 metres and ranges in colour from white, Pinkish Red and 
Blood Red. There are over 30 species of Rhododendron in Nepal. The other 
<B>conifer species of trees found are the Sal, Acacia,
Rosewood, Silky cotton trees, Chestnut, walnut, Oak Hemlock 
Alder, Birch, Silver fir, Bluepine and the Maples etc.</B><P>

<U><b>Birds</b></U> - there are many small and as well as the large birds found along 
the water courses - the <B>Thrushes, White capped river chat, Plumbeous 
redstart, Little fork tail, Whistling thrush, Large pied king fisher, White breasted 
king fisher, Eurasian king fisher, Brown dipper, the White breasted dipper and 
vultures - Himalayan Griffon and Lamergeir .</B><p>

<U><b>Animals</b></U> - like the rhesus <B>Macaque and common Langur 
monkeys, Yellow-Throated Marten, Himalayan Weasels</B> and the 
<B>Ghoral</B> - a wild goat that still roam the high grassy moraines and can 
still be seen, if you are lucky. There are lot more different species of wild animals 
found here. <P>

<b>Annapurna Conservation Area</B> -  the Annapurna Conservation Area 
covers 2600 sq. km covering the famous Annapurna Sanctuary as well. The 
conservation area is run by a non-governmental, nonprofit organization (the Annapurna 
Conservation Area Project, or <B>ACAP</B>) which is funded by various 
International Trusts.  Its primary objectives are to improve local standards of living, to 
protect the environment and develop more sensitive as well as sustainable   Himalayan 
Tourism. <P>
