At the Southern flank of the mighty Himalayan Range lies the famous destination of 
Pokhara with it’s famed Lake Phewa, dominated by towering 8,000 metre  Peaks of 
Annapurna &amp  Dhaulagiri just 15 to 20 km. distance away.<P>

Our adventure begins from this exotic valley of <B>Pokhara</B> town. The town 
itself is a long bazaar in length, extending for more than 2 miles. Towards the North of 
the valley we can witness for ourselves the wonderful gems - the White Himals: 
Dhaulagiri (8,167m.), Annapurna Summits and the Lamjung (6,983m.) and Manaslu 
(8,163m.). And of- course the first mountain peak that catches our eyes at a glance is 
the majestic Machhapuchhre ‘Fish Tail’  mountain . <P>

<b>Now the FUN starts :</b>  From the bagar bazaar of Pokhara, we follow the 
ancient trail ascending the Kaligandaki Valley Gorge, passing through terraced rice 
fields, strange and unique villages of Hyangja, Suikhet  reaching toward South to the 
base of the hill ‘Phedi’.  The trail again makes a climb to the village of Naudanda 
situated on a ridge. From ridge top we have the stunning views of the Annapurna - 
Lamjung massif. The trail proceeds along the ridge line to Khare, then drop down on to 
Lumle. A village where Ex-Gurkha soldiers learn farming. From here we proceed 
toward the “Moon Town” - Chandrakot perched on the edge of the hill overlooking 
Modi Khola Valley. From here we have the distinctive view of the Mountain 
“Machhapuchhre”.  Steep downhill to river side village of <B>Birethanti</B>, is the 
starting point of our trek.<P>
We roller-coaster further on up along the Bhurungdi valley towards the “Horse 
Watering - Place” where ancient old Inns are still existing - it is called Ghorapani.<P>

We pass many interesting villages in between - Hille, Tirkhedhunga. At 
<B>Tirkhedhunga</B> we stop - camp for the night. After Tirkhedhunga we then 
climb steeply up to a Magar village town of- Ulleri (it is said that highest percentage is 
comprised by the Magars from here, in the overseas famous Gurkha Soldiers). From 
Ulleri we will find out the views back toward Pokhara, strikingly outstanding. We can 
realize now that we are more than half way from the Horse Watering Place.  
Contouring along the way we pass on the settlements of Banthanti, Nayathanti then 
reaching to this place - the <B>Ghorapani</B>, crammed into Deurali (Pass). The 
Pass “Deurali” a forested ridge having a only Chautaara (Resting place) that surround 
a huge tree. But, to this day - funny to our ears is that, this place Ghorapani has become 
the most popular spot in the Annpurna region. And we will be camping here for the 
night.  Over here the next day, will be resting and exploring - going on short excursion. 
<P>

We proceed on past the campsite along the ridge line with our journey following 
the trail through rhododendron forest towards the large village town of Ghandrung. 
Along the way we pass a Deurali 2,987 metre (Pass) and descend steeply heading south 
to Bhainsi Kharka (Buffalo pasture land) towards <B>Tadapani</B> “distant water”. 
From Tadapani we then take the left side trail climbing down the hill to this famous 
Gurung village of <B>Ghandrung</B> - the 2nd largest village town of Gurungs in 
Nepal. This village is also the project headquarters of Annapurna Conservation Area 
(ACA). It consists of clusters of slate-roofed houses with stone courtyards. Form high 
point we will have the breathtaking views of the mountain peaks - Machhapuchhre, 
Hiunchuli and the Annapurna South, that we have ever seen before.<P>

Our trail  continues from here through the trees and along the river banks, passing 
through terraced fields, then at one point crossing a small suspension bridge. After 
crossing the bridge the trail lead us to a village of <B>Landrung</B>, another of the 
large Gurung village up the hillside. Onward from this village we head along towards 
Dhampus. In between, we pass  along several tiny settlements and villages like Tolka, 
Bheri Kharka, Bhikshuk Deurali (Pass 2,100m.) and village Pothana, as our trail wind 
around the two side valleys and finally reaching to a village of <B>Dhampus</B>. 
Dhampus village is most oftenly visited by all class of tourists especially from Pokhara 
side and they halt for a night to watch the glorious golden sunrise over the mountains 
the next morning.<P>
Passing by our campsite at Dhampus, we carry on down the Mardi Khola Valley 
following the river downstream until arriving at the roadhead near Hyangja. We 
conclude the trek, driving  to Lake Phewa for the last night camp of our 9 days 
journey.  After this portion is over, we can extend our holiday further, possibly  the 
optional venture e.g. - River Rafting and the Chitwan Wildlife Safari. <P>
