<p align=center><font size=6><b>To open more employment outlets<br>
</b></font></p>
<p align=center><font size=4><b>By Gyan Rai</b></font> </p>
<p><font size=4>THE government, with a view to judi-ciously solve the burgeoning 
unemployment problem that has been persistently defying concerted 
prescriptive measures for long, has come out with out with a blueprint 
that has yet to prove its efficacy to overcome this employment 
hurdle.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>For one, it has instituted a high-level commission. Another, 
employment generation bodies are going to be established right at the 
VDC (village development committee) level and at each tier, they are 
to be manned by government and people&iacute;s representatives. This is 
being done to ensure maximum participation and representation of the 
people. Still another is that it has come out with a tentative outline as 
to how it would be going about to achieve its aim: herein, giving over 
60,000 unemployed citizens the opportunities to stand on their own 
feet, thereby affording them the chance to contribute their share in the 
nation&iacute;s development endeavours.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4><b>Urgent necessity</b></font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Generating adequate employment opportunities, apart from being an 
urgent necessity, is easier said than done in the country. Lack of 
enough outlets in the form of industries and service-oriented 
enterprises to absorb the growing unemployed workforce coupled 
with the absence of the much-needed resources for the government to 
fulfill the required pre-requisites to generate employment 
opportunities are always there to impede the moves of the 
government to open up more employment outlets for the unemployed 
citizens. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Yet, merely citing such reasons by the concerned authorities without 
making concerted efforts to overcome them will, needless to say, not 
solve this burning problem. In fact, it would be only aggravating it the 
more. But letting this unemployment problem to fester on could lead 
to socio-economic dislocations&oacute;which, in turn, could throw a 
spanner in the nation&iacute;s development drive. As such, while the need 
for the government to come up with appropriate programmes to 
generate employment opportunities is always there, it also looks to 
reason for the government to explore other avenues to open up more 
employment outlets. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Herein, what needs to be pointed out is that though the government&iacute;s 
efforts alone would not be enough to make available more 
employment chances, it still can act as a catalyst to pave the way 
towards the same. Provided, of course, it comes up with the 
much-needed determination backed by a willingness to harness the 
available resources by tapping the inherent potentials of the people.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Amongst the few such avenues available for both the nation and the 
government so far, one is definitely the tourism sector. More 
especially the hitherto untapped tourism potentials dotting the nook 
and corner of the country. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>As all know by now, even though Mother Nature seems to have 
completely forgotten to bestow on Nepal her largesse in the form of 
commercially exploitable mineral resources, as if to compensate this 
oversight, she has filled the country with a variety of natural resources 
which, in turn, have the potentials to cater to the varied interests and 
needs of all Nepal visitors. The yearly increasing number of tourists 
flocking to the country in pursuit of their respective interests is 
enough proof that the country does possess such touristic sites. 
While these Nepal visitors are pursuing their touristic interests, they 
are not only generating the much-coveted foreign exchange for the 
state coffers but are also sustaining as well as opening employment 
opportunities for the people. Particularly for those living in and 
around the tourist spots and sites or along the numerous trekking, 
mountaineering and white water rafting trails. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>This will be very much apparent to all if they care to walk the 
popularly used trails to one trekking, mountaineering and white water 
rafting site or the other. Or, for that matter, if they go on sight-seeing 
tours of religious, historic or cultural sites located either in the urban 
enclaves or rural areas. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>That the nation, endowed as it is with rich yet varied cultural and 
natural settings, has yet to harness such endowments to the hilt by 
tapping their potentials through appropriate measures is by now also 
well-known to all. More particularly to the government and the people 
living in such spots which, till date, have remained off the tourism&iacute;s 
beaten trails, thereby forfeiting them from the chances of being 
tapped and exposed to tourism traffic. In fact, it would not be off the 
mark to note that almost every district&oacute;of which there are 75&oacute;of the 
country has at least one such a tourism-potential site having either 
historic, cultural, religious, sites or trekking or even white water 
rafting potentials.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>From amongst such numerous spots having tourism potentials, the 
Khaptad area, located in the Far Western Development region and 
touching at least three districts, is one. The area, apart from having 
religious significance due to the hamlet occupied by the late Saint (or 
Baba) of Khaptad, is also endowed with spectacular natural scenery 
and charm. Yet, its full religious and tourism potentials are still 
begging to be optimally harnessed by both the local populace and the 
concerned tourism authorities. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>But not for long. Especially if we are to go by the reports concerning 
the formation of a Khaptad area tourism committee with the objective 
of developing the Khaptad area as a religious-cum-tourism site. 
Herein, many a detractor (of which there seems to be quite a handful) 
might point out that tourism-related business and employment 
opportunities are, at best, seasonal in nature. Nevertheless, at a time 
when there are hardly enough adequate employment openings in other 
sectors to absorb the yearly increasing legions of unemployed 
youths, the formation of the Khaptad area tourism committee can be 
termed as a laudable and exemplary initiative.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>For one, instead of just letting things lying down, thereby allowing the 
tourism and religious potentials of the famous Khaptad area to remain 
dormant in the bargain, the concerned people and authorities, on their 
own, have initiated a tentative step towards harnessing the area&iacute;s 
inherent plus points. Though only time will tell as to whether or not 
their joint move will be realising their common objective, what indeed 
is noteworthy is that the local populace seem to have realised that 
until and unless they themselves initiate the necessary moves to uplift 
their own socio-economic status by tapping their available resources 
and potentials, nothing worthwhile would be happening in their area. 
This self-reliance and initiative on the part of the local people and 
their representatives should, therefore, only not be praised by all but 
also emulated by the people of other areas having tourism potentials.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Of course, desiring to harness the tourism potentials on the part of 
the populace by forming a committee is one thing and making it come 
true is quite another. Especially when the local people lack the 
necessary means, expertise and manpower to develop the area having 
tourism potential. Despite all this, the very fact that the Khaptad 
area&iacute;s local people and their representatives have realised the 
importance of pooling available resources if their common objective 
is to be gained shows that they are indeed seeking out possible 
solutions to the obstacles blocking their way. And where there is a 
will, there will always be a way. Given the steps initiated by them, 
there is every reason to hope that their aim, sooner or later, will be 
realised.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>In this regard, of interest to note is that the committee, apart from 
having the people&iacute;s representatives from four districts (Achham, 
Bajhang, Bajura and Doti) to the Lower House of the Parliament as 
well as the district development committees, has have secretaries of 
the ministries of Tourism and Civil Aviation, Forest and Soil 
Conservation, Finance, and Law and Justice as its members. This 
should a long way in addressing the resource, expertise and 
manpower needs of the local people there as they go about in 
developing Khaptad area into a popular tourist and pilgrimage site.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>No doubt, the local people and their representatives have still to 
overcome many challenges which could range from limited resources 
to virtually non-existent expertise and manpower, absence of the 
necessary tourism-related infrastructure to the lack of required 
transport facilities to reach the area. Despite all this, it is imperative 
that the concerned ministries, agencies and authorities tender all 
assistance at their disposal. For, by doing so, not only would the 
scenic Khaptad area be place firmly in the nation&iacute;s tourism map and 
trail but, in the bargain, adequate employment opportunities for the 
local people would be generated by the tourism-related businesses 
and services that will be established in the area once Khaptad is fully 
developed as a tourist spot. </font></p>
<p><font size=4><b>Potentials</b></font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Towards this end, coordinated strategies are a must, especially 
between the tourism authorities and the newly constituted 
employment generation commission. For, this is one sector which has 
all the potentials to not only augment the nation&iacute;s coffers but also 
absorb the unemployed people and youths living in and around areas 
having tourism potentials.<br>
