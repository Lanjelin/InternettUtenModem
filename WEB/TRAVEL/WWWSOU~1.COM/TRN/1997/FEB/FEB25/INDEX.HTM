Thimi (Bhaktapur), Feb 24 (RSS): </p>
<p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba inaugurated the eighth national workshop on 
the tuberculosis control programme at the National Tuberculosis Centre today. </p>
<p>Some 600 people including district health officers, public health officers, 
tuberculosis and leprosy workers and representatives of national and international 
NGOs are participating in the three day seminar jointly organised by the Health 
Ministry and the JICA National Tuberculosis Control Project. </p>
<p>Tuberculosis experts from SAARC member countries, Japan, Norway, Germany, 
France and the United Kingdom are also participating in the workshop. </p>
<p>In his inaugural address, Prime Minister Deuba underlined the need to attain 
success in TB control through joint effort as in the case of national immunization 
day. </p>
<p>Our services should reach all remote rural areas, he said stressing the need to 
make the flow of information in TB control more affective. </p>
<p>He appreciated the cooperation the Japanese government has been extending to 
Nepal in TB control work for the past 10 years. </p>
<p>From the chair, Assistant Health Minister Suresh Chandra Das emphasized the 
need to identify TB patients in rural areas as many such patients remain 
unidentified. </p>
<p>Japanese ambassador Tomohiko Yanase said Tuberculosis has after many years 
emerged as a serious problem in the developing countries. The directly observed 
treatment (DOTS) short course has been quite effective in TB control in Nepal, he 
observed. </p>
<p>Director of the National Tuberculosis Centre and the SAARC tuberculosis centre 
Dr Dirgha Singh Bom disclosed that three million additional TB cases are recorded 
every year in the SAARC region and the World Health Organization has agreed to 
support TB control programmes in South East Asia. </p>

BY A STAFF REPORTER</em></font><em> </em></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Kathmandu, Feb. 24:</em></font><em> </em></p>
<p><font size=4>Tug of war between the two factions of CPN-UML continues in its 
central committee meeting that began Sunday. As a counter move 
against Bamdev Gautam faction, which is seeking ouster of 
incumbent general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, the 
pro-Madhav Nepal group today registered a set of written charges 
against Bam Dev Gautam. Mr. Gautam had registered a charge 
sheet against general secretary Nepal Sunday and sought his 
resignation.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Ishwar Pokhrel today registered the counter charge sheet against 
Gautam. The charge sheet accuses Gautam of creating division in 
the party, deviating from party principles, tarnishing the party 
image among the supporters and the people, instigating workers 
and supporters against the central leadership and party decision.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>&quot;These irresponsible activities promoted by some elements within 
the party leadership have polluted and weakened the organization,&quot; 
says the written charge put forward by Mr. Pokhrel, warning that 
the self centered attitude would push the party backward and 
ultimately lead to collapse.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Pokhrel also accused Gautam of being involved in corruption and 
financial irregularities during the nine month period of CPN-UML 
government. &quot;If we can not maintain strict financial discipline, how 
can the party boost morale of the workers and supporters,&quot; he 
said. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Pokhrel charged that former deputy general secretary and the 
current standing committee member for working at his petty 
interest instead of larger interest of the party and the nation.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Another central leader who spoke at today's meeting was Mod 
Nath Prashrit. Prashrit defended general secretary Nepal and 
accused Mr. Gautam of hatching conspiracy against the party 
organization. &quot;There is no justification behind the demand of 
general secretary's ouster at a time when the sixth national 
convention is coming very soon', Mr. Prashrit said.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Today's move came as the counter move against the Gautam's 
group which registered a written charge sheet Sunday demanding 
the resignation of general secretary Nepal. In his charge sheet, Mr. 
Gautam accused Mr. Nepal of creating groups within the party and 
being unable to lead the party properly.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Mr. Gautam's camp that has been seeking general secretary's 
ouster includes C.P. Mainali, Radha Krishna Mainali, Sahana 
Pradhan, Jhala Nath Khanal, among others. Gautam camp wants 
Mr. Jhala Nath Khanal to be the next general secretary of the party. 
Gautam camp also wants to remove Mr. Ishwar Pokhrel and 
Pradip Nepal, both central committee members, from the party's 
central secretariat. Those who want Mr. Nepal's continuation as 
general secretary are Bharat Mohan Adhikari, Amrit Bohora, K.P. 
Sharma Oli, Ishwar Pokhrel, Mod Nath Prashrit among some 
others.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Both camps claim their majority in the central committee. The final 
decision is expected Wednesday. Chairman Man Mohan Adhikari 
is against any move that creates split in the party and has been 
calling upon all to discourage any attempt against party unity. 
However, both Nepal and Gautam camps have ruled out the 
possibility of division in the party, irrespective of the outcome of 
the central committee meeting.<br>

<p align=left><font size=5><b>Nepal supports extension of NPT: Lohani</b></font><font size=1> </font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>BY A STAFF REPORTER </em></font></p>
<p><font size=4><em>Kathmandu, Feb 24:</em></font><em> </em></p>
<p><font size=4>Diplomats, policy-makers and experts from more than 25 countries 
gathered in Kathmandu to discuss nuclear disarmament for 
creating peace in Asia and the Pacific region. Participants in the 
three day meeting on &euml;Nuclear Disarmament in the Post-CTBT Era 
emphasized the need for forging regional consensus on topical and 
important issues like peace and disarmament. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Participants also exchanged views concerning the entry into force 
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) prohibition 
in production of nuclear weapons and other materials like 
explosive devices. The meeting also aimed to discuss the 
preparatory process of the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty review 
conference scheduled to be held in 2000.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>The Ninth Regional Disarmament Meeting started today in 
Kathmandu under the aegis of United Nations Regional Centre for 
Peace and Disarmament Affairs in Asia and the Pacific. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The meeting will explore priorities in the field of nuclear 
disarmament after the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear 
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by the 50th General Assembly session 
held last September. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Addressing the opening session of the programme, Minister for 
Foreign Affairs Dr. Lohani reiterated the commitment of Nepal for 
peace and disarmament. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>&igrave;Nepal is making efforts for disarmament. We are in the process of 
ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention and have supported 
indefinite extension of NPT. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Nepal has already signed CTBT which will come for ratification in 
time. We are also strong supporter of micro-disarmament,&icirc; Dr. 
Lohani said. A durable peace can reliably be founded on the pillars 
of international understanding, equality, justice and development. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>It must be consistently nurtured and reinforced with cooperation, 
transparency and mutual confidence among actors at national, 
regional, and global levels, he said and added it demands a new 
culture of security built on lower reliance on arms and higher 
element of mutual cooperation and confidence. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>He said unprecedented progress in transport and communication 
has what was once a large world reduced to a global village in our 
time. So have the deadly weapons and their delivery systems that 
can precisely hit the targets and kill and injure millions of people 
half a world away. It is ironic that human beings have spent so 
much of scarce resources to destroy this one world many times 
over, but so little to fight its poverty and underdevelopment, 
Minister Dr. Lohani viewed. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>&igrave;Nepal believes, nuclear weapons due to their devastating potential, 
are practically unusable. But that does not preclude the possibility 
of accidents or of their desperate use as weapons of last resort.&icirc; 
Dr. Lohani further said that exorbitant cost and complexity 
involved in producing, storing,maintaining and destroying, them 
raise serious doubts about nuclear safety even in peace times. 
These weapons should, therefore, receive priority in disarmament 
agenda. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>An uneasy peace at the global level, interspersed with regional 
hostilities, has become the hallmark of the post war era. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The Asian- Pacific region like some others has its share of 
discords and security problems. And Ethnic diversity, territorial 
disputes, developmental inequities and social injustice, further 
aggravated by colonial legacies and cold war cracks have sown the 
seeds of mutual distrust. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The deep distrust renders the region susceptible to conflicts. 
Dialogues are a fundamental necessity to reverse the situation and 
create a climate of trust in the region. Disarmament is a key 
ingredient of regional dialogues, he said, however it can hardy be 
addressed in isolation of global disarmament.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Mr. Prvoslav Davinic, Director of Centre for Disarmament 
appreciated Nepal&iacute;s efforts towards establishing peace in the 
region. Mr. Davinic said the meeting would help strengthen the 
move for regional understanding towards maintaining peace in the 
region. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>He said that the experts from different nations would exchange 
their views about openness and transparency in military matters, 
regional security and the illegal flow of small weapons. He 
expressed belief that the regional meeting would gather diverse 
views about maintaining peace in the region.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>Regarding the objective of the regional meeting held here, Mr. 
Davinic said a wide participation from various countries has given 
a fillip to the disarmament campaign. However, the meeting will be 
very informal which would help built better understanding and 
develop a common consensus. Approximately 35 participants 
from government, academic and research institutes and 
non-governmental organisations mainly from Asia and the Pacific 
region participated in the three day meeting.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>The Centre for Disarmament Affairs in New York had decided to 
convene this meeting here on February 11. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The New York based office of Centre for Disarmament Affairs has 
three regional offices in Latin America (Lima of Peru), South 
Africa and Asia- Pacific. Its regional office established in 
Kathmandu in 1989 has already held such regional programmes in 
the past. <br>
