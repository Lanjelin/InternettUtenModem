<p>Music does not know boundaries neither Sur Sudha. Since the last decade, Sur Sudha 
has been relentlessly preforming its musical programme abroad, representing typical 
traditional classical music, creating a large number of listeners who love music for 
music sake. </p>
<p>Unquestionably, Sur Sudha is the only musical group in Nepal which has become 
synonymous to Nepali music in many countries. </p>
<p>Sur Sudha, a name to be reckoned with in traditional Nepali music, has been in the 
limelight for a decade due to its total commitment and dedication to music. </p>
<p><i>Sur Sudha consists of Prem Rana Autari in Flute, Bijaya Vaidya in Sitar and 
Surendra Shrestha on Tabala. </i></p>
<p>These three talented musicians have built a reputation for their innovative 
interpretations of traditional Nepali tunes, while at the same time composing many 
original pieces which stretch the parameters of the formal trio setting. </p>
<p>The results of these efforts can be heard on the &quot;The Nepal Series&quot;, &quot;Melodies&quot; and 
the just released two other CDs. </p>
<p>The &quot;Melodies of Nepal&quot;, &quot;Festival Of Nepal&quot; and The &quot;Nepali Series&quot; will be 
released on Friday (in Singapore) internationally through Universal Music (formally 
MCA Music Entertainment). This collection showcases the virtuosity of the individual 
musicians and offers the listeners an opportunity to take a musical journey through 
Nepal: from the Terai to the remote areas nestled high in the mighty Himalayas. </p>
<p>In the course of musical tour, Sur Sudha has travelled extensively in Europe, America 
and many Asian countries, including Japan. </p>
<p>In appreciation of its magical musical performances, Sur Sudha has received a number 
of national and international awards. </p>
<p>So far Sur Sudha has produced &quot;Images of Nepal&quot;, &quot;Festival Tunes of Nepal&quot;, folk 
semi-classical and classical music. Images of Nepal is about the dream of Shangri-La 
which people can feel through music. </p>
<p>Apart from this, Sur Sudha's also is now planning to bring out three CDs immediately, 
based on Nepali tourism, culture, heritage and religion. All CDs are being prepared to 
promote Nepali tourism abroad by highlighting the beauties of Nepal in the wake of 
Visit Nepal Year (VNY) 1998. </p>
<p>This apart, plan has been made for Sur Sudha to visit Japan, America and Europe for 
musical programmes beginning from April. This is the first time that any cultural troupe 
is going to disseminate information about VNY on its own expenses. </p>
<p>These CDs are produced by Universal Music, distributed by BMG Records, 
administered by Warner/Chappel and published by Schtung Records in 120 countries 
world-widely. </p>
<p>Founded in Hong Kong in 1982, Schtung now has a total of 7 digital studios in Hong 
Kong and Singapore. There are 12 composers in the group, eight of whom are 
currently developing album projects. </p>
<p>Universal Music is one of the largest distributors of musical albums in the world. This is 
the first time Nepali CDs are being distributed by such big companies. </p>
<p>Their ongoing pursuit of taking traditional Nepali music to the world, while at the same 
time experimenting with styles and musicians from different cultures, proves that the 
members of Sur Sudha as true musical pioneers.<font size=4> <br>
