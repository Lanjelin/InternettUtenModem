<B>K</B>athmandu,  the capital of Nepal today boasts four casinos in
each of its four 5-star hotels.  <LIT>Current government</LIT> policy permits
only 5-star hotels to operate casinos and thats why there is no
other casino.  The number went up from one to four  within a period
of about a year and a half.  Three casinos opened between January
1992 and May 1993.  This meant that competition  become much keener
and customers can get some of the best deals, in terms of complimentary
rooms, food and beverage etc.

Everyone who has been to Nepal is familiar with the oldest casino
that started in Kathmandu.
<P>
Its history, almost 30 years old, is one that is full of fun and
excitement for people from the Indian subcontinent. It is situated
 at the &quot;Soaltee Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza&quot;  (the leading
and the oldest 5 star hotel in Nepal).  There is a subsidized
dinner for players every night and an entertainment program as
well.
<P>
The casino is housed in a mammoth 20,000 sq ft. building and is
the biggest casino in Nepal.  The casino has very liberal rules
and you will be  comped in either a villa a few minutes walk from
the casino or the adjacent &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; if your play
is at a moderate level.<P>

In 1992, Casino Anna, located on the premises of 'Hotel De'l Annapurna'
opened its doors and it immediately drew huge crowds.  It is the
best located casino, being right in the center of Durbar Marg
- the premier place for shopping as well.  The casino is built
on 3 floors.  The ground floor  is for the children and has slot
machines.  The 1st floor has the gaming tables while the top floor
is reserved for tournaments and gets busy only on Saturdays.
<P>
If  you are in a mood for serious gambling  and do not want to
be disturbed, you should proceed straight to the 1st floor and
indulge in whatever engages your fancy, whether it be blackjack,
baccarat, roulette or Kitty - the recently introduced 9 card flush
type game. (Simplified Indian version of poker).
<P>
For all moderate players  the food and drinks are on the house.
 Your room will be comped if your play meets the house's requirements
of minimum bet and number of hours of play.  Negotiate well.
