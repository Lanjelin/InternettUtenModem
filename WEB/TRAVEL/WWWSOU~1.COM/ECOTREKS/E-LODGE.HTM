<B>We are offering a selection of lodge based treks to the popular routes in Nepal.   The Annapurna, Everest and Langtang-Helambu areas present some of the best known  trails of Nepal. Along these trails there have developed many locally run lodges catering to trekkers. Most of these lodges are very comfortable and charmingly appointed family-run  establishments. Our lodge treks are the best way to trek in these areas. We provide  excellent local guides, porters to carry luggage, all meals and accommodation in village  lodges along the way. Trekkers carry a small day pack only and walk at an easy pace. Our  lodge treks make it possible for visitors to sample the best of Nepal treks and at a cost no others can offer.</B></td>

<I><B>Our Lodge Treks Offer the Best of Both Worlds - Great Routes
and Lodge Accommodation</B></I> </center>
<P>
The development of locally managed lodges along the popular trekking trails in the Annapurna, Everest and Langtang/Helambu areas have resulted in an increased number of trekkers making use of these facilities. In recent years with the help of Government as well non-Government agencies many of these lodge owners have gone through training programmes aimed at raising the quality of services as well as instilling environmental awareness. For example in the Annapurna Sanctuary and adjacent areas it is now regulation for all lodge owners to use alternative fuel (fuel other than fire wood - kerosene, gas, electric or even solar) for cooking and heating, dispose of garbage properly and adopt other eco-friendly measures. Most lodges have all the basic requirements for trekkers to stay overnight - a dormitory, several private rooms, an attached restaurant, toilet and a shower room. The quality of food offered may vary from lodge to lodge but most serve simple and hygienic meals.
<P>
Getaway Eco-Treks has found it very attractive for trekkers to use these lodges in some of the routes instead of operating camping style treks. One of the main reason being that along these popular routes almost every house offers bed and meals and many camping trekkers find it incongruous to camp near a lodge and not be able to experience the warmth and hospitality of the friendly Nepali  hosts. The other important reason being that this helps the local economies directly by using the fascilities along the route.
<P>
Keeping this in mind we have been operating Lodge-Treks in some of these classic routes. To make sure that our guests do not get disappointed we stay in the best or most interesting lodge in each place. With larger groups we reserve all the beds in a lodge thus making sure that we have the place to ourserves. Our groups are provided with an excellent Guide and porters - possibly from the area you are trekking in - to guide you and carry your luggage while you hike only with a day-pack. A majority of our Lodge Trekkers have been overwhelmed by the homely atmosphere and the grace of their hosts and many have made great friends with them.
<P>
If you have an urge to trek in some of the most beautiful places in Nepal, interact and make friends with the local people withtout having to sleep in a cold and lonely tent, Lodge Trekking is just the thing for you. Make sure you are with Getaway Eco-Treks and we will make sure that you have a memorable time without having to spend a small fortune.

<center><font size=+1.5><B><A NAME="WD">WHAT DOES</A> OUR LODGE-TREKS INCLUDE ?</B></font> <BR>
<B>(Why Our Lodge-Treks Are The Best Way To Go)</B></center> <p>
<B>Services Of An Experienced Local Guide</B> <BR>
All our trek guides have been carefull selected for their ability
and temperament. Most of them belong to Sherpa, Tamang, Gurung
and Magar communities from remote mountain villages. All of them
have many years of experience of trekking and climbing in Nepal
and Tibet. Each guide has training and proven abilities in eco-friendly
methods, safety and, careful trek operations, keeping the health
and happiness of the trekkers as well his crew, uppermost. Our
guides are committed to making sure that all our trekkers have
an enjoyable trek, comes back safe and are overwhelmed by their
experience. Your guide will be a friend and companion, who takes
pleasure in showing you his country's specialities and, perhaps,
meet his home and family too.
<P>
<B>Services Of Porters/Pack-animals to Carry Luggage and Equipment</B>
<BR>
Where ever possible we employ porters/pack-animals locally at
the begining of the trek. This is one of the many measures we
take to make sure that most of the cost our clients pays goes
directly into the local economies where you trek. All our porters,
as all our field staff, are covered by insurance and, on high
altitude treks, are issued warm clothing and footwear to prepare
them better. Porters who prove themselves are choosen for training
as trek helpers, cooks and guides, thus giving them an avenue
to improve the quality of their life.
<P>
<B>Accommodation In Best Available Lodges</B> <BR>
Our lodge treks include accommodation in the best available lodge
at each stop. Lodges have a common dormitory sleeping 6 or more
people with an attached restaurant and basic toilet facilities.
Many also have a few private rooms for two or three persons each..
Solar heated shower rooms are avaiable at a small extra cost!
Along the more popular routes lodges are very comforatble and
charming, managed by friendly local families. As one gets higher,
to the base of high mountains, high passes and, in remote valleys,
lodges are more basic. In some of our high altitude lodge-treks
(eg: Thorung La and Cho La passes), trekkers may have to spend
a few nights with basic facilities, and make pass crossings or
explorations alpine style.
<P>
<B>All Meals While On Trek <BR>
</B>The trip includes three basic meals, breakfast, lunch and
dinner, each day. Breakfast and dinners are ordered at the restaurant
attached to the lodge run by the landlady. Lunches are ordered
at a trail-side lodge around mid-day. Most lodges serve, Nepali
meals - rice, lentil soup and curried vegetables or meat - soups,
noodles, momos (meat or veg-stuffed steamed dumplings), pancakes,
chappati breads, etc. Many also offer other exotic dishes. Your
guide will arrange for boiled water at dinner every evening to
fill your water bottle for the next day (bottled water are also
available at most lodges at extra cost).
<P>
<B>Roadhead Transport From Kathmandu Or Pokhara <BR>

The Annapurna Sanctuary offers the quickest way to get to high
Himalayan altitudes where glaciers replace rivers. We start by
ascending the foothills from Pokhara, appreciating the slate-roofed
tropical villages and magnificent rhododendron forests before
entering the narrow Modi Khola gorge. As we climb higher we get
to the hidden world of the Annapurna Sanctuary. The huge south
face of Annapurna (8,090m/26,535ft) provides an impressive backdrop,
while the closeness of 10 peaks over 6,000m/20,000ft, including
Hiunchuli, Fang, Annapurna III and Machapuchare (the Fish Tail
Peak), inspire a delicious joy as a fitting highlight of this
spectacular trek. On the return journey we will have a chance
to visit the beautiful village and the Gurung 'capital' of Gandruk
before heading back to Pokhara. A wonderful journey to the heart
of the Annapurnas.

The ancient trade route to Mustang and Tibet ,up the Kali Ghandaki
river, presents one of the most developed trekking trails offering
comfortable lodges run by Gurung and Thakali families. Starting
from Pokhara we ascend the Annapurna foothills through picturesque
Gurung villages and continue through lichen-draped rhododendron
forest to climb Poon Hill at dawn for spectacular views of Dhaulagiri
and Annapurna ranges. Later we will trek up the deepest valley
in the world situated between two Himalayan giants, Dhaulagiri
(8,167m/26,788ft.) and Annapurna (8,091m/26,538ft.). As we trek
up the Kali Gandaki valley we pass though the traditional and
prosperous villages of Tukuche, Ghasa, Marpha and Jomsom. The
Thakalis, a traditional traders, have converted their charming
and wonderfully clean homes into trekkers' lodges and are well
known as one of the most gracious and successful inn-keepers in
Nepal. Past Jomsom we reach the arid Tibet-like landscape of Mustang.
At Muktinath, set below the Thorung La pass, we have a day to
explore the temple and villages and enjoy wonderful mountain views
before taking the flight back from Jomsom.

<B>A Trek Around the Mighty Annapurna Massif - <I>The Classic
Trek</I> of Nepal</B> 

<p>
<B>Trek Cost: Minimum 2 Pax - US$ 885 Per Person</B></center>

<p>
This classic 21-day trek completely around the famed Annapurna
Massif offers the most diversity of any trek in Nepal: fascinating
ethnic groups each with their own language, incredible views of
many of the Himalaya's most famous high peaks, and constantly
changing panoramas - from lush, tropical rice paddies and moss-laden
rhododendron forests to Tibetan fortresses clinging to rocky cliffs.
<P>
Starting with a drive to Besisar we ascend along the Marsyangdi
river valley. We pass beneath snowcapped Annapurnas II, III and
IV and a range of 6,000m/20,000ft peaks stretching north to Tibet.
Crossing Thoroung La pass (5418m/17,770ft) to reach the holy shrine
of Muktinath. We then descend into the mighty Kali Ghandaki Valley
- the deepest river valley on the face of the earth - 7000m/23,000ft
deep between Dhaulagiri and Annapurna. At the end we trek through
a wonderful rhododendron forest on the Gorepani Ridge and the
picturesque Gurung villages before finishing back in the Pokhara
Valley.
<P>
As this is one of the most popular trekking routes in Nepal many
lodges catering to the needs of the trekkers have sprung up all
along this trail and we will be staying in one of these lodges
every night. Apart from being able to enjoy homely comforts we
will have the added advantage of being guests to families of different
ethnic people typical of this area. The Manang and the Kali Gandaki
valleys lies along an ancient trade route between India and China,
and a variety of ethnic peoples have settled here: Newars, Chettris,
Gurungs, Manangeys and Thakalis.
<P>
<B>Moderate to rigoruous trekking between 2,000m/8,000ft and 4,400m/14,500ft
with one pass crossing of 5,418m/17,700ft<I>.</I> . Accommodation

Starting with a 6 hour (188km/118miles) drive to Jiri (2,100m/6,888ft)
this trek follows the traditional route taken by the early Everest
expeditions and still serves as main artery to the roadless Sagarmatha
(Everest) region. Known as the Solu-Khumbu it is the home of the
Sherpas. This relatively tiny society of 8,000 people is the best
known and most admired of all Nepal's ethnic groups. According
to their oral history Sherpas migrated to high valleys south of
Mt. Everest from eastern Tibet about 450 years ago, hence the
name Shar-pa, &quot;peoples of the east.&quot; Many families along
this route have converted their homes into trekkers' lodges catering
to foreign hikers. Although a popular trekking route the Everest
area is visited by only some 8,000 visitors each year - a fraction
of the number that visits the Annapurna region. Trekking through
the Sherpa villages we share many of their hearths and enjoy their
generous hospitality. Trekking in from Jiri has the advantage
of helping you to acclimatise en route. This trek is about 190km/120miles
long and the total altitude gained on the inumerable uphill portions
totals 9000m - much higer even than Mt. Everest! After Namche
we follow the main trail to base camp (as per the 14-day Close
Encounter With Everest itinerary) with all its attraction. A legendary
trek to a legendary destination.

Park. Here the rare red pandas lurk in dense lichen-draped rhododendron
thickets, heards of blue sheep graze the alpine meadows and lammergeiers
glide over glaciated valleys amidst a scenery of lofty Himalayan
peaks. From Kyanjin Gompa we will have a chance to climb a ridge
on Yala Peak, or hike to the foot of Langshisa glacier, for an
incredible view of glaciers, icefalls and snow fields surrounded
on all sides by high mountains. The Helambu villages, over the
holy Gosainkunda lakes and Laurebenayak pass, are the home of
the Sherpas of Nepal.. Their slate and single-roofed villages,
that dot the terraced hillsides, present very fine trekking. The
region of Langtang and Helambu although easily approached from
Kathmandu is far less trekked than the Annapurna or Everest areas
making it all the more attractive. A wonderful walk through a
naturalist's trail.

The Sherpa villages of Helambu due north of Kathmandu valley presents
an easy getaway. This area because of its low elevation and the
Sherpa villages make it an interesting 7 day loop. Starting with
a short drive from Kathmandu to Sundarijal the trail to Helambu
climbs on to the Shivapuri ridge from where there are sweeping
views of the central Himalayas. Following a ridgline the trek
heads north to Thare Pati before turning east to Melemchi Gaon
and Tarke Gyang the principle villages of this area. From here
we visit Shermathang before descending to the Melamchi river to
end our trek with a drive back from Sipa Ghat back to Kathmandu.
