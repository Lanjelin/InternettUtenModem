<B>The rivers of Nepal take the traveler to the very heart of
a magical land and is one of the most exciting ways of exploring
Nepal's ancient cultures and unspoiled landscapes. Rising from
the glaciers of the highest mountain range on earth and from the
mysterious high plateau of Tibet the rivers plunge through narrow
gorges and traverse their rugged foothills. Along its course the
rivers passes through many life-zones traveling through alpine
meadows, sub-tropical forests and the lush tropical jungles of
lowland Nepal. Many of Nepal's rivers present some of the most
exciting and challenging trips for rafters and kayakers alike.
