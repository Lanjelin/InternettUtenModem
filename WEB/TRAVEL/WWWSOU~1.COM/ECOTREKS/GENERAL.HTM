<CENTER><A NAME="WT"><H3>What</A> is Eco-Trekking ?</H3></CENTER>
Eco-Trekking stems from the knowledge that there is an 
undeniable fragility in our planet and tourism  (trekking in our case) can 
have an impact either as a positive force for increased awareness and 
change, or as a contributor to cultural and environmental exploitation.  
Taking into consideration lessons learned from past experiences - the need 
for sustainable natural resources, cross-cultural exchange and, for tourist 
dollars to directly benefit the local economies through which they trek - the 
concept of Eco-Trekking is slowly but surely taking form.<P>
<P>
<B>Hence Eco-Trekking is trekking in such a sensitive way that 
treks:</B><br>
 Make sure that while trekking through protected and environmentally 
fragile areas steps are taken to minimize the impact by adopting eco-friendly 
methods such as using only alternative fuel (kerosene, gas) for cooking, 
packing out all non-degradable waste, disposing of biodegradable waste 
carefully and taking full safety precautions for clients as well as staff.<P>
  Make sure that, wherever possible, trekkers directly benefit the village 
economies by using local services (ie: lodges, products, guides, porters, 
etc.). Encourage lodges, and other village producers, to adopt eco-friendly 
methods.<P>
  Act in a sensitive manner as regards to cultural and religious beliefs of the 
region. Help instill a sense of pride in local cultures and values so that 
children do not just ape the foreigners but learn to adapt their modern 
methods with local requirements and resources.<P>
<P>
Eco-Trekking is also a commitment by the agents, operators and local bodies to 
make sure that the visitor gets the best value for their money, gets to 
experience the culture and nature in a safe, peaceful, friendly atmosphere and 
goes back totally satisfied.<P>
<P>
Keeping all these points in mind a group of people committed to nature and 
adventure tourism have formed <B>Getaway Eco-Treks</B>. Our mission is to 
make it possible for the visitor to be able to travel in an eco-friendly manner, 
avail of quality services at a very fair price while benefiting the local economies 
along the way.  In other words our mission is to add value to the quality of the 
traveller's experience as well as to the villagers' lives while protecting the 
environment and cultures typical of the Himalayas.<P>
<P>
Make sure you go with<B> Getaway Eco-Treks</B>. With us you deal directly 
with local operators and service providers, get reliable and quality services, best 
leaders/guides, innovative itineraries, all at prices not available anywhere. <P>

<CENTER><A NAME="WG"><H3>Why Go</A> With GETAWAY ECO-TREKS ?</H3></CENTER><P>
<P>
<B>Getaway Eco-Treks offers a choice of camping treks in Nepal Tibet and 
Bhutan. Managed and operated by a group of dedicated and experienced people 
who are not only well versed in the adventure travel service business  but also are 
committed to conserving our natural and cultural diversity. Our treks, tours and 
river rafting trips are well  equipped , offers optimum safety, provides guides who 
have first hand knowledge of the routes, natural history and cultural background.  
</B><P><B>
</B><P>
<B>Trained Trek Guides and Sherpas</B><br><B>
</B>Each of our treks are managed by a team of professionally trained trek guide, cook 
and  sherpas. Many of our famous  mountain guides have climbed Everest and other 
Himalayan peaks. Our leaders/guides and trek crew are committed to providing a safe 
and enjoyable holiday to our clients and in an eco-friendly manner.<P>
<P>
<B>High Quality Camping Equipment</B> <br>
All our camping-treks are outfitted with  the highest quality equipment available. 
Comfortable dome or 'A' frame tents, foam mattress, dinning tent with camp chairs and 
tables and a toilet tent are standard equipment on all our camping treks.<P>
<P>
<B>Hygenic Food  &amp   Water Preparation</B><br><B>
</B>Meal are prepared by cooks trained in modern cooking hygiene. Special care is 
taken to serve well boiled and purified drinking water everyday on trail to ensure that our 
trekkers stay healthy and enjoy their outing fully. Lodge food along the popular trails vary 
from basic to those offering a range of choice from pizzas to apple pie. <P>
<P>
<B>Kerosene Fuel  For Cooking</B> <br>
In order not to contribute to the already  rapid denudation of Himalayan forests we use 
kerosene fuel for all client and  staff  cooking on all our camping treks. When we use 
local services like lodges we patronize and encourage those lodges who have adopted 
ecologically safe methods in use of fuel and waste management - thereby encouraging 
other lodges to implement similar, or better, methods.<P>
<P>
<B>Correct Disposal Of  Waste</B><br>
Our  trail staff are trained in the correct disposal of waste. All biodegradable waste is 
burned and buried before breaking camp every morning. Care is taken to fill in toilet 
holes after use. It is our policy to porter all non-degradable waste (viz: used batteries, tin 
cans, bottles, plastics, etc.) out of the mountains. All our trip members are briefed about 
requirements regarding waste disposal before starting. All paper and dry tissue are 
collected and burned by our crew. Plastics, tins, foils, batteries and other non-
biodegradable items are to be taken back to Kathmandu (used batteries cannot be 
properly disposed in Nepal hence we encourage that batteries to go back to where they 
came from to be disposed properly).<P>
<P>
<B>Staff Insurance, etc.</B><br><B>
</B>We take pride in the fact that every single porter and guide employed by us is  not 
only well paid but also protected by a life insurance policy. They are provided  with warm 
clothing and proper shelter on all high altitude treks. All our treks benefit the village 
economics by using local services (manpower, produce, lodges and other services). 
Getaway Eco-Treks also contributes funds, leadership and time in fields such as 
environmental protection and in providing opportunities at the micro-economic (family 
and village) level.<P>

<H4>We Commit To Follow These Principles Of Eco-Trekking</H4>
 
<OL>
<LI>   <b>Prepare Properly For Each Trek.</b>  Warm clothing and shelter will be provided for porters and staff on high altitude treks.  A first aid kit will be sent on each trek.  First aid training will be made a available to staff.
<LI>   <b>Ask Group Members To Help.</b> Group members will be properly briefed before trek on proper dress, bathing attire, respect for religious sites, to give money/gifts only through monastery/temple caretakers, schoolmasters or local health workers.
<LI>   <b>Cook On Stoves/Fuel Efficient Stoves.</b> Every effort will be made to provide kerosene and meals for porters. Kerosene/gas will be used in every camping trek. 
<LI>   <b>Practice Proper Hygiene.</b>  Staff will be informed of the importance of washing hands before touching food and using clean towels for drying dishes. Drinking water will be boiled for at least two minutes.
<LI>   <b>Use Toilets And Existing Campsites.</b> Toilet tents or existing campsite toilets will be used   Toilet tent holes will be filled in to look as they did before digging.  Rain trenches around tents will only be dug in emergency.  New campsites will be used only when existing site are not available. 
<LI>   <b>Leave All Camp And Trails Clean.</b>    Campsite rubbish will be separated into burnable (paper), food garbage and nonbiodegredables (tins, bottles, metal-foils, batteries and plastics.)  Only paper products will be burned in an old fire-site, not a new one.  Vegetable waste will be scattered out of sight well away from the campsite.  All nonbiodegredables will be packed out to be disposed correctly.  Porters and staff will be encouraged to clean up after others and not to litter. Lodges that practice eco-friendly methods will be used on Lodge-Treks.   
<LI>   <b>While Staying In Village Lodges.</b> Patronize those lodges who use kerosene, gas or fuel efficient stoves for cooking where ever possible. Encourage and help those not already using eco-friendly methods to do so. Keep a record of each lodge used in order to compare different lodges and to introduce better services using better methods.

<CENTER><A NAME="AD"><H3>A Day</A> On Trek</H3> <P></CENTER>
<P>
All our camping treks are managed by a team of professionally trained sherpas with the  
Leader/guide responsible for all aspects of the running of the trek. Our special departures 
and nature/birdwatching treks are led by qualified leaders who are well versed in the 
culture and natural history of the Himalayas. Our Lodge-Treks are led by a local guide 
supported by porters to carry luggage and equipment.<P>
<P>
A trek-day starts around 6 a.m.  with a cup of tea/coffee. Soon a bowl of warm water is 
provided for washing. After packing your duffel and day-pack a breakfast of  
porridge/muesli/cornflakes  and biscuits  with  tea/coffee is served. The day's trek starts 
around 7.30 a.m.  Porter/pack animals carry all camp equipment, food and duffel bags. All 
you need to carry in your day pack are water bottle, rain/wind jacket, camera and other 
small items you may  need on the trail All trekkers walk at their own pace with the lead 
and "sweep" sherpa providing support throughout.<P>
<P>
The morning's walk to the lunch spot takes about three hours. In Nepal we usually stop for 
a hot lunch on the trail where as in Tibet a picnic lunch is provided. After hiking for three 
to four hours in the afternoon  our camp, or lodge,  is usually reached between 3-4 p.m. In 
the late afternoon and evening you can relax, wash, read or take a walk nearby. The 
evening meal is served between 6 and 7 p.m. in the dining tent (or dining room on a Lodge-
Trek). After dinner the leader/guide will brief trekkers on the next day's hike.<P>
<P>
Meals on the camping trek are prepared by our sherpa cooks whereas on the Lodge Trek 
we order meals at the restaurant attached to the lodges where we stay. Each days hike is 
planned so that trekkers have time to see, photograph and explore the countryside.  Anyone 
who is healthy, fit, enjoys the outdoors and hiking will qualify to participate in our 
treks.<P>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="TG">TREK</A>   GRADING (Trek Difficulty)</H3><P></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Grade 1 - Easy</B><br>
Easy trekking, by Himalayan standards is generally between 900m/3,000ft. and 
2,000m/6,500ft. There are always plenty of  'ups and downs' anywhere in the Himalaya 
and clients need to be regular walkers to get full enjoyment from their experience. It is 
possible however to design 'easier' three to four day treks with perhaps only three to four 
hours walking per day on request.<P>
<P>
<B>Grade 2 - Moderate</B><br><B>
</B>Moderate trekking 900m/3,000ft. and 3,000m/10,000ft. but possibly involving side 
trips to higher elevations.<P>
<P>
<B>Grade 3 - Difficult</B><br><B>
</B>Reasonably demanding trekking at altitudes up to 4,000m/13,000ft. with side trips to 
higher elevations. Some treks included here will, in part, be well away from villages on ill-
defined mountain trails.<P>
<P>
<B>Grade 4 - Strenuous</B> <br>
Treks of a demanding nature, requiring all participants to be fit and in excellent health, 
often in remote alpine areas and sometimes reaching altitudes in excess of 
5000m/18,000ft. Here we include all Tibet trips primarily because of the rigors of the 
climate and overall altitude, varying between Lhasa, at 3,700m/12,000ft.,  to high pass 
crossing, by vehicle or on foot in excess of  5,000m/16,000ft.<P>
<P>
<B>Alpine</B><br>
Extremely  demanding treks sometimes in very remote areas on rough terrain and perhaps 
including ( in Nepal) one or more of the so called 'trekking peaks' - maximum altitude, 
Mt. Mera at 6,461m/21,192ft.  Participants should have at least a basic knowledge of use 
of crampons and ice axes, though first time climbers may be accepted on some of the so 
called 'easy' routes on these peaks. Medical certificates are required prior to acceptance on 
any climbing treks.<P>
