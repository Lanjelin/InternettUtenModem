We at Kitini carpet Industries make 
hand knotted woollen carpets from 
100% wool. Carpets are made from 
hand spun wool in traditional Wooden 
looms. We have traditional carpet 
weavers to make carpets in traditional 
Tibetan designs and also semi modern and modern designs to meet customer's taste.<p>

Hand knotted Woollen carpets when finished in the loom are taken out and 
Hand cut to bring out designs contained in the weaving.<p>

We have possibilities to make any designs in carpets and in colour 
Combinations to suit the individual requirement.<p>

<p>
We dye our carpet wool in vegetable dyes. These vegetable dyes are 
Obtained from dry leaves, dry, roots tree barks, nuts and fruit skins and 
also flowers. Some of the main plants we use are:

<B>We are great lovers of nature and therefore we use those parts of plants 
which nature discards every season.</b><p><b>
</b><p>
We take these plants, (dry then whenever necessary) grind them into small particles. 
Then these powders are placed in boiling water allowed to boil for sometime so that 
plant colours are released in water. After slight cooling we dip woollen yarns in 
Hanks in water and allow to remain in water for some time.<p>
<p>
 When the final colour is achieved we dry the wool in the sun and use them in carpet 
making.<p>
<p>
<b>The natured colours are available in different colours and shades, in dark, 
medium and light shades. All our colours are fast enough as they do not bleed in 
normal washing. Vegetable colours are 100% safe and Environment 
Friendly.</b><p><b>
</b><p>
Carpets made from vegetable dyed yarn look more shiny and silky and have a softer 
feel. We make carpets in:<p>
