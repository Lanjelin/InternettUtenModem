<h3>Press Release </h3>
<B>His Royal Highness Prince Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah, </B>Chairman
of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation, Chaired the
first meeting of the seventeen member Zoo Development Committee
meeting today. The committee comprises committed conservationists
and experts in the area of bio-diversity conservation. The committee
also includes HE Ms. Sandy Vogelgesang, the American Ambassador
to Nepal, HE Mr. L.B. Smith, the British ambassador to Nepal ,
HE Mrs. Annmarre O'Keefe, the Australian Ambassador and also Mr.
Egbert Pelinck, Director General of ICIMOD.
<P>
Addressing the committee,<B> His Royal Highness</B> stated that
&quot;the major consideration which persuaded the King Mahendra
Trust to undertake this responsibility was the possibilities the
Zoo provided in further expanding our wildlife research and conservation
education activities. Wildlife research and conservation education,
if I may add has been the most important part of KMTNC's biodiversity
conservation efforts over the past decade.&quot;. <B>His Royal
Highness</B> further added &quot; successful conservation programs
often require detailed knowledge of species ecology, reproductive
biology, behavior, nutrition and disease. Consequently, Zoos around
the world have invested extensively in scientific research to
develop effective methods of captive propagation and animal care
as well as to help preserve threatened species and their habitats
in nature&quot;.
<P>
The committee was briefed on the current status and changes made
after KMTNC's management. The committee was also briefed on the
master-plan designed by a team of experts for the development
of the Zoo. The plan envisages in developing the zoo into a center
for conservation education, research and entertainment.
<P>
It may be recalled that His Majesty's Government handed over the
management of the Central Zoo to the King Mahendra Trust for Nature
Conservation on 29th, December, 1995.
