<p><i>Lotus Energy</i> is a solar and alternative energy system manufacturing company based in 
Kathmandu Nepal which<i> </i>manufactures <i>solar photovoltaic</i> systems and related components. 
<i>Lotus Energy</i> is not simply a manufacturer, as the company also has broad field experience in 
implementing complete turnkey solar electrification projects in remote rugged areas of the 
Himalayas. <i>Lotus Energy</i> provides a wide range of services: from preliminary site assessment and 
system design up to manufacture, installation, maintenance, and warranty service.</p>
<p><i>Lotus Energy</i> has proven ability to handle complete project implementation in the most difficult and 
demanding situations of the Himalayan region in conjunction with the government of Nepal, NGO's 
and private sector organizations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=4><b><u>Major Projects include:</u></b></font></font></p>
<p>&quot;<i>Lotus Energy</i> Village Electrification and Lighting Utility Project&quot; (LEVEL-UP) 
partially sponsored by the US Oceans and Environmental Sciences Organization 
(OES). This project is supplying village homes throughout Nepal with solar electric 
lighting systems which can also power a small TV and radio. The government of 
Nepal has offered 50% subsidy and loan facility to project participants.</p>
<p>&quot;Solar Technician Training Program&quot; for field technicians funded by United Nations 
Educational and Scientific Cultural Organization (UNESCO)</p>
<p>&quot;Terai Solar Powered Drinking Water Pumping Project&quot; supplying the daily needs 
for a village of 1000 people in South Nepal funded by Canadian Cooperative 
Office (CCO) and British Water Aid.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><i>Lotus Energy</i> anticipates a fast expansion in the next few years as a result of the very successful 
LEVEL-UP Program in which the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADB/N) has joined 
hands with <i>Lotus Energy</i> to subsidize remote villagers' purchases of solar home lighting systems. 
<i>Lotus Energy</i> expects to reach a production throughput of 2,000 systems per annum for typical 
village home sized systems alone, along with the necessary field infrastructure, remote service 
depots, etc., to support these remote market areas.&#160;</p>

<p><font size=3><i>Lotus Energy</i> produces and supplies a large range of products available for many remote and 
urban power supply purposes. In addition to the regularly produced products, specialized products 
and systems can be custom designed by <i>Lotus Energy</i> engineers and manufactured to suit the 
client's requirements.</font></p>
<p><font size=3><i>Lotus Energy</i> manufactures both DC (direct current, generally 12 volt) and AC (alternating 
current, generally 220V) types solar electric power systems. These systems are of the highest 
quality available in Nepal, geared for years of trouble-free service in the most demanding 
circumstances and environments.</font></p>

convert DC to AC current needed for 
normal electrical appliances. These units are 
also an excellent safeguard against power 
outages in urban areas (Solar UPS), as they 
are silent, pollution free, consume no fuels, 
and unlike generators, activate instantly if 
there is power outage. Certain models can 
even sell excess solar power back to the utility grid to reduce electric bill costs. </font></p>

controllers have both low voltage disconnect 
and over charge protection features which 
greatly extend battery life. When the system's 
solar batteries are getting low, <i>Lotus Energy</i> 
controllers feature an automatic cutoff to 
protect the battery from damage. This cutoff 
can be manually reset to provide a few added minutes of emergency power, even when the 
battery is low.</font></p>
