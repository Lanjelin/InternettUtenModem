<h4>Denial of Reality</h4>
India's failures in Kashmir have been compounding since the time Jawaharlal Nehru's liberal, 
newly independent government chose to rely on the hated and oppressive Maharaja Hari Singh's
 decision to join the Indian Union. Pressed by a military confrontation with Pakistan, Delhi took the 
dispute to the United Nations. It then promised to abide by the Security Council's resolution which
 called for a plebiscite to allow Kashmiris to decide between joining India or Pakistan. India broke
 that promise.<p>
	Delhi's only asset in those initial years had been Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah's cooperation. 
For his opposition to the Maharaja's unpopular regime and his advocacy of reforms of land and labour 
in Kashmir, the Sheikh and his party, the National Conference, had become the embodiment of Kashmiri
 nationalism. As Chief Minister of Kashmir, he promulgated land reforms in 1950, which further enhanced
 his standing with Kashmir's overwhelmingly rural and disinherited people. But this national hero was
 jailed in August 1953 after he began demanding greater autonomy. Except for two brief spells of freedom, 
he remained India's prisoner for 22 years, until February 1975, when the Sheikh became Chief Minister
 after signing an agreement with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.<p>
	Mrs Gandhi was able to defang the Lion of Kashmir, who allied with the ruling Indian National 
Congress. The only freedom he, and his heir apparent Farooq Abdullah, exercised during his second 
term in office was the freedom to be outrageously self indulgent and engage in corruption. Kashmiris
 nurtured anger and a sense of humiliation over how their vaunted 'lion' had been tamed in Indian hands.
 Furthermore, they had been denied not only the right of self determination, a right affirmed by the United 
Nations, but were now also witnessing the disintegration of their historic Kashmiri party, the 
Conference. This was taken as yet another assault on their identity and, as often happens in such
 circumstances, reinforced Kashmiri nationalism vis-a-vis India.<p>
	Besides political disenchantment, the alienation of the Kashmiri from India is mired in history,
economics and psychology. The problem is not communal, although sectarian Hindu and 
ideologues would like to view it in these terms. The latest phase of Kashmiri discontent followed 
significant social changes in Kashmir. The governments of Sheikh Abdullah and Ghulam Mohammed
 Bakhshi did free the Kashmiri from feudal controls, and helped enlarge a middle class. In increasing
 numbers, Kashmiri youth were educated but their social mobility remained constricted because
meaningful economic growth did not accompany land reforms and expanded educational facilities. 
Rebellions are normally started by the hopeful not the abject poor.<p>
	The roots of the popular uprising in 1989 lay in the neglect of Kashmir, 
and New Delhi's unconscionable manipulation of Kashmiri politics. Yet, India confronts
 the insurgency as incumbents normally do—with allegations of external subversion, brute force 
and unlawful machinations. Above all, it denies reality.<p><hr>

<h4>Kashmir in Partition</h4>
The reality is that New Delhi's moral isolation from the Kashmiri people is total and irreversible.
 It might be reversible if India were to envisage a qualitatively different relation with Kashmir, one
 which meaningfully satisfies Kashmiri aspirations of self government, but so far New Delhi has 
evinced no inclination in this direction. But can India's loss translate into Pakistan's gain?
	The answer is it cannot. Policy makers in Islamabad like to believe otherwise, and this 
 is not unusual. It is quite common for rival countries to view their contest as a zero sum game
 whereby the loss of one side translates as gain for the other. However, history shows this assumption 
to be false, and rival losses and gains are rarely proportional; they are determined by circumstances
 of history, politics and policy. India's Kashmir record offers a chronicle of failures, yet none of these
 have accrued to Pakistan's benefit. Rather, Pakistan's policy has suffered from its own defects.
	Three characteristics made an early appearance in Islamabad's Kashmir policy. One, although
 Pakistani decision makers know the problem to be fundamentally political, since 1948 they have
 approached it in military terms. Two, while the military outlook has dominated, there has been a healthy
 unwillingness to go to war over Kashmir. Three, while officially invoking Kashmiri right to self 
determination, Pakistan's governments and politicians have pursued policies which have all but
 disregarded the history, culture, and aspirations of Kashmir's people.<p>
One consequence has been a string of grave Pakistani miscalculations regarding Kashmir. 
Another has been to alienate Kashmiris from Pakistan at crucial times such as 1948 49, 1965 and
 the 1990s.
	Success has eluded Pakistan's Kashmir policy, and the costs have added up.
 Two wars—in 1948 and 1965—have broken out over Kashmir; annual casualties have mounted 
during the 1990s across the UN-monitored Line of Actual Control (LOC); the burden of defence
 spending has not diminished.
	A study of recent Kashmiri history will help put Islamabad's blunders in perspective.
 In 1947 48, Kashmiri Muslims were subject to contrasting pulls. The partition of India, the
 communal strife that accompanied it, and Kashmir's political economy, which was linked to
 the Punjab, disposed them towards Pakistan. However, the people's political outlook was
 rooted in Kashmiri nationalism which had been mobilised earlier by the National Conference
 led by Sheikh Abdullah. Sheikh Sahib was drawn towards the men and the party with whom
 he had worked closely since 1935—Nehru, Abul Kalam Azad, and the Indian National Congress.
 (He did not meet Mohammad Ali Jinnah until 1944.) There was also a tradition of amicable relations
 between Kashmiri Hindus and Muslims, despite general Muslim antipathy to the Maharaja's rule.<p>
	What Kashmiris needed was time, a period of peaceful transition to resolve their ambivalence.
 This, they did not get. Owing to Lord Mountbatten's mindless haste, the Subcontinent was partitioned
 and power transferred in a dizzying sequence of events which left little time to attend to complex 
details in far corners. The leadership of the Muslim League, in particular, was preoccupied with the 
challenges of power transfer, division of assets, civil war and mass migration. The League was short
 on experienced leaders, and squabbling squandered their meagre skills. Quaid i Azam Mohammad Ali 
Jinnah was terminally ill.<p>
	In this climate of crisis and competition, Kashmir received scant attention. The little
 attention it did attract was of those who did not comprehend Kashmiri aspirations nor the ambiguities, 
and the extraordinary risks and temptations that lay in waiting. In a peculiar expression of distorted 
perspective, self serving officials like Ghulam Mohammed, a colonial bureaucrat who later wormed
 his way into becoming the Governor General of Pakistan, paid more attention to the undeserving
 and hopeless case of Hyderabad (Deccan) than to Kashmir.<p>
	When India's Home Minister Sardar Vallabhai Patel sent feelers about a possible give-and-take
 on Hyderabad and Kashmir, Ghulam Mohammed is said to have spurned this opportunity and carried on
 his lucrative dealings with Hyderabad's Nizam. Pakistan also welcomed the accession of Junagadh and 
Manavadar, whereas an overwhelming majority in both states (as well as Hyderabad) were Hindu.
	In effect, Pakistan held three divergent positions on the question of accession—in favour of
 the Hyderabad Nizam's right to independence, Junagadh's right to accede to Pakistan against the 
wish of the populace, and, in Kashmir, for the right to self determination. Double standard is a common 
enough practice in politics, but it invariably harms the actor who lacks the power to avert consequences.
 The Nawab of Junagadh tried to deliver his Hindu-majority state to Pakistan, which set the precedence
 for the Maharaja of Muslim-dominated Kashmir choosing India. Pakistan did not have the power to
 defend either the Nawab or the Nizam, nor the will to punish the Maharaja. So India, practising double
 standards in its turn, took it all.<p><hr>

<h4>Pork Barrel</h4>
India's policies have been no less riddled with blunders than Pakistan's. Its moral isolation on
 Kashmir is nearly total, and unlikely to be overcome by military means or political manipulation. 
New Delhi commands not a shred of legitimacy among Kashmiri Muslims. Ironically, even as India's 
standing in Kashmir appears increasingly untenable, Kashmiris today appear farther from the goal
 of liberation than they were in the years 1989 to 1992.<p>

	Pakistan's engagement in Kashmir is indirect and unacknowledged. As such, it enjoys
 greater tactical and political flexibility than either Indian or the Kashmiri leaders. The diversity and 
nuances of informed opinion in Pakistan also render Islamabad more elastic than New Delhi, where
 the Hindutva right is powerful and breathes heavy over weak liberal shoulders. Furthermore, for a
number of reasons—its popular standing in large segments of Kashmiri population, material support 
of militant groups, international advocacy of Kashmir's cause—Pakistan's leverage in Kashmir is
 greater than what most observers assume. Yet, beyond repeating tired shibboleths about "our
 principled stand", Islamabad lacks a functioning policy capable of exploiting its advantages.<p>

	To date, the governments of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir have spent millions of dollars to
 mobilise international support behind the question of Kashmir. Islamabad's jet setting, patronage soaked 
lobbying for a UN recommended plebiscite has elicited no significant international support during the last
 seven years of Kashmir insurgency. Cumulatively, Pakistan's score has been a pathetic zero, despite the
 hectic international itinerary of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the ever-travelling delegations
 headed by the Punjabi politician Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan.
	A few months ago, the Security Council even dropped Kashmir from its agenda, and it was
 only retroactive Pakistani lobbying that was able to obtain a temporary reprieve. The most that Pakistan
 has been able to achieve are favourable resolutions from the Organisation of Islamic Countries, an entity
 about as influential in world politics as an Arabian camel. Kashmir's cause therefore serves merely as 
one big pork barrel for Pakistani carpetbaggers and patronage seekers, religious and secular, parliamentary
 and private.<p>
	In sum, Pakistan continues to wage a half hearted "war of position" replete with private
 doubts, symbolic posturing and petty opportunism. Its support has not helped unify or energise
 the insurgency in Kashmir into a winning movement. The resulting stalemate appears 'stable',
 and unlikely to be upset in the absence of a conventional India Pakistan war. Since war is not 
an option, Pakistan's policy is reduced to bleeding India; and India's to bleeding the Kashmiris, 
and to hit out at Pakistan whenever a wound can be inflicted.<p><hr>
