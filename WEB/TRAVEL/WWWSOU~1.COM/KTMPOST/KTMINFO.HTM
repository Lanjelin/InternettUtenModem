<b> Mr.Pratik Pradhan</b> the sub-editor of <b><i>TheKathmandu Post</i></b> and his team outlines which articles of the day's Kathmandu Post will
appear on the cyberspace version of the newspaper. Considering that the
Internet bandwidth costs (read as telecom costs) are still very high in
Nepal and keeping in mind all the additional work which has to be done at
Mercantile, Pratik limits the articles to those which cover issues on Nepal
and its immediate neighbours and/or articles which he considers important.
The articles are then uploaded to the computer at Mercantile Communications.
