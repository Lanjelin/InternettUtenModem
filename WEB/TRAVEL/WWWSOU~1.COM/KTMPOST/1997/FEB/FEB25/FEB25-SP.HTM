saves the day for NRT as Himalayan Sporting go down 2-1<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By a Post Reporter</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24- The 1997
Amatya Gold Cup runner-up New Road Team made a shaky start before
beating a tenacious Himalayan Sporting Club, Darjeeling 2-1 here
Monday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">New Road Team (NRT) , one of the
hot contenders were fortunate to have survived the rivals&#146;
fury in the second half. Lady luck, spectacular saves by the
defence and missed chances by the rivals saved the day for the
glamour side.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Undoubtedly the hero for the
winners was highly talented Suraj Khaling from Dharan who scored
the wining goal in the final seconds of the match.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It was a brilliant goal by the
youngster who scored from inside the d-area in a lightning
counter attack. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">NRT made a whirl-wind start
bombarding the opponents citadel. The forwards and mid-fielders
displaying effective co-ordination had the rivals at their feet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The visitors made valiant efforts
to keep the aggressors at bay but in vain. But mid-way through
the first half unable to withstood the pressure they conceded a
goal. It was a brilliant goal scored by diminutive Rajendra
Shakya who beat the advancing custodian by skilfully chipping
over him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Despite taking the lead, NRT
failed to pressurise the rivals further. Instead they slowed down
considerably and their performance dipped dramatically.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking advantage of the
opponents&#146; slackness Darjeeling made a steady come back into
the match. The forwards who looked lost in the initial stages
started to play purposeful football. The combination of Robin,
Lakpa, Sanjay and Pratap created a host of scoring chances, but
poor finish denied them goals. Apart from lacking clinical
finish, the players were nervous and jumpy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Darjeeling were a rejuvenated and
organised outfit after lemon break. Mixing aggression and
positive brand of football, they attacked in waves. Shyam Mali
and Murali were given a run for their money . So fierce and
intense was the attack that they were kept on their toes through
out. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Amir Dangol, the star mid-fielder
of NRT who stole so many hearts in Birganj was not at his best.
So were internationally experienced Sarbagy and Chet Narayan in
the attack. They were totally off-coloured and failed to make any
impact on the attack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Khaling, the new recruit from
Dharan impressed with his foot work, ball control and body feign.
But he was ignored by his team mates who refused to feed him
constantly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Darjeeling eclipsed the entire
second half. So one -sided was the affair that the game got
totally confined in NRT&#146;s territory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">After many futile attempts, the
visitors finally found the equaliser. Sanjay Rashaily stunned the
ring of defence when his swerving free kick from outside the box
found the net. It was a spectacular goal, perhaps the best so far
in the championships.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Inspired by the equaliser,
Darjeeling showed no respite in their attack. On numerous
occasions they had clear chances to take the lead but forwards
fumbled at crucial junctures. Medio Pratap Mothey was guilty of
squandering a sitter when he failed to get past the custodian on
the goal line.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then came the breathtaking save
by Murari who headed the ball to safety in the nick of time after
the custodian had been comprehensibly beaten.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then came the moment of glory and
relief for the champions, Khaling in a display of individual
brilliance scored the match winner to snatch victory from the
rivals. </font></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Jawalakhel Youth Club stun Sankata</strong></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the battle of youths,
Jawalakhel Youth Club bounced back from a goal deficit to oust
Sankata Boys Sporting Club 2-1 in a low-key match.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Sankata Boys Sporting Club (SBSC)
made a dream start when diminutive Hari Thakuri struck the first
blow in the very first minute of play.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thakuri known for his scoring
prowess and pace scored through a solo effort. He weaved through
a couple of defenders before slotting home from a difficult
angle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The unsettled Jawalakhel Youth
Club (JYC) quickly recovered from the early shock and made a
gallant fight back. Their attack revolved around Megh Raj KC and
Nabin Karki. They forced way their way through the defence time
and again but failed to score. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thakuri , the top scorer in
Siliguri ( West Bengal) football league was brilliant as usual.
He covered a lot of ground and did a lot of running. What he
lacked was support. Ramesh Budathoki also impressed a lot. He was
quick and played sensible and creative football.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Naresh Thapa and Anil Thapa also
had a big hand in the teams&#146; success. Giving good account of
themselves they blunted many dangerous attacks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The equaliser for JYC was scored
by Megh, while ht winning goal came though the boots off
experienced Om Shrestha.</font></p>
