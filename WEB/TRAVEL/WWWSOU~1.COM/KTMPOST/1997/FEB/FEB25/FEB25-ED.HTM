<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b>Chasing
dreams</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;All is not well with
overseas employment.&quot; That is an understatement when we look
at the Nepali&#146;s experience with overseas employment. Not
many years ago, a Nepali national committed suicide near the
Royal Nepalese embassy in Bangkok. This incident, was the doing
of a desperate Nepali youth the embassy had refused to help. It
was a sad commentary on the government&#146;s attitude and
responsibilities towards its citizens abroad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The situation is not very
different at present either. The difference lies in the fact that
many more Nepalis are chasing dreams today, further exacerbating
the situation. A large percentage of the educated elite want to
make it to the US and an even larger percentage of the workforce
have their eyes set on the Gulf, Japan, and the &#145;Tiger&#146;
countries like South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore etc. Even the
Philippines, which has on numerous occasions, gone to great
lengths to rescue its stranded and victimized citizens appears to
be attracting Nepalis. How bad things are in Nepal can be gauged
from this fact?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is anybody&#146;s guess that
things can only get worse. What else can be expected with
continued brain-drain and consistent depletion of able-bodied
workforce which cannot find good enough reasons to stay back in
the country. And to make things worse, there is always the
government, standing by, helplessly, unable to do anything about
the situation. Forget about responding to this unhealthy trend by
creating opportunities within the country itself, the government
has not also done anything about the rising number of
unsuspecting Nepalis who are being duped into paying their way to
3 D (dangerous, difficult and dirty) jobs abroad.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is understandable that there
is precious little that the government may be able to do to help
Nepali migrant workers whose status abroad is illegal. What is
however not understandable is why the government is not doing
anything to curb this illegal trade that has swindled thousands
of Nepalis? Spurious overseas employment agencies operating
through illegal channels here and abroad have increased. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If the government does not
intervene, the number of Nepalis working under extremely
exploitative conditions is bound to soar. Measures must be
initiated so that such agencies cannot operate even as cases of
such swindles are investigated and action taken against agencies
that are found guilty. This is the least that the government can
do for the people even if it cannot create the necessary economic
conditions that would make them stay back.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b>The
politics of health in Nepal<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By Janardan Subedi</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">All political, economic,
educational and religious institutions are closely interrelated.
An institution cannot be changed in isolation. A change in any
specific institution is met by coordinate alterations in other
institutions. In Nepal, this complex web of interdependence has
broken down. Recent changes in politics have had a devastating
effect on the health care system, for instance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Politics is related to health
because economic power lies in the hands of politicians.
Unfortunately, as it now appears, there is no relationship
between competence and political power. Political power has more
to do with attaining popular support based on individual
personality or party ticket rather than supporting the policies
and ideas of a party for societal development. An
individual&#146;s identification with a party has become a
substitute for the more traditional tribal system rather than a
critical decision collectively based upon political and
intellectual views.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The predominant view of the
Nepalese political process has insinuated itself into every
aspect of the social structure. Politicization is evident in
education, health care, bureaucracy etc which has directly led to
system-wide dysfunction. There is growing professionalization of
politicians without accreditation. Therefore, sometimes the
achieved status is not based on merit. The political infection
predisposes susceptible actors to deviate from and ultimately
denigrate their socially defined functions. As this epidemic
progresses, the systemic poisoning that it induces leads to a
structural disequlibrium that is increasingly difficult to
correct. Such an evolutionary trajectory towards maladaptation
certainly leads to societal cataclysm. For example, consider the
incongruities present in Nepal - with scores of teachers acting
like prime ministers but failing to educate, physicians behaving
as ministers but ceasing to heal, and students engaged in street
politic, failing to learn their lessons. The result of this is a
downward spiral that we now witness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The crawling chaos resulting from
the abrogation of duty has in some cases led to the dubious
prominence of NGOs, INGOs, international agencies, and donor
countries as contractors of development. Because these
institutions are extrinsic to Nepal, they are perceived to have a
cloak of competence. However, it is evident to all that, upon
closer inspection, this mantle is not without serious
perforation. This blind acceptance of the Western model of
development often clashes with indigenous culture. The flood of
Western mores carried in the backpacks of Thamel tourists have a
disposable feature indicative of the culture from where they
sprang. This attendant horizontal transmission of some of the
more undesirable aspects of Western &quot;culture&quot;
cosegregates with the interposition of deviance from norms. The
rapidly urbanizing streets provide a pathological environment in
which the parasitism of acculturation can thrive. This occurs
even in the face of the long extant Hindu-Buddhist spiritualism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The whispering winds of Eastern
fatalism so prevalent in our spiritual reckoning is equally
destructive for the path of development. The blind acceptance of
the masses to the stasis propounded by the political elite has
its roots in philosophy, a fact that is ruthlessly exploited by
politicians. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The dolorous darkness that
hinders Nepal&#146;s development is specially evident in the poor
health of its population. A nationwide overreliance on treatment
versus prevention greatly exacerbates this problem. Unlike in the
West, where chronic diseases are the foci of health care
delivery, Nepal&#146;s fundamental problem remains the rampant
prevalence of infectious diseases whose cause lies in medieval
hygiene practices. The solution to most of these ills is
obvious--the establishment of a universal clean water supply and
effective use of human waste management. Widespread infection
with parasitic diseases is common. Children infected with
hookworms suffer cognitive deficits at potentially sensitive
periods. It is a loss difficult to recover from. While
pharmacological intervention is undoubtedly effective in the
short term, if the source of infection is not eradicated,
reinfection is the rule and not the exception. Even
community-wide biomedical intervention with drugs ultimately
fails when such treatments are halted by economic exigencies.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The shortsightedness of political
leaders and parties and the bias of medical professionals
represent significant structural barriers to progress. Until
these powerful constituencies can be shown the errors of their
policies, they are doomed to a never-ending cycle of failure.
Millions of dollars will be wasted and the health of the
population will remain as it now stands. Political leaders are
certainly cognizant of the health care debacle as evinced by
their seeking medical treatment abroad. Such a luxury paid by
public monies is not available to the hill-dwelling Nepalis.
While they build medical schools of questionable distinction for
their children and relatives, many positions at rural posts go
unfilled with the overwhelming number of physicians preferring to
stay within the confines and comforts of Kathmandu Valley.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Hence, the politics of health in
Nepal is, in actuality, the abuse of politics.</font></p>

<p><strong>Post Platform<br>
</strong><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b>Neta ki
abhineta ?<br>
</b></font><em><strong>Kavita Sherchan</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There was a time when we were
taught sabai Nepali pancha ho ra sabai pancha Nepali (all Nepalis
are panchas and all panchas Nepali) in schools. Though this
statement doesn&#146;t hold true anymore with even the real
panchas refusing to be panchas, the statement can be changed into
all netas (leaders) are abhinetas (actors) and all abhinetas are
netas.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is indeed a very thin line
separating the two because we have one acting like the other. The
actors live with the delusion that they rule the nation. So they
keep on giving their valuable (?) advice on des bikas from time
to time. They give long lectures on what should be done and act
like des ko thekedars going on tours, spreading the message of
environment preservation and poverty alleviation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Not that I have anything against
them, their effort is indeed commendable and deserves applause.
What bugs me no end is the way our leaders act. It&#146;s no
secret that our leaders are good actors making even Oscar winning
performances look pale in comparison but sometimes they simply go
overboard. It&#146;s okay to act in parliament as everyone knows
that our parliament has been reduced to a mere stage where in
every session a new drama unfolds. But when they take their role
as actors so seriously, it gets too much for people like us.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Though by now all journos know
what to expect from ministers at programmes, sometimes it gets
too much even for them to digest. Like the incident that took
place a week ago. Our yuva karnadhars from Sankhuwasabha had
arranged a symposium on drug addiction and its impact on society.
They invited the PM to inaugurate the programme. Our PM who
can&#146;t say no, accepted the invitation and so the youth sent
grand invitations to all journos to cover the programme.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">However, at the last minute, our
PM gave them a royal ditch and the poor youths had no choice but
to go running to the minister of state Deepak Banskota and ask
him to be substitute chief guest. Banskota had to accept the
invitation as he couldn&#146;t afford to irk the youth of his
hometown lest they refuse to help him in the election. So, though
it wasn&#146;t quite a pleasurable experience to stand in for the
PM, he arrived at the venue on time. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Poor Banskota had to go through
humiliation the second time when he saw that there were only a
handful of people there. Seeing that all those present were
youngsters and not realizing that young people can be journalist
he asked the organizer bhais to postpone the programme promising
to bring a larger crowd, around hundred people, from
Sankhuwasabha himself. As luck would have it NTV arrived at that
time and our publicity ko bhoko neta, not wanting to let go of
the opportunity to be seen on TV agreed to preside over the
programme. The funniest part was when he stood in front and asked
all those present to move forward and cluster at one place so
that NTV could show that there were a lot of people present at
the function.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">So, now, can you blame me for
being confused? Our netas deserve to be abhinetas as they know
exactly how to behave in front of the camera. If NTV hadn&#146;t
arrived then we would have to go back empty handed. Wah netaji,
you are really an abhineta!</font></p>
