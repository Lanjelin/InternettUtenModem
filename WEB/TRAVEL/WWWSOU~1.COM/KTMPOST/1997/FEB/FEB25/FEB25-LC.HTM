Ministry must offer schools effective guidelines'<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By Sushil Thapa</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24- There is no
denying the fact that the mushrooming of private schools over the
last couple of years has boosted education prospects in the
country. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">However, lately, private schools
have been severely criticised for failing to maintain a high
academic standard and for working to gain personal benefits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mrs Geeta Rana, principal of
Galaxy public school, a familiar name in the education sector,
however, scoffs at the charges.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Eleven years ago, Rana started
her school with just 9 students and 2 teachers. On the contrary,
today, the school has over 3,500 students , 170 teachers and 130
non-teaching staff.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Rana, a former teacher of Adarsha
Vidya Mandir and St Mary's is a strict disciplinarian and firmly
believes in total education. Her 28-year-association with
education has made her amatured academician </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Rana's, a Masters in mathematics,
ultimate dream is to open her own university .</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In a free and frank conversation
with The Kathmandu Post, Rana, shrewdly coped with the charges
labelled against private schools.</font></p>

<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- Most of the private schools
are considered to be money making agencies. There are only a
handful of schools that impart quality education.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- I don't quite agree to what
you have said. It is simply a case of misinterpretation. Those
who think so are ignorant of the facts. Private schools truly
believe in quality education. The effort is always there to
impart the best possible education on our part. Perhaps, a few
schools might not be following the right kind of system and
syllabus. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">To ensure high academic standard,
the Education Ministry must offer schools effective guidelines,
syllabus and proper management and see that it is strictly
followed. Then only schools' efforts to achieve quality education
shall materialise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Apart from that schools also need
to work together to attain the objective.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- School fees are generally
exorbitant. Every year there is indiscriminate increment in fees
in the name of inflation. Don't you feel schools are
unnecessarily exploiting parents. The fact is that not all
parents are in a position to meet the mounting school expenses.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- Although fees vary from
school to school, students are charged on the actual cost of
education. There will be no end to fees increment. I am aware
that not all parents are financially sound. Neither are we
exploiting parents nor we have the intention to do so.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The government can control the
increasing fees by opening schools like Budhanilkantha ( where it
shoulders fifty percent of the expenses) in a big number.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In our case, we are self-
dependent and have to bear all expenses . Thus we need sufficient
money to buy all necessary equipment to ensure good education.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- What is the concept of
re-admission ? Why do students have to readmit themselves every
year with increased expenses? I think it is one of the tactics
adopted by schools to generate revenue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- I think parents have not been
able to quite differentiate between re-admission and annual
charge. As far to my knowledge no school charges students for
re-admission. In the start of a new session students are charged
for examinations, stationary and other useable items.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- Students are heavily charged
for extra- curricular activities. However, students are denied
access to activities through out the year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- It is the duty of the parents
to draw the schools' attention if they feel that their wards are
being denied access to extra-curricular activities. It is a small
problem that can be easily solved if parents and school talk over
it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- Students are compelled to
buy books and copies from schools itself. Is this done to ensure
school's commission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- Parents are not compelled to
buy books from the school. Rather they are free to buy from the
book-store of their choice. We sell books at the school so that
students can buy all books well on time. Sometimes books are not
available in the market and they are kept waiting for weeks. As
for the commission is concerned, it is for the people who look
after the sales. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- What has baffled many is the
frequent change of books and syllabus. Is it important ?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR - Before we prepare a new book
list for every class, we probe into the shortcomings of books and
syllabus of previous year. If we opt for everything the same,
students have tendency to rely on old answers and notes which
they obtain from friends. As a consequence, their learning
capacity automatically erodes . Secondly, bright students will be
made to suffer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- Classrooms are found to be
over crowded. A class consists of more than 50 students. Under
the circumstances teachers tend to become less effective since
they have to concentrate on a big mass.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- You cannot judge teachers'
performance by the size of the class. Their devotion and honesty
play a greater role in determining quality of the education . We
believe in mass education . We definitely like to restrict the
size of the class to 20 to 25, but again it will mean more money
for parents which they cannot afford. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- Teaching methods are
conventional. Students are forced to rely on readymade answers
provided to them by teachers. Don't you think this seriously
curbs students' creativity ? </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- I do not blame the teachers
for this. Research works have not been undertaken in the school
sector to improve the quality of the teachers. We are lacking a
proper system as well. The number of trained teachers here is
very limited. Time and again , it has been found that they too
commit minor mistakes. Therefore , in order to avoid mistakes in
answers the school management makes the final correction before
providing it to the students. Before students learn answers by
heart, they must have a clear understanding of the answers. They
have to memorise answers for examinations, otherwise, they cannot
keep themselves within the time frame.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- Schools have one common
objective that is to excel in the SLC examinations. Motivated by
this factor the rooster is planned accordingly including the
selection of students. Under the system only intelligent and
bright students derive benefit but the less intelligent students
are neglected. Is this not discriminatory ?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- Of course, one of our
objectives is to achieve good results in the SLC exams. There is
no demarcation between intelligent and average students. We treat
all students equally. Students are in the merit list not because
of the school rather through their special creativity and talent.
The school has nothing to do with it. Yes, the school sees that
such brilliant students make full use of their qualities.
However, they do not benefit extra care or facilities from the
school as reported.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- It is reported that schools
influence District Education Office and SLC board members through
member to achieve good results in SLC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- This is baseless and
impossible. I do not believe that money can buy good results. Had
it been possible then businessmen could have come to this sector
in a big way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Good results can be achieved only
through total commitment and hard work. It is like building the
city of Rome.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- What about corporal
punishments meted out to students. The press (The Kathmandu Post
and Kantipur) had booked one of your teachers for inhumanely
battering an Upper KG student.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- Certainly, we are against
corporal punishments. I admit that there has been cases of
punishments. Parents can help us to solve the problem. It is
their duty to educate their children with discipline and morale
at home itself. The fact is that parents are engaged in the act
of beating their children even before they admit them to schools.
Then they expect their wards to excel in studies without being
punished which under the circumstance is not quite possible. If
parents have any kind of reservation about school and teachers,
they should talk to the principal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">TKP- What flaws do you see in the
present education system?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GR- The system lacks stability
and direction. Even after completing school students are left
wandering about their career.</font></p>
