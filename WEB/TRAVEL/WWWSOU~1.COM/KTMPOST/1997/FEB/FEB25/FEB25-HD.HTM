MPs ask PM to prune cabinet by Mar 3<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By a Post Reporter</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24 - A day after
their threatening to remain absent during the voting on the
government&#146;s confidence motion, the 12
&quot;unsatisfied&quot; NC parliamentarians today called on the
Prime Minister to prune his cabinet before the House sits for the
winter session on March 3.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A source close to the PMO told
The Kathmandu Post that the one dozen NC MPs have offered to help
the Prime Minister, leader of their parliamentary party, during
the confidence vote if he resumes talks with the RPP and
reshuffles the cabinet to reduce the number of ministers before
the session begins. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, on his
part, held long parleys with NC president Girija Prasad Koirala
and former NC president Krishna Prasad Bhattarai seperately today
on the same issues. The details of the talks were not disclosed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, there are conflicting
claims about the resignations of the four senior ministers from
the cabinet while one more tendered his resignation today.
Minister of State Ganesh Bahadur Khadka told The Kathmandu Post
this evening that he had submitted his resignation today to the
Prime Minister to make it easy for him to reshuffle the cabinet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">However, secretary of the NC
parliamentarty committee, Bhakta Bahadur Balayar, insisted that
of the four senior ministers who reportedly resigned yesterday,
only Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Narahari Acharya had
formally tendered his resignation while the other three--Home
Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka, Education Minister Govind Raj Joshi
and Health Minister Arjun Narsingh KC--had &quot;merely offered
to resign if the PM so desired.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Home Minister Khadka declared his
resignation in an NC workers&#146; meeting in his home district
of Dang yesterday while Minister Acharya announced the same to
the press on Saturday. Ministers Joshi and KC, who are yet to
confirm or deny their resignations, could not be reached for
comments.</font></p>

seeks consensus on local bill<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By a Post Reporter</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24 - As the
decentralization report gets the final touches, Local Development
Ministry is taking inputs from political parties in a bid to
create consensus among the main political players for passing the
draft local authority bill in the winter session of parliament. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Local Development Ministry held
an interaction programme here today about decentralization and
local self-government in which central committee members of
Rastriya Prajatantra Party expressed their opinion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Today&#146;s interaction
programme was organized to present RPP&#146;s views about the
local self-government and proposed decentralization report, State
Minister for Local Development Rajib Parajuli said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Speaking on the occasion, RPP
President Surya Bahadur Thapa said decentralization should not be
seen as only a means of carrying out development works in
villages but rather it should be taken as a broad concept which
has the potential of addressing today&#146;s political and
economic problems. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Decentralization is not
only a simple means of development. It is a way by which we can
make people participate in the governance of the nation as
directed by the Constitution of 1990,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thapa pointed out that
decentralization programme cannot succeed without addressing the
problems of the oppressed and ethnic people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Provisions for the
development of language and culture of oppressed and ethnic
people should be included in the decentralization report and the
local authority bills,&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thapa also expressed his
reservations about the acceptance of the proposed
decentralization by a section of society, hinting at the present
bureaucratic mind set.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Foreign Minister and general
secretary of RPP Prakash Chandra Lohani said the present
decentralization proposal is a bold step but we have to go step
by step and there should be some mechanism to control and monitor
local authorities. &quot;If district authorities disregarded
government directives and plans, the government should keep some
preventive measures with it,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Lohani raised the tricky issue of
employees working in districts. What will be their promotion
criteria, will they have chance to get transfers? If the civil
servants&#146; issue is not taken seriously, many remote
districts will not get the services of doctors and engineers, he
said. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr Lohani said that an uniform
system of book keeping should be introduced for the local bodies
and the centre should audit accounts of local bodies. As for
giving legal and taxation rights to local bodies, Lohani said
these should be introduced phasewise.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Local Development Minister Kamal
Thapa said RPP has expressed its commitment to make villages the
center of development. &quot;RPP believes that the present
concept and style of development needs a drastic change.
Decentralization proposal is a step towards achieving the goal of
people-centered development and empowerment of local
authorities.&quot;</font></p>

favours total ban on N-arms<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By a Post Reporter</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24 - Hailing
recent breakthroughs on both nuclear and non-nuclear disarmament
fronts as encouraging, Nepal today urged the international
community to aim at complete elimination of nuclear arms. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Addressing the first post-CTBT
Asia-Pacific disarmament meet that opened here today, Foreign
Minister Dr Prakash Chandra Lohani said a time-bound framework is
essential for the total elimination of nuclear weapons, adding it
would not be easy for nuclear weapon states to part with these
symbols of power or for threshold states to abandon their nuclear
option. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;But we must stop being
prisoners of the pseudo-security of these weapons and concentrate
on post-CTBT era directed to complete nuclear disarmament,&quot;
said Lohani.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The programme of action proposed
by 28 NAM and other nations for phased elimination of all nuclear
arms provides a sound framework for progress, the Foreign
Minister pointed out. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The meeting, the ninth in the
series, intends to explore priorities in the field of nuclear
disarmament after the adoption of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) last year by the 50th General
Assembly session.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The three-day meet will address
key nuclear disarmament issues, including the enforcement of CTBT
and the preparatory process of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
review conference scheduled for the year 2000. The meeting will
also focus on regional security and illicit flow of small
weapons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Over 30 participants from
government, academic and research institutes and non-governmental
organizations, mainly from the Asia-Pacific region, are attending
the meeting financed from voluntary contributions of member
states and other organizations.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Japan has been a major donor to
the Asia-Pacific forum. Nepal provides 7,000 US dollars to
Kathmandu-based UN Centre for Disarmament Affairs each year. The
other UN Region Centres for Disarmament Affairs are based in
Lima, Peru and Lome, Togo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">An uneasy peace at the global
level, interspersed with regional hostilities, has become the
hallmark of the post-cold war era. The Asia-Pacific region, like
some others, has its share of discords and security problems. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Ethnic diversity, territorial
disputes, developmental inequities and social injustice, further
aggravated by colonial legacies and cold war cracks, have sown
the seeds of mutual distrust. &quot;This deep distrust,&quot;
said Lohani, &quot;renders the region readily susceptible to
conflicts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dialogues, he said, are a
fundamental necessity to reverse the situation and create a
climate of trust in the region. In the UN jargon, Kathmandu's
initiative in the field of disarmament has become familiar as
&quot;Kathmandu Process.&quot; Nepal has already signed the CTBT
and is in the process of ratifying the Chemical Weapons
Convention. It has also supported the indefinite extension of
NPT.</font></p>

himself in deep watersAccused of fund embezzlement and pimping
for legislators<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By a Post Reporter</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24 - In a dramatic
twist, leader of Communist Party of Nepal (UML), Bam Dev Gautam,
found himself in deep waters on Monday after a Central Committee
(CC) member levelled serious charges against him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">CC member Iswor Pokhrel charged
Gautam of abusing his position during the rule of the UML
government, embezzling millions of rupees and procuring
prostitutes for lawmakers during a December no-trust motion
against the Deuba government.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Pokhrel&#146;s three-and-half
page long counter charge-sheet turns the table on Gautam who is
trying to sack UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal. Gautam
dominated the intra-party feud until Monday with the majority of
CC members siding with him.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In Monday&#146;s CC session,
Pokhrel dropped the bombshell by alleging that the then Deputy
General Secretary Gautam often pressured UML Finance Minister
Bharat Mohan Adhikari to deflect foreign currency.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Pokhrel also charged that Gautam
frequently abused his position during the UML rule to clear
illegal gold from the customs of the Tribhuwan International
Airport on a commission basis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Gautam also used his considerable
clout to provide lucrative posts in the customs to those who
cared to pay commission to him, Pokhrel alleged.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">During the no-trust motions
against the UML government and the Deuba government, Gautam
embezzled millions of rupees from the party coffers and private
sources, Pokhrel claimed. During the December no-trust motion
against the Deuba government, Gautam not only embezzled 5 million
rupees from the party sources and millions more from private
sources but also procured prostitutes for lawmakers to win their
support, Pokhrel said.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;These charges have often
been carried by the media. If Gautam is innocent, why has he not
denied them yet?&quot; questioned Pokhrel in the CC meet.
&quot;Gautam should be penalized for these offenses,&quot; said
Pokhrel. &quot;To start with, he should be removed from the
politburo standing committee.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Pokhrel&#146;s other charges
against Gautam included favoritism, groupism and violation of
party statute and decisions including the one on the Nepal-India
Mahakali treaty. He also criticized Gautam&#146;s enthusiasm to
form a government with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When The Kathmandu Post asked
Gautam about the charges against him, he refused to comment.</font></p>

slams anti-Nepal activities<br>
</b></font><em><strong>By a Post Reporter</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24 - Madhav Kumar
Nepal&#146;s stronghold GEFONT, the labour wing of CPN(UML), has
condemned the anti-Nepal activities carried out by his arch-rival
Bam Dev Gautam.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In a press statement today,
GEFONT has hinted at the lack of serious Marxist ideology among
the party&#146;s executive body, accusing them of deviating from
their leftist orientation while charge-sheeting the party general
secretary. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the labour union,
any decisions regarding the leadership has to be taken by the
party&#146;s general assembly and not by the Central Committee,
the party&#146;s executive body.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">GEFONT has termed Gautam&#146;s
action as &quot;unpalatable,&quot; questioning whether
responsible leaders should resort to &quot;cheap gimmicks like
secret meetings to change the leadership. GEFONT adds: &quot;How
can these leaders expect to win the trust of thousands of our
party workers with such machinations?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The labour union &quot;shows
concern over the tussle for power among leaders&quot;, adding
petty interests will ruin the party&#146;s image. &quot;If such a
situation persists, UML&#146;s identity will be at stake.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Nepal and Gautam have been at
loggerheads since the latter was removed as the party deputy
early last year. But the rivalry deepened during the run-up to
the Mahakali ratification last September, with Nepal supporting
the Indo-Nepal river treaty and Gautam opposing it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Out of four sister organizations
of CPN(UML) -- the All Nepal National Federation of Students
Union (V), All Nepal Women&#146;s Association (ANWA), All Nepal
Peasants Association (ANPA) and General Federation of Nepal Trade
Unions(GEFONT), -- the latter is the only party body that stood
firmly behind Nepal when a furore broke out after the Mahakali
ratification.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Gautam yesterday charge-sheeted
Nepal with allegations ranging from irresponsible leadership to
resorting to strong-arm tactics in violation of the principles
established by the party&#146;s fifth general assembly. Gautam
has already collected signatures from 21 CC members to force the
general secretary&#146;s resignation.</font></p>

<p><em><strong>PMO-ministry differ over power companiesBy Binaj
Gurubacharya</strong></em></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">KATHMANDU, Feb 24 - The Ministry
of Water Resources has approached a number of potential companies
and has sought the help of diplomatic communities to look for
companies to develop and operate the multi-billion dollars
Karnali Chisapani hydro-electricity projects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Informing a parliamentary
committee members about the latest development in the nine
billion US dollars project, Ministry of Water Resources Secretary
Dwarika Nath Dhungel said the Ministry has started to look for
prospective multinational companies to take over the project with
a hope to implementing competitive negotiation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Ministry has come up with a
list of prospective companies who would possibly show interest in
the projects and has requested the embassies of friendly
countries to inform such companies of their respective countries
to come forward with their proposals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition, the Ministry has
also started a study on the possibilities of bringing maximum
benefit to the country.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The only company so far to show
any interest has been the US-based Enron Renewable Energy Corp.,
who has already presented its proposal twice, pledging to take
over the project.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Ministry proposes to issue
letters of invitation for bidders on March 1, and expect to
receive comments from bidders by the 23rd of the same month.
There would also be a pre-bid conference on April 15 and the
final date for submission of proposals have been set for May 31.
The Ministry also proposes to select the winning bidder on July
15, and issue Letter of Intent, which is to be followed by
negotiations leading to project agreements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The project first surfaced in
1977 during the visit of the then Indian prime minister Moharji
Desai, who signed a joint communique agreeing to initiate a joint
study of the project.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Following that, a secretary level
meeting was held on April 4, 1978, which decided to form a joint
team of engineers and geologists and agreed to carry out
additional study by forming a &quot;joint group of experts.&quot;
The group has already held nine meetings but have failed to meet
in the past few years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The project&#146;s ultimate
production could be 16,200 MW of hydropower, but Enron has
proposed to produce 10,800 MW of electricity which would be
consumed locally and exported to India and China.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">But India would also get other
downstream benefits like flood control and irrigation, for which
negotiation with India is necessary in this regard, said
Secretary Dhungel.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Engineer Arjun Shrestha said with
the Mahakali Treaty, the scenario in water resources between
Nepal and India has completely changed, leaving space for
negotiations and bargaining.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The project has the potential
capacity to irrigate 191,000 hectares of land in Nepal and 3.2
million hectares of land in India. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhungel said although Enron has
been the only company to come up with a proposal for the
Karnali-Chisapani project, the Tata Electric Company of India has
also submitted its proposal for the 402 MW Arun III project in
addition to the proposal put by Enron.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The proposed project for
developing and managing the hydro-electricity projects was
presented to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in September last
year, but Enron was made to present and brief the Ministry again
last month.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Chairman of the company, Robert
Kelly presented the proposal on January 30 to high level
government officials and members of the cabinet and the
opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Prime Minister&#146;s office
(PMO) is for granting the multi-billion dollar project to Enron,
but the Ministry is for calling additional proposals and has
extended the date for reaching the final decision to this summer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The PMO has been saying that when
it comes to the matter of mega projects like this one, the policy
is &quot;first come, first serve basis,&quot; and Enron is
entitled to go forward with the project.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Enron has also claimed that the
delay in starting the project would cost Nepal a loss of US$ 1.2
to 2.4 billion in lost power revenue and US$ 74 to 949 million in
lost tax revenues every year.</font></p>
