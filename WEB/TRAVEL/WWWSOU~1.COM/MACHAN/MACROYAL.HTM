The Royal Chitwan National Park
which stand today as successful
testimony of nature conservation
in South Asia. This is the first
National Park of Nepal established
in 1973 to preserve a unique eco
system significantly valuable to
the whole world.The Park covering
the protected area of 932 Sq. Km.
is situated in the subtropical 
inner Terai lowlands of southern
central part of Nepal. The Park
gained much wider recognition 
in the world when UNESCO included this area on the list of World Heritage Site in 1984.
It should also be emphasized that only a very small part of the national park is used for tourism. The great 
majority of the land, particularly in the hills, remains unvisited and therefore undisturbed. This is ideal for 
wildlife, and also preserves an element of mystery for humans; because large areas are still unexplored, our 
knowledge of what <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS5.HTM#556" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/machan/bbirds.htm"><B><U>birds</B></U></a> and <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs5.htm#558" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/machan/banimals.htm"><B><U>animals</B></U></a> the park contains is by
