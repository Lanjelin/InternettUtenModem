<h3 align=center><u>HOW TO PREPARE FOR A TREK :</u></h3>
<p>Even on an easy trek one will be required to walk for about 5-6 hours daily on uneven terrain and 
therefore should get used to regular exercise. We suggest you bring a pair of light and a pair of 
heavy pants, 3-4 t-shirts, 1-2 long sleeve shirts, 1 woolen sweater, 2-3 pairs of underwear, 3-4 
pairs of socks(cotton and woolen), a sun hat, woolen hat, jacket, rain poncho (for summer), 
trekking boots, camping shoes(sandles, slippers), gloves, thermal wear (for winter), swimming suit, 
sunglasses, backpack, flashlight with extra batteries, sunscreen, lip balm, walkman, books, games, 
and cards if you wish, toiletries, toothbrush, toothpaste, toilet soap, shampoo, toilet paper, pocket 
knife, camera and film, compass, water bottle, walking stick, and some extra money. </p>
<h3><font size=3><u>FOOD AND WATER:</u></font></h3>
<p>Our field staff are well trained. They will take maximum care with respect to hygiene. Water will 
always be properly boiled before preparing food or drinks. Food on the trek/tour is wholesome 
and freshly prepared for each meal. Only rarely do we supplement it with canned food which is 
used on longer trek/tours. One is advised not to drink water from the tea shops or streams along 
the way. Boiled water is supplied by our field staff who refill water bottles during breakfast and 
dinner times. </p>
<h3><font size=3><u>RESERVATION AND CANCELLATION PROCESS:</u></font></h3>
<h3><font size=3><b><i>You can book your holiday by mail, fax, directly at Glacier Dome head office in 
Kathmandu, or through your travel agent. In order to confirm the booking, we require 25 
% of the tour cost as a deposit at least two months in advance. The balance is payable at 
our head office in Kathmandu before the tour commencement. The security deposit will 
be refunded if a cancellation is made one month prior to the tour commencement. If a 
cancellation is made less than a month prior to the tour commencement 50 % of the 
deposit will be refunded. No refunds will be made if the tour is cut short according to 
travellers' wishes.</i></b></font></h3>
<p>Finally, if there is anything at all we can do to aid in your travel plans just let us know. We realize 
some of our clients have special needs and we would like to do our best to try to accommodate 
those needs. On behalf of all the staff here at Glacier Dome, we would like to extend our sincere
