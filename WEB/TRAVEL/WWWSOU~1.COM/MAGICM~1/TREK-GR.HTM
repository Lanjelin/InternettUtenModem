<p><font color="#B00000"><font size=4><em><strong>EASY TREKS (Grades 1-3)</strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong> <br>
</strong></em></font>These treks are suitable for most people with an average level of 
fitness. They are also suited to family groups with younger children 
or those with limited time. Even though these treks are rated as 
easy they afford the first time visitor to the Himalaya the chance to 
see the mountains at close range and to appreciate the culture of 
the people of the hills. These treks do not normally reach 
elevations exceeding 3500 metres making acclimatisation 
unnecessary for most trekkers. </p>
<p><font color="#B70000"><font size=4><em><strong>MEDIUM TREKS (Grades 4-6) </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>Medium treks begin to present more of a challenge to first time 
trekkers. The treks will reach elevations approaching 5000 metres 
and sometimes slightly higher and generally are of at least fourteen 
days duration. These treks should only be contemplated by fit, active people. The treks in this 
category are still suitable for people of all ages although small children will probably find them too 
strenuous. </p>
<p><font color="#B50000"><font size=4><em><strong>HARD TREKS (Grades 7-10) </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>Hard treks are those which are through relatively undeveloped regions and reach elevations 
approaching 6000 metres with these altitudes being sustained for several days. Because of the 
remoteness of the areas these treks will rarely be of less than twenty five days duration. While age is 
not automatically a barrier to undertaking a hard trek these treks are not normally suited to the very 
young or to older persons unless they have a high level of fitness and have previosly trekked at 
altitude. All persons taking part in hard treks should be of above average fitness and regularly 
participate in a suitable form of exercise such as hiking or bushwalking. </p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#B70000"><font size=4><em><strong>MOUNTAINEERING <br>
</strong></em></font></font>Various grades of mountaineering expeditions can be arranged either as complete trips or as part of 
a sceduled trek. Most of the treks that we organise have the potential to have included in their 
itinerary one of the various trekking peaks (these are specially selected peaks generally of around 
6000 metres elevation). More serious attempts can be organised if there is a group wanting to climb 
any particular peak. <br>
Persons wishing to take part in any mountaineering trip will need to have a very good level of fitness 
and, for the more serious peaks, some alpine climbing experience. </p>
<p><font color="#B70000"><font size=4><em><strong>RAFTING </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>Relatively easy rafting trips can be incorporated into the itinerary of most of our treks, depending on 
the time of year. For those persons wishing to participate in more demanding rafting trips there are a 
number of options which they will find more than challenging. Trips such as these can be arranged 
provided there is enough demand. </p>
<p><font color="#C40000"><font size=4><em><strong>NEW ADVENTURES </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>We are constantly researching new and exciting itineraries to offer you. In cooperation with the 
Nepalese Ministry for Tourism we are presenting a range of new trips to coincide with the Visit 
Nepal Year 1998 promotion. Details of these are yet to be finalised but they will include the 
following. </p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#BD0000"><font size=4><em><strong>Himalayan Explorer </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>A cultural trip with most of the travelling by bus and/or air. Highlights include a stay in a traditional 
village, a flight along the main Himalayan range, three days in our jungle resort and extensive tours 
through the Kathmandu Valley. <strong><br>
Duration: 21 days in Nepal </strong></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#BF0000"><font size=4><em><strong>West of Kanchenjunga </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>A completely new area in the far east. The trekking should not be too demanding but the scenery 
and the cultural attractions will be second to none. An ideal alternative to our Kanchenjunga foothills 
trek. <br>
<strong>Duration: 25 days in Nepal </strong></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#C80000"><font size=4><em><strong>Ganesh Himal. </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>Only a short distance from Kathmandu but surprisingly ignored by trekkers for years. This 
spectacular region is ideal for a short but demanding trek. <br>
<strong>Duration: 19 days in Nepal. </strong></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#B70000"><font size=4><em><strong>Likhu Khola/Rolwaling Valley </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>A completely new approach route from Solu. Trek along undeveloped trails amid spectacular 
mountain scenery. Crossing into the Rolwaling Valley via a high and dificult pass will be the highlight 
of the trip. <br>
<strong>Duration: 30 days in Nepal</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#BF0000"><font size=4><em><strong>Saipal Expedition </strong></em></font></font><font size=4><em><strong><br>
</strong></em></font>Travel to the far west of Nepal and be part of an attempt on a virgin 7000 metre peak. Previous 
mountaineering experience required. <br>
<strong>Duration: 35 days in Nepal. </strong></p>
