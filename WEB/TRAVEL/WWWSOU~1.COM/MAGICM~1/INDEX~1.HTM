<p><strong>Sandwiched between India and Tibet, Nepal 
is a country rich in a diverse array of 
landscapes and cultures. </strong></p>

<p><em>Where else on Earth could you travel 100 km and go from just above sea level to the top of 
the worlds' highest mountain? </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Here you can do just that......................................... </strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flood plains of the Terai, on Nepal's southern border, are at an elevation of only 150 metres 
above sea level while a mere 100 km to the north, straddling the Nepal/Tibet border, is the 8848 
metre high bulk of Mount Everest. </p>
<p>Not unexpectedly, the landforms, flora and fauna of this region are unique. The steamy jungle, with 
its' luxuriant vegetation, to the south is home to rhinoceros, elephants, tigers along with numerous 
smaller animals and a myriad of birds of all colours and sizes. Heading north, across the foothills, the 
jungle gives way to forests of pine, fir and rhododendron. </p>
<p>Born in the melting snows and glaciers flow mighty rivers that have cut immense gorges through the 
ranges. Heading south to join the Ganges these rivers provide an ideal location for rafting 
expeditions. From huge rapids to serene, gently flowing waters there is the opportunity for people of 
all interests to enjoy this experience. </p>
<p>Everywhere you look you will see signs of cultivation, for the Nepalese are a nation of farmers who 
have learned to harvest their lands with an efficiency unrivalled in many developed countries. As you 
climb higher the vegetation becomes increasingly sparse until you reach the tree-line where the frigid 
climate allows only summer grazing of the hardy yak and mountain sheep and goats. </p>
<p>You are now in the land of the mountain giants. Of the fourteen mountains on earth above 8000 
meters, Nepal has eight. The magnificent scenery of this region has to be seen to be believed. 
Mountains that rival anything in Europe or North America, are here, merely foothills. The sheer size 
of the main Himalaya range can be hard to comprehend with the base of most of the mountains 
starting at a point higher than most other mountains anywhere else in the world. </p>
<p><img src="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/magicmountain/M4.jpg" align=right border=4 hspace=0 width=184 height=289>The life of the Nepalese people revolves around their religions. The 
majority of the population are Hindu while most of the remainder 
are Buddhist. Anywhere else you would expect tension between 
such religious groups but here there is an amazing tolerance and 
understanding. </p>
<p>Derived from two main backgrounds, Indo-Burmese and 
Mongolian, the ethnic groups of Nepal are a source of fascination 
for anyone interested in anthropology. Over twenty different groups 
can be identified, all with their own language and culture. Despite 
being unified in the eighteenth century these groups have managed 
to retain their traditions largely intact and show a great deal of pride 
in their preservation. Their colourful ceremonies, their unique dress, 
their architecture all provide a wealth of different experiences for the 
tourist who wants to see more than just the mountains. </p>
<p>Yes, Nepal is truly a land of contrasts and can offer an experience so diverse that it can cater for 
visitors of all tastes, ages and abilities. Its' political stability can guarantee that your trip will be 
unlikely to be marred by the unrest becoming so common in other parts of the east. Its' warm 
friendly people will welcome you to share their culture and customs. This may be your first visit but 
it probably won't be your last. </p>
