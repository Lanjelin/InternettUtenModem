<p align=center><font color="#9F0000"><font size=4><strong>The Far East </strong></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>S</strong></font>traddling the Nepal/India border is the third highest mountain on earth, Kanchenjunga. The region 
surrounding this mighty peak, on the Nepalese side of the border, has, until recently, been closed to 
all visitors except the occasional mountaineering expedition or a few lucky scientific groups. Now it 
is possible for trekkers, who travel with Magic Mountain to visit this fascinating region. </p>
<p>The Kanchenjunga region is home to a diverse mix of people from many ethnic backgrounds. The 
most predominant of these are the Rai and Limbu peoples but they are neighbours to many other 
groups the most obvious of which are the Brahmans and Chhetris in the lower elevations while 
higher up the valleys are found people of Tibetan origin. </p>
<p>To trek in the Kanchenjunga region is a spectacular experience. Starting in the lowland valleys the 
vegetation is green and lush and the villages full of colourful local produce and crafts. The walking in 
this region is easy paced as we generally follow river valleys upwards rather than crossing ridges. 
As altitude is gained the scenery changes. The mountains that have dominated the horizon are 
getting closer, the villages more isolated and the people more Tibetan in appearance. Above the 
tree line the landscape takes on a rugged beauty. Towering snowy peaks, crystal clear mountain 
streams and glacial rivers of ice are on all sides. The only signs of human habitation the isolated yak 
herders' camps. </p>
<p>For an experience of Nepal in an area unchanged by western influences, a trek in the 
Kanchenjunga region is hard to beat. </p>

<p align=center><font color="#9F0000"><font size=4><strong>The Everest Region. </strong></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>M</strong></font>ore correctly known as Solu Khumbu, the Everest region is home to the legendary Sherpas. 
One of the most popular trekking destinations Solu Khumbu can also be a place to experience a 
really isolated wilderness experience by simply travelling a few days away from the main tourist trail 
up to Everest base camp. An area jam packed with the most incredible mountain scenery the 
Everest region also offers a wide range of cultural experiences with the warm and friendly Sherpa 
people welcoming visitors to share their lifestyle, their religion and their festivals. </p>
<p>Treks in Solu Khumbu can be short in duration and easy in grade or can be very much longer and 
more demanding depending on the type of experience the trekker expects. From the eight day 
Everest View to undertakings such as Everest Makalu or Gokyo Rolwaling, which require a greater 
commitment in both time and endurance, there is a trek in Solu Khumbu to satisfy every trekkers 
expectations. </p>

<p align=center><font color="#9F0000"><font size=4><strong>Central Nepal </strong></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>T</strong></font>he central region of Nepal contains some of the best known trekking routes in the Himalaya and 
also some surprisingly undeveloped destinations. From the Langtang Valley, just to the north of 
Kathmandu, to the massive bulk of Dhaulagiri in the west there is a multitude of possible 
destinations. The most famous of all the treks must be the Annapurna Circuit. Combining stunning 
scenery with a wealth of cultural experiences this trek is the one that everyone has heard about. But 
travel one or two valleys to either side and you will be trekking in remote undeveloped regions 
amongst spectacular mountain ranges that few trekkers are ever lucky enough to experience. A true 
adventure awaits you. </p>

<p align=center><font color="#970000"><font size=4><strong>The Far West.</strong></font> </font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>F</strong></font>or the very adventurous trekker a destination in Nepals' far west provides an experience different 
to any other that can be found in the eastern half of the country. Isolated by transport difficulties 
and government regulations this region had been a well kept secret until progressive trekking 
agencies started organising expeditions into this uncharted country. Steeped in tradition and ancient 
religions the people of western Nepal have had little contact with modern day travellers. The 
landscape also presents a very different panorama to that seen further east. Gone are the massive 
mountain ranges to be replaced by desolate rolling hills way above the tree-line, tranquil lakes and 
steep sided gorges which funnel the melting snows away to join the mighty rivers to the south. At 
lower elevations huge tracts of virgin forests give shelter to many different species of animals and 
birds. For a truly different insight into Nepal trekking the far west could be the answer for you. </p>

<p><font color="#990000"><font size=5><em><strong>When to go</strong></em></font><em><strong> ...............................................</strong></em></font></p>
<p>The prime trekking seasons are late September through November and March through to late 
May. During these periods the weather is generally settled and the temperature not too hot and not 
too cold. Days are usually sunny and clear and light clothing is adequate until reaching the higher 
elevations of about 4500 metres. Nights are cool to cold but overnight temperatures generally do 
not go much below freezing point. </p>
<p>The Spring season of March through to May is famous for its' display of flowers particularly the 
Rhododendrons which colour the hill sides with a rich array of colours. Autumn sees a fresh green 
tinge to the countryside following the rains of the monsoon. During early autumn there may be the 
occasional rain in the late afternoon but the clouds associated with this can produce the most 
spectacular sunsets. The winter season from December through to the beginning of March sees the 
weather become progressively colder. The days are generally clear but you can expect snowfalls to 
close the higher passes making traditional treks such as the Annapurna and Manaslu circuits as well 
as Everest Base Camp a risky proposition. Trekkers during the winter, however, will be rewarded 
with crystal clear skies and wonderful views of the mountains. </p>
<p>The summer season is the monsoon season. The foothills become far too hot for comfort and daily 
rain turns the trails into quagmires. Some treks, such as Mustang are possible where the main 
Himalayan range causes a rain shadow effect but generally this is not a good time to be trekking in 
Nepal. Other destinations, such as Tibet, are the best options for this time of year. </p>
