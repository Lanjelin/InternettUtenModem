NEPAL </strong></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#D00000"><font size=4><em><strong>Annapurna Circuit </strong></em></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>T</strong></font>he classic trek in the central region of Nepal. 
Lush green valleys, stupendous mountain scenery, 
a wide mix of cultures and the crossing of a 5000 
metre pass into the deepest river valley on earth. 
The Magic Mountain itinerary takes several 
diversions from the normal route getting away from the crowds that can sometimes be found there. </p>

<p><font color="#BB0000"><font size=4><em><strong>Gorkha </strong></em></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>L</strong></font>ocated an easy four hour drive away from Kathmandu, Gorkha is a fascinating reminder of 
Nepals' past turbulent political history. The region to the north of the city provides an ideal location 
for the first time trekker to experience unspoiled Nepalese culture and, at the same time be 
surrounded by snow capped Himalayan giants. Trek from Gorkha across rolling ridges and through 
dense forests until emerging onto a hilltop giving incredible mountain views. Never reaching more 
than 3200 metres elevation this trek is ideal for families with young children or for those wanting a 
more relaxed trekking experience. Combine this trek with rafting and a jungle safari and you have 
our Nepal Experience package. </p>

<p><font color="#B30000"><font size=4><em><strong>Langtang Valley </strong></em></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>T</strong></font>he Langtang Valley lies just to the north of Kathmandu and its mountains form the backdrop to 
the city. Being close to the main entry point for tourists the valley is a popular destination for 
trekkers but we have designed an itinerary that takes you into the remote head of the valley where 
little sign of development can be seen. The challenging crossing of the Ganja La pass leads back to 
Kathmandu on foot-tracks that have remained unaltered for centuries. Options for this trek can 
include climbs of one of the many minor peaks in the area with basic mountaineering training 
provided by our expert staff. </p>

<p><font color="#BB0000"><font size=4><em><strong>The Lost Kingdom of Mustang </strong></em></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>I</strong></font>solated for generations by government regulations the tiny region of Mustang huddles on the 
Tibetan border north of the Annapurna range. A part of the Tibetan plateau, Mustang presents a 
scene totally different to that seen elsewhere in Nepal. This arid region with its' fantastically eroded 
landscape and rich red and grey colours is home to the last of the separate kingdoms that once 
made up Nepal. The people of Mustang, the Lopa, still practice a lifestyle similar to their Tibetan 
neighbours who live only a few kilometres over the border. <br>
Entry to this fascinating remnant of a past era is still heavily restricted making treks here only of short 
duration. But, combine Mustang with a longer trek or a rafting and jungle safari and you have an 
experience equalled by no other. </p>

<p><font color="#BB0000"><font size=4><em><strong>Manaslu Circuit </strong></em></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>R</strong></font>ivalling its' more famous neighbour, the Annapurna Circuit, the recently opened Manaslu Circuit 
has much to offer both the first time and experienced visitor to Nepal. As this trek is restricted to 
members of organised trekking groups there has not been the overdevelopment, in the form of 
trekkers lodges, seen in so many other parts of Nepal. Instead you see only traditional village life 
being lived by a range of ethnic groups all living in harmony with their environment. From the deep 
river gorges to the spectacular mountains of the Manaslu and Ganesh Himal ranges the scenery will 
blow your mind! So, if you want to have the experience of a trek such as the Annapurna Circuit 
without seeing hordes of tourists then Manaslu is for you. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Duration : 28 days in Nepal <br>

<p><font color="#BD0000"><font size=4><em><strong>Manaslu/Annapurna Combination </strong></em></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>C</strong></font>ombine the best of the Annapurna and Manaslu Circuits with the chance to climb four different 
peaks and you have an itinerary that is hard to beat. The Annapurna Circuit is justifiably the most 
popular trekking destination with its' wealth of diverse scenery; from lush tropical valleys to ranges 
of Himalayan giants, this route has it all. Moving off the beaten track for the climbs, the trekkers 
crowding the main trail are left behind and you can enjoy the solitude of a high altitude wilderness. 
The unspoiled Manaslu circuit offers much that has been changed by trekkers on the Annapurna 
side. Villages and people living traditional lifestyles unaltered by the demands of modern tourism. 
The climbs are all challenging enough for most budding mountaineers and are led by our staff who 
have experience climbing on the worlds' highest peaks. For high adventure in the high Himalaya this 
trip could be for you. </p>

<p><strong>Duration : 50 days in Nepal <br>

<hr>
<p><font color="#B30000"><font size=4><em><strong>Dhaulagiri/Annapurna </strong></em></font></font></p>
<p><font size=4><strong>C</strong></font>ombine the circuits of Dhaulagiri and Annapurna with the chance to climb five different trekking 
peaks and you have the ultimate trek. Spend days at a time in remote, unoccupied mountain valleys, 
cross three passes at over 5000 metres elevation and see the splendour of the Himalayan giants 
Annapurna 1 and Dhaulagiri. <br>
Not a beginners trek but an ideal introduction to mountaineering. </p>
