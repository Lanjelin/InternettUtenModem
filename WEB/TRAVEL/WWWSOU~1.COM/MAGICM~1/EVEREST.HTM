of the worlds' highest mountains in one day. Based 
on the original expedition route to Everest Base 
Camp the Magic Mountain itinerary makes several diversions from the main trail giving the trekker 
both better acclimatisation and a taste of wilderness travel. The traditional visit to Kala Pattar and 
Everest Base Camp is followed by a side trip into the unspoiled Gokyo Valley where the views of 
the high Himalaya are second to none. </p>

<p><font size=4><strong>I</strong></font>f you want to experience true Nepalese wilderness trekking and climb the highest of the trekking 
peaks in Nepal then Everest Makalu is for you. High mountain passes; remote, uninhabited valleys; 
an attempt on the 6500 metre Mera Peak; unbeatable views of the main Himalayan range. All of this 
combined with Magic Mountains' traditional trekking service will make this the trip of a lifetime. Not

<p><font size=4><strong>N</strong></font>ot everyone has the time or the stamina to reach the traditional goal of trekkers in the Everest 
region, Everest Base Camp. For this reason we are offering a shortened itinerary that still gives you 
more than just a glimpse of the highest peaks on earth. We spend two nights on the beautiful ridge 
top that houses the rebuilt Buddhist monastery of Thyangboche from where the dawn and dusk 
views of Everest are spectacular. We also stay for two nights in Namche Bazar with its' surrounding 
Sherpa villages and wealth of Sherpa culture and hospitality. This trek can ideally be combined with 
rafting or jungle trips. </p>

<p><font size=4><strong>D</strong></font>o you want to combine a trek to the Everest region with an 
adventure in a remote unspoiled valley? Do you want to 
experience Sherpa and Tibetan culture and religion? Do you want 
the chance to climb a trekking peak? All of this and much more 
can be experienced on our Gokyo and Rolwaling Valleys trek. 
For years, protected by regulations and challenging access routes, 
the Rolwaling Valley has remained unaltered by western 
influences. Now open to group trekking parties this fascinating 
valley has much to offer. The challenge of the crossing of one of 
the most difficult passes on any trekking route and the desolate 
wasteland of a huge glacier leads eventually to a rich, fertile valley 
dotted with villages and farming communities. The warmth and 
friendliness of the valleys' inhabitants will be one of the highlights of 
the trip. This is not a trek for the faint hearted but for those who 
accept the challenge it will be the trip of a lifetime. </p>

<p><font size=4><strong>C</strong></font>ombine the traditional Everest trek with some remote area diversions and add the challenge of 
climbing a 6000 metre peak and you have our Lobuche East Expedition. One of the more difficult 
of the trekking peaks of Nepal, Lobuche East lies only a few kilometres from Everest. From the 
summit the views of the main Himalayan range are the amongst the best to be had anywhere. <br>
This is not a trek for the beginner for although the climb is optional the itinerary takes you through 
some remote and rugged areas. But, for those taking the challenge this trip will offer a complete 
Himalayan adventure with all of the excitement and cultural experiences you could wish for. </p>

<p><font size=4><strong>T</strong></font>his is the ideal winter trek. It combines fabulous scenery with a rich cultural experience all at a low 
enough altitude to ensure that winter snows do not spoil your trek. Set in the district of Solu this 
trek, through the foothills of the Himalaya, visits villages that the famous Sherpa people call home. 
Many of our staff come from this region so you will be guaranteed a warm welcome in their family 
homes. Their culture and religion will be seen as it can be nowhere else with their colourful festivals 
and happy singing and dancing all on the list of attractions. So if you are interested in more than just 
the spectacular views and want to visit during December through February then this is the trek for 
you. </p>

<p><font size=4><strong>F</strong></font>or a complete experience of what Nepal has to offer our Nepal Experience itinerary is ideal. 
Combining a trek in an unspoiled, yet undemanding, region with the thrill of whitewater rafting and 
the luxury of a stay in our jungle resort this trip offers it all. The trek through the foothills surrounding 
the ancient fortress town of Gorkha takes you into the traditional homeland of the famed Gurkha 
soldiers. Fearsome in battle these people in their natural environment are warm and friendly and will 
be happy to show you some of the delights of their region. The sometimes tranquil sometimes raging 
waters of one of Nepals' best known rafting rivers now await.</p>
<p>Our experienced rafting crew will take you for the ride of your lives through rapids with ominous 
names like Upset, S-bend and Ladies Delight before setting up an idyllic campsite on a deserted 
sandy beach. What better way to unwind after a trek than to visit our jungle resort. Set inside the 
Chitwan National Park, Machan Resort is the ideal base from which to see Rhino, deer, many 
different species of birds and, with luck, the famed Bengal Tiger. All of this in the luxurious and 
isolated setting for which Machan is famous. </p>
