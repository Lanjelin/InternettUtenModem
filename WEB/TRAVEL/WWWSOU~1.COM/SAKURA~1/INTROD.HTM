<B>   Namaste. As dedicating ourselves into the field of tourism
in Nepal, we have established a trekking company named 'Sakura
Treks' in 1993. For your convenience and safety, our guides, cooks
and field staff are well trained, having years of practical experience
in this profession. They are always ready to serve you at their
best. Since '93, we are serving foreign trekkers, climbers, professors
and students from various well known universities in the field
of trekking, mountaineering, educational trek and research team
in Nepal. While planning a trekking-course for you and your friends,
the personal attention, care and safety (for both trekking members
and our staff) will be our guidelines to make your trekking successful,
the secrets of our better trekking arrangement in Nepal. The guidelines
are the main points which one cannot overlook or ignore before
planning a trekking-course in this mountainous country. </B>

<B>   Perhaps, we are the very first trekking agency to introduce
seasonable package treks in Nepal. Our package treks provide a
relief to the trekkers having tender physical condition or low-budget
to complete a strenuous trekking-course, who cannot  afford much
time for trekking due to their tailor-made timeframe. We just
help them to fulfill their incomplete dream with our package treks
having almost pin-point accuracy.  Apart from our competitors,
we believe in simple but reliable services to all our respected
guests, well-wishers and our patronizing travel agents in Nepal
and abroad.</B>
