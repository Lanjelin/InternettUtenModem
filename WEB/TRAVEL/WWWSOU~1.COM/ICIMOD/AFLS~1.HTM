<H3>Rationale</H3>
<P>
For the successful implementation of ICIMOD's thematic and other action research
programmes, the Centre's administrative support services will have a significant role to
play.  The Centre will thus continue to make investments to provide services comparable
to those of other international agencies.  The administrative services should not only
include efficient management of the present physical facilities (such as offices, vehicle
fleet, conference rooms, library, communications, and computer services) but also an efficient and prompt service
to support the research and demonstration work at the Centre as well as in the member countries.
<P>
The Centre's financial management system will be further strengthened to meet the ever-demanding requirements
of financial reporting for the donors, as well as to meet the demands of an effective management information
system.  A high standard of financial discipline will continue to be maintained.  The Centre will endeavour to
maintain a healthy financial base, which is quite essential for its organisational growth.
<P>
Overall, the Centre's administrative and financial services will be appropriately streamlined in order to facilitate
effective programme implementation.
