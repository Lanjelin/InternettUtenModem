<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the key questions I am
often asked is the level and kind of impact that ICIMOD has on sustainable
development in the Hindu Kush-Himalayas (HKH). The great challenge we face
is well reflected in ICIMOD's primary mandate &quot;<I>to promote the development
of an economically and environmentally sound mountain ecosystem</I> [stretching
over more than 3,500 km] <I>and to improve the living standards of</I>
[120 million] <I>mountain people</I>&quot;. It is clear that ICIMOD is
not able and will never be able to reach out in such a way as to directly
impact the livelihoods of all these 120 million people. However, out of
the numerous studies; hundreds of workshops, seminars; and training courses;
and the increasing number of field demonstration sites in which ICIMOD
is engaged, three major types of impact have emerged. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Policies </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>ICIMOD has been a prime mover
over the last few years in promoting policies that specifically address
the mountain-specific problems and opportunities of its regional member
countries. A good example is Agenda 21 for Sustainable Agricultural Development
in Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region, which was presented at the Second
Round Table on China Agenda 21 last month. This document, which was formally
adopted by the government of Xizang Autonomous Region and included in the
Priority Programme for China's Agenda 21, is now the primary policy document
on sustainable agriculture in the Autonomous Region. ICIMOD, in collaboration
with the Institute of Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, played a
facilitating and supportive role in the process of preparing the document.
ICIMOD, in equally effective ways, played a decisive role in Nepal's Agricultural
Perspective Plan, Himachal Pradesh's Tourism Policy, and other mountain
development concerns throughout the region in which &quot;ICIMOD&quot;
concepts have been used. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Technologies </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Institutions in the region also
look to ICIMOD as a source of information on technologies that are adapted
to mountain-specific situations. Mountain risk engineering, developed and
promoted by ICIMOD, is one such technology. It helps to limit the risks
to man-made disasters so often associated with building roads, irrigation
channels, and other infrastructure. The technology and training packages
developed by ICIMOD are highly appreciated and are being increasingly adopted
throughout the region. Similarly, the technologies for soil conservation,
soil fertility improvement, and rehabilitation of degraded lands that are
currently being tested on some 15 sites under different conditions are
providing hope that the trend of physical deterioration in the environment
can be reversed. The introduction of Geographic Information Systems' technology
has provided national and local institutions with a powerful tool for regional
planning and a basis on which other decisions can be made. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Awareness and Capacity Building
</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>The most important impact ICIMOD
has had is perhaps the accumulation of knowledge and experience that has
been built up in ICIMOD's partner institutions throughout the region about
many different aspects of sustainable mountain development. Over the years,
hundreds of professionals have been exposed to the mountain perspective
of their particular profession or sector through which crucial amount of
expertise is now available throughout the region. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Improved Livelihoods? </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#008000"><FONT SIZE=-1>Through these various processes
we are confident that, eventually, the livelihoods of individual households
can be improved. ICIMOD is the first to acknowledge that it cannot do so
on its own. It is only through national and local institutions, both government
and non-government, that change can be accomplished. Bringing the integrated
mountain perspective into local and national development plans and programmes
will need continuing refinement, adaptation, and commitment. ICIMOD is
willing to do this. The 120 million custodians of and dependants on the
HKH environment deserve our continuing efforts to realise a positive impact
of our work on their livelihoods. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Despite the fact that the Hindu Kush-Himalayas
are the largest storehouse of fresh water at lower latitudes, for the bulk
of people inhabiting these mountains, year-round availability of water
is a major problem. They receive either too much during the few months
of monsoon or too little for the rest of the year. They have faced these
seasonal excesses and scarcities of water since time immemorial. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Development and management of water resources
in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) Region have been, so far, primarily focussed
on power generation and/or irrigation water for the plains and urban and
industrial supply. Hence, major investments so far have been directed towards
the construction of mega- or medium-scale hydel plants and irrigation systems.
Accordingly, the systems and institutions that have developed for the storage
and management of water resources, as well as knowledge and technology
for harnessing water resources, have been primarily concerned and geared
towards the ever-increasing needs of the plains and urban areas. Although
the importance of mountain areas as primary sources of water has been accepted,
the priority given to the plains in development planning have largely ignored:
</FONT></P>

<DL>
<DL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>the water requirements of the mountain communities</B>
in the headwater regions as well as the need to provide them with a fair
share of the benefits flowing out of water resource development projects,
and </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>the need to improve understanding of the hydrology
of the headwater regions</B> which not only influence the natural hydroclimatic
and biogeophysical processes but also the human activities in the upper
watersheds. </FONT></LI>
</DL>
</DL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">A closer look at the performance and life of water
resource development projects in several countries of the HKH has revealed
various problems. These include lower than projected performances and benefits
as well as reduced lifetimes. Many of these were not anticipated and could
be attributed to ignorance of the above two aspects while designing them.
For example, throughout the HKH, higher than estimated rates of sedimentation
in the reservoirs have seriously affected their storage capacity as well
as the performance of water resource projects. Such higher sedimentations
are found to be contributed by both natural and human processes, although
exact quantification of their individual contributions has been difficult.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Nevertheless, depending upon available resources
and local ingenuity and skills, mountain communities have developed diverse
strategies and systems for the management of water, in order to meet their
needs for water for husehold consumption and irrigation in accordance with
their local climates and biogeophysical conditions. These indigenous systems
of water management, though widely variable, from the largely arid west
to the mostly wet east of the HKH region, exhibit some common features.
They are systems that can respond to the primary and critical needs for
water for local community and facilitate strong community participation
and/or support in the management of such systems. They are also geared
to meet the water needs of individual households in the local community.
Thus, local ingenuity and skill have been applied over the ages to store
and use water to meet year- round needs and to develop agricultural systems
with cropping patterns, as dictated by local water availability. All over
the HKH one can see intricate irrigation channels which use both perennial
and seasonal sources to meet irrigation needs. These channels are constructed,
operated, managed, and repaired by local communities. Similarly, drinking
water systems, based on local springs, and groundwater for community consumption
are found even in the most remote mountains. Although it is not well recorded
how these skills were developed and shared between communities inhabiting
different parts of the HKH, the presence of water mills with horizontal
wooden turbines, which are still in use in many parts of the HKH, indicates
that skills and knowledge of use and management of water were widely shared
by the mountain communities across the mountains. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Most of these indigenous systems have coped with
and survived through the inter-annual variation of climate, particularly
changes in the intensity of rainfall, as well as social and economic transformations
which have occurred locally. However, mountain communities in the HKH have
been undergoing rapid social and economic transformations, particularly
over the last four decades. Excessive increase in population has occurred,
along with growing accessibility to surface and air transport and consequent
changes in settlement patterns; usually movement to lower altitudes and
settlement on lands prone to flooding and vulnerable to landslides and
debris flows. Growing accessibility of mountain areas, and uncertainty
about the possible impacts of global warming and climate change on local
water resources, have made indigenous water management systems not only
more vulnerable but also grossly inadequate in the context of meeting the
present and future water needs of mountain people. It is also seen that
people living in small watersheds are more vulnerable and unable to cope
with the disasters unleashed by extreme weather events (particularly intense
rainfall) which cause widespread damage to existing water management systems,
triggering landslides or debris flow or flooding. It is also seen that
the frequency of such disastrous weather events is on the increase in the
HKH. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">For example, according to a recent ICIMOD study,
the upper watersheds of the Bhotekoshi and Sunkoshi in Nepal experienced
major disasters due to intense rainfall in 1981, 1982, 1987, 1988, 1990,
1993, 1995, and 1996. Intense and continuous rainfall (521 mm, 90% of the
annual) between 4 and 5 August 1996 in the Taihang mountains in Hebei Province
caused widespread loss of life and property and damage to infrastructure.
Reports expressing increasing occurrences of extreme weather events and
the consequent damage caused by flood, landslides, and debris flow are
available from many parts of the HKH. Considering the impact of such events
on the hydrological regime of the upper watersheds, it is also extremely
important to develop an adequate understanding of the hydrology of such
watersheds, so that future programmes and projects for water resource development
for mountain communities are developed on a sound scientific footing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Considering the high risks and uncertainty which
have to be faced by mountain communities across the HKH in managing and
developing their local water resources, and to ensure supplies of water
to individual mountain households in the future, there is an urgent need
to identify, develop, and implement appropriate policies and programmes
for the management of local water resources in close partnership with local
communities. ICIMOD, in close collaboration with UNESCO/IHP (International
Hydrology Programme), World Meteorological Organisation, and its Regional
Member Countries, has been actively involved, since the early 90s, in developing
a better understanding of hydrological processes in small watersheds of
the HKH through the establishment of a regional network for hydrological
research. These organisations, together with the ICIMOD Member Countries,
the German IHP/OHP Committee, and the Slovak IHP Committee, organised a
Regional Workshop on Hydrology of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas, on 23 and 24
March 1996, in Kathmandu. The Workshop launched a FRIEND (Flow Regimes
from International Experimental and Network Data) type project for the
HKH Region, namely HKH-FRIEND, which hopefully will help to develop water
resource management systems geared to the needs and priorities of mountain
households on a sound scientific basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">ICIMOD's programme on water resources' management
has taken note of and also been guided by the following four principles
recommended by the 1992 Dublin Conference on Water and Environment which
was a precursor to UNCED 1992. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource,
essential to sustain life, development, and the environment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Water development and management should be based
on a participatory approach, involving users, planners, and policy-makers
at all levels. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Women play a central part in the provision, management,
and safeguarding of water. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Water has an economic value in all its competing
uses and should be recognised as an economic good. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">In addition, ICIMOD is currently engaged in developing
a regional programme on the management of water at the community level
which is geared to the needs of individual mountain households, and which
will be developed and implemented in close partnership with local communities.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">A Regional Workshop on Water Harvesting is also
planned to be organised in April 1997 in Chengdu, Sichuan, in collaboration
with the Chengdu Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Pakistan's forests can be divided into four main
categories. Alpine forests are situated in the high mountain region, at
altitudes of between 2,000 and 3,500 metres; subalpine forests are those
in the foothills of the mountain, in the monsoon zone; riverine forests
are located in the Indus plains; and mangrove forests are situated along
the coast and in river estuaries. In addition, there are man-made irrigated
forest plantations covering over 120 thousand hectares in the Sindh and
Punjab provinces and scrub forests and dry tropical forests in the western
highlands and desert areas. The alpine or coniferous forests and subalpine
forests cover about 30% of the total area. They are mostly under the administration
of the Forest Department of Pakistan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The Forest Act of 1927 (the gift of Whiteman),
which is still in force in Pakistan, governs the ownership and use of forests.
In addition to the general provisions of the 1927 Act, each class of forests
has a separate set of tenure and usage rights attached to it. In the case
of tribal forests, they are owned outright by the local community, which
has the right to decide, on the basis of a 60% majority vote, how they
are to be exploited. However, the Forest Department extracts a royalty
on felled timber, half of which goes to the community and half to the department
for its management costs. The royalty is paid by the contractors who enter
into an agreement with the community. The contractors are also required
to replace felled trees with seedlings of the same variety - a rule seldom
observed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The state-owned reserved forests are administered
and managed by the Forest Department, which issues permits for their exploitation
and levies a royalty on felled trees. Permits may be issued to right-holders
for domestic requirements at a lower royalty, or to contractors for other
interventions in these forests. The forests which formerly belonged to
the feudal rulers, such as those in Swat, Dir, and the feudal princedoms
of the Northern Areas, are now owned by the State, but the traditional
right-holders are allowed to continue using them as before. Instead of
applying to the feudal authority for permission to fell timber, they must
now apply to the Forest Department. The department also has the responsibility
of managing the forests and for reforestation. </FONT></P>

<DL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Heavy deforestation has taken place in the past
decade in all classes of forest, facilitated by the construction of roads.
Uncontrolled exploitation, combined with heavy grazing pressure and the
clearing of land for cultivation, has resulted in the almost total depletion
of forest resources in Pakistan. The increased demand for timber has meant
added pressure on natural forests, and heavy felling has taken place where
tracts of natural forest lie close enough to a road to make it profitable.
</FONT></P>
</DL>

<DT><FONT COLOR="#008000">The coniferous forests are the most important
in relation to the conservation of both soil and water resources; the maximum
amount of soil erosion, which silts up the components of the irrigation
and hydroelectricity systems and causes flooding of the plains, takes place
in the geologically-unsettled high mountain region. These forests are also
the principal source of commercial timber in the country. Riverine forests
play a comparable role in preventing silting from agricultural lands in
the floodplains of the Indus river and in protecting the river banks from
erosion. Similarly, the mangroves protect the coastline and are the nursery
of marine life in the delta region. The scrub forests are used locally
as fodder for animals and for firewood. </FONT></DT>

<DL>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Deforestation in Pakistan</B><FONT SIZE=+1>
</FONT></FONT></DT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Deforestation in the regions that constitute Pakistan
is not a recent phenomenon. However, it has accelerated in the past century,
and, in the last 75 years, forest cover has decreased from 14% of the land
area to 5.2% . Between 1974 and 1985, timber supplies from state forests
declined by 45%. The greatest damage has occurred since the First World
War. Efforts at afforestation and attempts at watershed management have
not kept pace with increased demand and excessive cutting and overgrazing.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Reasons for Deforestation</B><FONT SIZE=+1>
</FONT></FONT></P>

<DT><FONT COLOR="#008000">Traditionally, in Pakistan, forests have been
community property and considered a part of <I>shamlaat </I>(community
land) or <I>gowcher </I>(cultivated) lands. However, through various legislative
measures, the colonial state took over the majority of forest areas in
the country. When administered by the feudal authority or community organisations,
timber from these forests was primarily for the use of community members
or their dependent artisan classes. Since traditional rural culture was
limited by poverty, and therefore conservationist by nature, wastage was
discouraged and needs were modest. </FONT></DT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The taking over of large tracts of forest by the
colonial state coincided with a considerable increase in the population
of the country. After independence, this growth increased even further,
especially in the urban areas. To meet the housing and fuel needs of the
increasing population, especially in the urban areas, state forests were
auctioned to contractors for commercial exploitation. In addition, a capitalist
consumer culture was replacing the old subsistence system, and thus timber
needs per capita increased substantially. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Forests have been taken over by the communities
in line with the break-up of the old social economy; a break-up which led
to encroachment and forced occupation of community lands. Forests were
also taken over in a similar manner by powerful individuals or groups and
their commercial exploitation became possible. This process is continuing
in Pakistan and needs intervention by the Global Environment Facility as
soon as possible, since private forests supply 78% of the locally-met timber
demand. It is indeed alarming. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The development of the canal colonies for cultivation
in the provinces of Sindh and Punjab was accompanied by the clearing of
hundreds of thousands of hectares of riverine scrub and thorn forests in
the Indus plains. Not even a fraction of this loss has been made up by
tree plantations along the canals or through the irrigated forest plantations
that have taken place. In addition to the clearing of forests for agriculture,
large areas of traditional, community-owned grazing grounds have been brought
under cultivation as a result of encroachments in the <I>barani </I>(irrigated)
areas and colonisation through the expansion of the irrigation system.
The livestock population has also increased substantially; between 1976
and 1986 alone, livestock increased from 66.1 million head to 87.23 million
head. As a result of these two factors, the pressure on pasture land is
increasing. This overgrazing is leading to loss of vegetative soil cover,
followed by erosion and the loss of topsoil. In addition, excessive grazing
of certain species palatable to animals means the selective loss of valuable
plant types and their replacement by non-edible competitors. Overgrazing
also means that new tree growth is damaged and restricted as goats tear
off young bark and leaves in search of fodder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">It is estimated that 90% of all wood consumed
in Pakistan is for fuel. According to the housing census of Pakistan (1980),
79% of rural and 48% of urban households use wood for cooking and heating
purposes. Fuelwood alone provides 50% of the domestic sector's total energy
requirements. The seriousness of the shortage can be gauged from the fact
that fuelwood prices have increased 4.5 times between 1970 and 1980. In
addition, by the year 2000, Pakistan's fuelwood needs are expected to increase
by 100%. On the other hand, since 1975 private forest production has increased
by only 1.3% per year and state forest production by only 1.8 %. Meanwhile,
timber imports have increased by 5.2% annually during this period. However,
this imported timber is not used for fuel purposes but for construction.
</FONT></P>

<DT><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Repercussions of Deforestation</B><FONT SIZE=+1>
</FONT></FONT></DT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The increase in the price of building timber is
already adversely affecting the quality of housing in the country, and
the scarcity and cost of fuelwood is becoming a major economic burden on
low-income communities. As a result, gas cylinders are in great demand,
even in rural areas, as their monthly cost is less than half that of fuelwood.
One of the most visible, and perhaps the most significant, impacts of deforestation
is soil erosion. The mountain regions where the majority of natural forests
are located are characterised by steep slopes, fragile and thin topsoil,
and unstable geological conditions. When tree cover is removed, there is
nothing to stop the soil from being washed away by even mild rainfall.
In addition, landslides and rockfalls, which occur frequently in spring
as a result of melting snow and ice, are exacerbated by the absence of
tree cover. </FONT></P>

<DT><FONT COLOR="#008000">Vast areas of the Karakorams and Hindu Kush are
naturally arid and barren, and little can be done to prevent or control
soil erosion in these areas. But the historically heavy silt load of the
Indus, which flows through these mountains, is being augmented now by large
quantities of valuable topsoil swept off the slopes of the foothills and
lower mountains in the monsoon zone. This erosion has a dual impact on
the environment; it leads to desertification of once productive upland
areas and silting up of irrigation and hydroelectric systems, lowering
their efficiency and shortening their lifespans. </FONT></DT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The building of roads is probably the single biggest
factor contributing to rapid deforestation. Previously inaccessible mountain
areas, like the Kohistan district of the North West Frontier Province of
Pakistan, have in the last 20 years been connected to the plains by major
roads. Transportation facilities have made the logging of these rich and
ancient natural forests a viable commercial proposition. The extreme poverty
and hardship of life in these remote areas have meant that the local communities
have seized this opportunity to earn a substantial income in a short span
of time by selling their trees to down-country contractors. </FONT></P>

<DT><FONT COLOR="#008000">The Environment Protection Council of Pakistan
needs to be more and more alert to see the future of Pakistan in the light
of environment in the next 50 years. Timely action can only save us from
environmental disaster. Otherwise, we may lose the treasures which we have
owned for a very long time. </FONT></DT>

biophysical conditions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">However, this richness of species' communities
and genetic materials is undergoing disastrous impoverishment due to human
interventions. Biodiversity in this mountain region is disappearing and
the process must be slowed down and without delay. Most of the concern
has been focussed on lowland tropical rain forests, but mountain wildlands
are also important storehouses of biodiversity as the lowlands have been
altered by commercial agriculture, industry, and urban settlement. The
last stronghold of nature is often still in the mountains. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">For instance, the Chang Tang wildlife reserve,
in the Tibetan Himalayas of China, encompasses approximately 300,000 square
kilometres and is the second largest protected area in the world and the
largest in the world in mountain systems. In this reserve, large herds
of Tibetan antelopes still follow ancient trails on their annual migration
routes to birthing grounds in the far north. Wild yaks and the Tibetan
wild ass have large population across the steppes. The reserve retains
a grassland ecosystem largely unaltered by humankind. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">In recent years, the regional member countries
of the HKH established their own protected areas. According to available
data, 1,400 protected areas have been established in all the eight countries
of the HKH region. Among these, only 282 fall in the HKH mountain region,
and they constitute about 20 per cent of the total. Taking into account
the land area of the mountain systems in the region and its biodiversity,
the gap must be reduced by increasing the number of protected areas in
order to maintain its diversity and unique natural habitats. For this purpose,
ICIMOD is planning to assess and update a regional review of the adequacy
of protected area coverage in relation to the major biotic provinces and
their biodiversity. Protected areas are considered to be the most important
sites for <I>in situ</I> conservation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Another issue that needs to be addressed is how
to manage protected areas more efficiently in the context of <I>in situ
</I>conservation of biological diversity and habitats. In this context,
a workshop on Effective Management of National Parks and Protected Areas
in East Asia and South Asia was jointly organised by the IUCN-CNPPA East
Asia Nature Conservation Research, Monitoring and Training Centre, ICIMOD,
the Chinese National Committee for Man and Biosphere, and the Administrative
Office of the Jinzhaigou Landscape and Nature Reserve from August 25 -
September 2, 1996, in Jinzhaigou protected area, located in West Sichuan
in the Chinese Himalayas. The 7-day workshop was attended by over 150 participants
from 10 countries. It included a 2-day field trip to the protected area
and a Tibetan village. The workshop discussed various management issues
concerning protected areas and national parks in the region and called
upon officials concerned in the region to pay greater attention to the
management issues of protected areas in order to guarantee their vigorous
and healthy development. The workshop generated a ten-point recommendation
on effective management of national parks and protected areas in East Asia
and South Asia. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">I first saw a yak 22 years ago in Nepal. Since
then, I have lived with yak herders and conducted research on domestic
yak production systems and wild yaks in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan
Plateau. Obtaining research literature on yaks was always difficult. Finally,
with the publication of THE YAK, an excellent source of information on
many aspects relating to yaks is now available. THE YAK is noteworthy because
it makes available in English valuable data that were previously published
only in Chinese. THE YAK provides a notable contribution to the knowledge
and understanding of an important, yet little-known, animal in Central
and South Asia. </FONT></P>

<DL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Authors Cai Li and Gerald Wiener have organised
THE YAK into 12 chapters, with each chapter also including an overview
to accommodate the more general reader not interested in detailed information.
The layout of THE YAK is attractive and easily readable, with ample use
of tables and figures to present detailed data. Black and white photographs
are also judiciously used and are very helpful in illustrating the different
yak breeds and yak hybrid crosses. </FONT></P>

<DT><FONT COLOR="#008000">Chapter 1 summarises information on the origin,
domestication, and distribution of yaks and includes useful information
on the status of wild yaks. Chapter 2 describes different types of domestic
yaks and breeds, both on the Tibetan Plateau and in countries other than
China. Chapter 3 discusses yak breeding and crossbreeding practices and
provides considerable data in easily-readable tables. The unique adaptive
characteristics of the yak to the high, cold environment of the Tibetan
Plateau are well outlined in Chapter 4. Chapter 5, dealing with yak reproduction,
is especially thorough in the amount of data provided from Chinese researchers.
Production is especially thoroughly discussed in Chapter 6, which brings
together a lot of valuable information previously only available in Chinese.
Performance of yak crosses is dealt with in Chapter 7 with detailed data
on production aspects of various crosses. Chapter 8 profiles yak management
systems and Chapter 9 discusses yak diseases. Products obtained from the
yak, such as milk, butter, hair, and wool is described in Chapters 10.
Chapter 11 provides information on yaks from countries other than China.
The final chapter in THE YAK is especially valuable to yak researchers
as it examines the design of experiments with yaks and an analysis of results.
Future areas for yak research are also identified. </FONT></DT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">THE YAK also makes an extremely valuable contribution
with the exhaustive references' section at the end of the book. Anyone
desiring additional information or references on yaks will be especially
pleased with this section of the book. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Cai Li and Gerald Wiener have made a valuable
contribution to yak development with the publication of THE YAK. This is
one book that should definitely be on the desk of anyone working in rangeland
management, livestock production, and pastoralism in the Himalayas and
on the Tibetan Plateau. </FONT></P>

</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Jumla is a remote district in the Karnali Zone,
in the mid-western development region of Nepal. Commodities flown in from
outside are prohibitively expensive for local subsistence farming people.
Freight costs limit large-scale cash crop production or processing. Food
shortages and limited access to health services, smoke from pinewood open
fires, as well as lack of sanitation, education, and clothing, lead to
a high incidence of infant mortality and low life expectancy. Gender and
caste disparity lead to further suffering amongst women and low castes.
Altitude and remoteness also influence the relative poverty of communities.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Above the rice growing threshold of altitude 2600m,
many villages subsist on wheat, barley, and potatoes. At these higher altitudes,
forest and pasture lands provide excellent forage for bees, while insecticide
and other agro-chemicals are rarely used. The lack of fertile land for
agriculture makes beekeeping, with the indigenous <I>Apis cerana, </I>traditionally
a very important sideline activity for the people living at higher altitude.
At lower altitudes (between 2200m and 2600m), apples, mustard, and vegetable
seeds are worthwhile income-generating activities. Hence, beekeeping also
has potential at lower altitudes in Jumla, not only in terms of honey production
but also in terms of the pollination benefits which can improve crop yields
considerably. (See Box.) </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Women farmers in Jumla work 18 hour days and take
responsibility for the vast majority of work: carrying water and firewood,
child care, and preparing food as well as all the heavy agricultural tasks,
apart from ploughing (which is a lower-caste male domain). Male farmers
in contrast are required to carry less, work shorter hours, and generally
have time for attending meetings and relaxing. This causes problems in
eliciting women's participation in new activities such as beekeeping. Despite
expressing interest in taking up beekeeping, the need to keep farming to
feed the family in coming months is so crucial that women find it hard
to make time for training and discussions during extension visits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>What is action research in the context of the
Jumla beekeeping programme?</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">In Jumla, action research into beekeeping has
been underway since July 1995 as part of the ICIMOD beekeeping project,
funded by Austro project, Austrian Agency for Technical Cooperation Ltd.
Action research in this context is the testing of appropriate beekeeping
technologies and extension methods through action, together with project
beneficiaries. Implementation of beekeeping initiatives and research into
how to do so are going hand in hand and developing in an organic way. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Traditional beekeepers' ideas are used in the
development of beehive designs, and their participation is central to the
testing of these designs. Indigenous knowledge is discussed and documented,
using participatory methods, and subsequently used in management of experimental
beehives. Evaluation through scientific methods and informal interaction
with Jumla beekeepers is underway. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>What are the aims of the research?</B> </FONT></P>

<DL>
<LI><FONT COLOR="#008000">To establish appropriate beehive designs for

as a form of livelihood improvement in very poor communities </FONT></LI>
</DL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Scientific Monitoring</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">For the purposes of scientific testing of beehives,
five different hives have been designed and replicated in an apiary at
the Karnali Technical School (KTS), Jumla. The hive designs are shown in
the middle photo on facing page and described in the caption. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Internal hive microclimates (temperature and relative
humidity), bee colony performance, and yields of honey and wax from the
different hives are compared. Hives are managed using a combination of
modern and traditional methods. Use of top-bars and regular inspection
of combs are new ideas, but the project has also been trying indigenous
methods of winter feeding, insulating, and baiting hives for catching swarms.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Village Demonstration Apiaries</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">To explore how farmers respond to the 5 different
hive designs, demonstration apiaries have been placed with beekeeping groups
for farmers to manage themselves. They are trained in beekeeping and also
in the manufacture of the straw, `Jumla', and modified log hives. They
are also assisted in caring for the bees by project extensionists who make
regular visits. Farmer response to the different hives is monitored informally
by discussion during extension visits and by preference ranking exercises.
Some training has been held in the Karnali Technical School, but for fuller
community participation, village workshops and use of farmer-to-farmer
training and extension methods are proving to be more effective. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Findings on Hive Design So Far</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Despite the good insulating properties of the
straw hive and its cheap and forest-friendly advantages, Jumla farmers
have not accepted it. Lack of durability, pest attacks, absconding by bees,
and an unsustainable straw-press design are part of the problem. However,
its most significant disadvantage is that the Jumla people do not think
of it as a beehive! The traditional view of a beehive is a hollowed- out
log which is very heavy and durable. Adaptations of this idea in the form
of the `Jumla' and modified log hives are proving very successful. Farmers
easily accept these hives and are able to make their own, with a minimum
of training, by adapting their old hives or hollowing out new logs. The
project nevertheless is trying to encourage farmers to cut old trees and
use fallen logs to reduce the negative impact on the forest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Gender Awareness Raising</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">As outlined earlier, gender inequity means that
women in Jumla have little time for beekeeping or indeed for any new activity
which contributes towards the development of their community. Hence, simply
running a programme in beekeeping in Jumla is not enough to be able to
empower women to keep bees. In response to this problem, ICIMOD is funding
a gender awareness raising programme, which is presently being implemented
in the three villages where beekeeping groups have been established. Gender
imbalances are being tackled by taking a more holistic approach. Through
group discussion of women's problems and small-scale women's drudgery reduction
programmes, it is hoped that not only will women be able to make time for
beekeeping, but also for the overall development of their community. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Challenges and Conclusions</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The bees of Jumla are currently suffering from
an epidemic of two serious diseases, Thai Sac Brood Virus and European
Foulbrood, in which baby bees die and rot inside the comb. Therefore, the
project is experiencing difficulty in producing honey and convincing farmers
about the benefits of movable comb beekeeping. Selection and multiplication
of resistant strains of bees are called for and promotion of movable comb
beekeeping is essential if the disease problem is to be tackled effectively.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">We are learning that trying to promote beekeeping
in an isolated project, rather than as part of a larger integrated community
development programme has problems. A truly participatory development process
is one which facilitates farmers to build upon their strengths and skills
in a multi-dimensional sense, rather than in beekeeping alone. Use of PRA
and participant observation stimulate general discussion on villagers'
problems and means of overcoming them. Use of these methods requires support
from local NGOs to implement `sister-activities' to beekeeping initiatives.
Such activities are to be organised with collaborating NGOs in Jumla. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">A general finding is that use of participant observation
by the outsider `agent of change' is an extremely effective way of building-up
relationships with beekeepers and, in particular, in establishing communication
with women. Illiterate women are often afraid of outsiders, but are ready
to interact with a foreigner who looks like `one of them'. Importation
of ideas, especially from outside the country, often appears to be inappropriate,
as we are experiencing with the straw hive. Adaptation of indigenous knowledge
and technology (see Box), using farmer participation, is the only way to
develop appropriate and sustainable answers.</FONT> </P>

roads, telecommunications, power development, health and family planning,
education and vocational training, sports and culture, cottage industries,
tourism, agriculture, horticulture, forestry, fisheries, and livestock
development. During this plan period, 1,870 tribal families were settled
and afforestation was undertaken on 7,600 hectares of steep slopes. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The biggest project so far undertaken by the Board
is the Asian Development Bank (ADB)financed CHT Development Project (multisectoral)

inheritance rights to 1.8 hectares of land for rubber plantation, 0.8 of
a hectare for agroforestry and horticulture, and 0.1 of a hectare as homestead
land. Another 300 families were settled under the Afforestation and Settlement
Component of the project on 4,000 hectares of sloping land. The settlement

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Dr. Robert Rhoades has worked as an anthropologist
and development specialist for over three decades in the Himalayas, European
Alps, Spanish Sierra, Nevada, the Andes, and the uplands of south-east

many of which focus on mountain people. At present, he is Professor of

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The `mountain man' is now sitting at ICIMOD and
presented below is an excerpt of his interview by our public relations'
officer.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>PRO</B><I>: When and how did your interest
in work in the mountains first develop?</I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>RR</B>: I am a flat lander by birth - I mean
flat as it possibly could be across the horizon. I grew up on the American
great plains where we had no concept at all of variation in the topography,
and, at the age of 20, I joined the American Peace Corps - one of Kennedy's
first recruits - and they sent me to a place called Nepal. Quite frankly,
a place I'd never heard of before. They assigned me to work in agricultural
extension. My job was to distribute seeds and animals to the farmers that
lived in many different parts of the country. And I came to terms with
the fact that the world wasn't flat - as Columbus once thought it was -
that in fact much of the world is vertical. I learned this while walking
through the Himalayas carrying goats and chickens to one of the most remote
areas. The experience left such a dramatic impression on me that, when
I returned to my homeland, I decided that I needed to learn two things
- learn more about the mountains as an ecosystem and as a geological reality
and to learn more about, what I call today, the ethnoscape, in other words,
the cultural variation that exists among the people who live in the mountains
today. So it was almost a shock treatment coming from such a simple place
where things were flat to where everything was up and down and very complex
as it is in the mountains. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>PRO:</B><I> So, that was what brought you to
the mountains. What brings you here to ICIMOD? What made you decide to
spend a few months of your time here at ICIMOD?</I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>RR</B>: I have a long-standing relationship
with ICIMOD that goes back to the time of Collin Rosser - the first Director
of ICIMOD. I have always been very intrigued by the mandate of ICIMOD and
its importance. The current Director General offered me an opportunity
to come here to rethink sustainable mountain agriculture as part of a project.
Is ICIMOD going in the right direction? have they made the right decisions
in the past? what kind of plans can we make for the 21st century for mountain
people in the next millennium? It is within that context that I was able
to find time from my regular job to come here and spend three months at
ICIMOD. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>PRO</B><I>: As a person who has had a long-standing
relationship with and interest in ICIMOD, do you think ICIMOD has lived
up to the expectations of its founders? What are your observations on ICIMOD's
achievements and gaps and what should be its future thrust?</I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>RR</B>: I knew quite well some of the original
founders of ICIMOD, such as John Cool and Klaus Lampe and I was talking
to them about whether or not ICIMOD had achieved the dream. I know that
T. S. Elliot said &quot;<I>Between the dream and reality there falls a
shadow and between the act and the deed there falls a shadow</I>.&quot;
We had dreams for ICIMOD and we will continue to have dreams. But I don't
think anyone ever entirely lives up to those dreams, because, in controlling
the reality, there are many problems and one feels that you are falling
short. In many ways, I feel that ICIMOD comes as close to the dream as
possible. That does not mean that there are no shadows or shortcomings
which have engaged the Centre over the years. One of the early dreams that
I had for ICIMOD which did not materialise is that it would be truly the
global, international research development centre. John Cool and some of
the early founders said that that was a part of their intention as well.
But, over the years, ICIMOD has focussed, and rightfully so, on the Hindu
Kush-Himalayan region which has brought it a certain clarity in focus.
Certainly there are enough problems to handle within this region, and it
is very difficult to handle the global mandate as well. But during the
almost 12 years that I lived in the Andes, we were forming our own mountain
group and we looked to ICIMOD for leadership with a possibility of establishing
a regional office there. But unfortunately that never materialised. I think
that on many of the other issues ICIMOD comes close to its dreams. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>PRO</B><I>: Don't you think its limited resources
could also be a limiting factor?</I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>RR</B>: I think in the past it was much more
of a limiting factor than it is today. You see with the UNCED's decision
to pressure governments globally to donate to the various components of
Agenda 21, including Chapter 13, more and more funds are now available,
at least there is a significant amount of pressure on governments to provide
funds. So I believe that, in the present environment, funding - well it
is always a limitation - is certainly not the limitation that it was in
the earlier period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>PRO</B>: <I>It has been five years since Rio
and Agenda 21. After all the noise that has been made about it do you think
it has made a difference? What has it achieved especially in the context
of Chapter 13 - Managing Fragile Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain Development?</I>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>RR</B>: Agenda 21, Chapter 13, was a great
step forward for the mountains. Primarily because, up to that point, the
mountains, like many other global ecosystems, had been the most neglected.
The oceans had Jacque Cousteau and the rain forests had the Rock Groups.
Many people were speaking for the other ecosystems and even certain other
animals or species that depend on the mountains received more press than
the mountain themselves. For example, the Panda in China was a very popular
environmental symbol and Periwinkle too. Had it not been for the mountain
agenda group - a small group of mountain defenders who pushed for putting
the mountains before the delegates at Rio, we would still perhaps be in
the same situation today. Thanks to those great souls it came forth in
the form of Chapter 13. With the promise of some 50 million dollars a year,
which I don't think has materialised yet for the mountains, at least, there
is some hope. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">A large number of organisations - NGOs, International
Agricultural Research Centres, Universities, and private individuals have
suddenly developed more interest in the mountains. I happen to know that
many of those institutions, prior to Agenda 21 and the possibility of funding,
were not interested in the mountains, despite having them in their own
backyards. So the one impact of Agenda 21 is that it certainly has brought
more and more people to deal with mountain problems. On another level,
I am extremely concerned as to how much of that is just a rush for the
funds as opposed to real sincere dedication to the mountain people. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>PRO</B><I>: What would be your message to the
mountain people - everybody migrate to the plains and leave the mountains
as a playground for the rich?</I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>RR</B>: My first message to the mountain people
is to be proud; proud of the diverse cultures of the mountains, the people
that formed those cultures and have done so in very difficult conditions
over long periods of time. They have a very strong sense of place, they
have very fine adaptations to the mountain environment as reflected in
their indigenous knowledge about their natural resources, reflected in
the refined technologies and the animals they have, as reflected in their
ethnicity and their religious cultural systems; all these are a product
of the intimacy between the people and their environment. And no one else
can duplicate that. Certainly lowlanders can't because they perceive the
mountains in a wrong way. So, my message to the mountain people is to be
proud of what they have accomplished and to work on those accomplishments
as sources of strength as they move into the future, rather than as something
to be discarded because someone says they should modernise. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>PRO</B><I>: Finally, what would you say to
those working on the behest of mountain people?</I> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>RR</B>: I think the most important responsibility
for people who draw their salaries or livelihoods on the basis presumably
of serving mountain peoples is that they must do so with the ultimate dedication
and sincerity to help mountain farmers and mountain dwellers. In other
words, if individuals are in this business only because of the benefit
to themselves and they neglect their duty to be very honest, sincere, and
respectful of the mountain communities then I think in the short term there
will not even be jobs for them. In other words, the mountain peoples' cultural
ecosystems are valuable in their own right and, in fact, I would argue
that there should be a reverse debt commitment to mountain peoples for
all they have supplied to the world, including the genetic material of
all the major food crops and much more, including beauty and hydroelectric
power and mining. The rest of the world essentially owes them, if nothing
else, the respect that they deserve.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The Himalayas have remained a source of inspiration
to mankind from time immemorial. The high mountains have always posed a
challenge to the strength of men who, in turn, scaled the peaks to get
a feeling of conquest. Today, the mountains are as high, but the challenges
are different, diverse, and manifold. The Himalayan region is facing severe
ecological and developmental problems with its rapidly increasing mountain
population. Poverty and illiteracy are further adding to the problems of
deforestation, soil erosion, high population growth rate, poor health conditions,
food deficit, energy shortage, and overall environmental degradation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The problems are complicated, and are interlinked
with many physical and socioeconomic factors. A strong database and an
integrated approach are needed to deal with these problems for economical,
effective, and sustainable solutions. In this respect, Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) have been regarded as an effective tool for database integration,
analysis, and dissemination in the field of natural resources' management.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>The Need</B><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Efforts are being made to succeed in poverty alleviation,
environmental protection, and biodiversity conservation in the region.
The limited natural resources have to be managed for the economic benefit
of the growing population. The planning process is always constrained by
the physical resources available, but it is guided by socioeconomic needs.
Socioeconomic variables, such as demography, agriculture, education, and
health, are the basis for development planning. These factors are involved
in all the sectoral plans pertaining to social development, e.g., the population
of working children, youths, adults, and elders; urban and rural population;
and literacy, mortality, and fertility in urban and rural areas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Most socioeconomic data pertaining to an administrative
unit are available in analogue tabular form and are dispersed among many
national institutions. These data are not being merged in a digital format
for multi-sectoral and problem-oriented analyses. As a result, the likelihood
of finding a timely response to the information needs of planners and decision-makers
is limited. Some data on natural resources, environment, and socioeconomics
are currently available. However, these manually-produced geographic information,
e.g., maps, charts, and other static presentations may not depict the information
accurately and effectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">GIS has been used in the region mainly for physical
planning. Very little has been done to integrate socioeconomic factors
into these systems. There is a need for appropriate models to accommodate
the sociological dimension in addressing the real-world problems using
GIS. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Expectations</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The problems of natural resources' management
are closely associated to the socioeconomic conditions of the people. One
important aspect of GIS is the integration of tabular socioeconomic data
and thematic natural resources' data. In GIS, the socioeconomic data, or
the non-spatial data, can be organised as relational tables linked/related
to the spatial data of the administrative units which are a part of the
Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). GIS technology can be used
to portray the socioeconomic status on maps, i.e., on a spatial platform,
in order to have a more realistic presentation of the situation. This visual
medium of presenting information pertaining to spatial units can become
an effective means for planners and policy-makers in the planning process
and in abstracting related information at a glance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>Limitations</B><FONT SIZE=+1> </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The two discrete datasets, the socioeconomic data
and thematic natural resources' data, have different characteristics. Socioeconomic
data are mostly associated with settlement data. With the conventional
methodology of data collection, census data are based on administrative
units. Settlements are usually concentrated in certain pockets of a district
and a generalised picture can give wrong conclusions. The three dimensional
perspective of mountain areas is another important aspect which adds to
the complexity of analysis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>The Future</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">To address the problems of inadequate use and
management of socioeconomic, natural resources, and environmental data,
the process of using information in planning and decision-making must be
institutionalised. An awareness should be created among planners and policy-makers
regarding the capabilities of GIS technology in integrating physical and
socioeconomic data. There should be methodological improvements in the
contents of socioeconomic data and GIS should be taken as a perspective
for database design during the collection of such data. In this respect,
the common efforts of economists, sociologists, and physical scientists
will play an important role.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">In future, it is anticipated that individual-level
databases will become more sophisticated, and these will form the basis
for many geographic analyses. However, there is no present prospect of
such data becoming widely available, and some important datasets will always
be produced at area aggregate level. It should be noted that the representation
of socioeconomic data within a GIS is the generation of socioeconomic surfaces
where suitable data are available. It must be stressed that all data structures
within GIS are merely models of reality and the ideal of an exact reproduction
of what exists in the real world. </FONT></P>

resulted in documentation of the strengths and weaknesses of HKH institutions

This information was disseminated/shared with a wide range of institutions
in the respective countries. In addition, it was also used to design different

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Notable achievements in the HKH region have been
recorded in the areas of gender and development issues; biodiversity management
issues in agriculture; agricultural development processes and replication

in the subtropical shifting cultivation areas (hilly areas of Bangladesh)
with a view to addressing institutional capacity-building issues; and agricultural
development processes in the cold and dry areas and emerging institutional

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The programme was successful in facilitating the
reorientation of key senior people in Tibet towards the need for changing
approaches to agricultural research and development and bringing the mountain
perspective into planning and action. The evidence of this is available
in the joint initiative taken by several institutions to formulate an Agenda

options at MFS-ICIMOD had identified the Seabuckthorn initiative in China
as an appropriate approach for regeneration in cold and dry areas of the
Hindu-Kush Himalayan region. Interestingly, whereas China had developed
institutional capabilities (R&amp;D) for harnessing this indigenous plant
resource, other countries in the region had no idea about its potential
for bringing about economic and environmental changes in some degraded
mountain areas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The Institutional Strengthening Project carried
out systematic efforts in institutional capacity-building with respect
to Seabuckthorn harnessing (R&amp;D) in Himachal Pradesh-India, Nepal,
and Pakistan. The ICIMOD project helped establish a Seabuckthorn Research
and Demonstration Centre at Tabo, under the YSP University of Horticulture
and Forestry, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, and imparted training to scientists
and provided material support. Following ICIMOD's pioneering support, the
University has assured the permanent establishment of this Centre by mobilising
financial support from both the provincial government and from ministries
of the Government of India. Similarly, the impact in Pakistan is encouraging
and the same follow-up process is being carried out by ICIMOD. In Pakistan,
a new institute established by the Ministry of Agriculture, called the
National Aridland Development and Research Institute (NADRI), was asked
to develop and implement a Rs 5 million project on replicating the Seabuckthorn

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The Second Review Meeting of the NORAD-supported
<B>Mountain Tourism for Local Development Project </B>was held in Kathmandu
from September 6 - 9. The Review Meeting brought together members of the
micro-case study teams from India, Nepal, and Pakistan as well as ICIMOD
professionals and resource persons involved in the Mountain Tourism for
Local Development initiative. Nine micro-case studies and action plans
representing different eco-regions and tourism types in the HKH were presented
and discussed in the meeting. In addition, a Manual on Technology with
Implications for Mountain Tourism, a Compendium of Income-Generating Opportunities
related to Mountain Tourism, and a study on Institutions for Mountain Tourism
and Local Development were also presented and discussed at the Meeting.
The purpose of the meeting was to help finalise the case studies and other
expert inputs and determine a framework for the training modules that will
be developed by using the material derived from the micro-case studies.
Prototype Training Modules for four target audiences (policy-makers, programme
designers and implementors, community groups and potential entrepreneurs,
and the visitors) were also presented and discussed during the meeting.
The micro-case studies and other thematic studies will be revised and published
in the MEI Discussion Paper Series. The Training Modules will be used for
the pilot training of different target audiences in the respective countries
and institutionalised in the tourism-related training institutions in each
country context. </FONT></P>

conducted in Besisahar, Lamjung District, Nepal, on 17 and 18 September
in collaboration with the Rural Development Through Self-help Promotion
Lamjung Project (GTZ/HMG) and the District Development Committee. There
were altogether 32 participants representing 23 government institutions
and several NGOs and private companies. The workshop not only familarised
the participants with the GIS technologies as a useful planning and decision-making
tool but also with the digital database developed for Lamjung district.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Over a period of four months starting from July,
the Appropriate Technologies for Soil Conserving Farming Systems' Project
conducted several training courses on <B>appropriate technologies for soil
conservation, fertility improvement, propagation methods for cash crops,
EM technology,</B> etc. in Bangladesh, China, Myanmar, and Nepal. The training
was organised at three levels; policy-makers, technicians and extensionists,
and farmers. The participants learned about common issues and how to solve
common problems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">A Workshop on <B>Ethnobotany and Its Application
to Conservation </B>was held in Islamabad from September 16-24, 1996 in
collaboration with the National Agricultural Research Centre and World-Wide
Fund for Nature/Pakistan. The forty-nine participants and resource persons
came from the mountain areas in Pakistan, Xinjiang Province in China, Uzbekistan
in Central Asia, People and Plants' Programme of UNESCO and WWF International.
Prof. Pei Shengji and Mr. Ajay Rastogi participated from ICIMOD. The workshop
included a field trip to Ayubia National Park and interaction with the
local villagers on the periphery of the park as well as government officials
responsible for the management of the park. This provided a useful insight
into the intricate issues of conservation and development in mountain areas.
Pakistan has a rich system of traditional medicine which derives its strength
from ancient ethnobotanical knowledge. A group of leading &quot;<I>Hakims</I>&quot;
(traditional physician) was brought together and the discussions provided
basic orientation to the participants on the salient aspects of conservation,
utilisation, and promotion of this knowledge. As a first workshop on applied
ethnobotany in Pakistan, it was well received in the government as well
as non-government sectors and a group of participants is working on the
follow-up of the recommendation made during the course of the workshop.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">A Training Programme on <B>Quantitative Methods
and Database Development for Ethnobotanical Research in Mountain Environment</B>
was conducted at ICIMOD from October 7-10, 1996. Ethnobotany surveys usually
generate inventories of various plants; and techniques are used to group
them in various categories. Often these inventories are presented in descriptive
formats without any details addressing the complex interactions between
humans and plant use. This training was designed to suit the methodology
requirements of the awardees of case study and study grants in order to
facilitate their research work. These five young researchers from Nepal
were given training on systematic data collection, organisation of data
in a database, and using simple statistical packages for analysis of data
and interpretation of results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">The second <B>Gender and Development Fact-finding
Mission Methodology Workshop</B> was held from October 14 - 16 for 5 participants
from Chittagong (Bangladesh), Myanmar, and Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces
(China) who were selected as researchers for the Fact-finding Mission.
The workshop provided an orientation to the 3-month research activity which
they will carry out in their own countries and provided training in tools
for gender analysis. The researchers developed their individual action
plans during the course of the meeting, and these included an exploration
of plans and policies at the national level and investigation of gender
relations in one or two sample mountain communities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">A Regional Workshop on the <B>Conservation and
Management of Yak Genetic Diversity</B> was held in Kathmandu from October
29 to 31. The Workshop, cosponsored and organised by ICIMOD and the FAO
Regional Office in Bangkok, brought together 29 yak specialists from yak-raising
areas in Asia. Issues in the conservation and management of yak genetic
diversity were discussed and priority areas for action to improve yak productivity
and maintain genetic diversity were formulated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><B>A Regional Experts' Meeting on Rangeland and
