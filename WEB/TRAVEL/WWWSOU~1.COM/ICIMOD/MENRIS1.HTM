<H3>Rationale</H3>
 <P>
The Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) Region presents a formidable range
of both ecological and developmental problems that have physical as
well as socioeconomic dimensions. Development interventions must
therefore be formulated and implemented in an integrated manner.  An
integrated approach to solving the problems should have a strong
database.  Advances in satellite image processing and computer analysis
have made it possible to evolve a realistic, accurate, and uniform
database.  Experiences from the region, as well as from other mountainous regions, provide a sound
basis for the adaptation and dissemination of GIS technology as a tool to integrated development and
environmental management in mountain areas.  MENRIS acts as a resource centre for the HKH Region
for the study and application of GIS technology in close collaboration with national and international
research institutions, space agencies, and vendors in the participating countries.
