<H1>The Mountain Specificities</H1>
<P>While designing and implementing public and private interventions in the mountain areas, at both macro- and micro-levels, explicit consideration should be given to their characteristics. The important mountain characteristics or conditions that distinguish mountain regions from other areas can be termed mountain specificities.
<P>When any development intervention or resource-use practice overlooks the presence and operational imperatives of mountain specificities, it tends to lead to long-term unsustainability. Taking into consideration these specific characteristics will certainly assist in facilitating long-term sustainability of mountain resources' management. These mountain specificities can be both a constraint and an opportunity to mountain development.
