<CENTER><H1>MOUNTAIN NATURAL RESOURCES<BR>
   towards sustainable management of natural resources</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<H3> Rationale</H3>
<P>
Development interventions over the last few decades have brought about
tremendous changes in the  mountains, often at the cost of the limited and
fragile mountain resources.  With rapidly growing populations, such
development efforts have exerted increased pressure on natural resources and
have often caused their degradation and, at times, even irreversible losses. 
Unlike privately-owned and managed farm resources, most of these rapidly
degrading resources, such as forests, water, ranges, wildlife, and biodiversity, are common property resources and
managing them is both complex and difficult.
<P>
As development processes and interventions will continue, and even need to be accelerated, mountain resources
will be subjected to even greater changes in the future.  There is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies
and approaches for better and more efficient management of mountain natural resources in order to ensure
sustainable use.  Diversity of mountain environments and a lack of sufficient understanding make the search for
improved solutions a challenging task.
<P>
Improving the management of mountain natural resources is essentially an endeavour to respond to the challenges
of ecologically sustainable development of mountain environments in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region.
