<P>

ICIMOD is the first and, so far, only international centre
devoted to integrated mountain development.  ICIMOD
was founded out of widespread recognition of the
alarming environmental degradation of mountain
habitats and the consequent increasing impoverishment
of mountain communities in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan
(HKH)  Region.
<P>
The establishment of ICIMOD was based upon an
agreement between His Majesty's Government of Nepal
and UNESCO, signed in 1981.  ICIMOD was 
inaugurated in December 1983 and began operating in
September 1984.  Nepal, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Switzerland, and UNESCO were the founding
sponsors.

The supreme decision-making body of ICIMOD
is its Board of Governors. According to the
Statutes, "<B>the Board of Governors of ICIMOD
will consist of fifteen members of which
eight shall represent the Governments of the
participating countries of the Hindu Kush-
Himalayan area. The other seven shall be
international experts appointed by the Board
on the basis of their professional competence in the scientific and technical fields
relevant to the objectives and functions of
the Centre.</B>" To find the current ICIMOD Board of Governors<A HREF="BOARD~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/icimod/board.html"> Click here</A>  
<P>
The eight members representing regional
countries are appointed by their respective
Governments and the seven professional
experts are appointed by the Board based on
nomination by the ICIMOD Support Group.
<p>
<H3><A NAME=support>The ICIMOD Support Group</H3>
<P>
According to Article 8 of the Statutes, "<B>the
Support Group shall be the main link and
forum for interaction between the Centre and
the donor community.  While not intended to
serve the functions of a governing body for
the Centre, it shall provide suggestions and
shall support the efforts of the Centre in
respect to fund raising.</B>"
<P>

The membership of the Support Group consists
of the participating regional countries and
donors showing significant commitment and
support to ICIMOD on a sustained basis. 
Attendance at meetings will be by nomination
from parent countries/institutions.

The Centre receives two categories of financial support: core funds and project funds. Core funds are for implementing the "core" Regional Collaborative Programme for the Sustainable
Development of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas. Project funds can only be used for narrowly-defined
projects, as stipulated in the agreements with the concerned donor organisation. By the end of May
1995, the following governments and organisations were supporting ICIMOD at a total average annual level of approximately $ 3.5 million.

<P>
<H3><A NAME=mand>Mandate and Functions</H3>
<P>
According to ICIMOD's Statutes, "<B>The primary objectives of the Centre shall be to help promote the
development of an economically and environmentally sound mountain ecosystem and to improve
the living standards of mountain populations</B>", especially in the HKH Region. In pursuing its mandate,
ICIMOD works mainly at the interface between research and development and acts as a facilitator for
generating new mountain-specific knowledge of relevance to mountain development. At the same time,
ICIMOD attempts to ensure that new knowledge is shared among all relevant institutions, organisations,
and individuals in the region. As such ICIMOD functions as
<P>
<UL>

<LI>a <B>multidisciplinary documentation and information centre</B> on integrated mountain development;

<LI>a focal point for the mobilisation, conduct, and coordination of <B>applied and problem-solving
  research activities</B>;

<LI>a <B>focal point for training on integrated mountain development</B> with special emphasis on the
  development of relevant training materials for the training of trainers; and

<LI>a <B>consultative centre to provide expert services</B> on mountain development and resource
  management to the HKH countries.

</ul>
<B><A NAME=doc>1.   Documentation and Information Exchange</B>
<P>
  The Centre's activities in the information field, so far,
  have concentrated heavily on two aspects:  firstly, the
  development of a comprehensive documentation centre
  and <B>an appreciable library with computerised
  bibliographic</B> and <B>serial databases</B> as well as
  <B>bibliographies</B> on a number of  specific subjects.
<P>
  <B>Networking, repackaging, accessing,</B> and <B>compiling
  databases</B> are in an early stage of  development, and enhanced efforts are being made to upgrade
  skills and facilities. Networking arrangements are being developed to improve information exchange
  mechanisms.
<P>
  Secondly, the Centre   publishes  documents describing the results of original research, knowledge
  reviews, workshops, training courses, etc  that have been sponsored by ICIMOD. More than 200
  documents  have been published so far, as well as a four-monthly Newsletter and the Centre's
  Annual Report.
<P>
  Other types of information exchange are carried out
  through public relations' activities using videos and
  more effective avenues of knowledge exchange.  A
  permanent exhibition on major issues affecting
  mountain development is maintained at ICIMOD's
  headquarters.
<P>
<B><A NAME=res>2.   Research</B>
<P>
  ICIMOD carries out various kinds of research, ranging
  from state-of-the-art reviews of specific problem areas
  and policy reviews  to action research in which a
  number of practical spin-off benefits can accrue to limited geographical areas.  ICIMOD's experience
  in action-research - a move from experimentation and study to direct application in the field - include
  Mountain Resource Management,  Rehabilitation of Degraded Lands, and Sloping Agricultural Land
  Technology in most of its Regional  Member countries.  ICIMOD is also involved in limited scale
  original research through programmes such as the one on beekeeping.
<P>
  In all areas of research, ICIMOD seeks to make maximum use of its findings in as many countries
  of the Region as possible.  In seeking viable methods of sustainable mountain development,
  ICIMOD seeks to identify successful interventions that can be replicated across the HKH Region. 
  Collaboration with national research  institutes is a major focus for ICIMOD's research activities,
  including provisions for institutional strengthening.
<P>
<B><A NAME=tra>3.   Training</B>
<P>
  The Centre, in collaboration with national agencies, is
  promoting different measures to build capacities in the
  ICIMOD member countries in the various fields of relevance
  to sustainable mountain development. Capacity building is
  needed in both the technical skills and policy design for
  sustainable mountain development.  As such, a broad range
  of target groups for training and orientation can be identified
  and different measures for strengthening the human resource
  base of relevant institutions are needed.  ICIMOD  focuses its
  training mainly on: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>organising workshops, seminars, study tours, and other meetings for senior and middle-level officials and staff of government, academic, and non-government organisations  and
<LI>organising and/or supporting training courses on new and proven technologies and approaches to sustainable mountain development.
</ul>
<P>
  ICIMOD cannot hope to provide all the training programmes needed, nor can it train in large
  numbers. Therefore it concentrates its training in a number of critical mountain-specific critical areas
  with a focus on the training of trainers and decision-makers.
<P>
<B><A NAME=adv>4.   Advisory Services</B>
<P>
  ICIMOD provides advisory services on a continuing basis to government and non-government
  organisations.  The majority of these services are provided free of cost when they relate to requests
  for information and advise that can be handled from ICIMOD's headquarters in Kathmandu. 
  Numerous visitors to ICIMOD are advised on useful experiences in mountain development in the
  HKH and on relevant literature by the professional staff of ICIMOD.
<P>
  ICIMOD also provides advisory services on both an
  individual and a team basis.  Individual experts are
  used by governments in specific programmes.  Others
  are used by bilateral and multilateral donors in
  programme development and reviews.  Individual
  consultancies usually involve the loan of an individual
  professional to a programme or project already
  established by a related organisation in one or more
  countries of the Region for which ICIMOD's
  professionals have skills offering comparative advantages.  ICIMOD is particularly well equipped
  to assist in the reviews and assessment of planned, operational, or completed programmes on
  integrated mountain development or its subsectors.
<P>
<B><A NAME=uni>ICIMOD's Unique Features</B>
<P>
ICIMOD is the only international organisation with a clearly defined eco-regional focus, and the
ecological boundaries of the mountain ecosystem of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas determine its area of
intervention. Within this geographical mandate ICIMOD provides linkages between
<PRE>
Environment and development   :sustainable development of mountain areas will only be possible
                               if both issues are addressed at the same time

Research and development      :ICIMOD works at the interface of  research and development

Policies and technologies     :policies for sustainable mountain  development need to be
                               backed up with appropriate technologies and vice versa

Disciplines                   :the broad range of disciplines  represented by ICIMOD's 
                               professional staff enables it to  address mountain issues in an 
                               integrated way

Countries                     :the common concerns for the HKH bring eight countries 
                               together, benefitting from each other's knowledge and
                               experiences
</PRE>
As such ICIMOD functions as a mountain development forum for the HKH.
