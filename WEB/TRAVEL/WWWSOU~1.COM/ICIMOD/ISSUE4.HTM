An Example from the Mountain of Nepal</strong></font></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#000080">Food security in some mountain areas can be improved through cash crop farming based on 
mountain-specific comparative advantages, such as favourabe agroclimatic conditions. 
However, governments need to play a critical role here - they must focus on improving local 
capability; on generating appropriate technologies and ensuring that these are transferred to 
farmers; on developing markets and the necessary linkages to them; and on building 
appropriate physical-social infrastructure. There is also a need to collate existing data and 
create a database on the extent of poverty and hunger.<br>

<p align=left><font color="#008040"><font size=4><strong><br>
</strong></font></font><font color="#000080">Food security essentially means a state of affairs in which people have access to sufficient and 
nutritious food in order to maintain a healthy and active life throughout the year. Food 
insecurity anywhere is a problem of inadequate access, resulting from inadequate purchasing 
power. In the context of mountain development, food security should not lay emphasis on 
growing foodgrains only, rather it should provide productive options for growing high-value 
crops having comparative advantages. This paper discusses local strategies adopted by 
people from the mountain districts of the Rapti Zone of Nepal and presents a successful case 
for ensuring food security based on growing off-season vegetables in fragile mountain areas. It 
depicts how food security can be achieved through cash security and presents some important 
issues. <br></font></p>

</td><td width=50%><font color="#000080">In the inaccessible, middle and high Rapti mountains, apart from in a few 
fertile river valleys, the farmlands do not produce adequate foodgrains. 
Landholdings are small, fragile, marginal, and vertical. The agroclimatic 
conditions during winter are harsh. Thus, many family heads and young 
persons migrate for part of the year in search of food security. The 
boxed text on the following page presents some indigenous household 
strategies used to cope with food security in the Rapti mountains. Lack 
of food security implies greater hardship on women and children. Large 
numbers of unproductive cattle are raised to increase the amount of 
manure for fertiliser, and the women and children are required to travel 
to distant forests to collect leaf litter and bedding material for 
composting and to graze animals. Table 1 shows clearly how vulnerable 
Nepal's mountainous and hilly areas are in terms of food availability, 
while the plains (terai) enjoy foodgrain surpluses.</font></td></tr>

<p align=center><font color="#008040"><font size=4><strong>Prospects for Local Food Security - A Successful Case</strong></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#008040"><font size=4><strong><br>
</strong></font></font><font color="#000080">Mountain people, in some relatively accessible resource-poor areas, are beginning to see 
some prospects for better food security through farming profitable cash crops. This prospect 
lies in harnessing the mountain-specific characteristics. Owing to favourable agroclimatic 
conditions, mountain areas have the comparative advantage of being able to grow off-season 
vegetables during the summer and rainy seasons when the plains in the south cannot grow 
them due to hot and humid conditions. Vegetables, such as tomatoes, peas, beans, and 
cabbages, fetch much higher prices in the major market centres in Nepal and India. Banking 
on this strategy, some pocket areas of the Rapti mountains underwent a major transformation 
in terms of food security as described below.<br>
<br>
About four years ago, people living in the uplands bordering Rolpa and Salyan districts were 
among the poorest in the Rapti mountains. A farm household, with a small landholding of 
about 0.25 hectares - mostly terraced and marginal - could barely feed the family for four to 
six months with the scant production of maize, millet, and wheat. <br>
<br>
In 1993, USAID-Nepal's Vegetables, Fruits and Cash (VFC) Crops' Programme assisted 
local farmers in growing off-season vegetables on a small-scale trial basis in the area; now 
known as the Kapurkot Market Shed Area. As they could market and receive cash for the 
crops, the results provided a successful example to others. In 1994, about 28 Production and 
Marketing Associations (PMAs) with about 450 households produced 225 MT of a variety of 
off-season vegetables, valued at Nepali Rupees (NR) 1.8 million (1 US $ = NR 56.75). In the 
second year (1995), 93 PMAs, consisting of 2,000 participating households, were formed. 
They produced and marketed off-season vegetables amounting to 2,000 MT (NR 10.1m). In 
1996 the number of participating households increased to 4,000 (28,000 family members). 
They produced and marketed 3,200 MT of off-season vegetables (NR 17.5m). Every 
Tuesday and Friday, six to seven hundred farmers - mostly women - brought off-season 
vegetables on their backs to the market-shed area from 2 to 6 hours away in the mountains. 
Traders from major market centres (e.g., Nepalgunj, Butwal, Bhairahawa, Krishnanager, 
Pokhara, and Narayanghat and some Indian border towns) came to purchase the produce 
and the two parties negotiated the prices directly. <br>
<br>
During this period, the VFC programme assisted the local farmers in forming PMAs and 
trained a large number of women farmers in the technical know-how of producing and 
marketing off-season vegetables; this also included training in post-harvest technologies. It sent 
many of them to different markets in Nepal and India to see vegetable markets and to contact 
vegetable traders and marketers. The programme also established market and business 
linkages with major lowland towns. <br>
<br>
The improved cash income and employment from off-season vegetable production and 
marketing increased the per capita food availability two to three times. Earlier, when a 
household of eight family members was growing only cereal foodgrains on a 0.25 hectare 
farm, the estimated per capita food availability was only 72 kg. After growing off-season 
vegetables on about 60 per cent of the total land, the per capita foodgrain availability 
increased to 211 kg through foodgrain purchased from the cash received by selling off-season 
vegetables. If Rs 5,000 (52 kg) were to be set aside for children's schooling and health care, 
the estimated per capita food availability would be 159 kg, which is more than twice the 
amount the farm would have attained by growing foodgrains only. Increased cash income from 
vegetable farming also helped to empower the women by permitting them greater involvement 
in household decision-making. <br>
<br>
An economic analysis of farm-level data shows that production and marketing of off-season 
vegetables provide much higher returns than cereal foodgrains (Table 2). Similarly, in the 
inaccessible mountains of Rukum, growing vegetable seeds is significantly more profitable than 
growing wheat crops. Economic analysis shows that the C/B ratios of vegetable seed 
production range from 1:2.4 to 1:6.7, compared to 1: 1.7 in the case of wheat crops (Table 
3).<br>

<p><font color="#000080">Tulachan and Bloom (1995) estimated the internal rate of return (IRR) for three representative 
farms of the Rapti mountains for an investment programme on high-value agriculture (HVA). 
The analysis showed that the estimated IRR for small farmers having 0.25 hectares of land is 
higher (46%) than those of high and medium resource farms, indicating that HVA programmes 
can address the equity issue.<br>
<br>
The successful case described above does not necessarily imply that there should or would be 
indiscriminate commercialisation of off-season or summer vegetable production in the 
mountains. First, this farm enterprise will be profitable only for a particular period or season of 
the year during which no area in the plains can grow these vegetables because of hot and 
humid agroclimatic conditions. Secondly, many areas are not suitable because of inaccessibility 
and unfavourable biophysical characteristics. Dry and arid areas without irrigation are also not 
suitable. Many areas that are prone to hailstones or receive heavy rainfall cannot grow 
off-season vegetables. <br>

Such a commecialisation process should properly link upland (source of vegetable crops) and 
lowland markets (source of foodgrains). Market demand and prices of fresh vegetables, as 
well as lowland food availability, should be constantly monitored. Excessive and indiscriminate

health, should be restricted. </font></p>

</td><td width=50%><font color="#000080">The success story in this paper provides some important lessons. It 
also raises some key food policy issues that could be relevant to 
food security in similar resource-poor mountain environments of the 
Hindu Kush-Himalayas (HKH).<br>
<br>
First, emphasis on local capacity building should be the prime focus 
of any government intervention or donor and NGO programme. 
Farmers' group formation related to certain productive activities in 
mountain communities, such as the Production and Marketing 
Associations for off-season vegetables, has several advantages. 
Group savings could assist cash-poor farmers. In groups, they can 
considerably increase their bargaining power over traders for 
determining product prices. Secondly, market development and 
linkages become absolutely critical for promoting food security 
through farm income. Knowledge and skills on post-harvest 
techniques, such as picking, grading, packing, processing, storage, 
and transport, are very essential for the mountain farmers to market 
quality products competitively in major market centres.<br>
<br>
The government has an important role to play in generating 
appropriate technology and transferring it to farmers' fields. It also 
has a role to play in building both physical (roads) and social 
(training local human resources) infrastructures. Pricing policies 
should ensure that the comparative advantages in mountain areas 
are fully developed. Unnecessary restrictions and regulations in 
trade or movements of goods and services related to HVA can kill 
private initiatives, and they can be detrimental to the whole process 
of mountain development and transformation. <br>
<br>
Finally, the government has an important role to play in formulating 
mountain-specific policies that enhance farming systems and 
economically-profitable options that ensure household food 
security for mountain dwellers. </font></td></tr>
</table>
<p align=center><font color="#008040"><font size=4><strong>The Challenge Ahead</strong></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#008040"><font size=4><strong><br>
</strong></font></font><font color="#000080">Although the global forum has placed so much importance on world food security, unless this 
issue is addressed locally, mountain people will continue to suffer from food insecurity. 
Various economic analyses and the Rapti study presented here suggest that mountain areas 
have comparative advantages in HVA and not in foodgrain crops as emphasised by past 
policies aimed at achieving food sufficiency. <br>
<br>
However, the challenge is to have an improved understanding of the underlying causes and 
magnitude of food insecurity for the entire Hindu Kush-Himalayan region. The HKH 
mountains contain unique agro-ecological zones; each having specific mountain communities, 
farming systems, and differential scales of poverty with various socioeconomic and cultural 
values. ICIMOD has commenced a systematic study and analysis of new emerging policy 
issues in order to frame alternative mountain-specific policies to promote food security. 
Attempts will be made to create a strong database on the extent of poverty and hunger; 
household economies; crop and livestock production; seasonality; gender roles; and inter-and 
intra-household food distribution emphasising gender, children, and the poor under specific 
farming conditions in each unique agroecological zone. Failure to achieve household food 
security in the mountains will further aggravate poverty and hunger resulting in increasing 
degradation of mountain environments and, thus, threatening the very survival of global 
ecosystems. <br>
