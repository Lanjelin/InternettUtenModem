<H3>Rationale</H3>
<P>
The eight countries of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas together cover one large
ecosystem with many common problems that often have been studied and
described at a local and national level. Bringing together and sharing the information that
already exists on a regional platform are activities that are needed to ensure that research is not
duplicated; that successful experiences from one area can be tested elsewhere; and that
common approaches to sustainable mountain development can be promoted. Bringing
together this dispersed information and making it available in published form to policy-
makers, planners, and development workers have been the initial priorities of DITS. As a
result, ICIMOD has the best library on the HKH in the Region with computerised bibliographic and serial databases.
Subsequently, the dissemination of  the results of ICIMOD-generated/sponsored research and meetings  has also
become an important task. While the main responsibility for training and capacity-building in sustainable mountain
development lies with the thematic programmes (and MENRIS), the diverse target groups and countries that
ICIMOD tries to reach need specific training techniques and support, not always available among  the ICIMOD
professional staff. DITS will provide support to training activities by providing modern training equipment as well as
training in planning and in implementing training programmes.
