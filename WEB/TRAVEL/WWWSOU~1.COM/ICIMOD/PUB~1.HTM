     ISBN 92-9115-483-0</b>
<P>
<b>Abstract</b>
<p>
<I>
This country review on landslides in Pakistan deals with all the aspects of landslides, their types;
causative factors; their relation to geology, earthquakes, monsoons, and deforestation; their impact;
and possible studies to overcome disasters and control. This paper systematically identifies the
problem areas and gives details of the historical background clearly establishing the connection with
certain natural (earthquakes, lithology) and man-made (excavations and indiscriminate construction)
causative factors.
<P>
The northern parts of Pakistan, i.e., the mountainous regions of the Himalayas, the Karakoram, and
the Hindu Kush, have a high incidence of landslides. Though this part of the country is not highly-populated, nevertheless, the impact of landslides is felt severely. More so, because this part of the
country is bordered by China, India, and Afghanistan and is, therefore, of considerable strategic
importance.
<P>
The extent of the impacts of landslides depends upon various factors such as the depth and rate of
movement, stresses from the environment, volume of materials involved, and, most importantly, the
proximity to settlements and structures. The author quotes instances where more than half a village
has been wiped out or where powerhouses/dams have been damaged. 
Dealing with the diversity of causes, the author scientifically enumerates aspects of geology, such
as lithological distribution, bedding, joints, foliation, and schistosity, that lead to landslides.
Causative factors relating to surface and groundwater and the effect of saturation on strength,
temperature variations, earthquakes and vibrations, and effects of vegetation and deforestation have
been dealt with in the context of Pakistan.
<P>
The text is further substantiated with figures, tables, and photographs.

<b>Abstract</b>
<P>
<I>
Landslide Management and Control in India examines the problem of landslides in a mountain
environment in which rising populations and an increase in infrastructural construction have led to
augmentation in the probability of landslide occurrence. The various landslide triggers (rainfall
erosion, deforestation, earthquakes, overburden of and construction of inappropriate infrastructure,
geological causes, etc) and parameters of occurrence are discussed; a number of case histories are
given in illustration. Methodologies for Landslide Hazard Zonation and map preparation are
discussed, along with landslide hazard rating. Methods of landslide hazard mitigation are covered
and an outline for a training programme is proposed as part of the paper's principal
recommendations.</I>

<b>Abstract</b>
<P>
<I>
Landslides are one of the main natural disasters in China, responsible for huge social and economic
losses for mountain populations. This paper reviews the available information on effective measures
for reducing economic and social losses caused by landslides. These measures include landslide
mapping (identification, types of landslide maps, techniques of mapping); physical prevention and
control measures (problem avoidance, surface-water drainage works, subsurface drainage, support
structures, excavation, river structure works); landslide hazard anticipation (long-, medium-, and
short-term prediction; prediction of the extent of landslides); and assessment and mitigation
measures for landslide-dam failure disasters.
<P>
Institutions concerned with landslide hazard mapping and control, forecasting, mitigation, research,
and training (government agencies, research institutions, central and provincial governments, NGOs,
and scientific societies) have also been listed.</I>

<b>Abstract</b>
<P>
<I>The document covers the geographical make-up and geological framework of Nepal as an
introduction to the topic. Specific topics such as erosion and sediment yield in the Himalayas are
covered within these topic areas. Landslides are classified and factors causing them described,
including the geological background to landslides. Climate and vegetation are among the factors
covered along with hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods and earthquakes. The main part of
the document focusses on landslides and their mitigation; the landslide sections are introduced by
a short review of landslide studies in Nepal. The text is supplemented by an extensive bibliography
and the curriculum for studies in engineering geology of Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu.</I>

This is the first of a series of eight documents envisaged for mountain areas of the eight countries
of the HKH Region. In publishing this volume, ICIMOD is fulfilling a part of its mandate to facilitate
the dissemination of relevant information for sustainable development of the HKH. The information
is presented in tabular form with respective government institutions, but this is the first time that
many important data sets have been brought together in one volume and on a common geo-referenced platform. The spatial dimension provided by the graphics provides decision-makers and
planners with easy access to information.</I>

<b>Abstract</b>
<P>
<i>
Small towns and market centres can play an important and effective role in the development of
mountain areas. However, strategies for the identification and assessment of the potentials of market
towns and the formulation of a specific programme to develop the market town potential in mountain
areas of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas are lacking.
<P>
The present report builds upon existing literature and elucidates the application of the methodology
for the assessment as well as the development of prioritised action plans of the  market towns with
most potential in Dechang County in Sichuan Province, China, Tehri Garhwal district in the UP hills,
India, Dang district in Nepal, and Ghizar district in the Northern Areas in Pakistan. These areas
represent the diverse physiographic, spatial, and economic context of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan
(HKH) mountains. 
<P>
Spatio-economic profiles for each of the districts were prepared on the basis of secondary data
complemented by field level information. These profiles provide the socioeconomic, demographic,
and development parameters as well as the policy context of the development of market towns.
Several criteria were used in each context to identify and assess the market towns with the most
development potential. On the basis of the field visits and participatory rapid appraisal methodology,
several prioritised areas of action are identified for the promotion of a selected number of market
towns with the most development potential in each context. 
<P>
The exercise brings forth the enormous importance of the strategy for regional infrastructural
development of market towns, both in the realisation of the production potential of the hinterland and
in enhancing the forward and backward linkages. Human resources' development and the
strengthening of the local-level institutional mechanisms also appear as key elements in designing
`interventions' for the promotion of market towns.
<P>
In the context of the HKH countries, where planning manpower is often top heavy, the studies also
demonstrate the partnership that can be established between academic institutions, rural
development agencies, and governmental agencies in supporting demand-driven approaches to the
promotion of market towns.<I>
