        towards sustainability in mountain agriculture</H1></CENTER>
<P>
<H3>Rationale</H3>
<P>

With over two-thirds of the 120 million people still dependent on farming as their primary source of sustenance,
the task of overcoming poverty, inequality, and marginality and
improving the well-being of mountain people must begin by
addressing the problems of mountain agriculture.  Without
improvements in the millions of small mountain farms, there will be
little positive impact, either on poverty or on the mountain
environment. These farms must be seen as the pivotal focus of the
problems and also of the opportunities in sustainable mountain
development. Ways must be found to identify appropriate
technologies, policies, support services, and organisations that can
be easily accessed by mountain farmers. Economically-productive
and environmentally-sustainable mountain agriculture is almost a
precondition  for the expansion of non-agricultural income and employment opportunities. Moving mountain
agriculture on to a more sustainable path is also critical for improving the conditions of the mountain
environment. 
<P>
This programme focusses mainly on the individual farming household and the small plot of agricultural land
it owns or rents. Decisions on the type of crop to be planted or the type of livestock to raise are being
made by the farming household. With many women playing an extremely important role in mountain
farming systems, this Division acts also as ICIMOD's focal point for its gender and development
programme.
