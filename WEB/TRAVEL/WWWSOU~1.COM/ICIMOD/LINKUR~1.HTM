<H2>World Wide Web: Some Related URLs (sites)</H2>
<P>There is a great deal of excitement about how Internet is changing global communication. This is particularly true for the World Wide Web, the Internets fastest-growing area. The World Wide Web (called “Web”) has graphical user interfaces, ideal for delivering information to the 100 million Internet users projected by the end of the decade. The Web’s interactive clickable links are well suited for information referencing.  File transfer capabilities can send digital data through the internet to the end user’s computer.
<P>The Web is a global client/server application based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Discrete units of information, called Web documents, use the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). These documents can contain text, images such as orthophotos, downloadable vector graphics (such as maps), as well as sound 
and video.
<P>These URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) take you to some of the Web sites, more relevant to ICIMOD and mountain development.
