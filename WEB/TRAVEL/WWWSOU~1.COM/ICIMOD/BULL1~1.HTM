<H1><A NAME="bull20">1:250K Database of Nepal</H1>
<P>
The Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) Region presents a formidable range of both ecological and developmental 
problems that have both physical as well as socioeconomic dimensions. Within this vast region, severe problems such as deforestation, land degradation, flooding and drought, and environmental degradation, as well as poor health and educational conditions, present impediments to economic growth. An integrated approach to solving the 
problems needs a strong database. Advances in satellite image processing and computer analysis have made it 
possible to evolve a realistic, accurate, and uniform database.

Accordingly, MENRIS is in the process of building national level databases for the Regional Member Countries (RMCs) of ICIMOD on various scales, integrating spatial and non-spatial databases. During the first quarter of 1995, MENRIS  established  the Nepal database on a scale of 1:250,000. For establishment of the Nepal database, secondary sources of information were used. The infrastructures, i.e., international boundaries, district boundaries, roads, rivers, settlements, national parks, spot heights, and the contour lines at 500m intervals, are extracted from the topographical zonal maps of the Topographical Survey Branch of the Department of Survey, 
HMG. The ecological zones were extracted from the maps published by Dobremez. The population-related, socioeconomic characteristics of population and production-related data were extracted from publications of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Health. These data were later integrated into GIS coverages and various thematic maps created at district level.
<P><I>The details of the datasets are available upon request.</I>

MENRIS/ICIMOD is conducting a collaborative case study with the Rural Development through Self-Help Promotion (RDSP) Lamjung Project in Nepal. The district information system, based on ARC/INFO software, covers data on natural resources and socioeconomic data of 61 Village Development Committees and 
more than 1,100 settlements. The assessment of settlement locations is still being carried out using several sources and tools, topographical maps, aerial photos, and intensive field studies along with the Global Positioning System (GPS). The analysis of recent land cover has commenced using three satellite images 
(Landsat TM); viz., of December 1991 and February and May 1994. ILWIS and ERDAS software are being applied for 
this study.
<P>Several case studies have been completed so far: (1) agroclimatic zonation based on temperature and moisture regimes in the district, taking into account data from meteorological stations and elevation; (2) 
land-use changes from 1960 to 1979 using topographical maps from the 1960s and land utilisation maps published in 1986; (3) horticultural development, considering tropical, citrus, and temperate fruits, (4) potato production and seasonality of particular areas, and (5) development of accessibility to road infrastructure in relation to population over one decade from 1990 to 2000. Road infrastructure refers to fair-weather roads which cannot be used during the monsoon season from June to September. A model was developed for this study taking into 
account the topography, major rivers and bridges, and the walking distance per hour. The distribution of population was calculated according to areas of VDCs and the size and location of agricultural land. Population figures are based on the 1991 Census only since there is hardly an increase in total district figures since the 1981 Census. Due to heavy construction of local roads during the last five years, accessibility has improved tremendously, and this trend will go on considering the future plans for road building in the district 
(Map; Table).

ICIMOD. MENRIS is currently operating two IBM RS/6000 units and four XL 
120 units. The current upgrading of workstations includes two IBM 3BT workstations and four IBM 43 P/133 model workstations. The upgrading of facilities is being carried out in view of the rapid growth of the database and the need to cater to MENRIS professionals. The system will be in place in early 1996. In addition, MENRIS has recently upgraded its training and digitisation facilities with Pentium-based machines. The output production facility is being enhanced with an HP Designjet 750C inkjet plotter.
<P>The 3BT workstations have 128 MB RAM, 6.6 GB storage capacities with high end 24 bit graphics' cards. The 43/P workstations  have 64 MB RAM, 2 GB storage capacities with 8 bit graphics’ cards. Worsktations’ versions of ARC/INFO and ERDAS 
Imaging Systems will be running in these systems. With this, MENRIS will have one 
of the best GIS/RS facilities in the region.
<P>
<H2>Internet Connectivity</H2>
<P>To enhance communications with the outside world, connections with Internet  
are being explored extensively. The present Internet connection is through the 
Mercantile Office System on a trial basis. The system provides a full Internet 
connection with a Netscape browser. It is envisaged that by the end of 1996 ICIMOD will have an Internet connection interlinking its nodal institutions in the HKH Region. Presently ICIMOD can be reached through <B>icimod@mos.com.np.</B>A sample 
home page has also been created. It will soon be linked with other Himalayan 
Networks such as Himnet http://www.lehigh.edu/~inees/himnet/himnet.html.
<P>
<H2>Structured Elevation Model (SEM) Software </H2>
MENRIS/ICIMOD recently purchased PC-SEM software for distribution to nodal agencies in the RMCs and for its own purposes.   PC-SEM    is   a   vector-based digital terrain model which is used to perform analysis of three-dimensional surfaces. SEM is fully integrated into ARC/INFO and is designed for surface generation, storage, and analysis. SEM supports calculations of slope, aspect, and contouring and incorporates structure 
lines.
<P>SEM will be used for the GIS training programme of MENRIS and for advanced GIS analysis conducted in a PC 
environment. The software was made available at reduced cost by ESRI, Germany, which is developing the software.
<P><H2>ER MAPPER 5.0</H2>
<P>AsiaPac Singapore has made available ER MAPPER 5.0 software to MENRIS free of cost. ER MAPPER is an advanced image-processing software with the ability to integrate raster images with vector GIS/LIS data and an easy to use graphical interface. It runs on X-Windows (X11) based Unix workstations and PCs running Windows NT or Windows 95.

<P><H2>Inauguration of GIS Training Centre in Bangladesh</H2>
<P>The first certified centre for teaching ARC/INFO in Bangladesh was opened on 16 March, 1995. The learning centre is located in the ISPAN office in Banani, within the existing GIS Training Centre. The Environmental Systems’ Research Institute (ESRI) of California recently authorised the Flood Action Plan (FAP 19) GIS facility to be the first ARC/INFO Learning Centre in the country.
<P>FAP 19 has offered several ARC/INFO and other GIS courses in the past which were taught by expatriate trainers. Now the ESRI-accredited training will be conducted by local experts in the GIS Training Centre.
<P><H2>ESRI Forecast to Lead GIS Market in 1995</H2>
<P>The Environmental Systems’ Research Institute (ESRI) is forecast to lead the world GIS software market in 1995, according to Daratech, Inc., a market research and technology assessment firm. According to Daratech, worldwide GIS revenues will top US $ 563 million in 1995, a 13.7% increase over 1994. ESRI, with forecast revenues of US $ 162.8 million, is projected to be the number one GIS software provider for the year. ESRI 
is forecast to hold 28.9% of the market share - nearly 6% more than the nearest competitor.
<P>Much of ESRI’s growth is expected to come from increased sales of PC-based software products. ESRI is projected to be the number two PC-based GIS software provider in 1995, with forecast PC-based software revenues showing a 27.8% increase over 1994 figures. Much of this growth will be accounted for by increased sales of ArcView 2.1 and continued sales of PC ARC/INFO and ArcCAD, as well as Workstation ARC/INFO.

<H2>Special Report: GIS Markets to Triple Worldwide</H2>
<P>Worldwide, markets for GIS software and services will more than triple from US$1.2 billion in 1993 to US$3.8 billion in 1999, growing at a 21% compound annual rate, projects a new study just released by Frost and Sullivan. The share spent on software will rise from 46% in 1993 to 52% by 1999, forecasts the report. World GIS software and service markets’ migration to fast PCs from workstations characterise GIS markets. While GIS historically has been the domain of technical users, the market focus is shifting towards GIS as the core of a company’s central information management system. And while the current platform of choice for high-end GIS installations is the UNIX workstation, this will shift as use of PCs with Windows NT for GIS software apllications increases.
<P>Continuing technological advances are reducing costs of data acquisition and conversion while enhancing accuracy. Software developments like object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces, and multimedia 2-D and 3-D functions as well as data compression have been crucial in opening up GIS markets. Advances in client/server computing, the emergence of parallel processing, and the evolution of distributed database technology are expanding the ability of GIS to serve more users. 
<P>To maintain revenue growth, GIS companies will need to find ways to cut the high cost of implementing systems, capitalise on new technology, add product functionality and find innovative ways GIS can help end users reduce their own costs.

<P>Customer service remains a central competitive issue because of product complexity and a dearth of training 
specialists. End users abroad depend on long-distance support from GIS vendors and distributors. Government agencies facing budget cuts are increasingly using GIS to control costs as they deal with massive volumes of geographically related data. Overall, 80% of government data are estimated to be geographically-related. Businesses use GIS technology to track inventories, site stores and warehouses, develop sales and 
marketing strategies, and comply with government mandates.

<H2>World Wide Web: Some GIS URLSs</H2>
<P>There is a great deal of excitement about how Internet is changing global commerce. This is particularly true for the World Wide Web, the Internets fastest-growing area. The World Wide Web (called “Web”) has graphical user interfaces, ideal for delivering GIS information to the 100 million Internet users projected by the end 
of the decade. The Web’s interactive clickable maps are well suited for information referenced by coordinates. On-
line forms let users do text queries. File transfer capabilities can send digital data through the internet to the end user’s computer.
<P>The Web is a global client/server application based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Discrete units of information, called Web documents, use the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). These documents can contain text, images such as orthophotos, downloadable vector graphics (such as maps), as well as sound 
and video.
<P>These URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) take you to some of the more interesting GIS Web sites. If you have a graphical browser such as Netscape, they will give you a look at the future of GIS information on-line.
