<H2><A NAME="highway">ICIMOD on the Information Highway</H2>
For each of ICIMOD's mandatory activities (documentation and information
exchange, research, training, and advisory services) communication
is of vital importance. Reaching out to the 120 million people
living in the mountain ranges of eight countries is a continuous
challenge to the Centre.<P>

<B>Technologies</B><BR>
When ICIMOD was established in 1983, the main methods of communicating
with institutions in its member countries were by mail and telegramme.
Subsequently, telephone and fax have had a tremendous impact on
the efficiency of ICIMOD's operational and administrative contacts
in the region. We are very happy that, by entering into the INTERNET,
ICIMOD now also has the opportunity to interact in a very substantive
way on scientific issues, both within the region and outside,
with institutions and organisations with similar access. While at the moment the number of institutions and organisations
in the region with operational access to INTERNET may still be
somewhat limited, we are convinced that this technology will be
adopted by many of our partner institutions in the region within
the next few years.<P>

<B>Methodologies</B> <BR>
Face-to-face communication is, however, still the preferred method
of communication in this region, as can be seen from the contents
in this Newsletter. This issue, once more, reports on several
workshops and seminars that took place in the region. Travel by
ICIMOD professional staff to our regional member countries is
also an important communication method when it comes to ensuring
that ICIMOD's programmes respond to the the needs and problems
of our partner institutions. This issue also contains a short
note on the response to our readership survey, which indicates
the continuing, if not increasing, need to send out our Newsletter
regularly to the more than 2,000 addresses on our mailing list.
<P>

<B>The Ultimate Goal: Reaching Out to the Poor</B> <BR>
Even in ten years' time, 99 per cent of the population of the
HKH Region will not have access to INTERNET and will not have
direct access to the ICIMOD Newsletter and other ICIMOD documents.
ICIMOD is therefore on the continuing lookout for partners who
can be intermediaries in reaching out to the poor of the region.
Please approach us through any of the methods listed in the box
'Communicating with ICIMOD', and we will try to be of assistance.

<H2><center><A NAME="gurung">Conservation of the Environment in the Nepal Himalayas</center></H2>
<P><B><center>Harka B. Gurung</center></B>
<BR>
In recent years, the Nepal Himalayas have become the focus of
much environmental concern, owing to the massive soil erosion
that affects the adjacent lowlands and the problems of mountain
areas with heavy tourist traffic. This paper attempts to provide
a brief overview of four aspects of the ecocrisis: conceptualisation,
diagnosis, factors, and interventions.<P>
<B>I. Conceptual Clarification(1)</B> <BR>
Discussion on the Himalayan environment needs to begin with conceptual
clarity and this means the demolition of 'sacrosanct tenets'.
The obvious prevailing platitudes are ecological balance, fragility
of the mountains, the afforestation/soil erosion equation, native
ignorance of the environment, and environment and development
as antitheses (Table 1).<P>
Ecological Balance: The spoliation of the natural ecosystem is
inevitable with human intervention. The degree of imposition on
the natural environment varies in rapacity, both in time and space,
depending on whether it is for survival (poverty) or conspicuous
consumption (affluence). Substantial advances in science and technology
have, however, obliterated the Middle Path between traditional
immobility and materialistic heedlessness.<P>
Fragility of the Highlands: If vast quantities of sand and silt
were not transported by the Himalayan rivers over millions of
years, there would be no fertile Indo-Gangetic plains to contrast
with the poverty of the highlands. Excessive exposure to natural
elements makes highlands a high energy area for mass wasting.
Therefore, it would be more realistic to consider the highlands
as dynamic elements.<P>
Erosion due to Deforestation: The instability of the highlands
is related more to the declivity of the land surface of steep
slopes. At excessive heights above the treeline, mass wasting
takes place independently of vegetation cover. Soil creep erosion,
solifluction, and land slips and slides are common in the highlands,
whether there be vegetation or not. Human activities do contribute
to deforestation, but the extent of human impact on consequent
land degradation remains an unknown quantity.<P>
Native Ignorance: General-ly, the natives are said to be ignorant
of ecology or the adverse consequences of environmental degrada-tion.
It is said that high-landers should not multiply so fast, that
shift- ing cultivation is a bad land-use practice, and tree felling
for fuelwood certainly leads to deforestation. However, these
are adaptive mechanisms for survival in the absence of alternatives.
<P>
<B>II. Environmental Problems</B> <BR>
The two principal environmental problems in Nepal are land degradation
and deforestation. In recent years, pollution problems have also
emerged due to haphazard urbanisation and industri-alisation.
The first two processes are due to the nature of terrain and over-exploitation
of the natural resource base.<P>
Land Degradation: The term 'degradation' used here is not in the
form of a geomorphic process but in the sense of diminishing economic
returns. Mass wasting in the form of landslides and slope failures
is common on steep slopes. Soil erosion is natural on steep slopes,
and the heavy precipitation during the monsoon intensifies the
process. In arid transHimalayan areas, wind erosion is a predominant
process. Road and canal construction activities also contribute
to slope failure, but their scale of impact is minor compared
to that of natural mass wasting in Nepal.<P>
Nepal is said to lose 240 million tonnes of sediment annually
through its three river systems. That the catchment area of the
Koshi is only half that of the Karnali but transports a 2.4 times
greater sediment load is indicative of the active contribution
of heavy precipitation in the eastern part of the country. Mass
wasting and surface erosion contribute to in-creased sedimentation
and flood hazards in the inner <I>terai</I> and the <I>terai</I>
plains.<P>
Deforestation(2): Destruction of forests has two aspects: forest
depletion through overexploitation and outright clearance for
agriculture and other land uses. The former occurs near settlements
and is due to the extraction of products and overgrazing. Expansion
of cropland at the expense of forest land is indicative of increasing
population pressure, while commercial exploitation is facilitated
by road access. From 1964/65 to 1978/79, there was a loss of 382,000
hectares of forest land.<P>
The rate of forest depletion varies widely among the elevation
zones. The moun-tain zone is assumed to have gained marginally.
In the hills, the loss was as low as 0.2 per cent. Nearly 90 per
cent of the forest area lost was in the tropical <I>Terai</I>
at a rate of 1.8 per cent annually. This was mainly because of
agriculture and settlement for the large influx of migrants.<P>
Depletion and destruction of forests have a highly negative effect
on biological diversity. The rich floral diversity in Nepal is
represented by 375 species of fern, 352 species of lichen, and
350 species of orchid. Furthermore, the country has high faunal
diversity, being the convergence of the Oriental and Palaeoarctic
realms. It includes 797 bird, 580 butterfly, 129 mammal, 120 fish,
and 63 reptile species. Despite the designation of some areas
as national parks and reserves, many biotic species fall in the
endangered category.<P>
Pollution: Solid waste of varying compositions, biodegradable
to non-biodeg- radable, have become a problem in urban and industrial
areas. It has also become a problem in heavily-trekked areas such
as the Annapurna Sanctuary and the Upper Khumbu. Water contamination
has also become a big problem in Kathmandu Valley due to industrial
effluent, chemical pollution, and pesticides used on agricultural
land. Air and noise pollution are very localised problems and
refer particularly to the Kathmandu Valley. Air pollution in the
Valley is mainly caused by brick kilns, cement factories, and
the increasing number of vehicles.<P>
<B>III. Causative Factors</B> <BR>
The three broad categories of environ-mental problems enumerated
above owe their genesis to discrete factors. Simply stated, land
degradation is mostly natural, deforestation is due to popu-lation
pressure, while pollution pro-blems are due to poor management.
<P>
Steep slopes are both the cause and effect of mass wasting. According
to the databases of the Land Resources' Mapping Project, 58 per
cent of Nepal's land surface is defined as steep to very steep.
Deforestation, whether in the form of depletion or outright clearance,
can be attributed to human interference.<P>
The overpopulated hills are the sources of outmigrants. Some hill
districts in central Nepal exceed 7.7 persons per net cultivated
hectare, while the national average is 5.7 persons. This has put
increasing pressure on forests for timber, fuelwood, fodder, and
land for cultiva-tion. Another source of pressure on forest land
is the large number of livestock, estimated from 13.3 to 18.3
million during 1980/81. Their density per hect-are of gross cultivated
land is 7.6 on grazing land and 2.1 on forest land. Despite various
attempts at agricultural development, increase in food produc-
tion has not been through intensification or increase in productivity
but through cropland expansion.<P>
Except for the acute situation of solid waste, water, air, and
noise pollution in metropolitan Kathmandu, these problems are
still in the formative stage. The problems are evident and mainly
due to the lack of any control mechanism or proper management.
<P>
<B>IV. Poverty-Environment Nexus(3) </B> <BR>
The relationship between environment and development in the highlands
of Nepal should be considered to be inverted since some of the
environmental stresses there are the making of extreme underdevelopment.
Poverty is the basic cause of poor land management, the consequence
of which is deepening poverty (4).<P>
The risks can only be mitigated through economic development for
it is the poor that impose on marginal resources.<P>
The main agenda of highland develop-ment revolves around reconciling
land-use conflicts, reducing demographic pressure, and developing
alternative sources of energy. The last item has much relevance
for the protection of natural vegetation. Programming of activities
will be more realistic through a better understanding of traditional
re-source management systems. Since the highlands are generally
away from the centres of economic and political power, successful
implementation will be contingent on the full involvement of local
institutions and beneficiary participation.<P>

<H2><center><A NAME="regional">Mountain Agricultural Education and Research</center></H2> 
<P>
In order to foster regional cooperation for sustainable development
of mountain agriculture among agricultural research and educational
institutions located in or concerned with mountain agriculture
in the HKH, ICIMOD organised a regional consultation in Kathmandu.
The consultation was intended to provide a platform for sharing
experiences, discussing issues of common concern, and identifying
areas for action at national and regional levels.
<P>
<B>Participation</B> 
<P>
Among the participants at the meeting were 20 Vice Chancellors
from Universities based in the HKH and a similar number of high-level
functionaries from National Agricultural Research Centres. Another
20 participants represented Ministries of Agriculture, NGOs, and
other organisations with a mandate for agricultural extension.
<P>
<B>Common Platform</B> 
<P>
It was basically agreed that all mountain agricultural research
and development was facing a number of common issues. After an
extensive review of existing constraints and potentials, the meeting
concluded with the following key recommendations under four specific
topics.
<P>
<B>I. Strategies for Transformation of Education Systems</B> 
<LI><I>Specialised courses on mountain agriculture should be offered
within the general B.S. level degree programme.</H1>

<LI><I>Students should be required to undergo a year's internship.
</I>

<LI><I>There should be an exchange of faculty/staff amongst regional
universities and research institutes.</I>

<LI><I>Faculty should spend 20% of their time directly involved in
extension and foster two-way communication between the university
and farming communities.</I>

<LI><I>ICIMOD should serve as the focal point for information and
resource sharing.</I>

<P>
<B>II. Redefining Research Priorities </B>
<LI><I>Agro-ecozoning of the Region must be conducted, along with
a survey of various farming systems in each zone.</I>

<LI><I>Indicators for sustainable farming systems should be developed
for monitoring, evaluating, and formulating policies.</I>

<P>
<B>III. Incorporating Gender Concerns into Agricultural Institutions</B>

<LI><I>Curricula should be adjusted to include gender concerns at
all levels.</I>

<LI><I>Local women should be mobilised as extension agents to work
with existing women's organisations for empowerment and skill
development.</I>

<LI><I>Research should be conducted on time and labour-saving technologies
to reduce women's workloads.</I>

<LI><I>Research should be conducted on women's indigenous knowledge,
using participatory methods.</I>

<LI><I>Information on technologies for women should be collected
and shared.</I>

<P>
<B>IV. Strategies for Creating Regional and International Partnerships
and Alliances</B> 
<LI><I>At the national level, each country should establish national
mountain agricultural resource committees at the central, state/
provincial, and local/district levels.</I>

<LI><I>Each country should carry out an analysis of the institutional
framework within its territory, including an inventory of who's
who to identify a focal point and sources of funding.</I>

<LI><I>At the regional level, ICIMOD should establish an Advisory
Committee on Mountain Agriculture made up of representatives of
the national committees.</I>

<LI><I>All institutions should share their policies, plans, publications,
etc through the national focal points; ICIMOD can disseminate
this information through print and electronic media.</I>

<LI><I>Short-term refresher courses and in-service training programmes
should be offered to government officials, researchers, and educationalists,
as well as to extensionists and farmer organisations.</I>

<P>
<I>The Report of the Consultation will be available later in 1996.</I>

<B>Introduction</B> 
<P>
The Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment (IMHE), the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and the Ministry of Water Conservancy
(MWC) is based in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. It is a premier
institute for research on mountain hazards and environment in
the Chinese Himalayan Region. The institute was established in
1965 as the Southwest Branch of the Geographical Institute, CAS,
and renamed the Sichuan Institute of Geography and the Chengdu
Institute of Geography in 1971 and 1978, respectively. The institute
was given its present name in 1987 and is now under the dual leadership
of CAS and MWC.
<P>
<B>Mandate and Ojectives</B> 
<P>
The main mandate and objectives of the institute are to conduct
basic and applied research on: 1) distribution, formation, and
control of mountain hazards (debris flow, landslides, and soil
erosion); 2) formation, evolution, and protection of mountain
environment and human impacts on mountain environment; 3) development
and utilisation of mountain resources, especially soil resources;
and 4) application of remote sensing and computer mapping for
mountain planning and development.
<P>
The institute offers Masters' Degrees in education on mountain
sciences and provides consultations for mountain development.
<P>
<B>Organisation</B> 
<P>
The institute has a Directorate co-ordinating the following divisions
and field stations.
<P>

<BR>
Two of the field stations are open to international scientists.
The institute also has two debris flow and landslide simulation
laboratories and one synthetic technical and specialised laboratory.
<P>
<B>Staffing and Facilities</B> 
<P>
The Institute has about 400 staff, including 120 senior research
fellows and 100 middle research fellows. It has a library of documents
on mountain hazards and development. Several Journals are published
by the Institute, of which Mountain Research is the first journal
to be published on mountain development in China.
<P>
<B>Programme</B> 
<P>
To meet the needs for sustainable mountain development, the institute
focusses on a number of aspects.
<LI>
i. Debris flow: formation, regional planning, and comprehensive
control of debris flow
<LI>
ii. Landslide: formation and distribution, monitoring, forecast,
and protection, specifically for disastrous landslides;
<LI>
iii. Mountain erosion and protection: concentrated on soil erosion
in arid and semiarid areas of the Chinese Himalayas
<LI>
iv. Mountain ecology and assessment
<LI>
v. Regional development assessment
<LI>
vi. Mountain regionalisation for economic development
<LI>
vii. Mountain pedology
<LI>
viii. Application of remote sensing and cartography for mountain
development and regional planning.
<BR>
During the past 30 years, the Institute has made a substantial
contribution to mountain development. More than 400 research and
production projects have been completed and 70 prizes have been
awarded at national and provincial levels.
<P>
The Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment has been involved
in the ICIMOD Programme/Projects since ICIMOD's establishment,
in particular in the field of landslide hazard assessment.The
current Mountain Risk Engineering Project focusses on training
at field level (Newsletter 24).

<I><B><center>J.D. Gurung</center></B></I></B> 
<P>
The promotion of sustainable development in the HKH Region is
the mandate and mission of ICIMOD. Beyond the ecological concerns
alone, sustainability also incorporates social, political, and
economic factors. Gender is one aspect that is closely linked
to sustainable land use and the alleviation of poverty, which
is fast becoming more feminised in the region. Men and women's
differing roles and responsibilities, access to resources and
benefits, and their practical needs affect the priorities and
interests of the sexes in different ways. Due to their social
and economic roles, poor rural women have a close association
with the natural resources from which they must provide water,
food, fuel, and income for their families. As a result, women's
lives are very much affected, in ways that are different from
the ways in which men are affected, by the environmental degradation
which is occurring in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region.
<P>
It is the under-represented needs of women, in addition to the
better-known priorities of men, therefore, that must be understood
and accounted for in the planning and implementation of sustainable
development programmes. Due to the tremendous variations in cultures,
constraints, and opportunities in this mountain region, policies
and plans for the incorporation of gender per-spectives must be
based on local realities, which differ widely from east to west;
a gender perspective for sustainability in the HKH Region will
necessarily be derived from a knowledge of this diversity, gained
with the full participation of both sexes in the information collection
and analysis.
<P>
As was often commented on during the recent ICIMOD-sponsored Regional
Consultation on Agricultural Research and Education in Sustainable
Mountain Agriculture, most institutions involved in agriculture
and natural resource management (including NGOs) in the region
have not formally incorporated gender concerns into their research,
extension, and training programmes. Indeed, many of their staff
are not aware of what 'gender and development' refers to and demonstrate
a gender blindness that leads to the widespread exclusion of rural
women from participation in re-search and extension activities,
limiting the degree of sustainability that these outreach actions
may achieve. The common problems that women of this region experience
- those of heavy workloads, low education, little access to financial
and health services and new technologies, and limited control
over resources - go largely unaddressed by those institutions
responsible for rural poverty alleviation through improved land
use. Clearly, a strategy to bring about gender-sensitised planning
and implementation in these key agencies could do much to encourage
more equitable development between men and women and more sustainability.
<P>
To address this institutional neglect of gender concerns, ICIMOD
has developed an institutional strengthening programme focussed
on, but not limited to, agriculture and natural resource management
institutions in the region. This programme will have both research
and training components, as well as support for a Gender Network
for information exchange. Research will begin in 1996 with a fact-finding
mission to identify relevant institutions and indi-viduals, collect
existing data, and analyse the situations of women and men farmers
throughout the mountain areas within the eight countries of the
region. These analyses will then point the way to the development
of a more in-depth and systemised databank to meet the needs identified.
<P>
From this mission, participants from eight countries will be selected
for attendance in a training course on incorporating gender into
organisational policies and programmes, as well as development
activities for mountain dwellers. Women and men engaged in policy
formulation for agriculture, forestry, livestock development,
and environmental development in general, whose institutions demonstrate
an interest to incorporate gender concerns into their programmes,
will be eligible. These participants will gain the skills to guide
their organisations to become more gender-responsive. A network
formed around this core group of participants will provide the
nexus for information collection and sharing in the HKH Region.

<P>
ICIMOD's first workshop in 'Women, Development, and Mountain Resources:
Approaches to Internalising Gender Perspectives' took place in
November 1988 to promote interaction between ICIMOD professional
staff and guest participants who were resource experts on women's
issues. The workshop was coordinated by Dr. Vandana Shiva and
Dr. Deepak Bajracharya.
<P>
From that time, the need for gender perspectives in mountain development
has moved out of the tentative phase to becoming an accepted concept;
if indeed there was ever any doubt about the importance of women
in mountain development and in development per se. The first workshop
was useful in that it came up with several suggestions about practical
approaches to enhance the role and effectiveness of women in mountain
resource development and management. Since then, internalising
gender has progressed from the general to the particular.
<P>
Forty women from Nepal, lndia, and Pakistan came together in Kathmandu
in December 1995 and decided to form the Himalayan Grassroots'
Women's Natural Resources' Management Network. This workshop was
a continuation of the process which had begun in May 1995 at the
First Regional Community Forestry Users' Group Workshop organised
by ICIMOD's Participatory Natural Resources' Management Programme.
<P>
The December forum brought together the women who had been nominated
to the regional committee and who had been given the mandate to
operationlise a regional network for women in May 1995.
<P>
In his inaugural address, Egbert Pelinck, Director General,lCIMOD,
welcomed the participants and said that this was a unique meeting
for ICIMOD. This was the first meeting in which grass roots' women
from ICIMOD's three member countries had come together to discuss
the involve-ment of women in natural resources' management and
mountain develop-ment. ICIMOD had already recognised the important
role of women in this area and had established a special programme
on gender and development. He said he was happy to see that men
had also been invited to the forum and hoped that they would contribute
to the discussions. ICIMOD would be eagerly looking forward to
the outcome of the workshop so that the recommendations could
be fed into ICIMOD's ongoing programmes.
<P>
The first two days of the workshop were spent in small groups
to identify issues related to natural resources' management and
the barriers which prevented women from playing a stronger role.
It became clear during the plenary presentations that the status
of women within the household was a critical issue and that women
had to have a greater say in decision-making at all levels. The
barriers identified were related to social and cultural issues,
lack of education,the legal rights of women,and lack of aware-ness
about rights. In addition men's attitudes towards women, political
manipulation, and caste and class structures were considered to
be wider issues which need to be addressed.
<P>
The plenary also recognised that the key to sustainable mountain
develop-ment was rooted in the ability of women to have a greater
role in decision-making. This would only be possible if mechanisms
to address gender and related issues were created so that women
could collectively address them on a continuing basis.
<P>
The women participants endorsed the formation of the network and
decided to create the Himalayan Grassroots' Women's Natural Resources'
Management Network. As a principle it was also essential to ensure
that leadership for this forum remained vested with grassroots'
women. With this in mind, the group elected a new committee from
the three countries of Nepal,lndia, and Pakistan. A follow-up
meeting of the regional committee is scheduled to be held in Nepal
in May 1996 to evolve a strategic action plan for the future.

<H2><center><A NAME="energy">Rethinking the Energy Development Paradigm for Mountain Populations</center></H2>
<P><I><B><center>Kamal Rijal</center></B></I> 
<P>
A basic feature of the HKH Region is that the majority of the
population lives in the countryside, quite removed from the amenities
of modern cities and towns. These people are forced to lead simple
lives, meeting virtually all their energy requirements from the
environment. The price of this energy self-sufficiency, particularly
for the poor, and specifically women and children, can be quite
enormous in terms of human effort. This tedious and arduous labour
is aggravated by the low efficiency of end-use devices. As a result:
i) biomass is the principal fuel for cooking and space heating;
ii) animate energy is the main source of mechanical energy; iii)
the domestic sector is the main consumer of energy; and iv) cooking
and space heating are the predominant end uses.
<P>
The slow pace of energy transition in the HKH Region can be attributed
to the slow rate of growth in economic activities due to prevailing
development barriers. These barriers are caused by mountain specificities
which are manifested by inaccessibility, marginality, and fragility
(Box 1). Besides these constraints and the 'niche' imposed on
the energy sector, the numerous barriers it faces with regard
to policy, planning, technology, cost, financing, institution,
and information pose a serious predicament for the development
of the sector. However, a more positive strategy would be to capture
the opportunities generated by the mountain-specific characteristics
rather than harping on the constraints.
<P>
The objective of the energy system is to provide energy services.
Energy services are the desired and useful products, processes,
or services that result from the use of energy - for instance,
illumination, cooking, space conditioning, and so on. The energy
chain that delivers these services begins with the collection
or extraction of primary energy, which is then converted into
energy car-riers that are suitable for end uses (Fig. 1).
<P>
Therefore, better efficiency of energy use permits significant
improvements in the physical quality of life without any increase,
or even with decrease, in the amount of primary energy, while,
at the same time, it reduces the release of environmental affluent.
Also, when a particular energy carrier is used efficiently, or
a shift is made into more efficient energy carriers, then inefficiently
used sources will be available for alternative uses. For example,
large-scale dissemination of improved cooking stoves might make
it possible to use animal dung as farmyard manure.
<P>
Mountain development and the associated poverty alleviation are
believed to be feasible if development is both equitable (in group,
gender, and generational dimensions) and sustainable (from both
environmental and fiscal aspects). This would require a significant
change in the energetics of mountain lives, besides the energy
services required to fulfill the most basic needs such as water
and food.
<P>
Sustainable human development could be achieved if energy systems'
transformation means movement towards a model that embodies lower
energy system supply costs; greater financial sustainability,
reflective of users' preference and ability to pay; improved environmental
sustainability through greater reliance on renewable energy and
improvement in the supply chains of traditional fuels; adoption
of a system in a manner that maximises both direct and indirect
benefits; and use and development of alternative institutional
and financial approaches and incentives by all key players.
<P>
To facilitate sustainable environmentally-friendly development,
other infrastructural development activities, as well as income-generating
activities associated with credit facilities, are also crucial.
At the same time, the system of decentralised governance and identification
of appropriately-designed technology with in-built institutional
attributes need to be packaged for intervention in mountain communities.
<P>
It is important to understand the overall food, fuel, fodder,
fertiliser, and fibre (F5) system when considering the possibilities
of transforming the energy systems in support of economic development.
In the HKH Region, F5 systems are intertwined in many ways.
<P>
Animals and animal energetics are important in both subsistence
and market-based development phases. Also significant is the value
of the multiple outputs of animal husbandry and how it affects
the alleviation of drudgery, increased productivity, and overall
livelihood of the household.<HR>

<P>
The intricate relationship which exists between energy - economy
- environment is generally understood. However, lack of knowledge
concerning how to capture the dynamic linkages of these sectors
continues due to the weak database and poor analytical capabilities.
<P>
A particular concern is the health impact associated with domestic
use of traditional fuels. Many people, especially women and children,
are seriously affected by exposure to very high concentrations
of emissions caused by cooking with low-grade fuels and stoves
in poorly ventilated environments. An energy system transformation
that reduces the health risks as well as poverty must be promoted.
<P>
It can therefore be concluded that energisation of mountain communities
can be made feasible only if appropriate technological interventions,
in terms of energy sources, technologies, and institutional mechanisms,
are conceived and translated into reality. Energy technology interventions
with increased economic activities will lead to breaking down
the vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation. If
energy transformations are implemented appropriately, even the
poor can contribute in a significant way to development, which
would affect their lives as well as the overall economy.

<P>
The Hindu ush-Himalayan (HKH) Region is one of the world's highest
ecosystems. This mountain ecosystem is extremely rich in biodiversity
due to its great variety in altitude, climate, geology, biophysics,
and soil formation. Human interactions with mountain envi-ronments
throughout history have further enriched their biodiversity with
particular distribution patterns of plant, animal, and genetic
diversity. Recently, as part of an effort to promote national
biodiversity conservation, several countries of the region began
preparing national biodiversity action plans or programmes which
also take mountain ecosystems into consideration. The biodiversity
convention, however, also considers an ecosystemic approach in
the wider geographical context, which is essential for further
conservation, and Agenda 21 reinforces that concept by devoting
a full chapter (13) to: 'Fragile Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain
Development'.
<P>
Biodiversity conservation is accorded high priority by the HKH
member countries, and, as a consequence, ICIMOD is planning to
play a more active role in the field of biodiversity in the HKH
Region. Since May 1995, ICIMOD has been engaged in a programme
of regional collaboration on 'Biodiversity Assessment, Monitoring,
and Management in the HKH Ecosystems'. To ensure that ICIMOD coordinates
a regional programme that is complementary to and in support of
national programmes, the programme carried out a state-of-the-art
review on biodiversity and organised a regional consultation workshop
for further development of the programme.
<P>
The main purpose of the state-of-the-art review is to recommend
a regional collaborative programme on biodiversity assessment,
monitoring, and management as a whole, as well as other activities
specific to the needs of each country. The reviews will help to
identify the existing knowledge base and areas of high priority
for the future. On the basis of available information, and in
consultation with other biodiversity experts, the state-of-the-art
review papers were prepared at the end of 1995 by experts from
the respective member countries of the HKH Region. All the review
papers highlighted the main issues involved in biodiversity conservation
and management in mountain eco-systems in the respective countries,
with updated information, data, and maps on biodiversity.
<P>
A Regional Consultation on Biodiversity Assessment, Monitoring,
and Management in the HKH Region was organised from December 19
to 20, 1995, at ICIMOD, Kathmandu. It was attended by 23 participants
from the regional member countries and concerned international
agencies such as WWF, WCMC (World Conservation Monitoring Centre),
IUCN, and ICIMOD; participants included the authors of the state-of-the-art
review papers. The workshop was organised with the purposes of
(1) exchanging and sharing information on biodiversity conservation
in the mountain ecosystems of the HKH Region and improving the
existing knowledge for better collaboration on the subject; (2)
assessing and discussing the state-of-the-art review papers prepared
by experts from the regional member countries; and (3) providing
a forum for regional collaboration on biodiversity in the HKH.
The principal outputs of the workshop were the positive comments
made on the country review papers.
<P>
A wide range of common issues on biodiversity conservation and
management in the mountain ecosystems was raised and discussed
and the outcome was outlined into two groups of issues, one related
to the biophysical aspects of regional cooperation for biodiversity
conservation and the other related to the socioeconomic aspects
which essentially build up the basis for formulating a medium-term
work programme for regional collaboration on biodiversity. The
workshop proceedings, including the state-of-the-art review papers,
will be published by ICIMOD in the near future.

<H2><center><A NAME="survey">How You Responded to Our Newsletter Readership Survey</center></H2> 
<P>
<B>Background</B> 
<P>
In October 1995, ICIMOD carried out a Newsletter Readership Survey
for the first time. We are extremely grateful for the responses
we received and are happy to share with you some of the significant
findings.
<P>
A total of 2,071 questionnaires were sent out with Newsletter
No. 22 to 79 countries and, to date, 300 (15%) responses have
been received from 30 countries. Out of these responses, 181 (60%)
were from the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) Region and the rest,
totalling 119 (40%), were from outside the region. The two primary
reasons for carrying out the survey were:
<P>
<LI>a. to find out how useful and informative you find our <B>Newsletter</B>
and to find out whether you feel it provides adequate information
on the issues relating to sustainable mountain development and
<P>
<LI>b. to solicit your ideas and suggestions on how we can further
improve both the content and presentation of the <B>Newsletter.</B>

<P>
<B>Here is the feedback</B> 
<P>
<I>1. Are you receiving the ICIMOD Newsletter regularly?</I> 
<P>
217 (73%) respondents indicated that they were receiving the <B>Newsletter</B>
regularly; however, some of them complained about irregularity
or late receipt. (This probably has more to do with the vagaries
of postal authorities worldwide than with ICIMOD - something that
ICIMOD has no control over.)
<P>
<I>2. Do you wish to continue receiving the ICIMOD Newsletter?</I>

<P>
All but five respondents wished to continue receiving the <B>Newsletter</B>.
<P>
<I>3a. Is the ICIMOD Newsletter interesting to read?</I> 
<P>
284 (95%) respondents find our <B>Newsletter</B> interesting and
3 (1%) do not (4% had 'no comment').
<P>
<I>3b. Does the Newsletter provide useful/practical information?</I>

<P>
Several readers expressed the opinion that the <B>Newsletter</B>
should provide more practical, technical, and scientific information,
focussing on the results of research activities carried out by
ICIMOD and on highlighting 'success stories' in the region. Nevertheless,
275 (92%) found the <B>Newsletter</B> interesting.
<P>
<I>3c. Does the Newsletter help you to understand the activities
of ICIMOD?</I> 
<P>
282 (94%) of you responded favourably, 5 (2%) did not, and 4%
had 'no comment'.
<P>
Readers would, nevertheless, like more information on activities
that are going on or which are about to be launched by ICIMOD
in the region. They would also like the Centre to be more involved
in on-line interactive communication systems such as the Internet,
List Servers, and World Wide Web. We are happy to inform you that
you can find us on the Internet (see front page).
<P>
<I>4. Have you ever contacted ICIMOD with an enquiry after reading
an article in the ICIMOD Newsletter, or enquired about its programmes
and publications?</I> 
<P>
118 (40%) readers contacted ICIMOD after reading an article in
the Newsletter, whereas 169 (56%) did not, and 4% had 'no comment'.
<P>
<I>5. Do you think the articles are too technical, about the right
level, or too general?</I> 
<P>
240 (80%) of you find our <B>Newsletter</B> about the right level
in terms of its content, 12 (4%) too technical, and 33 (11%) too
general. The general feeling here is that the <B>Newsletter</B>
should contain more technical or lead articles highlighting research
activities, case studies, or 'success stories'. At the same time,
some urged us to maintain a balance between items that are of
wider interest and those that are technical.
<P>
<I>6. Are there any particular topics(s) or item(s) you would
like to see in the ICIMOD Newsletter?</I> 
<P>
More than half (54.33%) of the respondents provided information
on topics of interest, many of which related to natural resources'
management.
<P>
<I>7.Do you keep copies of the ICIMOD Newsletter in your library
or documentation centre?</I> 
<P>
263 (88%) responded that they keep the <B>Newsletter</B> in their
library/ documentation centre.
<P>
<I>8. Do you have any comments on the frequency, language, and
visual presentation of the ICIMOD Newsletter ?</I> 
<P>
While readers complimented us for the improvements we have made
over the years in terms of layout, formatting, and visual presentation,
there is a strong indication that most would like to see the frequency
increased either to quarterly or bi-monthly, if not monthly.
<P>
<I>9. Do you have any other comments about the ICIMOD Newsletter,
or recommendations about how we can improve it ?</I> 
<P>
Some of the responses to this question were the same as those
covered in question number 6 above. In addition, our readers would
like to see information and reports on a broad range of additional
subjects.
<P>
We hope that readers will recognise in this and future editions
of the Newsletter that we have received to make it even more responsive
to the needs of our readership. In the meantime we thank all f
you who contributed to our understanding of the Newsletter's readership.

<B>1. Landslide Hazard Management and Control in Pakistan</B>

<P>
<B>-M.H. Malik, and S. Farooq</B> 
<P>
<B>ISBN 92-9115-483-0</B> 
<P>
This country review on landslides on Pakistan deals with all the
aspects of land-slides, their types; causative factors; their
relation to geology, earthquakes, mon-soons, and deforestation;
their impact; and possible studies to overcome disasters and control.
This paper systematically identifies the problem areas and gives
details of the historical background, clearly establishing the
connection with certain natural (earthquakes, lithology) and man-made
(excavations and indiscriminate construction) causative factors.
The extent of the impacts of landslides depends upon various factors
such as the depth and rate of movement, stresses from the environment,
volume of materials involved, and, most importantly, the proximity
to settlements and structures. Dealing with the diversity of causes,
the author scientifically enumerates aspects of geology, such
as lithological distribution, bedding, joints, foliation, and
schistosity, that lead to landslides. Causative factors relating
to surface and groundwater and the effect of saturation on strength,
temperature variations, earthquakes and vibrations, and effects
of vegetation and deforestation have been dealt with in the context
of Pakistan. The text is further substanciated with figures, tables,
and photographs.

<P>
<B>- V.C. Thakur</B> 
<P>
<B>ISBN 92-9115-497-0</B> 
<P>
Landslide Management and Control in India examines the problem
of landslides in a mountain environment in which rising populations
and an increase in infrastructural construction have led to augmentation
in the probability of landslide occurrence. The various landslide
triggers (rainfall, erosion, deforestation, earthquakes, overburden
of and construction of inappropriate infrastructure, geological
causes, etc) and parameters of occurrence are discussed; a number
of case histories are given in illustration. Methodologies for
Landslide Hazard Zonation and map preparation are discussed, along
with landslide hazard rating. Methods of landslide hazard mitigation
are covered and an outline for a training programme is proposed

Landslides are one of the main natural disasters in China, responsible
for huge social and economic losses for mountain populations.
This paper reviews the available information on effective measures
for reducing economic and social losses caused by landslides.
These measures include landslide mapping (identification, types
of landslide maps, techniques of mapping); physical prevention
and control measures (problem avoidance, surface-water drainage
works, subsurface drainage, support structures, excavation, river
structure works); landslide hazard anticipation (long-, medium-,
and short-term prediction; prediction of the extent of landslides);
and assessment and mitigation measures for landslide-dam failure
disasters. Institutions concerned with landslide hazard mapping
and control, forecasting, mitigation, research, and training (government
agencies, research institutions, central and provincial governments,
NGOs, and scientific societies) have also been listed.

The document covers the geographical make-up and geological framework
of Nepal as an introduction to the topic. Specific topics such
as erosion and sediment yield in the Himalayas are covered within
these topic areas. Landslides are classified and factors causing
them described, including the geological background to landslides.
Climate and vegetation are among the factors covered, along with
hazards such as glacial lake outburst floods and earthquakes.
The main part of the document focusses on landslides and their
mitigation; the landslide sections are introduced by a short review
of landslide studies in Nepal. The text is supplemented by an
extensive bibliography and the curriculum for studies in engineering
geology of Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu.

This is the first of a series of eight documents envisaged for
mountain areas of the eight countries of the HKH Region. In publishing
this volume, ICIMOD is fulfilling a part of its mandate to facilitate
the dissemination of relevant information for sustainable development
of the HKH. The information is presented in tabular form with
respective government institutions, but this is the first time
that many important data sets have been brought together in one
volume and on a common geo-referenced platform. The spatial dimension
provided by the graphics provides decision-makers and planners
with easy access to information.

Small towns and market centres can play an important and effective
role in the development of mountain areas. However, strategies
for the identification and assessment of the potentials of market
towns and the formulation of a specific programme to develop the
market town potential in mountain areas of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas
are lacking. The present report builds upon existing literature
and elucidates the application of the methodology for the assessment
as well as the development of prioritised action plans of the
market towns with most potential in Dechang County in Sichuan
Province, China, Tehri Garhwal district in the UP hills, India,
Dang district in Nepal, and Ghizar district in the Northern Areas
in Pakistan. These areas represent the diverse physiographic,
spatial, and economic context of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH)
mountains. Spatio-economic profiles for each of the districts
were prepared on the basis of secondary data complemented by field-level
information. Several criteria were used in each context to identify
and assess the market towns with the most development potential.
On the basis of the field visits and participatory rapid appraisal
methodology, several prioritised areas of action are identified
for the promotion of a selected number of market towns with the
most development potential in each context. In the context of
the HKH countries, where planning manpower is often top heavy,
the studies also demonstrate the partnership that can be established
between academic institutions, rural development agencies, and
governmental agencies in supporting demand-driven approaches to
the promotion of market towns.
