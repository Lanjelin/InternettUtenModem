<H3>Total Budget</H3>

With the current assumption of an annual budget of $ 3.85 million for 1995 and an annual increase of seven per cent for inflation and exchange fluctuation factors, the total budget for the next four years will be as follows.

<H3>Funding Strategy</H3>
<BR>
<LI>Increase total annual levels of external funding from $ 3 million (1994) to $ 3.8 million <BR>
<LI>Maintain (at least) present levels of support by Regional Member Countries and other "core support" donors.<BR>
<LI>Request donors presently supporting individual projects to shift from project funding to programme funding.<BR>
<LI>Request donor organisations not yet supporting ICIMOD to join other donors and strengthen the total  financial basis of ICIMOD.
<P>
<H3>Special Project Funding</H3>
<P>
It is expected that, by undertaking the holistic approach to funding presented in this proposal, there will be far less need for seeking project-type funding.  However, there will still be cases in which specific new and additional activities have to be carried out in support of the overall mandate and programme of the present proposal. Such projects would usually require expertise and resources not present within ICIMOD's "new style" of operations and in general would be of a limited duration.
