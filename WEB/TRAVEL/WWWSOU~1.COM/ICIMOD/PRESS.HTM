<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>FINLAND TO SUPPORT ICIMOD<br>
</strong></font><strong>January 20, 1997<br>
</strong></font></p>
<p align=left>The Finnish Government has decided to contribute U S $ 314,000 to support ICIMOD&#146;s core 
programme. ICIMOD&#146;s uniqueness lies in its focus on the eco-region of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas 
and this support is a manifestation of the ever-increasing concern of donor governments and 
organisations for poverty alleviation and environmental conservation in the Hindu Kush-Himalayas. 
Based on experiences gained in the past, ICIMOD has reexamined and redirected its activities 
since 1st January 1995 when it embarked on a four-year Regional Collaborative Programme. The 
programme addresses key issues of sustainable mountain development from an integrated 
perspective and is the conceptual and organisational framework for implementing the four 
mandatory activities of ICIMOD, i.e., documentation and information exchange, research, training, 
and advisory services. <br>
<br>
The Finnish Government has become the seventh donor supporting this programme on Sustainable 
Mountain Development. The others include Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden 
and Switzerland. Twelve other countries and organisations support projects on specific subjects. 
Having focused on strengthening its human resources as well as its regional partner institutions in the 
first two years, with such increasing support ICIMOD is now better equipped and geared to help 
improve the living standards of populations of the Hindu Kush-Himalayas and their environments 
through an integrated approach. </p>

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>Space Informatics: Current Development in the Field of Information<br>
</strong></font><font size=3><strong>December 12, 1996<br>
</strong></font></font></p>
<p align=left>Owing to the difficult topography of mountain regions, including inaccessibility, and thereby lack of 
accurate information base, the decision-making process and implementation of developmental plans 
do not often meet desired expectations. The inherent diversity, marginality, and varying biophysical 
and socioeconomic values present great impediments for the use of Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing Technology. The ability to design and implement effective 
polices and programs in this dynamic environment is dependent on prompt and thorough analysis of 
current resources, their limitations, and changes. The implementation of GIS can be facilitated if data 
is collected, merged, and analyzed to provide information and output in a form that decision-makers 
can understand and use thereby addressing the problems of unscientific and inadequate use and 
management of the natural resources and environment. The process of using information in planning 
and decision making must be institutionalized and the information must be in a readily available form. 
This is where a GIS and Remote Sensing Technology come into play. It integrates biophysical and 
socioeconomic data and indicates alternative strategies for decision-makers. <br>
<br>
Despite widespread use of GIS in the global context, the implementation of GIS for mountain 
regions should be considered in a different perspective than for the lowlands. The lack of the 
experience in handling truly three-dimensional GIS which is the prevailing technology, and dearth of 
trained manpower and accurate multi-sectoral data hinder its appropriate application. Recent 
advances in the Remote Sensing Technology with new earth resources satellites on orbit like 
Advanced Earth Observing Satellite of Japan will definitely give new dimension to mountain 
resource management.<br>
<br>
Last year in 1995, the first space informatics seminar for the mountain ecosystems was organized in 
Mongolia, and a similar seminar for tropical ecosystem management was held in Figi in August 
1996. This &quot;Second Space Informatics Seminar for Sustainable Development - Mountain 
Resources Management&quot; is jointly organized by the United Nations Centre for Regional 
Development, National Space Development Agency of Japan, Ministry of Population &amp; 
Environment of His Majesty's Government of Nepal and International Centre for Integrated 
Mountain Development. ICIMOD is involved in constructing GIS databases with national 
collaborating institutions for wider exchange between national and regional institutions. In this 
regard, this seminar is an additional milestone for the partnership and collaboration with the global, 
regional, and national institutions.<br>
<br>
Over 70 participants, mostly representing the eight member countries of ICIMOD, are attending the 
seminar. The resource persons are mostly from the regional institutions and universities. The 
tentative program, being held in Kathmandu, involves presentations of about a dozen technical 
papers, one day field trip around Kakani area to show the application of remote sensing and GIS 
techniques, and group discussions. The seminar will be followed by two and half days workshop on 
the same theme. During the seminar/workshop, there will be exhibits on state-of-art technology 
related to Remote Sensing and GIS from the participating institutions and several other Japanese 
organizations/companies. <br>
<br>
The seminar/workshop will benefit resources planners, managers, application scientists, and 
researchers of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region to better understand the recent developments in 
space remote sensing and GIS technologies and their applications for resources management. 
Through this seminar/workshop ICIMOD and its regional member countries can develop in the near 
future some fruitful application programs with the National Space Development Agency of Japan 
(NASDA Japan) for natural resources' management in the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region. <br>

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>SWEDEN TO SUPPORT ICIMOD<br>
</strong></font><strong>November 21, 1996<br>
</strong></font></p>
<p align=left>The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) has become the sixth donor 
organisation supporting ICIMOD&#146;s core programme on Sustainable Mountain Development. 
SIDA&#146;s commitment to contribute US $ 200,000 per year for the next 3 years is an indication of 
the ever-increasing concern of donor governments and organisations for improving the living 
standards of mountain populations and their environment through an integrated approach. Over the 
past two years the donor contributions to ICIMOD&#146;s core programme have more than doubled and 
the countries supporting ICIMOD in this way now include Austria, Denmark, Germany, the 
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Twelve other countries and organisations support projects 
on specific subjects. The Swedish announcement was most opportune and welcome at this time as 
next week ICIMOD&#146;s Board of Governors and Support Group will meet in Pokhara to discuss the 
1997 Work Programme and Budget.&#160;</p>

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK DISCUSSED BY 
SUB-REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OFFICIALS<br>
</strong></font><font size=3><strong>July 22, 1996</strong></font></font></p>
<p>The Ministry of Population and Environment of His Majesty&#146;s Government, together with the South 
Asia Co-operative Environment Programme (SACEP, Colombo), the International Centre for 
Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), organised a consultation programme with senior officials from the Ministries of 
Environment of the South Asian Region from 23-24 July, 1996. <br>
<br>
The Meeting was attended by representatives from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, 
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and from the host organisations: ICIMOD, SACEP, UNEP&#146;s 
Environment Assessment Programme for the Asia Pacific Region (UNEP-EAP.AP), and UNEP, 
Nairobi.<br>
<br>
The Honourable Minister for Population and Environment, Mr. Prakash Man Singh, inaugurated the 
Meeting at ICIMOD. The Hon&#146;ble Minister welcomed the participants and highlighted the 
importance of the &quot;GEO 1 Report&quot; and expressed appreciation of the efforts put in by the 
international and regional organisations (ICIMOD &amp; SACEP) for jointly co-hosting the 
Consultation with assistance from UNEP.<br>
<br>
Mr. Taka Hiraishi, Director, Division of Environment Information and Assessment, UNEP, briefed 
the meeting on the background and purpose of the GEO 1 Project.<br>
<br>
The overall objectives of the Meeting were to review the draft GEO I Report and to have mutual 
consultations on environmental legislation and enforcement. The GEO project is UNEP&#146;s response 
to the 18th GC session of the UN requesting a new, comprehensive report on the state of the global 
environment now and until the year 2015. The draft document was prepared in close collaboration 
with relevant international, regional and national organisations and institutions. The report aims to 
highlight the essential problems of and threats to the environment, basic trends in environmental 
change, population increase, and consumption and production patterns. It also includes the 
recommended actions and measures, such as institutional and legal measures, that could effectively 
reverse unwelcome trends.	<br>
<br>
The Meeting reviewed the GEO Report and presented comments and suggestions for its 
improvement.</p>

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>IMPORTANT GEOLOGICAL FINDINGS IN SUNKOSHI AND 
BHOTEKOSHI</strong></font><font size=3><strong><br>
May 8, 1996<br>
</strong></font></font></p>
<p align=left>A research project on &quot;Hazard Mitigation in Northern Sunkoshi and Bhotekoshi Water Catchment 
Areas&quot; has come across major geological findings in the area, indicating the need to adopt a new 
approach to infrastructural development and watershed management. The project, implemented by 
ITECO Eng. Ltd, a Swiss company with a great deal of experience in the Himalayan region, in 
collaboration with ICIMOD, ITECO-NP, and the Swiss National Servey of Hydrology and 
Geology, carried out research on the fragile thick quaternary deposits of the Bhotekoshi and upper 
Sunkoshi catchment areas. This research was funded by the International UNO Decade on the 
Prevention of Natural Disasters and partly by Swiss Development Cooperation. A National Group 
comprising of representatives from HMG line agencies, including the National Planning Commission, 
carried out extensive review of the project proposal and provided important inputs to the project 
activities.<br>
<br>
Geological and hazard mapping, as well as surveyance of specific instabilities damaging farmlands 
and threatening the Arniko Highway were among its activities. The design of small-scale engineering 
and bioengineering measures to control the instabilities surveyed was also finalised. Hydrological 
studies linked to debris flows and instabilities on specific streams and sites were also carried out. 
Several teachers and graduates of the Department of Geology of Tribhuvan University as well as 
other Nepalese professionals, were trained on-the-job and consequently formed the survey team. 
Six Swiss expatriates participated in the project as trainers and implements.<br>
<br>
The research results confirmed that the fragile and thick quaternary deposits in the area were of 
glacial origin. Very deep glacial Pale-valleys filled by glacial or glacio-fluviatile sediments were 
identified by means of the seismic reflection method as low as 700masl, and it confirmed the output 
of electrical soundings implemented earlier on the occasion of the Arniko Highway Project. Such 
Pale-valleys are located below or along the present riverbeds. The study of sediment exposures 
with typical glacial depositional features, the presence in deposits of pollens indicating cold climate 
vegetation, and other findings are convergent facts indicating that the valleys were glaciated in the 
remote past. The Charnawati Rehabilitation Project as well as the HMWA project could also 
identify a typical till and thick glacial sediments in the Charnawati catchment area. It is therefore 
highly probable that other valleys of the northern hills were also glaciated at low altitudes during the 
same period. <br>
<br>
This is a new and important geological finding in Nepal.<br>
<br>
Such a new sight of quaternary geology has important implications. Besides the input brought to the 
science of glacial geology and what the presence of low altitude glaciation implies for a better 
understanding of climatic changes during the Quaternary Era, the presence of major glacial 
depositional zones within populated areas of the northern foothills&#146; belt is fraught with other 
consequences.<br>
<br>
One important issue rests in the fact that, when flowing through thick glacial sediments, the rivers 
and streams strongly undercut their banks and undermine their beds, mainly during high flow periods 
and floods. These processes result in landslides which infill the stream-riverbeds and may dam them, 
with obvious catastrophic consequences, e.g., floods and debris flows. These whole processes 
recur again when the rivers and streams have acquired a new bed profile. The nature of the 
sediments is also favourable to the storage of perched water tables, another cause of landslides and 
mudslides. <br>
<br>
This throws light on the causes of recurring landslides taking place on farmlands. Bridges 
constructed on the margins of or within the corridor influenced by stream- river erosion processes 
cannot be safe. The same applies to dam and dam reservoirs. In the case of the reservoirs, the 
slopes located in glacial deposits are weakened by the buoyancy effect and may fail with, as a 
result, rapid silting and, if a major landslide occurs, wave flooding. In the worst situation damaging 
or breaching of the dam may take place. In addition piping may occur below the dam.<br>
<br>
The finding of these glacial deposits at low altitudes implies that new approaches to infrastructural 
projects and watershed management are needed. This means that quaternary mapping, and 
especially, mapping of the glacial deposits are crucial for Nepal . This is the first time that such a 
mapping has been carried out. <br>
<br>
A final workshop for the project is being held at ICIMOD from 8 - 10 May. The results are being 
analysed and discussed by a total of 45 participants, including Nepalese scientists, HMG line 
departments officers, representatives of development cooperation agencies, and practitioners from 
private companies. A field trip along the Arniko Highway (with a visit to glacial deposit exposures 
and landslides) is part of the programme. The last day of the workshop is dedicated to final 
discussions and recommendations. </p>

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>ICIMOD publishes GIS database<br>
</strong></font><font size=3><strong>April 17<br>
</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3></font></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000080"><font size=3>The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has recently published a 
GIS (Geographic Information Systems) database of key indicators of sustainable mountain 
development in Nepal, on the basis of statistical and other information provided to ICIMOD by 
various organisations and institutions, according to ICIMOD press release received here the other 
day.<br>
<br>
The maps provide a spatial view of a whole range of perspective such as location, physiography, 
climate, demography, socioeconomic characteristics, agriculture and hydrology. While some of the 
maps have been published earlier, there are many new maps generated by ICIMOD through 
analysis of new data on climatic and socioeconomic aspects. The value of GIS as a tool for 
integrating different types of data is clearly demonstrated by these maps. The document also 
indicates the practical value of GIS for local-level planning and for highlighting the spatial 
consequences of development decisions and activities, the release said.<br>
<br>
According to the release, there are altogether 53 colour maps, computer-generated at ICIMOD's 
Mountain Environment and Natural Resources Information Service. The maps are supported by an 
introductory section explaining the genesis of the maps and the issues arising during compilation.<br>
<br>
There are also appendices with useful complementary information on the structure of the database, 
standard district codes, and ecological legends. ICIMOD hopes that all those involved in integrated 
mountain development will not only use this database but also provide inputs to updating the 
information therein.</font></font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>REGIONAL COLLABORATION FOR HYDROLOGY IN THE HINDU 
KUSH <br>
</strong></font><font size=3><strong>March 22, 1996</strong></font></font></p>
<p>The Hindu Kush-Himalayas are a store house of immense water and yet drinking water is a scarce 
commodity for millions of dwellers of mountains. Seasonality, steep slope and extreme climate 
create significant variances in the availability of water. Excessive rainfall, particularly during the 
monsoon, causes large-scale damage to life and property. Proper management of water supplies is 
crucial to sustainable development in the Hindu Kush-Himalayas. In an attempt to increase 
understanding of the hydrology of the region UNESCO/IHP, the International Centre for Integrated 
Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in cooperation with UNESCO/MAB, WMO, IGBP/BAHC 
and IAHS have come together to organise a Regional Workshop on Hydrology of the Hindu 
Kush-Himalayas. <br>
<br>
The Workshop held in ICIMOD focusses on the importance of water resources and the efficient 
use and delivery of water, whether in the form of power or as a basic physiological need. The 
workshop is a continuation of regional collaborative activities started under UNESCO IHP-IV 
Project H-5-6, and will focus on ways and means for a more effective collaboration between the 
countries of the HKH in hydrological studies. The Workshop is expected to launch the 
establishment of a new FRIEND-type group within the region.<br>
<br>
The workshop was inaugurated by Dr. D. N. Dhungel, Secretary, HMG/N, Ministry of Water 
Resources. Other speakers on the occassion were Mr. Egbert Pelinck D.G.; ICIMOD; Mr. Kiran 
Shankar Yogacharya, DG. DHM; Mr. L. A. Mandalia UNESCO; Dr. Z. W. Kundzewicz, WMO; 
Prof. A. Herrmann , German IHP/OHP Committee; and Prof. S. R. Chalise, ICIMOD. There are 
altogether 30 participants, two nominees each from the eight countries of the HKH, and experts 
representing the Institute of Hydrology - UK, Global Runoff Data Centre, and also those from 
Japan, UK, and Germany.</p>

<p align=center><font color="#0000FF"><font size=4><strong>MOUNTAIN FOCUS NEEDED FOR AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION 
AND RESEARCH<br>
</strong></font><strong>Feburary 14, 1996<br>
</strong></font><strong>Hindu Kush-Himalayan Scientists and Educators Meet<br>
</strong></p>
<p align=left>From 23-26 January, more than 60 agricultural scientists and educationists gather in Kathmandu to 
participate in the &quot;Regional Consultation on Research and Education for Sustainable Mountain 
Agriculture.&quot; The meeting is organised by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain 
Development (ICIMOD) in recognition of the fact that traditional research and educational systems 
have not adequately taken into account the specific nature of mountain agriculture and the 
indigenous knowledge that the farmers of the mountains already possess. As mountain areas open 
up and come into contact with the wider market economy, different cropping patterns are needed to 
respond to the new aspirations of mountain farmers for increasing their income and improving their 
livelihoods.<br>
<br>
A critical issue requiring special attention is the migration of male workers from the hills and 
mountains to the plains, urban centres, and abroad, which has left the responsibility for mountain 
farming to female-headed households. This also needs new thinking in the context of agricultural 
research and education; fields still largely dominated by men.<br>
<br>
Among the participants at the meeting are 20 Vice Chancellors from Universities based in the Hindu 
Kush-Himalayas and a similar number of high-level functionaries from National Agricultural 
Research Centres. Another 20 participants represent Ministries of Agriculture, NGOs, and other 
organisations with a mandate for agricultural extension. <br>
<br>
The Consultation is intended to provide a platform for sharing experiences in mountain-specific 
research and education, to discuss issues of common concern, and to identify priority areas for 
action at national and regional levels. High on the agenda will be an assessment of the adequacy of 
the current curricula of mountain agricultural Universities and ways for their improvement. The 
meeting is also expected to help develop linkages and cooperation among agricultural research and 
educational institutions of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region, including better mechanisms for 
information exchange among the concerned institutions, international agricultural centres, and 
ICIMOD.</p>
