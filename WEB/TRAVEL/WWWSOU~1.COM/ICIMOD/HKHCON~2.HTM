<H1>Constraints/Disadvantages</H1>
<P>
<B>Inaccessibility</B>- Isolation, distance, and poor communication facilities result in high costs or even non-availability of access to goods and services and to markets as well as to other opportunities for diversifying mountain economies.
<P>
<B>Fragility</B> - The natural environment of the HKH is prone to rapid degradation in the face of intensive use and improper planning and development of roads and other physical
infrastructure.
<P>
<B>Marginality</B> - In physical terms, the soils and lands are marginal in their productive capacity. In human and institutional terms,  the people of the mountains are left on the fringes of decision-making from mainstream, national development policies and programmes. There is a neglect of their conditions, needs, and aspirations; an increasing inequality and limited participation in decision- making; and the unsuitability of imposing external solutions and programmes.
