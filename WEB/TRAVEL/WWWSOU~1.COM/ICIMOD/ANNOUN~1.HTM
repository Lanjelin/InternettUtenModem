<h1><A NAME="request">REQUEST from APMN</h1>
The Regional Conference on Sustainable Development of Fragile
Mountain Areas of Asia (SUDEMAA) was organised in Kathmandu from
December 13-16, 1994. Following three days of extensive discussions
on a wide range of mountain development issues, including country
statements about respective mountain areas, the participants adopted
the SUDEMAA Call to Action, calling upon countries to place mountain
areas higher  on their respective sustainable development  agendas.
The conference brought together over 60 policy-makers and practitioners
from New Zealand to Iran. One of the decisions of the meeting
was for ICIMOD to facilitate information exchange about Asian
mountain areas.
<P>
The Asia Pacific Mountain Network (APMN) is a follow-up to this meeting
and represents an  informal forum for the exchange of information
and sharing of knowledge affecting sustainable development of
mountain areas in the Asia Pacific Region amongst agencies and personnel concerned or associated with
such mountain areas. The network is coordinated by the International
Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) in Kathmandu,
through a special grant from the Swiss Government.
