The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, ICIMOD, was created  to promote progressive and effective development of mountain communities in the <a href="HKHMEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/icimod/hkhmenu.html">Hindu Kush-Himalayas.</a>
<P>
The establishment of ICIMOD was based upon an agreement between His Majesty's Government of Nepal and UNESCO, signed in 1981. ICIMOD was inagurated in December 1983 and began operating in September 1984. Nepal, the Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland

, and UNESCO were the founding sponsors.
<P>
ICIMOD is the first international centre devoted to integrated mountain development. It was founded because of wide-spread international recognition - especially in the <a href="HKHCOU~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/icimod/hkhcount.html">eight nations</a> of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region - of the accelerating degradation of 

the fragile mountain habitats under severe population pressures, with the consequent increasing impoverishment of mountain communities.
<P>
The centre operates as a non-profit, autonomous institution, international in character, and non-political in management, staffing, and activities.
<P>
The page attempts to provide a searchable source for information about the Centre, catalogue and databases and links to the global information network. More information about ICIMOD is available<a href="ICIMOD~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/icimod/icimodin.html"> here.</a>
