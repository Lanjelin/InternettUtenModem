<p align=center><font color="#008000"><font size=4><b>The Environment-Development Dilemma </b></font></font></p>
<p>Most development activities impinge upon the environment and adversely affect the ecological 
balance of the mountains. It would be unreasonable and unfair to the mountain people if, for that 
reason, no development activities were to be undertaken in mountain areas. </p>
<div align=center><center>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td><font color="#008000"><font size=2><b><i>In between the two 
extreme types of activity; 
namely, (i) 
'environmentally-benign' 
ones and (ii) 
'ecologically-disastrous' 
ones there is a whole 
range of activities that 
have various combinations 
of income-generating and 
environmental impact 
potential.</i></b></font></font></td><td width=75%>The intimate and interactive links between environment and development 
necessitate complete incorporation of environmental of the generally 
practiced post-formulation assessment of environmental impact of a 
project or a programme. Efforts in the past have focussedmainly on 
categorising areas as resource-abundant and resource deficientor on 
zonation of environmentally-sensitive areas (e.g., into green, red, and 
orange categories). The concept of carrying capacity has also been used to 
assess the extent to which development activities could proceed without 
endangering the environment. These approaches have succeeded in 
highlighting the importance of environmental protection, but they have fallen 
short of evolving approaches that can strike a balance between 
environmental and developmental needs. Environmental impact analysis, on 
the other hand, has been applied to judge specific projects or programmes, 
without necessarily having a range of options for consideration. </td></tr>
</table>
</center></div>
<p>Methodologies for evolving alternatives from which a set of development activities causing minimum 
damage to the environment could be chosen for mountain regions, in general, and for specific areas 
with a varying resource base, in particular, have not been adequately developed. </p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td><font color="#008000"><font size=2><b><i>Available methodologies 
for EIA and assessment of 
income potential for 
precise quantitative 
estimates may prove 
inadequate, and they need 
to be further developed by 
natural resource and 
environment specialists 
and economists together.</i></b></font></font></td><td width=75%>A quantitative assessment of the environmental sensitivity of different 
activities, in terms of both resource use and resultant processes and 
activities, is needed. Ideally, an aggregate index or coefficient of 
environmental impact for each potential development activity is required. 
There are essentially two steps in this exercise; one, in terms of the state of 
natural resources that need to be developed and, two, in terms of the 
extent to which a development activity affects these indicators directly and 
indirectly, which have to be assessed. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Activities should also be indexed according to their income-generating potential, in order to choose 
an activity structure that is sustainable in terms of both its impact on the environment and potential 
for income generation on a continuing basis. Simultaneously, the development plan should provide 
for the possible regeneration and replenishment of environmentally-sensitive resources that would 
be depleted, even if slowly, in the process of economic development. </p>

<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=25%><font color="#008000"><font size=2><b><i>Any development strategy 
will have to ensure 
expansion of employment 
opportunities and 
broad-based development 
of human resources and 
skill 
formation,particularly 
among small-holders, the 
landless, and women, to 
ensure that the benefits of 
development are widely 
distributed.</i></b></font></font></td><td width=75%>Integrated planning in mountain areas requires the use of linkage analysis in 
operational aspects, not merely as a tool for estimation of demand-supply 
balances and output and investment requirements. For, due to the 
problems of inaccessibility and marginality, production linkages do not 
materialise without interventions. This is true of both linkages between 
infrastructure and directly productive activity and those between different 
activities or different links in the production and marketing chain.Thus, 
development of transport infrastructure and power supply in themselves 
does not necessarily lead to the development of income-generating 
activities, nor does wide-scale prevalence of manually-operated, 
low-productivity activities, even considering the potential for high 
productivity and better incomes through use of power and access to 
outside markets, bring about development of energy and transport 
facilities. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Similarly, production of primary commodities, even though on a significant scale, does not 
encourage the development of processing facilities, thus depriving the producers of better incomes 
and others of employment opportunities locally. Even an activity like tourism, for which mountain 
areas have a comparative advantage, is often found to have more 'leakages' than 'linkages' because 
there is no integrated planning approach to link it with other local activities. </p>
<p>Integration in mountain areas, therefore, has to be a concrete aspect of planning and not a mere 
methodological device. It must, at the same time, be recognised that, in operational planning, 
integration can be effective only if appropriately reflected in coordination among different sectoral 
agencies and departments, insofar as the responsibilities for sectoral development and activities and 
resources for that purpose are divided among line agencies.</p>

can make them effective partners in 
development.</i></b></font></font></td><td width=50%>In view of the centrality of women and their proven potential for 
hard work and enterprise, the gender dimension needs to be 
completely integrated into development planning in mountain areas: 
the 'special programme' approach is neither adequate for the 
development of women nor for using their potential to develop 
mountain areas and communities. Any planning methodology, 
therefore, needs to incorporate the gender dimension as well as 
the environmental dimension. Ways to equip women to participate 
effectively in new, dynamic activities and processes, as well as to 
enable them to make decisions on significant matters that affect 
improvements in the standards of living and welfare of their 
families, should form an integrated part of area development plans. 
The principal focus should be on broadening the choices for 
women in relation to their work and time allocation. </td></tr>

<p align=center><font color="#008000"><font size=4><b>Distinct Approach</b></font></font></p>
<p>The terrain and altitudinal characteristics of mountain areas require a distinct treatment of space in 
area planning methodology. Agroclimatic zoning and watersheds provide, within certain limitations, 
useful concepts for this purpose. Different elevation and altitude ranges, which may also coincide 
with different agroclimatic and resource zones, could also be adopted as planning units. But in no 
case is an entire area, used as a planning unit in the mountains, going to be at the same altitude and 
with similar terrain and slopes (if so, it would not be a mountain area!). </p>
<p>Therefore, spatial mapping for preparation of resource inventories and assessment of development 
potential has to be three dimensional. A tool, such as the Geographical Information System (GIS), 
which is now widely used for spatial depiction of all kinds of characteristics and their 
interrelationships, would be most useful for this purpose. It would, however, be necessary to 
determine the nature and extent of data necessary for integrated planning. Given the general 
limitations in respect to availability of data on a disaggregated area basis, and the time and cost 
involved in primary data collection, the tendency to ask for large-scale, highly detailed information 
should be avoided. Prior identification of the kind of information necessary and adequate for a clear 
conceptual framework of integrated planning should be made. At the same time, planning on an 
area basis would also make it possible to fill in data gaps as and when they appear, as part of the 
process of formulating and implementing plans and programmes. </p>
<p>The institutional arrangements for planning in mountain areas also need a distinct approach. Mere 
decentralisation, which commonly means decentralised implementation of the programmes planned 
from above, is not good enough for mountain areas: planning from below on an area basis is 
essential. </p>
<div align=center><center>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td><font color="#008000"><font size=2><b><i>In mountain areas with 
their highly diverse and 
heterogeneous resource 
base and spatial 
discontinuities caused by 
altitude,slope,and 
relief,'autonomy' in 
planning in a real sense is 
required. In other 
words,plans for 
development of mountain 
regions have to be evolved 
on an area basis, so that 
they can take into account 
the specificities of 
resource base and achieve 
better integration between 
resources and activities, 
among activities, and 
between environment and 
development.</i></b><i> </i></font></font></td><td width=75%>Local, institutional capacity-building and people's participation are 
necessary conditions for successful preparation and implementation of 
plans in this approach. The vagaries and exigencies of nature resulting from 
terrain and climatic characteristics have compelled the mountain people to 
evolve ways of cooperating and working together as communities. 
Historical, cultural, and ethnic specificities have introduced further specific 
dimensions to naturally determined mechanisms in some mountain areas. 
This phenomenon, which takes the form of indigenously-evolved 
institutional arrangements, should be used and strengthened as far as 
possible by providing modern scientific, technical, and management inputs. 
These should be supplied by government and non-government 
organisations. Similar use should be made of the indigenous knowledge 
and practices developed by mountain people over the centuries as a part 
of their survival strategies. In other words, a methodology for preparing 
and implementing plans and programmes in mountain areas must 
incorporate the local institutional and human adaptation specificities, rather 
than mechanically applying institutional models developed elsewhere. &#160;</td></tr>

<p align=center><font color="#008000"><font size=4><b>Looking Ahead </b></font></font></p>
<p>Methodologies for integrated and area planning using 'consistency' models and regional planning 
techniques are reasonably well-developed. They, however, need to be modified and adapted for 
integrated planning on an area basis for mountain regions in respect to (i) incorporation of 
environmental issues into the plan framework, and (ii) intersectoral integration at the area level. On 
both these counts, existing methodologies are deficient. Plan models, mostly using an input-output 
framework to determine demand-supply balances and consistencies, have not internalised 
environmental parameters, and regional and area plans have mostly been an amalgamation of 
sectoral schemes and programmes without paying much attention to linkages among activities. </p>

should be the guiding principle 
in planning, in wholly or 
predominantly, mountainous 
countries and regions. </i></b></font></font></td><td width=75%>Numerous manuals and guides have been developed to elaborate and 
resolve conceptual and technical issues involved in integrated area 
planning. What is important for the present purpose is to identify the critical 
modifications to be made to concepts, issues, and methodologies to 
account for the mountain perspective</td></tr>
</table>
<p>. This perspective, as developed in the past work of ICIMOD, consists of a set of mountain 
specificities, namely, inaccessibility, fragility, marginality, diversity, niche, and human adaptation 
mechanisms. The first three broadly represent constraints, and the remaining three opportunities, in 
mountain development. Basic factors underlying these specificities, their operational and 
development implications, as well as externalities of development interventions directed to different 
specificities, have also been elaborated in earlier work at ICIMOD (for more details and further 
reading, see MEI Discussion Paper 96/2). A number of ICIMOD activities used this framework to 
develop approaches to sustainable mountain development, particularly in the area of agriculture and 
farming systems. Based on both the conceptual work on mountain perspectives and 
application-oriented research and demonstration, ICIMOD has also tried to elaborate upon the 
concept of sustainability, particularly in terms of its indicators, positive and negative, in respect to 
agriculture. </p>
<p>A training manual for mountain area development planning is an idea worth considering. It should, 
however, be borne in mind that training for planning methodologies for integrated mountain 
development needs to be based on substantive and real world situations that could be used not only 
as illustrations of a standardised methodology of area planning, but also to lead to modifications and 
changes in the methodology itself. </p>
