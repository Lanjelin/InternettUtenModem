<p align=left><em>A reasonable amount of progress has been made by the APMN since the first APMN 
Bulletin last March. So far, we have concluded agreements with four focal points 
throughout Asia. Some of these focal points have already started providing inputs for the 
Bulletin. A meeting of the Focal Point Coordinators has been set for March 17-19, 1997. 
The second issue of the Bulletin is in front of you and a full-time assistant has been 
appointed by ICIMOD to manage the increasing volume of work. </em></p>
<p align=left><em>All of these represent developments that have been initiated by the APMN Secretariat 
and are, in our opinion, important and essential. However, in order to be sustainable, we 
must be demand driven and not supply governed. The main challenge for APMN is to 
find a real niche among the mountain people and their organisations in Asia. All of you 
out there who are concerned about the future of your mountain people and their 
habitats, the message to you is GET INVOLVED! </em></p>
<p align=left><em>There are several ways of getting involved. Firstly, make a firm commitment to bring 
about sustainable mountain development. Secondly, mobilise and generate information 
on critical mountain-related issues. Thirdly, evaluate actual successes and failures and, 
fourthly, provide inputs on how to pursue successful policies and programmes for the 
benefit of mountain people and their environments. UNCED Agenda 21 has provided a 
whole range of important subjects and issues for us to work on. Let us all get involved 
and see how best we can promote sustainable mountain development. Please write to us 
at ICIMOD or to any of the subregional focal points (page 4) if you wish to share some 
aspect of mountain development that you consider relevant for the future of mountain 
people and their environments. </em></p>

approximately 2-3 days. The venue is Kathmandu. </p>
<p align=left>The main objective of this meeting is to further define and refine the activities of the APMN - 
both collectively as well as individually by the different focal points. There is an urgent need for 
the focal points to become more active in their respective areas, especially in terms of collecting 
issues and identifying priorities. Each focal point must now develop a short-term as well as a

<hr>
<p align=center><strong>THE THIRD ADHOC INTERAGENCY MEETING ON FOLLOW-UP TO UNCED AGENDA 21, CHAPTER 13</strong></p>
<p align=left>The Third Ad hoc Meeting was held in Aviemore,Scotland on April 22, 1996, and was attended by representatives from the 
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations University (UNU), ICIMOD, the International Union of 
Forestry Research Organisations (IUFRO), International Mountain Society (IMS), The Mountain Institute (TMI), the World 
Conservation Union (IUCN), Centre for Alpine Environments (ICALPE), African Mountains&#146; Association (AMA), and the 
International Union of Alpinist Associations (UIAA).The meeting was chaired by Mr. Luis S. Botero of the FAO Forestry 
Department. </p>
<p align=left>The principal objective of the meeting was to review the progress made after the Second Inter-agency Ad hoc Meeting held in 
Lima, Peru, on February 20, 1995 and the follow-up action taken by the concerned agencies and organisations on the 
recommendations of the Third Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD). The meeting also discussed the 
future course of action in view of the upcoming five-year review of action taken on all Chapters of Agenda 21, since the Rio 
Conference in 1992, scheduled for 1997.<br>
<br>
The first item on the agenda for the meeting was an overview of the progress made in implementing the decisions and 
recommendations of the Third Session of the CSD, which was given by the FAO, the Task Manager for Chapter 13. The 
overview included information on the regional consultations on Chapter 13 and the work undertaken on the development of 
criteria and indicators for sustainable mountain development. A presentation was then made by each representative on the 
progress made since the second inter-agency meeting. Some of the highlights were the establishment of the Uganda Mountain 
Resources&#146; Centre, a regional centre focussing on mountain research; four new mountain sites among 13 new biosphere 
reserves; IUFRO&#146;s recently established Task Force on Mountains and Forest Development; the significant growth of the 
network of scientists and managers working in mountain protected areas; the role played by IUCN&#146;s European Programme 
and ICALPE in organising the European Intergovernmental Consultation on Chapter 13; new mountain publications by 
ICALPE; the upcoming AMA meeting in 1997 on community involvement and participation in mountain development; TMI&#146;s 
work in high-altitude archeology and on sacred mountains; ICIMOD&#146;s role in establishing the APMN; and UIAA&#146;s efforts to 
channel financial inputs from hikers and trekkers directly into local mountain communities.<br>
<br>
Item five on the agenda covered the recent work undertaken by the FAO and other UN agencies on the development of 
criteria and indicators for sustainable mountain development. FAO indicated that it would like to include members of the 
inter-agency group in further development of the criteria and indicators. In terms of the guidelines for formulation of sustainable 
mountain development programmes, which the FAO had requested TMI to develop, the participants unanimously agreed on 
the usefulness of such an exercise. Other activities reported upon and discussed during the meeting included the continued and 
important role of NGOs in shaping and pursuing the Mountain Agenda; advances in national and regional-level action; the 
possibility of holding a major international meeting on Chapter 13; the planned publication of The State of the World&#146;s 
Mountains - 1997; and the status of the quarterly journal, Mountain Research and Development.<br>
<br>
Discussions were also held on the upcoming fifth session of the CSD and the planned session of the UN General Assembly in 
June 1997. The Meeting recommended that the Fourth Inter-agency Meeting on Chapter 13 Follow-up be held in conjunction 
with the second session of the European Inter-governmental Consultations to be held in October 1996 in Trento, Italy.<br>

<p align=center><strong>PAYING FOR MOUNTAINS: INNOVATIVE MECHANISMS AND PROMISING EXAMPLES FOR 
FINANCING CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (PFM)</strong></p>
<p align=center><strong>AN ELECTRONIC CONFERENCE</strong></p>
<p align=left>The Mountain Forum, a global electronic network, offers a venue for global linkage of individuals and organisations concerned 
with mountain cultures, environment, and sustainable development and was formed with the purpose of providing mutual 
support and exchange of ideas and experiences.The Mountain Forum&#146;s first electronic conference, PFM, began on July 9 and 
ended on August 8. It was initiated at the request of the FAO and the content moderator was Lynelle Preston of The 
Mountain Institute. The goal of this conference was to identify innovative financial mechanisms and derive operational 
principles that can help reverse the net loss of resources from the mountains.<br>
<br>
There were approximately 210 subscribers to this conference from throughout the world with an <br>
average of 10 new postings every day. The discussions began with the topic of user fees and associated community rights. 
Specific cases on this topic included the Annapurna Conservation Area Project in Nepal and the Pippen System in Sikkim, 
India. Another thread of discussion revolved around trust funds; a useful description of Debt-for-Nature swaps and 
information regarding the Regional Consultations on Trust Funds in Latin America and the upcoming consultation in Asia were 
also posted.<br>
<br>
The second and third weeks saw more discussion on user fees and potential fees that could be established to help pay for the 
mountains such as a-dollar-a-day fee for enjoying the mountain scenery, a tourist tree tax, and a multi-tiered fee structure. An 
interesting posting suggested employing mountain farmers as mitigators of global warming. A discussion on the transfer of 
urban water utility revenues to finance watershed protection and biodiversity conservation was thought provoking. It is 
encouraging to witness active thinking on how to get downstream users to compensate for upstream communities and 
environments. Discussions were held on the use of transferable development rights as a mechanism to finance the protection of 
conservation areas and regional trademarks as a mechanism which ensures that low-cost competition is avoided and an 
appropriate price is maintained for a particular (mountain) product. Many promising and specific examples of mechanisms 
were documented such as village micro-hydropower schemes.<br>
<br>
The fourth week was an especially busy week with the discussions touching on a variety of issues and mechanisms such as 
micro-enterprise development, ecotourism, and community forestry in Nepal; the Bhutan trust fund; localisation; 
incentive-based initiatives in Mongolia and Tibet; Mt. Taranaki in New Zealand; and mountain management in the Sumava 
Mountains of the Czech Republic, among others.</p>
<p align=left>These discussions will serve as input to a document that will seek to provide guidance to policy-makers and planners in 
developing programmes and policies that will mobilise more financial resources for mountain conservation and sustainable 
development projects.This document will be used in the U.N. review of Agenda 21 next year. <br>

<p align=center><strong>A NATIONAL POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE HIGH COUNTRY OF NEW ZEALAND: SUMMARY OF A 
WORKSHOP SPONSORED BY THE CENTRE FOR MOUNTAIN STUDIES, LINCOLN UNIVERSITY </strong><br>
</p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%>The workshop focussed on the potential contribution of a 
national policy statement (NPS) for the high country of New 
Zealand. The topic itself is consistent with Chapter 13 of 
Agenda 21 and other political and resource management 
considerations. The workshop participants included 
representatives from the Federated Farmers, Ministry of 
Environment, Canterbury Regional Council, Royal Forest and 
Bird Protection Council, Lincoln University, North Canterbury 
Fish and Game Council, and the Department of Conservation. 
In New Zealand, there is only one existing example of an NPS 
, the Coastal Policy Statement, and this is not a useful example 
for the High Country case. The 1979 statement of Government 
policy on the High Country could perhaps be taken as a more 
relevant starting point. The Workshop participants judged that 
an NPS should be a statement which ... provides the vision and 
policy direction on issues of national importance.<br>
<p>The need for an NPS was highlighted by the unsustainable 
practices in many parts of the High Country; the need for 
consistency of approach when dealing with issues in the High 
Country; and the need to update the 1979 statement of 
government policy. </p>
</td><td width=50%><p align=left>Some of the reasons for developing an NPS were that an NPS 
could potentially achieve a coordinated approach to some 
parts of integrated resource management in the high country 
and an NPS would identify criteria and principles to be applied 
in pursuing integrated resource management in the high country.<br>
<br>
Some of the reasons given against developing an NPS included 
the facts that determining a national policy under the RMA 
would be time consuming and costly; a revision of Regional 
Policy <br>
Statements, regional plans, and district plans would be 
necessary; and the high country is too diverse for a national 
policy. During the Workshop it had been argued by many 
present that an NPS would be most helpful if it dealt with 
policy and goals, rather than specific objectives and tactics. 
The Workshop members recommended that ... the Ministry for 
the Environment be urged to consider the merit of initiating a 
1979-like representative meeting to consider if it is worth 
maintaining, reviewing and updating the 1979 policy on High 
Country. The outcomes of this workshop could be of 
international interest. However, the questions of politics, 
ownership, and relevance must not be overlooked. </p>

Countries (ICGAMC) was established as a non-governmental, 
non-commercial research institution. The main focus of this 
Centre is the study of hydrology and glaciology in the mountain 
massifs of Central Asia, namely, the Tien Shan, the Pamir, and 
the Altai. The Centre includes three research stations located 
around Almaty, the capital city of Kazakhstan, within an 
altitudinal range of from 2,300 to 3,500masl. The Centre invites

<p align=center><strong>THE SACRED ALTAI</strong></p>
<p align=left>The Altai is a mountain chain stretching from South Central Siberia into Western Mongolia, forming the boundary of Northern 
Sinkiang and sloping away into the Gobi Desert. Although similar in character to the Alps, the Altai cover a far greater area, 
extending from the Irtysh Valley eastward to the Sayan Range. The majority of this chain is located in Russia (Republic of 
Altai) and in Mongolia (Mongolian and Gobi Altai). The highest peak of this range is Mt. Beluha (4506 m).<br>
<br>
A quarter of the Republic of Altai is wooded and the most valuable tree species is cedar - -&quot;the Altai Taiga Tsar&quot;. The 
landscape of Altai is diverse and picturesque. Altai is a pra-motherland of the Altai language family which includes over 35 
Turk nations. Furthermore, three religions of the world - Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam - come together in this region. 
Shamanism is also widespread among the indigenous people.<br>
<br>
The Altai region has been a transitional area for many nations and tribes such as the Scyphs, Hunns, ancient Turks, and the 
Mongol warriors of Tenghiz-Khan. Towards the middle of the 19th Century, the Altai region became part of the Russian 
Empire. However, in the 20th century, Altai became an autonomous unit of the Russian Federation under different names at 
different times, such as the Karakorum okrug (1920), the Oyrot oblast (1922), the Gorno-Altai oblast (19&#162;8?), and the 
Republic of Altai (1992).<br>
<br>
At present, the territory of the Republic of Altai is 92,000 sq.km. and the population is 200,000 (1995). The capital, 
Gorno-Altaisk, has a population of 46,700. The territory is weakly developed and the average population density is 2.2 pers. 
per sq.km. More than 70 percent of the total population live in the rural areas. The economic axis of the Republic is directed 
from north ( with the relatively developed foothill and lowland Altai Kray) to south ( with the marginal mountain regions of 
Mongolia) along the ancient caravan route of the Chuy Valley. Over 90 per cent of the Republic&#146;s budget is donated from the 
Federal budget. The industries are also economically weak.<br>
<br>
The Government and the Parliament (El Kurultai) of the Republic have, at present, been actively searching for the ways to 
transit to a sustainable development model and achieve a balance between economic growth and protection of the 
environmental and spiritual values of Altai. These issues will be discussed at the International Conference on &quot;Altai in the 
System of Sustainable Development of the Mountain Territories&quot;, which will take place in Gorno-Altaisk. For further details on 
the Conference, please contact Dr. Yuri Badenkov.	</p>

<p align=center><strong>A CALL FOR INNOVATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES</strong></p>
<p align=center><em><strong>&quot;All effective projects have emerged from and as a result of the organisation of women for collective action, which 
is required to confront powerlessness.&quot; </strong></em><strong>(Wignaraja 1990)</strong></p>
<p align=left>The principal objective of a development programme is to improve the quality of life and this is based on two elements: 
condition and position. The conditions of women&#146;s lives can be changed in a relatively short time span. They do not challenge 
the gender divisions of labour or women&#146;s subordinate position in society. Change in women&#146;s position, however, is a greater 
challenge, based on issues of power and control over resources. Meeting strategic gender needs helps women to achieve 
greater equality, alters existing roles, and thereby improves women&#146;s economic and social standing in relation to others.<br>
<br>
Mountain women themselves identify their practical needs related to their primary roles in family care, farm production, and 
community management. Planners, who are interested in addressing these same needs, find a unity of purpose with these 
priorities and claim to have a &#145;Women in Development&#146; programme. However, the more profound needs for equality cannot 
be met solely through the design and implementation of women&#146;s programmes along these lines. The capacity to confront the 
nature of gender inequality and women&#146;s subordination can only be fulfilled when the bottom-up struggle of women&#146;s 
organisations has been incorporated (Moser 1993). Only when both the practical and strategic needs of mountain women are 
addressed can governments and development agencies claim that they are meeting the challenge of achieving sustainable 
development in mountain communities.<br>
<br>
Over the past ten years, it has been seen that when women organise and participate as active subjects rather that as passive 
objects of development programmes, they can move from a condition of mere survival to one of sustainable development 
(Wignaraja 1990). Some examples of successful women&#146;s organisations are the Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW) 
in Nepal and the Self Employed Women&#146;s Association (SEWA) in India. Based on Gandhian principles, SEWA began as a 
trade union to deal with the total problems of poor women working in the informal sector. SEWA <br>
<br>
provides poor women with a support system not only in their workplace, but also in their homes. 2,100 members (in 1990) 
are organised into small groups, according to their livelihoods as vendors, home-based producers, and labourers, which elect 
their own leaders. (Wignaraja 1990).<br>

<p align=left>GEDNET Asia, initiated by ENGENDER, the Centre for Environment, Gender, and Development, Singapore, and sponsored 
by Canada&#146;s International Development Research Centre, is the result of an informal network of researchers working on 
critical issues related to the environment, gender, and development in the Asia/Pacific Region. <br>
<br>
Two of its key projects are located in mountainous regions. The &#145;Technology and Environment&#146; Project is based in Chiang 
Mai Province in Northern Thailand and focusses on the environmental impact and sustainability of gender-based weaving and 
dyeing in Northern Thailand. The &#145;Gender, Food, and Community-based Natural Resource Management&#146; Project, 
encompassing Nepal, Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland in India, Bhutan and Tibet, focusses on research into women&#146;s 
indigenous knowledge on the use of soils, plants, and animals to meet household needs and on women&#146;s role as resource 
managers and livelihood providers.<br>
<br>

<p align=left><strong>SOIL CONSERVATION AND UPLAND RICE SYSTEMS IN VIETNAM<br>
</strong><br>
In the upland areas of Vietnam, approximately 40,000 ha, in the hilly and mountainous landforms of the North, the Central 
High Plateau, and the eastern part of the South are under upland rice crops. The widespread view that this crop is a 
non-economic and unsustainable crop is, however, not shared by the highland farmers of this region. As a traditional crop, the 
indigenous varieties can withstand drought, low fertility, and low inputs by the highlanders who are part of the rural poor of this 
country. Moreover, substantial scope for improving the systems, with the potential yields far exceeding the present yields, 
exists.<br>
<br>
In terms of soil conservation and fertility, although soil loss was commonly higher than with other crops grown under similar soil 
conditions, intercropping with other crops such as black beans and soybeans is highly recommended on sloping land. Upland 
rice crops require almost zero inputs and the application of farmyard manure or mineral fertilizers showed no or little effect. 
These upland rice systems have proven to be sensitive to improvement measures. However, appropriate soil conservation and 
nutrient amendment measures could go a long way towards optimising the benefits of this crop.<br>
<br>
<strong>HET&#146;S SECOND PROJECT IN NEPAL<br>
</strong><br>
The Himalayan Environment Trust (HET) has initiated its second conservation project in Nepal by donating a micro-hydel 
project in Lo Mantang, Mustangbhot, in Northwestern Nepal to be operated by the King Mahendra Trust for Nature 
Conservation (KMTNC). In light of the fact that His Majesty&#146;s Government of Nepal (HMG/N) has recently decided to open 
this area to tourism, this project could be instrumental in reducing the dependence on forest wood. This project is also 
envisaged as a people&#146;s participatory project. HMG/N, through the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP), has 
contributed some funds and will be supporting the project to the maximum. Solar power experiments have begun in the area 
and, with the help of the recently-installed incinerator, ACAP is disposing of bio-degradable items. Initiatives such as this can 
help to minimise the adverse impacts of tourism and conserve the beauty of areas such as Mustangbhot.<br>
<br>
<strong>EASTERN HIMALAYAS - CORRIDORS AND CLIMATE CHANGE<br>
</strong><br>
Black Mountains National Park and Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan and Manas National Park in Assam, India 
exemplify the role that protected areas with corridors and transfrontier conservation can play in biodiversity conservation. 
Black Mountains National Park in Central Bhutan covers broad-leaved forests and alpine meadows. It encompasses a diverse 
variety of large protected areas with a wide range of altitude and habitat ranges and provides a corridor that leads to the Royal 
Manas National Park in southern Bhutan. The World Wildlife Fund for Nature has identified 449 species of birds in this 
combined area, and this number exceeds that of any other protected area in Asia. <br>
<br>
Manas National Park in Assam, India, constitutes a 2,900 km2 contiguous wildlife habitat in India and Bhutan. It has 22 
species of mammals listed in Schedule I of the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act of India and over 320 species of birds and is 
considered to be one of the high biodiversity areas of India. The park has also been a part of the Manas Tiger Reserve since 
1973. In the context of climate change, such a corridor can facilitate seasonal movements and dispersal of birds and several 
mammals and biota under the spell of climate change may migrate between these protected areas rather than across 
unprotected lands. <br>
<br>
However, in the context of connectivity, what kind of connectivity does these areas provide? Paucity of data; high rates of 
poaching; apprehension that corridors will lead to the establishment of smaller reserves; and the risk of spread of catastrophes 
such as predators, fires, and disease are some of the attendant criticisms and apprehensions with regard to corridor and 
transfrontier conservation.<br>
<br>
<strong>RANGELAND MANAGEMENT IN UPLAND BALUCHISTAN<br>
</strong><br>
Sustainability in the rangeland scenario is recognised to be difficult to define. The concept of rangeland sustainability can come 
true provided that there is adequate understanding of a number of factors and their interactions, such as ecosystem-level 
components and their interactions on temporal and spatial scales. The nature and magnitude of products that a society has to 
derive from a given rangeland must not be overlooked. Furthermore, a healthy balance among the different components of an 
ecosystem and an understanding of community dynamics, animal behaviour, nutrient cycling, and other rangeland dynamics are 
imperative. <br>
<br>
Baluchistan is the largest province of Pakistan, with an area of 34.5 million hectares. Livestock rearing constitutes a major 
source of livelihood. The upland regions of Baluchistan support 11.3 million sheep and 7.8 million goats. Increases in livestock 
population, along with harsh climatic conditions, have resulted in severe problems of over-grazing and deterioration of the 
natural vegetation. Due to the continuous grazing pressure, palatable plant species are declining and are giving way to 
inherently slow growing and less palatable woody vegetation. The above scenario provides an opportunity for the introduction 
of new suitable forage species. During winter, forage deficit in upland Baluchistan is a serious problem. It is, thus, imperative to 
introduce species that can provide ample forage during the time when other native plant species are dormant. <br>
<br>
<strong>DEGRADATION OF FARM LANDS IN SOUTH ASIA<br>
</strong><br>
FAO, UNDP, and UNEP estimate that the countries of South Asia, Iran and Afghanistan are losing at least 9.8 to 11 billion 
dollars annually as a result of losses resulting from land degradation on 43 per cent of the region&#146;'s total farmland. A high 
enough figure, this is still an underestimate because it measures only the on-site effects such as reduced agricultural production, 
while leaving off-site effects such as river silting, floods, and road damages. The types of degradation assessed by the above 
organisations, in a joint report, were soil erosion caused by water, wind, soil fertility decline, water-logging, salinisation, and 
lowering of the water table.<br>
<br>
Soil erosion caused by water was the most widespread, affecting 25 per cent of all agricultural land in the region. In many 
areas of sloping land, for example in Nepal, it is severe, causing permanent loss of the land&#146;'s productive capacity. It was also 
found that 43 per cent of the region&#146;'s total agricultural land suffered from one form of degradation or another. Of this, 31 
million hectares were severely degraded and 63 million hectares moderately degraded. The country worst effected was Iran 
with 94 per cent of agricultural land degraded, followed by Bangladesh (75 per cent), and Pakistan (61 per cent).<br>

<p align=left><strong>THE KATHMANDU DECLARATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE 
ECOHYDROLOGY OF HIGH MOUNTAIN AREAS<br>
</strong><br>
The International Conference on the Ecohydrology of High Mountain Areas, held in March 1996 in Kathmandu, Nepal, was a 
joint initiative of UNESCO, ICIMOD, the German IHP/OHP, WMO, and DHM. The conference attracted the attention of 
scientific communities and decision-makers at the global level and within the Asia/Pacific region. The participating scientists 
highlighted regional issues in ecohydrology such as data collection and information systems; atmostpheric, hydrologic, and 
ecological interactions; water-induced hazards of erosion; and sedimentation and landscape processes.<br>
<br>
<strong>MEETING OF THE ICSI WORKING GROUP ON HIMALAYAN HYDROLOGY<br>
</strong><br>
A four-year Working Group on Himalayan Glaciology was created by the International Commission on Snow and Ice (ICSI) 
during the IUGG General Assembly in Boulder in 1995. The objective was to bring together specialists in glaciology from the 
Himalayan countries along with some experts from outside, with experience in Himalayan conditions, in order to summarise the 
current state of knowledge of snow and ice sciences in the region. A group of 13 was identified and the first meeting was held 
at ICIMOD in March 1996. The Working Group proposed the production of a report in the International Association for 
Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) Red Book format by mid-1998 on the present state of knowledge of glaciers in the Himalayas. 
At the Kathmandu <br>
meeting, the group resolved to identify available baseline data and to recommend free exchange of such data between 
scientists living in the Himalayan countries.<br>

<strong>INTERNATIONAL GEOSPHERE BIOSPHERE PROGRAMME (IGBP) BIOSPHERIC ASPECTS OF THE 
HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE (BAHC)-GLOBAL CHANGE IN TERRESTRIAL ECOSYTEMS (GCTE) 
/START-SASCOM WORKSHOP ON &quot;GLOBAL CHANGE IMPACTS ON MOUNTAIN HYDROLOGY AND 
ECOLOGY&quot;<br>
</strong><br>
This workshop is considered to be a reaction of the IGBP scientific community to the UNCED Agenda 21, Chapter 13: 
Managing Fragile Ecosystems - Sustainable Mountain Development (the &quot;Mountain Agenda&quot;). It was held in ICIMOD and 
was convened by Dr. A.Becker, Vice Chair of the BAHC Scientific Steering Committee and Dr. H. Bugmann for GCTE, 
both from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research (PIK), Potsdam, Germany. As intended, a draft work plan 
(research programme proposal) was prepared and approved by the workshop participants, and this is soon to be published . 
Some of the suggested research activities included study of the altitude-specific interrelations between socioeconomic 
conditions and ecological and hydrological characteristics required to develop concepts for sustainable mountain development 
and study of hydrological and ecological processes and interactions along altitudinal gradients in mountain areas dependent 
upon land surface characteristics.<br>
