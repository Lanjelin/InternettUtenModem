<p align=center><font color="#008000"><font size=4><b>Mountain Farming Dilemma</b></font> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Given the limited area and low fertility of their land and the increasing population, mountain farmers are finding it increasingly 
difficult to sustain their livelihoods on the basis of cultivating their own land and are looking for other options. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">It may be true that without the present level of mountain agricultural research and new agricultural technologies, the poverty of 
mountain farmers would have been worse, but it is also true that this &quot;greening&quot; has benefitted only a few, and in selected 
areas. The concern then, over who in the mountains has gained from agricultural research, becomes even more important as 
the composition of the poor changes. Among the rural poor today, we find smallholders, marginal farmers, and, of course, 
countless landless agricultural labourers. </font></p>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td><font color="#008000"><b><i>Wage labour is replacing 
subsistence agriculture; but, in a 
sense, both are subsistence because 
they provide no more than a 
hand-to-mouth existence at most</i></b></font><b> </b><p><font color="#008000"><b><i>Agricultural researchers have so 
far not taken into account the 
impact of their recommendations 
on the diverse ethnic environments 
and demographic circumstances of 
mountains as they do for specific 
agroclimatic regimes. </i></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#008000"><b><i>Rapidly increasing demands 
caused by the fast growth in 
human and livestock population in 
mountain areas are likely to 
threaten all efforts towards 
sustainability of mountain 
agriculture both ecologically and 
economically</i></b></font> </p>
</td><td><font color="#000080">Today, although mountain agricultural research institutions have fully recognised the 
importance of employing different methods for different agroclimatic zones, they have 
failed to understand that different strategies are also required to match the needs of big 
farmers, smallholders, marginal farmers, and the landless. It is a different task, and 
probably a harder one, to steer the benefits of agricultural research towards smallholders 
and labourers. Today, although mountain agricultural research institutions have fully

task, and probably a harder one, to steer the benefits of agricultural research towards 
smallholders and labourers. </font><p><font color="#000080">One also finds the contradiction that managing food security and overcoming poverty is 
more important to the mountain communities than the concern for environmental 
conservation, while public interventions give higher priority to the latter. This may be the 
`heart of the mystery' of the unclear flow of benefits of farm research to mountain farmers. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The sustainability of mountain agriculture has two dimensions; one ecological and the 
other economic. Case studies, commissioned by ICIMOD, have revealed that successes 
are largely associated with the consideration for and failures with disregard for mountain- 
specific conditions, both physical and socioeconomic. This means that both the nature of 
opportunities available and the types of constraint that are operative have to be 
understood. Opportunities in mountain environments are manifested by diversity, 
comparative advantages, and adaptation mechanisms, while the main constraints are 
inaccessibility, fragility, and marginality.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000080"><i>The educational institutions located in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) Region were reviewed extensively by 
ICIMOD during the period 199295. These institutions appear to have the following common organisational and 
operational problems. </i></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#000080"><strong><i>Educational institutions were organised on the pattern of relatively successful and older institutions in the 
plains. Their organisational structure and curricula emphasise crop production under irrigation. Efforts to 
reorient towards the specific needs of mountain agroecosystems have been limited, ad hoc, and poorly 
supported. </i></strong></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><strong><i>Agriculture in mountain areas is based on integrated croplivestock-agroforestry farming systems in which 
supportlandfarmland energy flow is an integral process. But the curricula are based more on the 
monoculture of individual commodities - some food but mostly cash crops. Horticulture and pastoral 
management, which are very important in mountain areas, are generally neglected in the curricula. </i></strong></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><strong><i>Because of the fragility of the mountain environment, sustainable use of the resource base is vital for the 
growth of agriculture in these areas. Adequate emphasis is not given to integrated management and 
sustainable harvesting of natural resources. </i></strong></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><strong><i>Linkages among research institutes, extension organisations, and the public sector development agencies 
are often weak. These institutions have confined themselves to oncampus teaching and thesisoriented 
academic research. As a result, they have little contact with the agricultural community and are, therefore, 
not necessarily involved in finding appropriate solutions to serious problems. </i></strong></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><strong><i>In most cases, there is very little interaction with the farmers, resulting in serious adverse consequences on 
the quality, relevance, and usefulness of the knowledge imparted. </i></strong></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><strong><i>Funds are insufficient to carry out effective research and outreach programmes. </i></strong></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>It is difficult to argue that universities based in mountain regions should focus on mountain relevant subjects only, 
as the opportunities and outlets to absorb their product with such specific skills may be very limited. However, 
concerned agencies can begin to provide &quot;mountain agricultural development modules&quot; in the general agricultural 
curriculum, especially in those organisations located near or in mountain areas. In the context of conventional 
mountain agriculture, mountain-specific conditions have not been given sufficient weight by agricultural R &amp; D, 
which explains our poor understanding of them. </b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In the context of conventional mountain agriculture, mountain-specific conditions have not been given sufficient weight by 
agricultural R &amp; D, which explains our poor understanding of them. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In more successful initiatives, such as those taken at the Lumle and Pakhribas agricultural centres in Nepal and in Himachal 
Pradesh in India, mountain specificities have played a key role in determining choices of technology. These experiences 
highlight the need to identify problems carefully, get feedback from the farmers themselves, and give appropriate institutional 
back-up to address these issues. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The important question is how do we ensure food security and cater to the other needs of a growing number of people 
sustainably; without destroying the environment and limiting the options for future generations? While there may be many other 
obstacles to making this transition, a more serious problem appears to be in the lack of knowledge and skills required to bring 
about the needed changes. While different agencies have crucial roles to play, the main challenge lies for research and 
education systems, to determine the type of technological options as they are responsible for the development of human 
resources capable of bringing about the changes needed for sustainable mountain agriculture. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Among other factors, mountain agriculture has suffered from neglect and this has led to the current crisis. To overcome the 
damage caused by past neglect, systematic and foccussed effort is necessary. And education and research are probably the 
best area to start such efforts. Without sound investment in people, research, and in the application of the lessons learned, the 
problems faced by mountain farmers will not be solved. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i>Although considerable diversity is seen in the organisational patterns of farm research institutions in the HKH Region, 
they do have some common characteristics. These are summarised below. </i></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Most research institutions devote most of their efforts to field crops, especially cereals, wheat, maize, and rice, 
and, in some cases, potatoes. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Research is limited mainly to higher yielding varieties responsive to external management inputs and not on 
further developing traditional systems and practices. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Research on livestock management, fodder production, pasture management, horticultural crops, and 
agroforestry, especially as components of an integrated farming system, is often not included in the research 
agenda of these institutions. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Most research is limited to biological and agronomic aspects, and there is very little research on sustainable use 
of the resource base, soil conservation, and socioeconomic aspects. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Most research institutions in the region almost entirely neglect post-harvest operations - processing, storage, 
and marketing aspects - which result in sizeable losses of perishable produce and great differences in 
commodity prices. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Very little attention has been given to addressing gender-specific problems. Strong biases against women are 
seen in faculty, research and extension. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Research strategies do not pay attention to optimising the farm incomes from smallholdings through the 
sustainable use of natural resources. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Periodic review of mandates, organisational and management structures, perspective plans, research 
programmes, and interinstitutional linkages is rarely carried out. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Specially designed training facilities for developing human resources for mountain agriculture are lacking. </i></font></li>
<li><font color="#000080"><i>Most R &amp; D institutions are underfunded. Adequate and appropriate resource allocation is necessary for 
effective research in and development of relevant technologies.</i></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000080">If we talk about biotechnology and genetic engineering, we are also discussing ownership of policies and projects by 
stakeholders, the need for better understanding of social cohesion, and accountability and empowerment of the marginalised, 
such as women and small farmers. All of these have become as relevant for sustainable mountain agriculture as in other areas 
of development. Biotechnology and genetic engineering alone will not solve the problems of mountain agriculture. Stakeholders 
must be able to participate in the design and implementation of the policies and programmes to be carried out in their areas and 
on their land. Also essential is the empowerment of marginalised groups such as women and other poor farmers. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Research and education need to be integrated because educational skills relevant to specific mountain situations depend upon 
the ability of experts to examine problems and potential of mountain areas. Farmers themselves should be involved in both the 
teaching and research functions and their perceptions may be reflected both in the curricula as well as the research agenda. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Institutions need sufficient funds to acquire proper laboratory, library, and farm facilities to undertake research programmes. 
Because of the relative isolation of mountain areas, mandatory adequate support to professionals working in these institutions is 
essential in order to retain them and keep morale high. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">ICIMOD has actively been trying to identify strengths and weaknesses in the national agricultural education and research 
institutions in the HKH. In this context, it organised a <b>Regional Consultation on Education and Research for Sustainable 
Mountain Agriculture </b>in January, 1996, in Kathmandu. The consultation provided a platform for sharing experiences, 
discussing common concerns, and identifying areas for action at national and regional levels. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">The gathering also identified gaps in mountain agri-education and research. Priority areas for human resource development, 
training, and research were identified in the context of building institutional capacities. It was thought that<b> institutional 
marginality within the national context, could be overcome by creating a mechanism for regional 
cooperation/alliances. </b>The priority areas identified for regional cooperation included human resource development for 
reorientation of farm education and research to suit local farming conditions and facilitate exchange of knowledge and 
experiences among countries. The recommendations listed below were made for follow-up by institutions, national 
governments, and ICIMOD. </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#000080">Developing and refining sustainable mountain agricultural concepts vis a vis agricultural research and education </font></li>
<li><font color="#000080">Strengthening of institutions to improve human resources in order to carry out necessary changes in education and 
research. This can be achieved by establishing internship/sabbatical leave for in-service training and specially designed 
short training summer schools in sustainable mountain agriculture. </font></li>

understand or involve the farmer who is the ultimate 
beneficiary of these activities, then the value of such 
teaching and research becomes questionable.</i></b></font></font></td><td><ul>

mountain agriculture for the undergraduate and post-graduate 
levels and support to improve lead /focal point education and

<p><font color="#000080">Institutional strengthening initiatives focussing on human resource development in agricultural planning, education, research, and 
extension within various provincial institutions have begun in Tibet. Efforts have been made to strengthen capacities of the Tibet 
College of Agriculture and to establish a Mountain Agriculture Faculty to run specialised courses in pastoral management. 
Under the Tibet Fellowship Programme, sponsored by ICIMOD, young Tibetan in-service scientists are being given an 
opportunity to work towards M. Sc and Ph D degrees in the highland agricultural issues of Tibet. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">In pursuance of the above-stated recommendations and also to address the issue at the regional level, ICIMOD will continue 
dialogue with national agricultural and education institutions of the HKH countries and formulate a regional programme for 
reorientation of education and research for mountain agriculture. In addition, it will aspire to bring together mountain 
agricultural research and education policy makers of the HKH region to share their perspectives and find common sulutions 
and also disseminate mountain agricultural development information as widely as possible. </font></p>
