<P>
<B>Diversity</B> -  The region is unique because of its great variety of environmental conditions, which is reflected in its
<P>
<UL>
<LI>      ecological diversity,
<LI>      biological diversity,
<LI>      cultural diversity, and
<LI>      institutional diversity.

<P>
<B>Opportunities</B>-The mountains provide a "niche" or opportunity for development in which they have comparative advantages. Examples of such opportunities are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>     hydropower
<LI>     tourism
<LI>     vegetable seeds and off-season vegetables
<LI>     horticulture
<LI>     medicinal plants and other high-value products
</UL>
<P>
<B>Human Resources</B> - The people of the region are its strongest asset. Despite cultural, ethnic, and institutional diversity they have coped with the harsh environment by developing mountain-specific adaption mechanisms for their technologies, community-based natural resources' management systems, and traditional practices of ethno-engineering and indigenous knowledge systems.
