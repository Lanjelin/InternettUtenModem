pleasure for us presenting you the latest innovation in our
hotel. We are proud to be the first Art Space Hotel of its kind.
Barious paintings and sculpture from Mr. Rolf A. Kluenter can be
visited all over the hotel in a parmanent exhibition.</p>

<p><b>The Artist:</b></p>

<p>German by birth, Rolf A. Kluenter received his higher
education at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Dusseldorf. A
grant for a field study on religious art brought him to Nepal in
1980. He has remained ever since. What's more he has been
exhibiting his work consistently both in Europe (Switzerland,
Germany, Belgium, Holland) and in Nepal. Kluenter also has
lectured for several years at the Tribhuvan University in
Kathmandu and started the first Animation Film Production project
in Nepal beside spearheading other painting projects in Belgium
as well as here. Current projects include also a limited serie of
Klueters personally autographed designs on silk ties and scarfs.</p>

<p><b>Puzzle:</b></p>

<p>Rolf A. Kluenter has been using puzzle shapes as a motif in
his paintings since 1995. The shapes themselves seem to be freely
floating through space, some receding and others advancing into
the foreground. Thre is no hint what the completed puzzle may
look like.<br>
A longside the paintings titled puzzle on handmade paper, the
artist has also done a series of three-dimensional painted
objects on clay. These comprise groups of puzzle shapes that,
again, do not fit together. It is only the space between them
that defines the constellation as a unit.</p>
