<p><strong>Ladies and Gentlemen,</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Nepal and to this conference on 
Non Governmental Organisations and TB control.</p>
<p>All over the world, NGOs and governments in developing countries are waking 
up to the fact that TB is the number one killer of their adult population, and that it 
inflicts an enormous burden of suffering and disease. Many of them are now 
realising that urgent steps have to be taken if TB is to be controlled.</p>
<p>It is now two years since His Majesty's Government of Nepal revised the TB 
control strategy, and adopted a policy of Directly Observed Treatment, Short 
Course or DOTS. Last year we began to implement this policy, and already we 
have seen excellent results. Based on this experience we are now expanding 
DOTS in Nepal, and plan to cover the whole country by the year 2000.</p>
<p>However, we recognise that, on our own, we will be unable to defeat TB. It will 
take the combined efforts of government health workers, the community, Non 
Governmental Organisations and the private sector to successfully fight this 
terrible disease. </p>
<p>That is why I believe this conference is so important. Many of you here are from 
NGOs from all over the world. You are all involved in TB control, and you bring 
a wealth of experience. As you share these experiences and discuss issues of 
mutual concern, you will be learning together. You will be learning about the 
many different ways NGOs are involved in fighting TB. You will learn about the 
different problems and constraints you face. You will discuss ways of overcoming 
these problems, and improving your effectiveness. This can only be of great value 
to the communities and individuals that you work with and serve. </p>
<p>I am particularly pleased that this conference is taking place in Nepal. The 
National Tuberculosis programme in Nepal has a long history of co-ordination 
and co-operation with NGOs involved in TB control. I trust that the lessons we 
have learnt here will be of value to you, and that you will leave this conference 
with new ideas, with even greater commitment to TB control, and with an 
appreciation of the beauty of our country.</p>
<p>With these few words I declare this conference officially open. </p>
<p><em>Thank you </em></p>
