TOWN</u></b><b> </b></font></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Namaste and greeting - My name is Ria Grant.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>I am from Cape Town in South Africa and it is a great honour for me to have been given the 
opportunity to discuss <b><i>TB Control in Deprived Communities. </i></b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>South Africa's TB epidemic, like yours, is one of the worst in the world. The incidence is 700 
new cases per 100&#160;000 per annum and is approximately 50 times higher than a country like the 
USA. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Asia has the highest number of TB patients but in the Western Cape we have the highest 
incidence. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The AIDS epidemic is magnifying the TB scourge. In 1995 about one in every four people who 
developed TB did so because they were HIV+. At least half of all new cases are contagious and 
will spread the disease to an average of ten other people every year.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Without effective management the number of TB cases in South Africa is expected to quadruple 
over the next ten years.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Of all the cases of TB treated in South Africa 31% occur in the Western Cape Province. In the 
deprived communities of the Western Cape, those areas with the poorest housing, education and 
lowest level of income: it has been shown that 1 in 3 houses has had a case of TB in the last 10 
years.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>The reason for the rise in TB notifications in the Western Cape over the last 10 years is uncertain 
but could be related to:</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size=3><b><i>a unique urbanisation process </i></b>over the past two generations which has seen 700000 
persons move from what were termed the native homelands (rural areas) to Cape Town;</font><font size=2> </font>&#160;</li>
<li><font size=3><b><i>poor health infrastructures in the rural areas </i></b>which force seriously ill patients to seek 
medical assistance in the City;</font><font size=2> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>the result of an <b><i>infrastructure which encourages the reporting of TB. </i></b></font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size=3>Policies to control tuberculosis in South Africa have been in operation ever since Act 36 of the 
Public Health Act was promulgated in 1919.</font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b><u>SUGGESTED TB CONTROL MECHANISMS FOR DEPRIVED COMMUNITIES </u></b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>I would like now to put forward some proposals for the control of TB in deprived communities 
and to relate these to my own experiences in combatting TB in Cape Town over the past 30 
years.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>There are <b>TWO </b>fundamental control strategies:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font size=3><b>[I] PRIMARY CONTROL ie the PREVENTION strategies</b></font><font size=2> </font><font size=3><b>and <br>
[ii SECONDARY CONTROL ie the CURE and CURE SUPPORT 
strategies.</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3><b>[i] PRIMARY CONTROL</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The long term control strategy in any deprived community must be toward </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>a] <b>a raising of basic standards of living; <br>
</b>b] <b>nutrition education; and <br>
</b>c] <b>general health education. </b></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Until the socio economic status of the deprived classes of Cape 
Town and any other place in the world is improved, particularly 
in respect of housing and nutrition, concerned health officials must 
continue to strive to secure such relief in these three areas.</font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>d] <b>Immunisation</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Specific protection of up to 80% of previously unexposed persons can be obtained by means of 
immunization with BCG vaccine. In Cape Town this is routinely given at birth.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Financial and manpower resources are clearly cardinal in the effective primary control of TB.</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>[ii] SECONDARY CONTROL </b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>I propose the following key strategies in secondary control of TB ie in <b><i>the cure and cure 
support phase:</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>a] <b>Early Diagnosis</b><br>
b] <b>Effective treatment (DOTS) </b>- which in itself can be categorised into 
hospital and clinic treatment and community based treatment .<br>
c] <b>Social support which comprises</b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>i. <b><i>Counselling </i></b>of patients</font><font size=2> <br>
</font><font size=3>ii. <b><i>Development </i></b>of the Individual</font><font size=2> <br>
</font><font size=3>iii. Patient <b><i>Incentive </i></b>Schemes</font><font size=2> <br>
</font><font size=3>iv. <b><i>Financial support </i></b>of patients</font><font size=2> </font></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>d] <b>An integrated National TB Control Programme.</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3><b>DIAGNOSIS</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Efforts to diagnose cases of tuberculosis as early as possible are directed mainly at those groups 
in the community most likely to be affected, namely those who have been in contact with known 
cases and those who have suspicious symptoms.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>In Cape Town suspects are referred to the City Health Department by many different health 
services, private and public.</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b><i>Contacts </i></b>- comprise the second most important high risk group.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Routine annual mass X-ray screening, a key strategy of former years, is no longer encouraged in 
Cape Town. The emphasis is now placed on pre-employment screening and focussed checks on 
high risk groups.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>The case finding yield per hundred thousand X-rays is relatively small and in the year ended June 
1995 only 7 cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis were discovered out of 3926 examinations.</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>TREATMENT</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Hospital and clinic treatment. </b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Hospital and clinic treatment still provides the cornerstone of TB treatment though this is 
changing. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>In Cape Town the majority of patients receive a 6 month course (5 days per week) of 
chemotherapy, administered under supervision on an out&#173;patient basis. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Every possible step to retain the patient as a functioning member of society needs to be taken 
throughout the treatment period. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Hospitals</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The Provincial Hospital Services play a role in the diagnosis, hospitalisation, treatment of patients 
and in the training of health personnel. Staff at these hospitals and related institutions often provide 
support and consultation for those in the field and in the management of difficult cases. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>There are <b><i>TWO </i></b>TB hospitals in Cape Town:</font></p>
<p><font size=3>1. The <b><i>Brooklyn Chest Hospital </i></b>[a Government hospital] caters for patients who are too ill to 
be treated as out-patients and serves the whole region. </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>It can accommodate 90 females, 157 males and 56 children. <br>
Patients are hospitalised for a minimum of 2 months. <br>
Many of the children have TB Meningitis. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3>2. The <b><i>DP Marais SANTA Centre </i></b>[managed by SANTA and subsidised by the Government] 
caters for ambulant patients whose home conditions would not be conducive to their treatment 
-[homeless people], retreatment defaulters who are not compliant often alcohol and drug abusers 
and multi-drug resistant cases. </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Patients are hospitalised for 6 to 8 months.<br>
They have 178 male beds and 60 female beds. <br>
They do not accommodate children.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3><b>The Local Authority Health Services</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The executive function of rendering comprehensive health care services is in the process of being 
delegated to the Local Authority. The head of the Local Authority Health Service has a wide area 
of responsibilities of which the control of <b><i>communicable diseases </i></b>and especially <b><i>tuberculosis 
</i></b>is one of the most important. This person is responsible for the organisation of the services and is 
accountable not only to the public via the respective council, but also to the <b><i>Director General of 
National Health.</i></b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Community Health Centres </b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>1. Local Authority Community Health Centres number 54. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>These facilities support a total of approximately ................ patients. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Community Based Treatment </b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Many of the people in the deprived communities do piece work. This entails having to leave their 
homes very early in the mornings to stand by the road side where contractors pick them up for 
the day, if they are lucky. They return late in the afternoon after the clinics have closed. This 
results in poor treatment compliance. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>A TB caseholding project initiated by CHASA (Community Health Association of Southern 
Africa) aimed at improving the compliance rate of patients has been implemented in our region. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The project is a departure from the traditional medical model of TB treatment and involves the 
community, NGO's and the health providers as equal partners. The collaboration of all these 
different players has led to the formation of the &quot;TB Alliance&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>It is a DOTS project. Patients are given the opportunity of receiving their treatment in the 
community, workplace, school, creche or at the clinic. This means that patients can negotiate to 
receive their treatment at a time and place convenient to them. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>In order that patients receive treatment in the community, lay volunteers are selected and trained 
to administer TB treatment. These 'treatment supervisors' receive incentives based on the number 
of patients they supervise. They are allocated up to 10 patients each. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>This project was implemented in 1994. It has proved to be a valuable control to the TB Control 
programme and the benefits to the community are numerous: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>it takes the reality of the TB problem into the community instead of it being perceived as a 
problem for the clinic staff; </font></li>
<li><font size=3>making treatment accessible to suit patient needs instead of having to abide by rigid clinic 
hours;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>capacity building community groups to be partners in managing TB control in their areas; </font></li>
<li><font size=3>by educating community people [treatment givers] about TB, nutrition, AIDS, alcohol and 
drug abuse creates a tremendous human resource potential; </font></li>
<li><font size=3>by reducing the caseload of the clinic sister this enables her to spend more time with 
problem TB cases, eg Multidrug resistant cases. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3>The <b><i>sunflower, </i></b>a symbol of life and vitality, illustrates the togetherness, upliftment and hope that 
the <b><i>TB Alliance </i></b>provides. The intertwined flowers represent the joint efforts of the three major 
players; non-government organisations, health providers and the community. For TB patients it is 
the promise of a healthier future. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b><u>Social support - Non Governmental organisations</u></b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Non governmental Organisations [NGO's] tend to complement and extend the functions of health 
services organised and funded as a result of legislation. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>They play an important role in: </font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size=3>increasing public awareness of the problem of tuberculosis, in health education;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>in mobilising support for tuberculosis patients and their families; </font></li>
<li><font size=3>in supervising TB treatment. SANTA administers residential centres (about 5000 beds) for 
tuberculosis patients<u>;</u></font></li>
<li><font size=3>providing useful models for working more closely with communities. </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size=3><b><u>TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE </u></b></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Social Work Intervention: Counselling &amp; Casework - Patient centred approach</b> </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>Social workers play a critical role in TB support. In my own organisation, a Cape Town 
based non&#173;Governmental Organisation known as TB Care Committee there are 4 social 
workers in attendance on a sessional basis at the Community Health Centres where they 
counsel TB patients. </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Patients are visited in their homes where their families are counselled about the importance 
of emotional support and encouragement and educated about tuberculosis and contact 
examinations. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3><b>Groupwork and Community Work</b> </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>This intervention addresses awareness programmes and skills training of patients. 
TB/AIDS Awareness programmes are conducted at schools and skills training groups eg 
sewing, shoe repairs and beadwork are run at various centres. Student Social Workers 
from one of the local Universities assist with these projects. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3><b><u>Patient Incentive Schemes </u></b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The incentive to patients to complete their programme of treatment is a key control strategy. In 
Cape Town we have the following patient schemes: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3><b><i>A &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; </i></b>- is a feeding scheme under which patients receive bread and soup 
or peanut butter when they attend the clinics for their daily treatment. An average of 1000 
adults and 400 children receive breakfast everyday from Monday to Friday. </font></li>
<li><font size=3><b><i>Childrens Food Parcels </i></b>- small parcels consisting of full cream milk, cereal, sugar and 
peanut butter are distributed monthly to the children on daily treatment. </font></li>
<li><font size=3><b><i>Food Vouchers </i></b>- in the TB Care Committee we provide support in the form of Food 
Vouchers. Adults who have been screened by the social workers and found to be destitute 
receive a monthly voucher of R50 [$....] This is conditional upon regular attendance for 
treatment and could thus be seen to be part of the incentive programme. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3><b>FUNDING</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The acquisition of funds is obviously a key issue for any organisation involved in the Control of 
TB in Deprived communities. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b><i>The TB Care Committee expended </i></b>R1 035 161 on TB Control for the year ended March 
1996. Our main source of funding is as follows: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>Government subsidies [75% of Social Workers' salaries are subsidised];</font></li>
<li><font size=3>Government grant for nutrition;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>Donations from the private sector. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3>The Health Departments are refunded in part by the Central Government for costs incurred in TB 
control. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Social Assistance</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The degree and extent of state assistance to TB patients will be a major factor in determining 
strategies for TB Control in deprived communities. In South Africa a very unfair system of social 
assistance prevailed in the pre-election era. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Members of the &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Coloured&quot; race groups were entitled to government disability grants 
while they were undergoing treatment. To qualify for this assistance they had to be deemed 
unable to work for 6 months. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The Black community on the other hand did not qualify as the criteria differed and they had to be 
declared unfit for 1 year. TB is supposed to be cured in 6 months therefore this category of 
patient did not qualify for social relief. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Married women did not qualify at all, regardless of their breadwinning status. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Unfortunately after years of crisis management the groups which qualified for social assistance 
have become so dependent on hand-outs of Government grants that they are not interested in 
helping themselves. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Developing TB has for some become an art. For many families the amount of money they receive 
from social assistance is more than they would be capable of earning. There is no advantage in 
being cured. This is not conducive to treatment compliance. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The discrepancies based on race and gender have now been rectified but the financial drain on 
the country's financial resources would be astronomical if every adult TB patient were given a 
monthly pension and every dependant was catered for. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>To this end the Government and NGO's are working at development projects which would 
improve patients' skill bases and earning capacities in an endeavour to eradicate the dependency 
on social assistance. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>In South Africa we have SANTA, a National Tuberculosis Association with branches 
country-wide. It is a well known NGO which has played a leading roll in the fight against TB 
through providing hospitals in rural areas, health education and material relief. My colleague will 
tell you more about their role. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>THE NATIONAL TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL PROGRAMME</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>In 1996 a new TB Control programme was launched by the Department of National Health, 
based on International (WHO and IUALTD) programmes and adapted to suit local conditions. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>This programme enables clinics to manage patient treatment effectively, to evaluate outcome and 
to assess service impact themselves according to standardised procedures. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b><i>DOTS: Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course </i></b>incorporates the following elements: </font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size=3><b><i>Direct observation </i></b>of patients as they swallow their medication; </font></li>
<li><font size=3><b><i>Patient-centred care; </i></b></font></li>
<li><font size=3><b><i>Microscopy Services; </i></b></font></li>
<li><font size=3><b><i>Measuring cure rates </i></b>- TB registers; </font></li>
<li><font size=3><b><i>Training of health workers.</i></b> </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size=3>It cannot be emphasised enough that adequate preventative measures, early aggressive treatment 
- especially of smear positive cases - and, most importantly, the attainment of patient compliance 
until cure are paramount in controlling this disease. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>The Conventional Biomedical TB Treatment Strategy</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The treatment and management of Tuberculosis in the conventional way, whether curative or 
preventative, has remained largely individualistic, focusing on the patient or person at risk 
[Andrews, Williams &amp; Kinney, 1988]. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The essentially individualistic nature of the treatment is thus maintained through clinic supervision, 
with little meaningful involvement by the patients themselves. Patients are expected to engage in 
behaviour adjustments related only to the demands for compliance without proper account of the 
socio-economic and larger structural issues affecting compliance. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>An Expanded Approach for effective Treatment of TB Patients</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>One must realise first of all that the disease is but one of many concerns for especially poor 
patients or at risk individuals. While practitioners may often not be able to conceive how people 
can allegedly not be concerned about their own health and that of their families, poor families will 
often make provision first for those perceived essential material needs. And if the disease is not 
perceived as immediately life threatening they will postpone or put off visits to doctors or clinics. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Secondly we must recognise that for the patient compliance is secondary to the person's overall 
goal to upgrade life. Non-compliance is likely if: </font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size=3>the medical regimen is complicated;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>takes a long time; </font></li>
<li><font size=3>requires major behaviour change;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>the provider agency is inefficient or inconvenient;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>the patient-provider relationship is not very close, and if the patient is dissatisfied with the 
relationship. </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size=3><strong>Compliance is likely if:</strong> </font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size=3>the patient believes the disease to be life threatening;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>believes himself/herself to be personally susceptible; </font></li>
<li><font size=3>therapy is efficient and painless;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>there is involvement of supportive personal networks. </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size=3>We need to make an assessment of financial, material, social and psychological problems. The 
sickness problem of the patients cannot be treated in a social, economic and political vacuum. 
Failing this realisation we will be sending patients back to the very conditions from which they 
come ie that gave rise to their sickness, non compliance and continued chronic sickness. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>It is necessary to establish and strengthen, where existing, the formal and informal support 
systems for communities excluded from helping networks for so long and to utilize these in our 
combat strategy. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Many of these tasks have to be performed by other professionals, assistants and community 
volunteers. The effective incorporation of these into our combat programmes can best be effected 
through a team work approach. </font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>CONCLUSION</b> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>It is to be hoped that the importance of &quot;Patient centred care&quot; will be recognised as one of the 
key elements in this National Control programme and that the patient and the community is 
included in all aspects. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>To effect cure, compliance is paramount. If one assumes that compliance is less than perfect in 
some cases, reasons for it would certainly lie at levels other than mere personal ones. People 
concerned about making life more tolerable amidst such destitution, as is often associated with 
tuberculosis, may be less concerned about compliance. This often includes socially deviant ways, 
such as alcohol and substance dependence, vagrancy and others. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Assessment needs to be made of the financial, material, social and psychological situations, as 
well as the nature of the support systems in such destitute communities. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The battle against tuberculosis has to be a joint effort between those working in health services 
[both formal and informal], researchers and funders, patients and the communities to which they 
belong. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The process of building a common vision and purpose among all who have a stake in it, is 
probably the most important ingredient of any strategy and structure designed to eradicate the 
epidemic. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>This is where the importance of the TB NGO's support could make the difference in this TB 
Control Programme. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>If you invest in a reliable, credible and accountable NGO then you as funders will be investing in a 
better world for everyone. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>In our African tradition we believe in &quot;Ubuntu&quot; - you need a person to be a person.</font></p>
