<p><font size=3><b>Dr Neil Hamlet<br>
</b><i>International Nepal Fellowship (INF)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>One approach to NGO involvement in TB control is to support the implementation of diagnostic 
and treatment services through the integrated primary health care infrastructure. Working with 
government health services brings it's own particular joys and sorrows, and Dr Neil Hamlet, 
director of the Tuberculosis Leprosy Project of the International Nepal Fellowship will share some 
of these with us. The TLP supports TB and leprosy control services in one of the most remote and 
disadvantaged regions of Nepal. How can an NGO support the government, without taking over 
completely? Should excellent services be compromised for the sake of sustainability? Dr Neil 
Hamlet will cover these issues and several others in this session. </font></p>

<p><font size=3><b>Mr Akramul Islam<br>
</b><i>Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee is widely recognised as one of the most 
experienced NGOs involved in community based rural development in South Asia. For many years 
BRAC has been involved in TB control, with an approach that is truly community based, involving 
female health volunteers. BRAC have recently seen an increase in this involvement as the revised 
NTP has expanded in Bangladesh, and continue to achieve remarkable results. But is this 
sustainable? Is TB control an expressed need of communities? What levels of support do volunteers 
need? Akramul Islam will present the experience of BRAC in community based TB control, 
highlighting some of the lessons learnt.</font></p>

<p><font size=3><b>Dr Klaus Jochem<br>
</b><i>Nuffield Institute for Health (NIH), UK</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The dynamics of health sector reform, changing priorities in health care, emerging and re-emerging 
diseases, and demographic and epidemiological trends, are all combining to change the shape of 
traditional disease control programmes. How will this affect TB control? What is the potential role 
of the private sector? How can NGOs and NTPs learn to develop closer links with the private 
sector? These questions, and others, will be considered by Dr Klaus Jochem of the Nuffield 
Institute for Health, Leeds University.</font></p>

<p><font size=3><b>Dr Bhawana Shrestha<br>
</b><i>German Nepal Tuberculosis Project (GENETUP)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The German Nepal TB Project is a joint initiative between the Nepal Anti TB Association and 
Kuratorium Tuberkulose in der Welte. GENETUP was the first organisation in Nepal to introduce 
DOTS, and has achieved remarkable results with an intermittent drug regimen. Their clinic is located 
in urban Kathmandu, where most of their patients come from. Dr Bhawana Shrestha will present 
their results, and describe some of the issues involved in providing services in an urban area.</font></p>

<p><font size=1><b>&#160;</b></font><font size=3><b><i>People On the Move; </i></b><b>TB Control in refugees</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Dr Santa Tamang<br>
</b><i>Save the Children Fund UK (SCF UK)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Nepal provides a temporary home for refugees from several countries, with the largest group of 
over 80,000 coming from Bhutan, and living in camps in the Eastern Region of Nepal. Save the 
Children UK is responsible for health care services in the camps, and has established an excellent 
TB control programme. As the number of refugees world-wide increases, TB is also a growing 
concern in this group of people. Dr Santa Tamang will describe the SCF programme and discuss 
some of the issues involved in providing TB control services to refugees.</font></p>

<p><font size=1><b>&#160;</b></font><font size=3><b><i>Centres of Excellence? </i></b><b>Hospital based TB Control</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Dr Andrew Edwards<br>
</b><i>United Mission to Nepal (UMN)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>TB control provides an excellent example of the interdependence of curative and preventive health 
care services in disease control. Prevention IS cure, and a good TB control service relies on a 
combination of diagnostic and treatment services. Historically, these have often been based at TB 
clinics or general hospitals, and in many countries these institutions continue to treat a large 
proportion of patients with TB. Cure rates are sometimes poor though - often because the hospital 
is unable to routinely follow up late patients in the community. Patan hospital is an urban district 
hospital run jointly by the United Mission to Nepal and the government of Nepal, and provides 
treatment for the majority of TB patients in the Lalitpur district. Dr Andrew Edwards will describe 
the treatment services at Patan, and show how good results can be achieved in a hospital with links 
into the local community.</font></p>

<p><font size=3><b>Ms Anne Horgheim<br>
</b><i>Norwegian Heart and Lung Association (LHL)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The Norwegian Heart and Lung Association began as (and still is) a patient&#146;s organisation to 
provide support for people with TB. Over the years, changing patterns of disease in Norway have 
led the organisation to expand it&#146;s area of concern, but it remains firmly committed to TB control, 
and supports activities in several developing countries. LHL is unusual in that it remains an 
organisation of patients - people suffering from a disease who have organised themselves to fight 
their disease. Is this a potential model for other countries? Are there similar models in developing 
countries? What can we learn from the experience of LHL? Ms Anne Horgheim has worked in 
Nepal and Norway, and will describe the work of LHL.</font></p>

<p><font size=3><b>Dr Ian Smith<br>
</b><i>United Mission to Nepal (UMN)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>The directly observed component of DOTS is perhaps the most contentious aspect of the revised 
strategy for TB control. Health workers and patients alike find it difficult to understand why 
someone has to supervise treatment. Is it necessary? Why supervise treatment? Who can supervise 
treatment? These and many other related questions will be dealt with in a presentation which will 
also include a look at some models for DOTS in developing countries. Come prepared to share 
your own experiences of DOTS!</font></p>

<p><font size=3><i>Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Tuberculosis is a disease of disadvantage and neglect. Governments (and many NGOs!) have 
neglected TB for far too long. Perhaps because TB is a disease of the poor and marginalised it has 
failed to attract the attention of policy makers. Perhaps too because it has been with us for so long; 
familiarity breeds - not contempt - but apathy. Both advocacy and health education are essential 
strategies to overcome this complacency and ignorance. Those in power need to know that TB can 
be controlled, and those without power need to know that it can be cured. The Voluntary Health 
Association of India has a long history of involvement in these areas and will describe the advocacy 
and education activities of the VHAI relating to TB control, highlighting some of the lessons learnt.</font></p>
