<p><font size=3>This is your opportunity to get it off your chest! Is there a burning issue that you feel needs to be 
discussed, and doesn&#146;t appear on the conference programme? Or perhaps you&#146;ve got a brilliant 
idea that you want to share? Or an experience that you feel is relevant? Whatever it is, please 
share it with us.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>At the conference we will have a speakers corner. This will be a 5 minute opportunity for 
people to stand up, say what they think, then sit down and wait for the reaction! Unfortunately 
you can&#146;t stand up in front of us and have your say. However, if you send us your thoughts by 
e-mail, we&#146;ll make sure that someone reads them out on your behalf, and we&#146;ll even keep a 
record of the response!</font></p>
<p><font size=3>And we&#146;ll post them on this page for everyone else to read!!</font></p>
<p><font size=3>So get thinking - be creative, be innovative, be radical. Then click on the button below - type in 
your ideas, and send them on to us. Couldn&#146;t be easier! </font></p>
