<p><font size=3>Tuberculosis is one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality world-wide<b>, 
</b>currently infecting a third of the world's population, and causing nearly 9 million new cases and 
3 million deaths each year. Developing countries bear the brunt of the epidemic, and the 
South/South-East Asia Region is particularly affected, with 40% of the world's TB cases 
occurring here.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>NGOs have a long history of involvement in TB control throughout the world<b>. </b>National 
anti-tuberculosis associations, international NGOs and national NGOs are active in TB control 
in many countries, with many different models of involvement. Their contributions are immense. 
The global strategy of TB control promoted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) known 
as Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) was first developed at a national level 
by an NGO - the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD) - in 
several countries in Africa and central America.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>As countries step up their efforts to control TB, the role of NGOs will become even more 
important<b>.</b> Achievement of the global objectives for TB control will need more NGOs to get 
involved in TB control. NGOs that are already involved in TB control will need to co-ordinate 
with NTPs, with the private sector, and with each other. Many countries are establishing such 
mechanisms of co-ordination, and NGOs are learning from each other. Each NGO is unique 
and many different models for NGO involvement in TB control can be found. There is a need to 
review the effectiveness, successes and problems of these different approaches. That&#146;s why 
we&#146;re having <font face="Wide Latin"></font></font><font color="#FF00FF"><font size=4>tbNET 97</font></font><font size=3>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Benguiat Frisky"><font size=5><b>What will <font face="Wide Latin"></font></b></font><font color="#FF00FF"><font size=4>tbNET 97<font face="Benguiat Frisky"></font></font></font><font size=5><b> cover?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>There will be three types of presentations and discussions. Each day will begin with a <br>
<b>&quot;</b></font><a href="SUMMIT.HTM" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/ngo-tb/summit.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><b>View from the Summit</b></font></font></a><font size=3><b>&quot;</b> - broad overview to set the scene. We will hear about the global 
TB situation, TB control strategies, and issues relating to co-ordination between NTPs, NGOs 
and the private sector. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Next we have<b> &quot;</b></font><a href="WAYS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/ngo-tb/ways.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><b>Ways and Means</b></font></font></a><font size=3><b>&quot;.</b> These consist of a series of in depth case studies from 
several different NGOs, representing a broad range of approaches and countries. The 
presentations will last for 60-90 minutes, and will look at the structure, process and outcome of 
each model of involvement in TB control; identifying problems and failures as well as strengths 
and successes. Please ask probing questions, and make observations from your own 
experiences.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>And finally <b>&quot;</b></font><a href="ISSUES.HTM" tppabs="http://www.south-asia.com/ngo-tb/issues.htm"><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><b>The Big Issues</b></font></font></a><font size=3><b>&quot;.</b> This series of presentations will focus on issues facing NGOs 
involved in TB control, for example <i>TB and HIV</i>, <i>Co-ordination with NTPs, Doing DOTS, 
TB in refugees, etc</i>. Topics will be introduced with short presentations, followed by group 
discussions. The final outcome will be a series of conclusions and recommendations, which 
together with the presentations, will be published as conference proceedings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Benguiat Frisky"><font size=4><b>How will <font face="Wide Latin"></font></b></font><font color="#FF00FF"><font size=4><b>tbNET 97<font face="Benguiat Frisky"></font></b></font></font><font size=4><b> be different?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>First, it is being held in a developing country. International awareness of the TB epidemic has 
led to a proliferation of TB related conferences - but most have been held in the West, and 
attended mainly by academics and researchers. This conference is being held in the developing 
world, in a region particularly affected by the TB epidemic, and is primarily for those directly 
involved in TB control as programme managers and donors.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Second, there will be two groups of participants - those who come to Kathmandu, and those 
who take part via the Internet. It will be the first &quot;on-line&quot; conference to be held from Nepal, 
and one of the first to be held in a developing country. During the conference, participants in 
other parts of the world will be able to down load presentations from this web page, and upload 
their own comments and contributions to the discussions.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Third, it is not an end in itself. The conference has two main purposes. The first is to discuss 
matters of concern to NGOs working (or planning to work) in TB control. The second is to 
establish a network of these NGOs, mainly for the South and South East Asia Region - but also 
including organisations from wider afield. This network will give participating organisations the 
opportunity to continue sharing experiences and to learn from each other for many years to 
come.</font></p>
