<p><font size=2><strong>&#160;<font face="Paddington"></font></strong></font><font size=4><strong><i>Tools for the fight; </i></strong><strong>Global TB Control Strategies</strong></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Professor Donald Enarson<br>
</b><i>International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD)</i></font></p>
<p><font size=3>Poor TB control programmes are an obscenity and an injustice. An injustice because TB is a 
disease which can be controlled, but insufficient and inadequate efforts are being made to do so. 
An obscenity because a poor TB programme is worse than having no TB programme, and 
actually increases the burden of suffering and disease.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>&#160;</font><font size=3>The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease was the pioneer in developing 
an appropriate control strategy for developing countries. Professor Don Enarson, Scientific 
Director of the IUATLD will describe this strategy, and highlight some of the issues involved in 
implementing good TB control, based on experiences in different countries around the world.</font></p>

<p><font size=4>&#160;<font face="Paddington"><strong><i>Building coalitions; </i></strong><strong>WHO and NGOs in TB Control</font></strong></font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>Mr Robert McDermott<br>
</b>World Health Organisation (WHO)</font></p>
<p><font size=3>From a small unit within WHO, the Global Tuberculosis Programme has expanded rapidly over 
the last few years, and has been instrumental in drawing attention to the desperate TB situation 
in many countries around the world. The declaration of a Global TB Emergency in 1993 led to 
increased awareness of the need to take immediate action against TB. Since 1996 WHO and 
IUATLD have been promoting World TB Day - an advocacy opportunity on a scale most 
countries have not seen in the past. Mr Robert McDermott of the Global TB Programme, will 
talk about the role of WHO and NGOs in raising awareness about TB.</font></p>
