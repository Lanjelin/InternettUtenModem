<p><font size=3><b>Abstract --</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>In Bangladesh, a country of 122 million people, there are an estimated 150,000 
new cases and 80,000 deaths from TB every year with a 2% annual risk of 
infection. The national TB records of BRAC and the government program suggest 
that only approximately 30% of TB patients being reported and receiving treatment 
are women. Prevalence and detection rates are lower for women, although among 
children below fifteen years of age the case detection and incidence rates are similar 
between the sexes. To explore reasons for <i>why</i> less women are being treated for 
tuberculosis, a study area was chosen where the BRAC TB Control Program has 
been in place since 1992, and data from 1995 and 1996 was analyzed with a focus 
on the age and gender distribution of TB patients. Next, six single-sexed focus 
group discussions were conducted with female TB patients, community members, 
and local health providers to get a sense of their perceptions of TB and treatment 
seeking behavior of women. Findings from the data analysis demonstrated that the 
chosen area was representative of the national TB statistics and the findings from 
focus group discussions showed that strong stigmas persist in the community 
including an openly stated fear and avoidance of TB patients. The implications of 
these stigmas and social beliefs are more severe for women and have a powerful 
impact on female treatment seeking behavior. Women tend to hide or ignore 
symptoms for fear the community or their family might find out - in general, married 
women fear they would be rejected by their husband and sent back to their father's 
home, while unmarried women fear that contracting TB would ruin their chance of 
marriage and bring shame to their family. The majority of participants believe that 
TB is hereditary and an infected woman will pass it on to her children. Participants 
agreed that women feel most comfortable going to locally based village doctors or 
traditional healers for health problems because they are familiar, accessible, and less 
costly. These findings highlight the crucial need to begin breaking down the 
persisting stigmas and myths of TB. There is a pressing need to initiate a 
collaboration with the village doctors and traditional healers in TB control efforts. 
Health providers should be made aware of these gender issues and receive training 
in assisting the patients with the social consequences of the illness in addition to the 
medical treatment for the disease. </font></p>
