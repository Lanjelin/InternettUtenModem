<p><font size=3><b>&quot;The Big Issues&quot;</b> focus on matters that concern us. These sessions begin with a short 
presentation from an invited speaker, followed by a time of discussion. A series of questions will be 
posed, and by the end of the session some recommendations will be developed. As well as views 
from participants at the conference, we will also include your responses received by e-mail from all 
over the world! </font></p>

<p><font size=3>NGOs and governments have complementary strengths and weaknesses. The ability of NGOs to 
act swiftly in times of need, to mobilise community resources, and to help communities identify their 
own needs and respond appropriately, is matched by the government's ability to mobilise extensive 
resources, and it's long term commitment to health care services. In this session we will hear from 
two speakers - Mr Elgin Saha, Director of HEED Bangladesh, and Dr Dirgh Singh Bam, Director 
of the Nepal National Tuberculosis Programme. Their observations, from two perspectives and 
two countries, will shed light on this area!. </font></p>

</font><font size=3><i>South Africa National Tuberculosis Association (SANTA)</i></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>People with TB often live at the margins of society. Health care services are frequently ill equipped 
to reach and support such people, and as a result, the people who need care the most, are least 
likely to get it. The TB Care Committee is a network of agencies working in TB control in South 
Africa. Ms Ria Grant will discuss this issue, and look at ways of overcoming barriers to care for 
deprived communities. Mr Aidan Keyes will describe the strategy now adopted in South Africa to 
fight TB, and the relationship between SANTA and the national government. </font></p>

<h3><font size=4><i>The Deadly Duet</i>; TB and HIV</font></h3>
<p><font size=3>As AIDS cases rapidly increase in Asia, many countries turn towards community and home based 
care for people with HIV and AIDS. The AIDS pandemic also has considerable implications for 
existing TB control programmes in Asia. AIDS and TB care strategies are closely linked, with 
people in the community and family providing care and support. The linkage is even stronger, as the 
two diseases are often found together in the same patient. To what extent then do treatment, care 
and support strategies for the two conditions relate?</font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p align=center><font size=3><b><i>Can planning for home and community based care of people with AIDS (PWA) learn 
anything from care of patients with TB, and vice versa?</i></b></font><font size=4> <br>

</font><font size=3><i>Britain Nepal Medical Trust (BNMT)</i></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The global target of a cure rate of 85% is still a distant dream for many programmes. However, 
there are several programmes which have managed to achieve this target, and are now looking at 
ways of increasing case finding as the next step. Britain Nepal Medical Trust are such an 
organisation, and have made attempts to find the &quot;missing&quot; patients in several remote hill districts of 
eastern Nepal. Dr Mohammed Akhtar, TB Co-ordinator of BNMT, will describe their 
programme, and the results they have obtained.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

</font><font size=3><i>Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC)</i></font><font size=4> </font></h3>
<p><font size=3>Analysis of case finding statistics in most developing countries shows that the majority of patients 
registered for treatment are men. This may be because women get TB less than men, or because 
they are denied diagnosis and treatment. The BRAC programme in Bangladesh works with female 
health volunteers, and is therefore well equipped to answer some of the questions relating to gender 
and TB. Ms Elizabeth Fair will present the results of their research, and discuss some important 
questions relevant to this topic.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

<p><font size=3><b>Mr Virendra Lal Karn</b></font><font size=4> <br>
</font><font size=3><i>International Nepal Fellowship (INF)</i></font><font size=4> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The declining prevalence of leprosy world-wide has led many organisations to reconsider the role 
of leprosy control programmes. With fewer patients to diagnose and treat, it will become more and 
more difficult to sustain such programmes. However, there will still be an ongoing need for leprosy 
control activities for many years to come, and for rehabilitation work for even longer. Many 
countries have combined their leprosy and TB programmes, whereas in others TB has been 
combined with other communicable disease control programmes, such as HIV/AIDS, or with 
Respiratory Disease Control. The previously independent INF TB and Leprosy projects were 
recently combined as one project in the Mid West Region of Nepal. Mr Virendra Lal Karn of the 
INF TB Leprosy Project will describe the process, and identify some of the issues involved.</font><font size=4> </font></p>

<h3><font size=4><i>What's On Your Mind?</i> Free Session</font></h3>
<p><font size=3>This is your opportunity to discuss an issue that you feel hasn't been dealt with properly yet. What 
about multi-drug resistant tuberculosis? Or issues of sustainability and funding for NGO 
programmes? We received many ideas for topics to be discussed in the conference, but it would 
have taken a full week of meetings to cover all of them! During this session we will have two rooms 
available for participants to get together and discuss issues of their choice. You can join in too! 
Identify an issue and give us some of your ideas. We will announce it, and if there are other people 
interested then they will get together and come up with some difficult questions, interesting ideas, 
good discussion and profound thinking!</font><font size=4> </font></p>
