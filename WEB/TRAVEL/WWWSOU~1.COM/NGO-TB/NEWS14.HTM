<p><font size=5><b>Yesterday&#133;</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>We began our second day of tbNET with two remarkable and complementary presentations. 
Professor Donald Enarson gave us a birds eye view of TB control around the world - both in the 
present and from the past. The falling prices of drugs (capitalism doesn't always work for 
capitalists!) and the improvements of TB control programmes in some developing countries are very 
encouraging - but there is still a great deal of work to be done. An example of how this work can 
be conducted in a community based TB control programme was then presented to us by Akramul 
Islam of BRAC, which works in partnership with the government of Bangladesh, and provides TB 
control services though a network of female community health volunteers. Issues of sustainability 
and co-ordination with the government featured in the discussion that followed.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size=5><b>&#133;and Finally</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>An interesting mix of presentations to finish off tbNET97! We begin with Bob McDermott from the 
advocacy unit of the WHO Global TB Programme, challenging us to think more about the role of 
advocacy in TB, in a world of dwindling resources for disease control. A related challenge to our 
current thinking will come from Klaus Jochem, of the Nuffield Institute for Health. Klaus will discuss 
the relationship between NGOs, government programmes, and the private sector, in an era of health 
sector reform.</font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>We have two alternative presentations in the afternoon. First an issue of controversy! Should TB 
and Leprosy Programmes combine? Virendra Lal Karn of the INF TB Leprosy Programme will 
discuss this issue, based on experience in the Mid-west Region of Nepal. Or you can discuss TB 
control in urban areas with Dr Bhawana Shrestha from the German Nepal TB Project, based here 
in Kathmandu.</font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>We have two sessions to conclude tbNET97. First, what have we achieved? We will hear a brief 
report from each of the groups, with answers to the questions posed, and recommendations for the 
future. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>And the future is the topic in our final session. Where do we go from here? What is the future of 
tbNET? Can we link up as a network of interested organisations to share information and 
experiences? How can we build on our experiences of the last 3 days?</font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Please come ready to give your feedback about this conference and your ideas for the future. Let's 
get a vision for tbNET! </font></p>

<p><font size=5><b>Speaker's Corner</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>We heard from 2 speakers yesterday. Dr Wesley from India asked us to consider the role of NGO 
run institutions in TB control. Dr Kumar deputy director TB Centre told us about TB in the SAARC 
region, and made several interesting points such as the major role of the private sector in several of 
the seven SAARC countries - Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Today we will hear brief remarks from 2 people - Dr Agnes Gebhard, who comes from Holland, 
but works in Vietnam, will begin, and later in the morning we will hear from Dr Prakash Kumar Roy 
of World Vision, Bangladesh. </font></p>

<p><font size=5><b>Around the World</b></font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>We continue to receive comments and responses for our discussion questions from around the 
world Philippines, Ethiopia and the UK. Here are a few comments from AHRTAG:</font><font size=2> </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Dear friends - thanks for involving us in the conference - it is a pleasure to see such a participatory 
forum, and such a concern for working in a participatory way with marginal and disadvantaged 
groups, and collaborative work with government and NGOs. Gone are the days when the word 
'control' is appropriate for public health concerns! </font></p>
<p><font size=3>When researching materials for the recent AHRTAG publications on TB and HIV, and on children, 
we found very little on community based prevention and education, gender concerns, on tackling 
stigma associated with TB, and on integrating NGO roles with the need for adherence/follow-up. 
We look forward to finding out more from conference participants. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>We do hope our package of TB publications arrived, and that our partner HIAN in the Philippines, 
sent copies of the Asia Pacific edition. Please urge participants to contact us for extra copies. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>Best wishes</font><font size=2> </font></p>
