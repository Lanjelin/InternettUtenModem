<p><font size=3><strong><br>
Honourable Minister of Health, Colleagues , friends, </strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>I bring you greetings from the Director General of WHO, Dr H Nakajima and 
from the Regional Director for the South East Asian Region, and add my own 
personal welcome to Kathmandu. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>There are three reasons why it is auspicious for us to be meeting here in 
Kathmandu on this day. Firstly, it is auspicious that we should start this meeting 
on the day of the Nepalese festival that honours the Goddess Saraswati, whose 
greatest blessings are bestowed on learning and education. Secondly today is 
recognised as the first day of spring in Nepal. The third auspiciousness is that we 
should meet here in Nepal, the place where it can be said that the NGO 
originated. The &quot;Ghuthis&quot; or traditional self help co-operatives have served the 
people of Nepal and enabled them to serve each other for centuries. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Sadly though, I observe that many of these community organisations are being 
allowed to wither and die. This may be because development projects, and 
possibly even outside NGOs, have made them unnecessary. As a result, like so 
many things that no longer serve their purpose or are not used, they atrophy, and 
fall into dis-use. When their energetic people are taken away, they lose their 
momentum and cease to attract the attention of those they served and those who 
served them.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>I believe this highlights the importance of and the need for all of us to work with 
the people in a way that enables them to carry on, leaving them better able to 
achieve what they want to achieve. It points clearly to the importance of 
facilitating, of being a facilitator. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Soon after my return to Nepal 18 months ago, to take up my post as WHO 
Representative, having previously worked here for six years in the 1980's, I 
recorded some of my reactions to the experience. I observed that at least two 
changes are needed in the way we work, both within WHO, as well as at country 
level. They are;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><font size=3>a change from seeing &quot;money&quot; as the answer to development problems, to 
making much more effective use of the resources that are already available </font></li>
<li><font size=3>a change from providing answers from the outside,</font><font size=4> </font><font size=3>to enabling people to 
realise how much they have within their own experience and setting.. </font></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>It seemed to me at the time, that in much of development, unintentionally, people 
become dependent on outside resources and ideas. In their interactions with 
development agencies and people from outside, they begin to focus on how much 
they themselves lack. When they do this continuously, they lose their self-esteem 
and their self-confidence. This is particularly so with respect to the cultural 
traditions and traditional approaches, which indeed have enabled many 
communities to survive particularly difficult (if not impossible) conditions. These 
traditions and practices sometimes represent adaptations that have taken place 
over hundreds of years. They include adaptations in the ways in which 
communities relate with each other, make decisions and use available resources. 
These patterns have evolved in response to a particular context. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>I had seen many examples of foreigners moving into someone else's country, 
bringing answers to problems that come from the outsiders' own cultural context, 
and which may well have been very effective in that context. Although effective 
outside, they may not work as well in another setting. A sad consequence is that 
people forsake the values that have sustained them, letting go the principles on 
which their communities are based. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Because we have stopped validating peoples' inner strengths, we have presented, 
like good advertising agencies, the idea that people should want something else. 
In our haste, we forget to invest the time needed to validate what they already 
have and to encourage their use of it to gain what they need. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=4><b>What I am talking about is the need to be a 
FACILITATOR. This means enabling</b> others to understand 
what it is that they are trying to achieve, rather than <b>telling</b> them 
what it is that they should be doing.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>In the Intergovernment or International organisations, we often feel that the 
NGOs can do it more easily. However, at the same time I have noticed that it is 
harder for some to resist the urge to do the thing themselves rather than work 
with others, rather than enabling them to do it themselves, and so build the 
people's capacity.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Clearly we must work in partnership with others. Recent real success in Nepal 
with National Immunisation Days against Polio, have shown us how effective we 
can be when we work with others. It is a tribute to partnerships and effective 
leadership amongst people in Government, Non-Government, Service, Political, 
and Community organisations. We were shown by our own Minister of Health 
how important personal effort and leadership can be in motivating people at all 
levels to work with each other and get things done. <b>IF WE CAN DO IT ON 
ONE DAY FOR POLIO, WE CAN DO IT ON OTHER DAYS FOR 
OTHER THINGS. </b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Concerning Tuberculosis, you all know much more about TB than I do, but I am 
concerned that frightening figures remain; with a third of the world's population 
infected, 90 million expected to become sick in next 10 years. Yet there are 
exciting prospects from the DOTS approach, with its guarantee of cure, and the 
prospect that its widespread use can reverse the epidemic.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>But let us not forget that TB is a disease of the poor and undernourished. Let us 
use the success of DOTS to reach out and advocate for action in the areas that 
influence the spread and control of TB, nutrition, women's health, environmental 
health, HIV/AIDS, and the people's information about the need for proper 
treatment. This links with the need to promote literacy.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Let us also celebrate the co-operation and team work, between Government and 
NGOs, between organisations and the people, between countries, and between 
the rich countries and the poor countries.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=3>Allow me to close by wishing you well for the next three days and quoting a wise 
man from our neighbour to the north, China, where Lao Tzu, in the 5</font><sup><font size=3>th</font></sup><font size=3> century 
BC said ; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font size=4><i>&quot;Imagine that you are a midwife: you are assisting at someone 
else's birth. Do good without show or fuss. Facilitate what is 
happening rather than what you think ought to be happening 
... When the baby is born, the mother will rightly say: &quot;We did it 
ourselves&quot;.</i></font></p>
