<p><font size=3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font size=3>At the end of 1971 Bangladesh emerged as an independent nation through a nine months long war 
of independence from Pakistan. After many years of closed (economy, political, social and 
religious) orientation only recently the country is poised again to taste the fruit of independence 
through its open market economy policy. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>There had been always a tension between government organisations (GO) and non government 
organisations (NGOs) in Bangladesh, over the issues of recognition at large, as to who performs 
better in local support system. It took some time for us to recognise that the NGOs can not take the 
role which a State can. Equally the government started realising that in certain areas NGO delivery 
system is much more effective. So, recently a realisation took place between the government &amp; 
NGOs that both need to develop a partnership between to make their effort more effective and 
impactful. It is to complement but not to compete with each other.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>One of our biggest programmes is our TB-Leprosy Control Programme. We have signed one 
Memorandum of Understanding with the government, by which we have taken the responsibility to 
take care of TB &amp; Leprosy patients in Sylhet Division (4 Districts - 7.5 million Population). 
According to the MOU, Govt. is providing space (room and building for us at each District and 
Thana level), drugs (from WHO) and co-ordinates technical support. We as NGO have the full 
responsibility along with the government to identify patients, ensure treatment and follow-up. For 
this we have to involve the community and DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course) 
system. We have developed some incentive scheme to ensure the local community's participation, 
which is giving us quite an encouraging results.</font></p>
<p><font size=3><b>BENEFITS</b></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>Government allocated us office and clinic space at District and Thana level.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>In collaboration with government, we trained all government level doctors in our Division at 
our site.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Government doctors are supervising and signing patients cards supervised by HEED (NGO), 
making our programme more cost effective.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Government field level staff are now being trained which is quite helpful for detecting patients.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Government Health Complex, job and equipment are also being used by our staff from time 
to time.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Government doctors are following Standard National TB Treatment Guideline (WHO agreed 
policy).</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>No TB patients any more under private practitioner (government or private medical officers).</font><font size=4> </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3><b>PROBLEMS</b></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>The SCC drugs are quite expensive in the open market. A huge number of patients of the 
country are yet to be in a system like ours. As a result there is a tendency of slipping the 
drugs to outside market.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>There are also a tendency of local (Non NGO) doctors to keep those patients who have 
sputum negative pulmonary and extra pulmonary TB cases, giving promises of free TB 
Treatment.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size=3><b>CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</b></font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>Hard and sincere work by the NGOs can create the atmosphere of recognition and honour 
for NGOs.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
<li><font size=3>Close networks with the government authority, due respect and honour to them can help a 
congenial atmosphere for both to work towards an effective partnership. The TB patients are 
to be recognised, served, honoured and treated not others. We in Bangladesh now are very 
hopeful than before, of a effective partnership between GO &amp; NGOs, as we attempt to 
control the disease in our region.</font><font size=4> </font></li>
