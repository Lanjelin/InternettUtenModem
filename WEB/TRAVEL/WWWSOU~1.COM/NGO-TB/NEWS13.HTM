<p><font size=6><b>Yesterday&#133;</b></font> </p>
<p><font size=4>We've had an excellent first day! It was a privilege to have the Honourable 
Minister of Health inaugurate the conference, along with Kedar Sthapit, a young 
man with TB.</font> </p>
<p><font size=4>The comments made by Dr Bill Pigott, WHO country represen-tative, were 
particularly pertinent, and we will include them in the conference report, and also 
load them on our web page. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Following the inauguration, the Minister sent a message greeting by e-mail to our 
other participants around the world. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>The first presentation was by Dr Shimao, president of the Japan Anti TB 
Association. In his &quot;View from the Summit&quot; presentation he gave a broad 
overview of the global TB situation and challenged us to think about elimination 
and eradication goals in developing countries. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>We then heard from Neil Hamlet about the INF TB Control Programme, 
supporting govern-ment services in Nepal. Then in the afternoon we broke into 
two groups to look at various issues. Ria Grant and Aiden Keyes helped us to 
look at TB in disadvantaged communities, Elgin Saha and Dirgh Singh Bam 
covered government and NGO relation-ships, Katsunori Osuga facilitated a 
session in which participants shared their experiences of health education and 
advocacy, Santa Tamang presented the work of Save the Children in TB control 
with refugees, and Andrew Edwards talked about TB control from a hospital 
base. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>So a very busy, but a fruitful, first day!</font></p>
<p><font size=6><b>&#133;and Today</b></font> </p>
<p><font size=4>We begin today with a very important session. Professor Donald Enarson of the 
International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases will review global 
TB control strategies. In the second session of the morning we will hear from 
Akramul Islam about the community based approach to TB control used by 
BRAC in Bangladesh. We continue with the theme of community involvement in 
TB control, as Anne Horgheim tells us about the experience of a patient's 
organisation involved in the fight against TB - the Norwegian Heart and Lung 
Association. The choice of issues for discussion is wide today, and most relate 
to community involvement in TB control&#133; &quot;Doing DOTS&quot; will look at different 
approaches to supervising treat-ment from around the world. The Deadly Duet 
of TB + HIV also receive our attention in an open session chaired by Ria Grant 
from South Africa. Tell us of your experiences in this important area. 
Alternatively, you can discuss ways of increasing case finding with Mohamed 
Akhtar who will be sharing the experiences of the Britain Nepal Medical Trust 
with us. The final session offers a difficult choice - in the Main Hall, Elizabeth 
Fair will be discussing the issue of Gender and TB, while in Hall 2 Dr 
Sadutshang will talk about MDRTB, based on his experience with the Tibetan 
community, in Dharmasala, India. Have a great day!<br>
