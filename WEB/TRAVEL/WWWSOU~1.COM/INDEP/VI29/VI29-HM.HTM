<b><h3>Tell me why ...</h3></b>
<P>
<b>By C K Lal</b>
<P>
Visit Nepal Year 1998. The slogan has a nice ring to it. It does
not create an imagery. it promises no USP (Unique Sales Proposition
or an attribute that differentiate a product or a service from
the competition). It does not even build upon a 'competitive advantage'
- the latest buzz-word of international marketing. It's simple
and direct. To the point, almost like <I>Bhiksham Dehi.</I> Unfortunately,
altruism is alien in the cut-throat competition for pleasure-pound
and leisure-lira. The yen for Yen and the yearning for Yankee
yuppie is unlikely to succeed in the absence of a focussed marketing
effort. Some people may climb the mountains because 'they are
there,' but when it comes to choosing a holiday destination for
their family; they aren't usually that rash.
<P>
Can any one say with any amount of conviction why a discerning
traveller should choose to pay us a visit in the &quot;Visit Nepal
Year&quot;? Himalyas? They were there before and shall still be
there a decade after. Temples? How about Ankor-Wat. Shangri-la?
Tibet or Mongolia, any one? To economise words and let sleeping
metaphors snore, allow yours' truly to assert that it's not assets
which count in hospitality business. it's the value that you add
through your imaginative use of resources that has a decisive
impact. Novelty soon wears off, novel ideas are slightly more
enduring. Do our tourism tsars have that? If you were to go by
their choice of the all-important catch-phrase, then you would
become as cynical as I am.
<P>
Getting down to brass tacks, one wonders if the <I>objectives</I>
of the campaign have been clearly defined. has the <I>target audience</I>
been closely identified? Presumbly, a <I>methodology</I> has been
agreed upon, a <I>budget</I> worked out and the <I>duties and
resonsiblities </I> of various sub-sectors clearly assigned. Excellent!
However, there is a little problem. When this competently choreographed
opera was being enacted, some one forgot to raise the curtain
and the audience was blissfully unaware of what went on. One hopes
that it's just the rehearsals. What's the big deal? It doesn't
pay to put the cart before the horse. Even the most prepared needs
quite a lot of preparation and 1998 isn't that far awayTalkg about
preparations. How prepared are we - to welcome the expected hordes?
Tourism businesses in Nepal are run on feudal lines and the general
public receive very little, if at all any; benefit from a boom
in the business. More often, they are adversely hit by it's inflationary
pressure in the tourist - infested regions. Hence, we have to
be <I>educated</I> with more information than the pontifiction
of 'Guest is God'. It doesn't help your  smile when you learn
that some of the bloated priests are making hell-lot-of-dough
out of your back-packing Gods.
<P>
Let's face the bare facts now. Nothing has been done till date
to disapprove the popular notion that the slogan in all it's intent
an officious farce. Tourism is a serious business these days.
The halcyon days of putting up a wooden signboard with a legend
like &quot;Buddha's Abode' on your cattle-shed and fighting off
a smashed-out junkie from mounting a cow are long gone. Like a
bank, a hospital or a school, the reputation of a service industry
is on the precipice. One wrong move and the edifice built over
the years will collapse. It's for this very reason that 'Visit
Nepal Year' should not  drift into a fiasco. In this finicky business,
successes are built upon successes and one is only as good as
one's last failure. It's certainly not too late, to formulate
a more commercially viable strategy.
<P>
Years ago, I had written in a Nepali newsmagazine that while the
Himalayas can do wonders; yet it had no cure for the ailments
of our tourism industry. With profound sadness, I am sorry to
report that things haven't changed.over the years.

World Bank approves more than $ 18 million for Nepal's rural water
and sanitation
<P>
The World Bank has approved a $ 18.28 million credit for the Nepal
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The project will support
rural communities, using a demand-driven approach for service
delivery and a participatory process to decision making to implement
water supply and sanitation schemes in the villages with assistance
from support organisations such as non-governmental organisations,
community based organisations and private firms. The project will
support a package of investments for water and sanitation as well
as community development activities to deliver clean and safe
drinking water and provide hygienic sanitation facilities to 550,000
villagers. The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending arm.
<P>
&quot;Improvements in water supply and sanitation are important
elements in reducing poverty and improving quality of life,&quot;
says World Bank Resident Representative Joe Manickavasagam. &quot;Rural
productivity is constrained directly by the high rate of water
related diseases.&quot; Manickavasagam added, &quot;The Rural
Water Project is an innovation, in that it explicitly uses NGOs
and a participatory approach, which means the community and beneficiaries
play an active role in decision-making and management of the programmes
under the project. Furthermore, more than $ 2 million will be
contributed by the communities themselves.&quot;
<P>
As part of project preparation, the project was piloted in several
villages in Nepal over the last two years. The project's three
main objectives are to:
<P>
* deliver sustainable health and hygiene benefits to the rural
population through improvements in water supply and sanitation;
<P>
* improve rural real incomes through time savings and income earning
opportunities for women; and
<P>
* improve government and non-governmental capabilities to undertake
and sustain these efforts.<hr>

<b><h3>Koirala launches tirade against government</h3></b>
<P>
<b>By D L Bhandari</b>
<P>
The President of the Nepali Congress (NC), Girija Prasad Koirala,
is presumably daunted by the presence of the vastly unorganised
opposition in the party; if his invectives against the coalition
government led by the Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba are anything
to go by. He used the three day western regime meeting and colloquium
of the NC workers that ended on August 26 at Pokhara, to his advantage
to air his grievances.
<P>
The party president's speech couched in the form a working paper
on the coordination and Interrelation between the elected office
bearers of Nepali Congress local party units hinted t the need
for an imminent mid-term poll. However, he has been trumpeting
for this cause to make inroads to the top and regain his lost
glory of 1994.
<P>
He has been forthright in admitting his past follies that in a
way split the party rank of file into splinter-groups. Political
stability, too finds priority in his train of thought - a fact
that, he feels can only be achieved through the continuity of
government. Yet his speech was peppered with vitriolic remarks
against the people in power.
<P>
What can be conceived a as desperate bid to gander mass support
around him, he reiterated his views that NC will not entertain
the need to continue with the present coalition set up at the
lost of party principles and policies. But the delegates, were
always around to refute his view as and when he dwelled long on
the rather and peripeteias of Nepali Congress workers were being
given a short shrift he signed off with this ardent belief that
the NC can ill-afford to continue with the coalition of the party's
identity would have under an axe.
<P>
The colloquium, in a sense was a spectacle of an assembly that
remained ambiguous an its not cause of action, land credence due
to he presence of Koirala's detractors like speaker of the House
of Representative, Ram Chandra Poudel, Minister for Communication,
Chiranjivi Wagle and Minister for Industry, Dhundiraj Shastri,
among others. His detracts like the speaker Poudel put forth his
vies against regimented discipline, the NC General Secretary,
Sushil Koirala embraced discipline as a necessary evil. However,
the startling comment of the day cause from the General Secretary,
Taranath Ranabhat, who dwelled on the need to bridge disunity
in the party at a time when regressive and revisionist forces
are working in Tandem to discredit the multiparty democracy.
<P>
Thus, the silver living of the meet can be dubbed as the NC's
marshalling of its troops setting aside the pausal differences
before they face the electorate during the local elections in
near future.<hr>

<b><h3>Bill is facing a premature crisis</h3></b>
<P>
<b>By A Staff Reporter</b>
<P>
It's been for years that various NGO's operating in the country
are clamouring for a new Act which would legitimise  daughters
to inherit parental property irrespective of they get married
or not. Political parties two have jumped on the bandwagon primarily
on electoral consideration. At present, a team bureaucrats a scrutinising
this issue before it is registered at the House of Representatives
during the current session of the parliament for legislative approval.
<P>
Under the present arrangement a girl child is not intituled to
lay claim on parental poverty until he attains the age of 35 and
chooses to remain a spinster. In stark contrast to this clause
number 16 concerning property in Muluki Ain, -  an Act which was
promulgated by Rana Prime Minister empowers are male child to
inherit property once he attains the age of 18.
<P>
The draft of the new Parental Property Act was complied by joint
team of women's group and legal experts. But if the words of the
Spokesman of the Ministry of law are anything to go by, government
has backtracked over the issue of tabling the draft document in
its original form and contempts.
<P>
The spokesman in question, Hari Prasad Neupane is, however, confident
that the bill may be tabled in  the HOR in near future without
much off an opposition.
<P>
Asked about the likelihood of whether the government is committed
to pass an independent Act for womens' interest, he says,  &quot;It
is likely that since the issue is very sensitive, the government
may simply amend the clause number 16 regarding parental property
distribution, by legitimising women to inherit parental property
once they are 30 years of age&quot;. However, a similar change
may put the  son's age of owing the family property only after
he attains the age of 30.
<P>
It has been reported is the section of the press that the government
is willing to restore semblance of parity regarding the inheritance
of the parental property, and put a contentious issue to rest.
Neupane also quoted the Supreme Court's ruling in this context,
&quot;the government should enact such a law which does not in
any way dispute social fabric while entitling women to receive
parental property.&quot;
<P>
Even though there has been a couple of NGO's and women's groups
demanding for such an Act, women in general do not subscribe to
this view. The vice president of the Nepali Congress, Shailaja
Acharya filled that if such an Act is put to practice then that
&quot;will lead to discrepancies since a daughter once married
becomes also the co-sharer of the property held by the husband.&quot;
However, she has defended the ideal that unmarried women should
be empowered by a suitable legal procedure.
<P>
The minister of law in the meanwhile is consulting with legal
experts and leaders of the political parties before arriving Act
any conclusion. Since the issue is one of national importance
its needs a judicious scrutiny to eliminate any chance of eventual
abuse. It remains to be seen, whether such an Act would revolutionise
the lives of Nepali women or not and bring about a sea-change
in the existing social fabric. <hr>
