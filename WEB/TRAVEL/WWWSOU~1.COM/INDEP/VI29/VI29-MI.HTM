<h3>Krishna the divine lover</h3>
<P>
There are many facets of Lord Krishna's personality, as depicted
in <I>Mahabharata</I> epic and other texts. Besides being a man
of action, he was a divine lover. With his striking countenance
in the visual arts and omnipresence in music and literature be
could not go unnoticed, unmentioned in the everyday life of a
vast number of people. 
<P>
As a great lover he is depicted with open frankness and sensual
charm by the artists. All the cowherd damsels of Braja (now known
as Vrindavan), and the slender-waisted Radha, fall distractedly
in love with him. He rouses their ire, and their longings; with
his playful pranks and fulfils those longings; he torments them
with the melodies of this flute, loving them all. He is in turn
defended, protected and embraced by the beauties. If he teases
his beloved at times, he is also suppliant in love, for he pays
homage at the feet of the beloved touching them, gently massaging
them, painting them with lacquer and placing his head on them.
He accepts his shortcomings with humility and equanimity when
he is berated and reprimanded in no uncertain terms by the beloved,
for being treacherous and deceitful. 
<P>
There is this strange simplicity in his character, of the supreme
being who appears in the mortal world to conquer all evil and
annihilate the evildoers, engaged in dalliance and being chastened
by her for frivolous reasons which are more often than not, imaginary.
This very quality, this fallibility makes Krishna adorable in
the eyes of the milkmaids, and popular with the masses whose lives
are touched by the romance of his deeds. His amorous games can
be classified into two broad categories, love of the individual
as depicted through his affair with Radha and second, his flirtation
and frolicking with the milkmaids in a group, teasing them into
submission. 
<P>
Towards that end, Krishna employees all the guiles of a wily lover.
Just as no one can resist his splendid appearance, nobody can
be impassive to the summons of his flute.

<b><h3>Paper Tony and Eton Boys romance with Nepali mountain village</h3></b>
<P>
<b>By  A Staff Reporter</b>
<P>
Tony Freak is an Englishman from North London. While trekking
in the Upper Khumbu in 1988 his Sherpas persuaded him to return
from Gokyo to Namche Bazar along the eastern side of the valley
which took him through their village. Phortse lies in an idyllic
setting, a south facing terrace high on the mountainside at the
unction of the rivers Dudh Koshi and the Imja Khola draining from
Sagarmatha (Mount Everest).
<P>
Tony quickly recognised that Phortse had few of the facilities
enjoyed by neighbouring communities. The village school was in
a poor state of repair and there was no proper accommodation for
the teachers. on has return to England be appear for help. Within
two years the school was repaired, re-roofed and painted, and
a brand new teachers' hostel had been built Tony had raises the
money, designed the hostel, obtained permission from the authorities,
surveyed the building and ordered all the materials from local
sources and from Kathmandu, and, finally arranged for everything
to be carried to the village for the master builder to construct
the new building.
<P>
In 1993 some staff a Eton College started to plan a trekking expedition
to Nepal. John Vessey, the master in charge, approached Steve
Webster of Mountain Travel asking whether he knew of a community
scheme with which ht school could become involved. Thus Tony and
John were put in touch with each other, and joint operations began.
It was at about this time that a tragic accident occurred at the
school in which a senior boy died. Gordon Daniel would have been
a member of the expedition, so a decision was taken to set about
raising money to create a lasting memorial to Gordon in Nepal.
<P>
Since 1994 Tony and Eton have combined to provide a medical clinic
and a gompa for the people of Phortse, meanwhile tony has been
adopted on an honorary member of the village-they call him Papa
Tony. The clinic was built in 1994 and Eton boys spent a week
in August helping to put the finishing touches.
<P>
However, the outstanding achievement of this co-operation has
been the building of the new Phortse gompa. constructed of stone
and timber this large two-story structure stands high above the
village in a commanding position looking down te entire length
of the Khumbu valley to the plains below.
<P>
the villagers have worked hard through 1995-6 clearing the huge
area covered by the foundations They have quarried and carried
the stone to the site, and some were involved in transporting
the timber from sawmills outside the National Park. Large quantises
of building materials had to be flown in by helicopter. Pasang
Lama Sherpa, is the master builder directing the day-to-day construction.
Tony, with some of his friends, and second group of Eton boys
have been helping during the summer to bring this major project
to completion. The crowing glory arrived when on August 31st,
a propitious day, the Abbot Rinpoche Tengboche came to Phortse
to bless the Gompa. there was s tumult of rejoicing and celebrations
which Gordon Daniel's family, John Vessey and a roup of Eton Masters,
their wives and friends were able to witness after trekking to
the village for the opening ceremonies.
<P>
All that remains to be done tis to decorate and furnish the Gompa,
and to construct a monk's living quarters with kitchen and latrine.
The former will be a responsibility falling on the villagers.
The latter will continue to exercise both Papa Tony, who has already
designed the building, and Eton College which will help to pay
it.
<P>
The boys finally left Phortse and continued their trek with a
group of Sherpas employed by Mountain Travel, Nepal. They entered
Tibet and approached Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) from the north.
Where they all achieved an altitude of just over 20,000 feet.
