Shailaja embarked into politics the day she was born as the niece
of legendary B.P. Koirala. She came into the limelight after the
1960's royal takeover, when she demonstrated tremendous courage
by waving a black flag as King Mehendra spoke at a public meeting.
A career politician, Shailaja is, however, an epitome of a politicians
who fumbles to carve out a place at the top and stay there inspite
of having  worked ones way to it. Shailaja, who is currently the
Vice-President of Nepali Congress (NC) and represents a constituency
of Morang districts to the House of Representatives declined to
entertain question on Mahakali Treaty, but, however spoke on corruption
saying that the party is left to pay, heavily for those who are
indulging in corruption, at least in the polls. Contented with
spinsterhood, she says, she is enjoying every moments of life
as it comes along, and is, of late inclined to spiritualism, Malayan
Buddhism in Particular. Last Friday, she talked with Achyut Wagle
of The Independent at her residence at Mahankal, Bouddha. Excerpts:

<P>
<B>Q. You were one among the three so-called second generation
leaders working together to being the big-trios together. But
recently it is felt that you are more inclined in favour of NC
President G.P. Koirala. What is the reason?</B>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> Your question, it seems, is inspired by what
others are propagating about me. As a matter of fact, I speak
what I feel is right. This holds good in respect of policy matters
in the party also. As far as you have identified me as one of
the three second generation leaders (Sher Bahadur Deuba, Ram Chandra
Poudel and Shailaja Acharya herself), let me tell you I do not
belong to that bracket. This is mainly due to the reason that
they have repeatedly failed to remain neutral on most occasions
(when it was necessary for them to demonstrate integrity). As
for me, I have been speaking out the truth whenever expected of
me whether I was holding a post or not. Therefore, whoever are
projecting me as Koirala-supporter are doing a wrong thing.
<P>
<I><B>Q.  But you have been appointed of in a prestigious post
of party vice-president by Koirala himself?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> My role in the party remains the same that I
have been enjoying since years. As I see it, the post of the Vice-President
is turning out to be a figurative one since the party statute
has not vested any power on this post. Yet I am asserting myself
in my own way by directing my energy towards salvaging the declining
image of the party by encouraging those who have been sidelined
to join the mainstream.
<P>
<I><B>Q. Do you ascribe the view that the NC has lost its earlier
vitality after the first multiparty election in the country?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> That's totally a wrong analysis since the NC
had immediately after it was elected to power had fared well in
the local election by recording a majority position in more than
sixty districts. This clearly was the <I>cogent</I> proof of the
fact that the party was in excellent shape at the time when Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai was its President and G.P. Koirala was the prime
minister. But the efforts to weaken the party are being launched
from left and right and from within the party itself lately. This
was initiated at the time when the country had to go to the midterm
polls and during the conduct of the polls itself. The party narrowly
escaped from the brink of split. Obviously, NC couldn't be expected
to win the elections in divided state. But the happy news is that
the Congress is very strong among the grassroots population. While
the numerical strength gained by CPN-UML and the RPP in the parliament
is the outcome of division in the Congress, what I am confident
of is there is no party in this country which can defeat it provided
it goes to the polls unitedly. But the weaknesses in NC have not
been totally overcome. In fact, the fault lies at the centre where
<B>division</B> is more apparent due to the power struggle. We
have a substantial followings at grassroots level who are disappointed
at the way the leaders at the centre tend to act.
<P>
<I><B>Q. How do you explain the constitution of the new Central
Executive Committee, and do you think it has included enough dissidents
to avert the recurrence of past crisis in the party?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> The constitution of the central committee of
a party by all means falls within the prerogatives of its president.
This was so during the time when K.P. Bhattarai was the president
also. While I do not see any need to debate on the nature of the
committee, it is unlikely that anyone will be successful in evolving
a consensus committee either. But the major question should be
weather the committee is functioning as expected or not. As far
as I see it, the new committee since its inception, has held three
a official meetings, and have brought the major national issues
such as the Mahakali Treaty, womens'  property right issues etc
to the intensive debate. This shows the central committee is committed
to hold <I>protracted</I> debate before evolving suitable policies.
Of course, there are still some districts where we have so far
failed to resolve the organisational crisis. I do not claim that
we have acted remaining free from bias under various circumstances
in various districts.  Whatsoever, take it from me, that politics
is no longer a play thing of a lone wolf when one used to scheme
things in seclusion. Therefore the future as well as the decision
making process of the party  much depends on the party activists
spread across the length and breadth of the country.
<P>
<I><B>Q. You referred to policy aberration in NC in the recent
past. Do you mean to say the party  either moving away from principles
of democratic socialism or have been merely saying that the ethical
tradition of the party is no longer being courted?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> NC has always been a centrist political organisation.
But moving away from its course, the party has unduly compromised
to form a coalition government with RPP. I do not mean to say
that we had not to form a government, but this should have been
a balanced alliance commensurate to the strength in parliament.
No party should try to take undue advantage out of the given political
situation. I consider this to be a sort of surrendering of principles.
We have also started to lose our distinct identity in the bargain.
I have been speaking against this tendency of our excessive flexibility
with RPP since the first session of this parliament when parliamentary
committees were being filled up by maintaining working relation
with that party. There was no justification on giving three out
of six committees to the RPP. My words were taken as personal
vendetta against the party and nobody projected me in right perspective.
In fact, I was against the RPP exertion of undeserved pressure
on us well before Sher Bahadur Deuba came into the picture. Under
the prevailing circumstances, it has become difficult to distinguish
between RPP members and the Congress counterparts. Let me cite
B.P.'s words who had said, &quot; we cannot be jingoistic in the
name of nationalism and cannot also hold <I> </I>republican views
 in the name of democracy.&quot; This is to maintain equal distance
from both RPP and CPN-UML. I have an impression that the party
tends to lose equilibrium at times. The party must bring forth
its views on issues such as women's rights, land reforms, the
kind of relations the party has to have with neighbouring countries
and so on. The degree of transparency which was being maintained
regarding the above issues before is diminishing recently and
has given birth to consternation recently. When it comes to the
party's commitment to socialism, there has been a certain degree
of deviation from its original stance. While they are arguing
that the global change is behind this U-turn in party's policies,
what I don't understand is how are the external factors going
to effect us when we are so poor that the parameters which shape
their economies are totally absent in our country. There are no
industries here nor is it likely that we may also be able to realise
the dream of industrialisation to necessitate the change in socialist
policies we are propagating. Therefore instead of running after
multinationals who would not come here in the absence of infrastructure,
we ought to be concentrating on agriculture to realise 'green
resolution' to start with. We can't have sugar mills unless we
have sugarcane plantation. Thus, what  I feel is the drive for
disinvestment on the part of the government and liberalisation
policies have, by and large, no substance. On the contrary, in
countries such as ours, state should play a pivotal role to protect
the interest of the down trodden. Moreover, the structure of our
society will fail to exploit the new alternatives.
<P>
<I><B>Q. It is said that the new entrants in the NC  and those
who can spend money are virtually holding the party to ransom.
Would you comment?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> You are right in saying this. There are people
in the party who have money and are trying to scale the organisational
hierarchy at a quicker pace a others who have served the party
all along the past. Since they can manage to move nearer the leaders,
it is they who are dubiously capable of creating <I>schism</I>
in the party. But I am sure since they  are conscious of their
doubtful progress over others, they do consider themselves as
misfits in the midst of others who are the true soldiers of the
organisation. But as a happy sign, more than 70 percent of General
Convention members were largely old vanguards of the party. The
new entrants are now slowly making their place in  district organisations.
But the central leadership should see to it that an NC candidate
during elections is not opposed by other faction as has happened
during the last mid-term poll.
<P>
<I><B>Q.  You are alleged to have a personality clash with PM
Sher Bahadur Deuba? How far do you communicate with him?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> You can't expect me to be having any sort of
personality clash with him. In fact, when I constituted Democratic
Youth League in 1967, in Benaras, he was not even in the committee
while Ram Chandra Poudel was elected as the General Secretary
which suffices to say that he is not my contemporary leave alone
qualify as my rival. Since he was not even in that committee,
it is better be understood than said that he is not my rival at
all. It is for this reason, that he should be coming to me for
advise rather than me taking initiative to meet him. He has come
to me one. I have too gone to meet him at his residence once which
shows we are, of course, in touch. But since I am, incidentally,
also the Vice-President he should come to me too seek advice.
<P>
<I><B>Q. So, you have got the ego-problem then?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> I say what I see and if some people take it as
an ego, I have no objection.
<P>
<I><B>Q. How do you visualise the party's performance in the up
coming local elections?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> Provided that the party unitedly concentrates
on the local elections in right earnest, there is no doubt that
we may maintain our present status. But before that we will have
to plan the right strategy to address the people's concerns  before
we actually face the election. We will have to convince the voters
that if there is an alternative to NC it is not RPP or CPN-UML,
but within the Congress itself. Since people have identified NC
cadres as the power mongers, we will have to work hard to erase
this image from the memories of the electorate.
<P>
<I><B>Q. Do you think the era of trio in NC has come to an end?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> There is no way that we should be taking it for
granted that the era of trio has come to an end. They all will
be, in their own way, contributing to the welfare of the party.
They may not be active but  will keep on reflecting on the functioning
of the party.
<P>
<I><B>Q. Where do you find yourself in the race for the realm
of power?</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>A.</B></I> I doubt whether I am not well versed in the game
played to capture power. Therefore, I do not know as to where
I am, or how far away am I, from it. But what I feel is, I am
not able to please others who matter, if anyone is to go nearer
to the power. But for one thing I am sure, that the future leadership
of the party will be in my hands. This is not my wishful thinking
but I have gathered this in the course of my meeting with people.
I am, perhaps, the first natural choice of the cadres. Therefore,
if NC has a future, I too have one.
