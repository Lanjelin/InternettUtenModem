Perhaps, few noticed that <B>Their Majesties</B> this time used
the <B>VIP </B>and not the <B>VVIP</B> bay at the airport to travel
abroad. It seems, this fact went <B>mindlessly</B> <B>unnoticed
</B>even by our usually very '<B>nosy</B>' press. Could this Royal
action<B> indicate</B> a <B>leaner</B>, more <B>user-friendly</B>
Monarchy going into the 21st century?

<B>Mother Teresa</B>, the 86-year-old <B>Nobel Peace Laureate</B>,
frail yet beaming, who almost died of heart failure recently remarked
from her sick bed, 'I want to go home, there's <B>much</B> to
be done'. Such <B>dedication</B> and <B>devotion</B> to work even
in the face of <B>death</B> must surely prove to be a <B>shining</B>
example for all, especially for <B>Nepalis </B>who is <B>habituated</B>
in doing things <I>bholi first hour ma </I>(tomorrow) instead
of today.

On Aug 28, an anonymous legal clerk's official stamp <B>ended
</B>one of the world's <B>most glamorous</B> marriages as the
Prince and Princess of Wales were <B>divorced,</B> considered
to be one of the <B>highest</B> divorce sums negotiated in Britain.
It's the sad <B>unwinding</B> of a marriage that started so well
and ended so sadly. And those who meet <B>Diana</B>, just Princess
of Wales now, need not <B>bow</B> in courtesy!

They never gave up trying for a <B>daughter</B>. A British couple
whose 22 years of <B>tireless trying</B> to have a baby girl resulted
only in <B>11 sons,</B> had their wishes <B>granted</B> last week,
when not one but two girls were born to them. Patience coupled
with <B>tenacity</B> of purpose pays, I guess!

The <I><B>Gai Jatra</B></I> satirical programmes currently running
in the capital has one very <B>overriding</B> theme. That political
parties, the politicians and the attendant <B>publicity</B> they
receive are <B>ruining</B> the nation. How true. <I><B>Tattler</B></I>
could not agree more!

Come September the monsoon becomes <B>fickle</B>. Does it? Anyway
persistent rain has made the surrounding hills <B>lush green</B>
while leaving the Capital's streets slushy. <B>LC</B> scams and
other such sensations from <B>Mechi </B>to<B> Mahakali</B> were
there as well, but they are not part of the monsoon.
