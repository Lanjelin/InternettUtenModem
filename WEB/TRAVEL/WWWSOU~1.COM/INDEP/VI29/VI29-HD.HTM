<b><h3>Chairman Mao to this day</h3></b>
<P>
<b>Foreign Bureau
<P></b>
After a &quot;quite and relaxed&quot; one week in China, King
Birendra returned home September 1 with Queen Aishwarya, Prince
Nirajan and Princess Sruti. Understandably, the official circles
are not quite willing to share with the press the substance of
the &quot;very important&quot; discussion the King had with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing August 28. Political analysts,
however, believe that the Chinese leadership impressed upon the
visiting dignitary that the Middle Kingdom continues to regard
Nepal as a &quot;dependable friend&quot; and the Chinese view
is based basically on the &quot;continuity&quot; provided by the
King himself from Mao era to this day.
<P>
Informed sources told <I>The Independent</I> that the royal visit
has once again brought into focus the excellent understanding
existing between the two close neighbours and the need to cooperate
with each other within the limits set by their respective national
priorities. Private sector collaboration has been re-emphasised
for mutual benefit. It is expected that Tibet's proximity factor
will receive a new impetus and Beijing may now seriously consider
allowing Nepali entrepreneurs to participate, in some form, in
the five-year multi-billion dollar industrial development programme
for the Himalayan plateau.<hr>
<P>
<b><h3>What's in a routine visit?</h3></b>
<P>
<b>Foreign Bureau</b>
<P>
Contrary to reports, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South
Asian Affairs Robin Raphel is not sticking her lovely neck out
to Jhapa and Mahakali in the neighbourhood of Nepal-India-China
tri-junction in the far west, even though, coincidentally, her
current South Asian trip which begins with Nepal, September 4
(today) has been planned to cover these very countries. Raphel
leaves Nepal for India September 8 and then goes to Beijing from
there.
<P>
Does the Assistant Secretary have any specific mission, say, expressing
American support to the Mahakali Treaty in line with the British
Undersecretary Liam Fox's some days back? &quot;No, she is coming
here on a routine visit similar to the previous trips she has
made to Nepal,&quot; U.S. Embassy spokesman David Queen told <I>The
Independent. </I>This is Raphel's third visit to Nepal in equal
number of years.
<P>
Raphel is expected to have an audience with the King Birendra.
Observers attach considerable importance to this event because
she is going to China and the King has just returned from there.
She is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Deuba, Foreign Minister
Lohani and Water Resources Minister Rana and senior coalition
and opposition leaders.
<P>
According to Queen, she is also spending some time with the Peace
Corps Volunteers in Pokhara September 7 although the trip to the
picturesque town is supposed to be a get- away from-it-all.<hr>
<P>
<b><h3>Getting closer</h3></b>
<P>
<b>Political Bureau</b>
<P>
It has taken such a long time but in the end, it seems, commonsense
and concern for the nation will supersede all other peripheral
considerations. The controversial Mahakali Treaty, barring new
and unexpected hitches, may indeed be on the verge of being ratified.
But as the key holder, the CPN-UML, insists the Deuba Government
would have to make a 'firm commitment' that it will immediately
initiate dialogue with New Delhi for the rectification of certain
'built-in flaws' in the bilateral document.
<P>
Former Minister Prem Singh Dhami, who was a member of the Khadga
Oli Study Team, told <I>The Independent </I>September 3 that the
report turned over to CPN-UML General Secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal
focuses essentially on three broad political and technical aspects
of the bilateral deal, namely, issues having a direct relationship
with the Mahakali Treaty, issues concerning development of water
resources as a whole and issues relating to 'good' neighbourly
relations between Nepal and India.
<P>
The CPN-UML's Central Committee meeting scheduled for September
3 was postponed till today because of differences among the Politburo
members over the question of how to approach the nine-point recommendations
articulated by the Study Team. According to former Minister Pradeep
Kumar Nepal, the Central Committee members have been given copies
of the report submitted by the Team so that they may be able to
intelligently argue their points at the meeting today.
<P>
Asked about the party's latest stance on treaty ratification,
he said, &quot;The CPN-UML has never opposed the treaty. If our
suggestions concerning the overall facets of Nepal-India relations
are accepted, we are in favour of endorsing the Mahakali treaty.&quot;
<P>
The main among the nine points stressed by the Team are that Mahakali
be designated a border river throughout the western front, that
the government should settle the dispute over the land Nepal had
lost when Sarada Barrage was built some 70 years ago, that the
origin of Mahakali river be clearly identified, and that there
is and will be no border infringement.
<P>
The treaty signed in New Delhi, February 12, between the two countries
has defined Mahakali rivers as 'a boundary river on <I>major stretches
</I>between the two countries.&quot;
<P>
The CPN-UML, it seems, is committed to, once and for all, to resolve
the controversy over the origin and course of the <I>actual</I>
Mahakali river along the hilly parts of Darchula district where,
as some CPN-UML local leaders allege, the river has been arbitrarily
identified from among the various streams which pass through the
area. This has finally resulted in the loss of about 1600 hectares
of Nepali territory.
<P>
Explaining the reason behind the postponement of the Central Committee
meeting, Nepal said, &quot;The decision to ratify or not to ratify
the treaty will be reached in a day or two, since the basic mandate
of the Study Team was only to compare the treaty initialled in
Kathmandu with the one signed in New Delhi and not to say &quot;yes&quot;
or &quot;no&quot; to the treaty. Hence, the decision will have
to be taken by none other than the Central Committee itself.<hr>

<b><h3>'No compromise on passengers' safety'</h3></b>
<P>
<b>By A Staff Reporter</b>
<P>
&quot;Leasing an aircraft always entails a lot of problems, I
agree. But we have to have it anyway. We either have to buy it
or take on lease. This time around, we are more cautious,&quot;
RNAC's Managing Director Udaya Bir Gurung told <I>The Independent</I>
September 1.
<P>
In an effort to clarify the RNAC management's position in the
face of recent controversy over the proposed leasing of a Boeing
767, Gurung let it be known that personally he preferred outright
purchase of aircraft to avoid unnecessary controversy.
<P>
&quot;The RNAC is fully aware of the concern shown by a section
of German tour operators and friends regarding the credibility
of the company from which the national flag carrier is thinking
to acquire on lease a wide-bodied Boeing 767,&quot; said the young
RNAC executive head.
<P>
&quot;This concern has all the more strengthened the RNAC's determination
to choose an aircraft with more caution&quot; Gurung remarked,
adding, &quot;Anyway, we are satisfied with the technical details
on the said aircraft made available to us by the Boeing Company
of America&quot;.
<P>
Furthermore, he said, Boeing 767 can easily be flown by the Nepali
pilots which will save a lot of money and reduce the overall cost
for RNAC operations. The Nepali pilots have been flying Boeing
767. So the switch over to the 767 series will not be a difficult
task for them.
<P>
Gurung dismissed the rumours that the aircraft in question has
no credibility. &quot;We are not that foolish to go for an aircraft
to be flown to Frankfurt and other European destinations, where
there is a doubt over the aircraft's credibility&quot; he said.
&quot;If we do so the whole exercise will prove to be absolutely
suicidal.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We will not just rush to lease the aircraft only because
we badly need one. Unless we are completely satisfied with the
aircraft's airworthiness, we will not take on lease any aircraft
from anywhere. We may be in dire straits due to the lack of aircraft
in the peak season but we will not compromise the safety of our
passengers,&quot; Gurung assured.
<P>
He said that he was still very much hopeful that everything would
go well, and the national flag-carrier would be able to lease
the most suitable aircraft before the peak season breaks open.
