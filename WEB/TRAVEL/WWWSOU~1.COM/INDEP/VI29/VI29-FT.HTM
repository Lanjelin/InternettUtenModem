<h3><b>Domestic and wild</b></h3>
<P>
<b>By C K Lal</b>
<P>
Destiny seems to have thrust naivety upon Gajjubabu <I>Hindibhasi</I>.
Every time he opens his mouth, he ends up putting his foot into
it. Once again he has goofed up with the <I>Aaj</I> interview
and ended up being in the news for al the wrong reasons. Though
his observations aren't without some merit, what he seems to have
forgotten is that he is no more a mere rabble-rouser. Being the
loyal minister of His Majesty has it's limitations, one of them
is circumspection. Since I am free from any such obligations,
allow me to agree with the views attributed to the Honourable
Minister!
<P>
It's difficult to deny that India is the fulcrum of Nepalese foreign
policy. The more we try to disown this geographic, historic, religious,
cultural and economic legacy; the more we get entangled in it's
mess. Unfortunately, our insecurity does not allow us to face
reality and <I>then </I>make efforts to alter it to our advantage.
The blind fury of an elephant caught in the marshy swamp makes
it sink deeper and the more Nepal tries to shake off Indian influence,
the stronger it gets.
<P>
Nepali rulers' distrust dates back to the days of a conquering
prince of Himalayan hills who travelled to Kashi to acquire a
<I>Gotra</I> and thereby the divine right to rule a kingdom he
had built out of almost nothing. Probably the <I>pandasi </I>
of the city-eternal didn't accord him the respect that he thought
was his due. Or may be the merchants cheated him just as they
treat any one from the hills even now. Be as it may, when the
prince matured into a Greatly King; he neither forgot nor forgave.
he enshrined his way of getting back at his tormentors in a guide
for his successors. To this day, this 'enlightened discourse'
and the diatribe contained in it against Indians continues to
be the anchor-block of our foreign policy.
<P>
Indians have their own reasons for not trusting us. The cow-belt
elite hasn't forgiven us for our valour in the aid of beleaguered
John company fighting off a Sepoy Mutiny. Incidentally, Indians
call it their First war of Independence. Barrels of Nepali blood
shed for Indian defence in subsequent decades hasn't been able
to wash that blot on the psyche of India's post-independence establishment.
Slightest show of our individuality alarms them in deciphering
a Chinese, an American or, believe-it-or-not, even a Pakistani
plot of destabilising their union! If it were not true, one would
have had a good laugh at the joke. Unfortunately, this kind of
defensive handling caused by mistrust ends up hardening the attitude
of insecure Nepali decision makers who are constantly fighting
to 'create' a personality free from the shadow of the big Brother.
Thus, the vicious circle of doubt, suspicion, mistrust and insecurity
breading some more of the same continues unabated. To be sure,
Indians have a genuine problem. If they try to be accommodating,
the signal is misread as patronising in Kathmandu, probably the
reason why they haven't done that very often. Similarly, if they
bargain hard, they end up looking belligerent. Now, as any professional
diplomat will prefer any day; South Block has learnt to proffer
the notoriety of the latter rather than the stigma of the former.
<P>
Perhaps thee is one more reason behind the brusque behaviour of
Indian establishment towards their immediate neighbours. They
have an exaggerated pride in theirs' being what they pompously
call 'the most populous democracy in the world; when the members
of the Indian Diplomatic Corpse travel to the <I>really </I> important
world capitals, their middling status promptly deflates their
self-worth Back on home-turf in the sub-continent, they lash out
at their immediate neighbours with the ferocity of an enraged
defeated boxer hitting out at his punch-bag in the basement. sometimes,
the punch-bag rebounds. It's but natural.
<P>
It does not help matter any that Indian diplomatic corpse is elitist
in spite of being a meritocracy. The anglicised bible-Brahmans
of South Block prefer to be pucca brown-sahibs and refuse to accept
that any one who does not agree with them in everything is not
necessarily an enemy. combining the worst of Indian caste system
and English hypocracy, their disdain for their 'up-start' neighbours
is perceptible. Their shenanigans in the SAARC capitals reinforces
their image of being from the ministry of 'external affairs' rather
than the foreign ministry and one does not need to have read the
exploits of Tirmizi of Pakistan to take note of that.
<P>
Commenting on Indo-Nepalese relations, an Indian leader is reported
to have remarked that they couldn't do anything about their size.
Now, that's a lie. For a start, they can stop throwing their girth
around. Relationship between a cat and a tiger is difficult enough
without the wild one roaring too often. Reassuring the weak is
the responsibility of the strong. There are no exceptions.
