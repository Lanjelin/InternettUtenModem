<b><h3>Media Musing</h3></b>

The fate of the Mahakali accord continues to be the main focus
of the national print-media with positive and negative commentaries
on the eve of its presentation to the joint-sitting of the current
session of parliament.  The constituents of the 3-party coalition
are doing everything in their might and the CPN-UML is likely
to announce their game-plan this week. The print-media had a field
day. Going by their Thursday's rampage in observance of <I>Gai-Jatra,</I>
an annual religious and cultural event, through the ages by taking
out special supplements in lampooning the dramatise personae in
political life .Moreover other fields of national interest for
their yearlong misdeeds, failures, folliesand foibles to the readers
content. Cartoonists, too did not fall behind to convey the general
mood of the people, one of dismay, distrust and disquiet. This
feeling of being badly let down by the political leaders whether
in power or in opposition are put forth through caricatures and
on -stage performances. This has laid bare the underlying message.
As the government is on its way in completing a year in power
belying the previous expectation of completing - the opposition
is only to be blamed for propagating this impasse. The latters
unity too is in shambles dented due to the internal differences
over the Mahakali accord. In the meantime, a section of print
media and opposition lawmakers have taken exception to the reported
statement of a visiting British Parliamentary Under Secretary
for Foreign Common wealth affair over the ratification of Mahakali
accord to the press person before the leaving Kathmandu. This
may affect the countries chances to receive capital investment
from abroad. This, act the superficial level looks rather unusual.
A British Minister, of all persons to have thrown weight behind
a bilateral matter of this  stature. 
<P>
Even the alleged pressure by Kathmandu  based US envoy Sandra
Vogelson as attributed by some dailies, is at variance with the
junior British Minister's comments. The US envoy, is believe to
have dissociated her government stance. Thus, the main objective
behind the reported the pressure was on the other hand was use
by a section of  CPN-UML leadership to get political mileage for
itself by sustaining the suspense over the contentious accord.
This instance act as an indicator of the major policy differences
even among western allies over the global issues.

The other major national print-media item was the untimely demise
of 72-year old ailing Mangala Devi - wife of senior Democratic
leader, Ganesh Man Singh. The deserved coverage accorded to her
    profiled her courage, determination and leadership qualities.
She rightly considered Vanguard of the struggle against Rana's
early fifty's and the guiding force behind the restoration of
multiparty democracy after 1960. A pionner of the womens equality
and freedom  and to create and organisational edifice, she made
history in the filled of social reforms. The void caused by her
death is difficult to be filled. The condolences that poured in,
irrespective of party hues and ideologies sure admiration and
esteem for a sole of her starter.

Though not of this magnitude a section of natural print-media
did record the demise of Narayan Prasad Banskota, 74 and ailing
for protracted illness. He carved a niche for himself in the field
of the kingdom's literally journalism with a long stant as the
Director of information. He founded and edited a prestigious literacy
monthly for many years with contemporary Nepali poets, and writers.
He has associated for quite a time as board of director of the
Gurkha Patra Corporation, the Rastrya Sambad Summitee, Shakha
Publication and member secretary of the press council in the initial
stages. As sympathiser of the Nepali Congress and promoter of
wortling causes, he made myriads contribution to political, social
and eductions institutions. Despite no let-up in the Prime Minister
bashing by G.P. Koirala faithfuls and press loyal to him, some
print media report the coalition far from being on the brink of
collapse. Be this as it may, HURON president seems to be actively
engaged in bringing MHG and Dr. Babu Ram led Maoists to the negotiating
table after months of rampaging in various districts. While this
could be a welcome beginning, the search for a new face to head
the ministry of finance. But the most deplorable aspect igniting
serious concern was the complacent attitude of the ministry of
civil Aviation and tourism about the success of the visit Nepal
year 1998. This happens against the backdrop of the Lufthansa,
withdrawal from kingdom. The German flag carrier the only decent
linkage with Europe with Nepal and the only prestigious foreign
airline in views of the fast dwindling tourist traffic and high
airport traffic, its exit is truly a big blow for the country.

The busting of powerful gangs connected with the commercial exploitation
of girls ranging from seven to sixteen years of age in Brussels
and Vienna has been brought to light y the global media with both
shock and revulsion. This was focussed promptly Stockholm conference
held 3 day last week for the first time to combat sexual abuse
and commercial exploitation of girls in their adulthood for world-wide
pornographic purposes leading a further aggravation of AIDS cases.
Ten to 12 million girls are stated to be victims in Asia with
Nepal and India climbing thousands and thousands though Deuki
practices - a kind of religious rituals rampantly observed in
Terai area. This has been an area for beyond the reaches and concern
of Human Rights Organisations.
