<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Dwarika's Village Hotel is a unique place in South Asia.It is a functioning proof that tourism does not destroy heritage and the environment.On the contrary it has demonstrated that a proper blending of cultural restoration and tourism leads to the preser
vation of historical artifacts and contributes to the growth of skills and  culture that would  otherwise have eroded from crass commercialism .It has shown that heritage can be preserved and be used  for further preservation works. Infact, it may yet be 
the model to demonstrate what must be done to preserve the look of Kathmandu Valley-- a stepping stone towards the larger and more gigantic task of rehabilitating the uniqueness and beauty of Kathmandu under severe environmental and cultural stress of unc
ontrolled modernity at present

Dwarika's  Kathmandu Village Hotel is like no other hotel in the world. It has not been constructed but, has been put together. Every piece of the fascinating edifice is an original object of art that was once a part of some ancient building. The hotel's 
exqusitely carved doors, windows, pillars and beams have been painstakingly salvaged from all over Kathmandu. They come from centuries-old dwellings that were being razed to make way for modern concrete complexes, or other that were simply falling apart w
ith the ravages of time. <p>

The components were collected and lovingly restored, and the damaged portions were recreated by master crafsmen. They were inserted into the hotel building, and gradually the hotel grew. The builders relearned old skill in wood craft. When they found out 
that the special bricks needed for the traditonal house facade were not available anymore, they manufactured their own. The result of this effort is a museum of the Kathmandu Valley. Dwarika's Kathmandu Village Hotel came out of one man's lifelong quest t
o preserve the architectural glory of Kathmandu--the late Dwarika Das Shrestha. <p>
<h3>HISTORY</h3>
It all started when one day  44 years ago in 1952 Mr. Shrestha came upon two carpenters who were sawing an exquisite 
pillar from a traditional house into timber.  Aghast that the labour of a skill that took centuries to 
develop was about to be destroyed, Mr. Shrestha offered to buy new timber for them if they would 
give him the old pillar.  After that, it went on to become a one-man crusade.  He began scouring the 
alleyways and courtyards all over the Kathmandu Valley, picking up a door here and a window there, 
saving whatever he could of the old architectural pieces..<P>
Pretty soon, the collection grew to a sizeable proportion. Moreover, it was also starting to become an 
expensive pursuit.  Building a hotel from this hoard of woodcraft was only logical as it would provide 
the funds to continue the work and the setting for the preservation  and restoration of the artifacts.  
Dwarika's Kathmandu Village Hotel thus became the fulfillment of a lifelong passion. <b>The world soon noticed.</b> In 1980 , Pacific Asia Travel Association(PATA) awarded Dwarika's with the PATA Excellene Award for a remarkable contribution to heritage c
onservation. In 1990, Dwarika's was honored with the Spirit of Enterprise Rolex Award.<p>
<h3>TODAY</h3>
The hotel is not simply another commercal operation: it is mainly the manifestation of an effort at restoring and preserving a culture. But, and this is the difference with other heritage restoration projects, the late Dwarika Das realized that a massive 
work without a firm commercial foundation would eventually not be financially viable. This perception shaped his decision to give his beloved wood carvings not a dead museum-like setting but life restored to a living environment. In a museum, they would b
e fossils of  dead past, whereas in a commercially operated hotel art lovres could not only see the art but live it and enjoy it, at the same time contribute to its upkeep and maintenance as hotel guests.<p>
This approach makes Dwarika's Village Hotel a unique place in South Asia.
Nowhere else is heritage restoration being attempted in a way that rejuvenates it and makes it a part today's living environment.<p>
In the attempt to bring the refined elements of 15th Century art into the 20th Century, Dwarika's is in a constant struggle of self-exploration. Every element, from the design and manufacture of bricks and other civil engineering structures to layout of s
pace such as quadrangles and offices, from the lovation of restoration workshops for wood carvers to the training of workers to think and act as in the best possible ways that their forbearers would have five centuries ago, has had to be explored and re-c
reated. In this way, Dwarika's represents the larger process of revitalizing a sublime element of a Neoali as well ads a World heritage.<p>
Dwarika Das Shrestha passed away on February 1992; but his work continues. His vision of cultural restoration, based on a strong feel for the beauty of a bygone era but resting on today's sound commercial commansense, guides the work and activities of the
 establishment he has left behind.<p>
