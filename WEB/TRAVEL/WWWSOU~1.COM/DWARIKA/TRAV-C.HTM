<H5>Nepal Treks and Natural History Expedition (P.) Ltd.</H5> a
subsidiary company of Kathmandu Travels has been specially
set up to Ús  and cars. The guides and representatives can  converse
fluently  in  English  and  some foreign  languages.  They  are
specially chosen and trained to take care of the visitors  from
arrival  till  departure. Our visitors are  not  just  "another
tourist" for us. We treat them as our guests and strive to  win
their  friendship  which  accounts for that  little  difference
between us and our competitors.
