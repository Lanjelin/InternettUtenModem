<P>
With  our  Headquarters  in Kathmandu and  representation  in
Germany,  U.S.A.  and  Japan, we are  now  handling  the  tour
arrangements not only in Nepal but also in India, Bhutan, and
Tibet  for  a  number of prestigious travel organisations  all
over the world.
<P>
Kathmandu Travels & Tours has transport fleet of about 25 delux
coaches  and cars. The guides and representatives can  converse
fluently  in  English  and  some foreign  languages.  They  are
specially chosen and trained to take care of the visitors  from
arrival  till  departure. Our visitors are  not  just  "another
tourist" for us. We treat them as our guests and strive to  win
their  friendship  which  accounts for that  little  difference
between us and our competitors.
