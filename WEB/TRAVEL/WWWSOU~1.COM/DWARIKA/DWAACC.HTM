Each of the 30 rooms has its own character and individuality. There is a 16th century window in 
one, a private little courtyard attached to another, different Buddhist symbols incorporated on 
hand printed curtains and bedspreads are in still other rooms. What is common in all the rooms 
is that they are all first class rooms with spacious bathrooms.<P>
