<H4>Background</H4>
<p>
Nepal in it's effort to industrialise, has so far implemented seven developmental plans. From the Fifth Plan (1975-80) onwards the focus has significantly shifted from establishmet of infrastructural facilities and agricultural development to maximisation of industrial output and its equitable distribution.
<P>
However, Nepal is still in early stages of industrial development and is therefore an attractive proposition for industrial investment. Indian companies, backed by their experience and capablities developed in the field of appropriate technology with emphasis on employment orientation and export promotion, can play a very positive role in furthering the process of industrialisation by joining hands with their counterparts in Nepal. Comparative advantages in terms of geographical proximity, efficient communication links between India and Nepal, free convertibility fo Indian currency in Nepal, Inida's capability to provide servies are some of the other positive features which could facilitate joint ventures between the two countries.
<P>
At present there are 12 Indo-Nepalese joint ventures. Out of these 7 are in the manufacturing sector (with a total investment of Indian Rs. 169. lakhs i.e. about 2% of our total global investment) 2 are in exploration of minerals and 2 in the hotel industry and one in tourism. a list of on-going Indo-Nepalese Joint Ventures is given in Annexure.
