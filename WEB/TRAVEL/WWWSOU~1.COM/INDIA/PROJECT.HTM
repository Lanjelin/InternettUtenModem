<h3>Indo-Nepal Trade</h3>
<P>
	<UL><LI>Due to geographical reasons and traditional linkages, the trade and economic relations between India and Nepal are very close and unique.<P>
<P>
	<LI>The bilateral trade relations are centuries old, trade having been carried out traditionally on barter basis. Till the 50s and 60s, trade with India constituted over 90% of Nepal's overall trade.  With Nepal's gradua diversification of its trade, India's share  in Nepal's trade has declined, for example from 82.2% in 1974-75 to 29.0% in 1994-95.  Yet, India continues to be Nepal's predominant trade partner. India's importance to Nepalese economy is also on account of the fact that  the illegal trade across the open India-Nepal border constitutes a significant volume of Nepal's trade.  It would be an understatement to state that illegal Nepal-India trade is the cornerstore of Nepalese economy.  Besides, India is the primary source of capital and machinery for industrialisation of Nepal.<P>
<P>
  	<LI>During 1994-95, India's share in Nepal's trade  was 29%, in exports 18.8%, and in imports 31.7%.  In absolute terms, Nepal's imports from India during this period amounted to NRs 20.8 billion, and exports to India NRs 3.4 billion.<P>
<P>
	<LI>Major Indian exports to Nepal include machinery, transport equipment, tobacco, rice, tea, coffee, cotton and cotton yarn, fabrics, coal, spices, sugar, miscellaneous processed goods, drugs &amp  pharmaceuticals, and iron &amp  steel.  As regards imports from Nepal, hides and skins, leather, oil seeds, vegetabls oils, essential oils, pulses, cereal preparations, readymade garments and chemicals constitute the bulk.<P>
<P>
	<LI>The bilateral trade balance is greatly in favour of India.  Among the several reasons for this are Nepal's underdeveloped industrial base, narrow range of exports, facility of easy import of daily use items from India, including import of raw material for some of Nepal's major exports such as readymade garments, and unauthorised trade through the long and open border.<P>
<P>
	<LI>For statistical purposes, during 1994-95, 36.5% of  Nepal's trade deficit was on account of trade with India.  Since the additional concessions granted to Nepal at the time of conclusion of  the Treaty of Trade of 1991, the Nepalese exports to India have risen at a consistent rate of 35% per annum.  This has helped address the consistent Nepalese complaints of the rising trade gap in bilateral trade.<P>
<P>
	<LI>Nepal's overall BOP position with India is far more healthy.  As the Indian Rupees income accruing to Nepal through invisibles like tourism, Gorkha pensions and welfare, remittances by Nepalese settled in India, excise duty refund, and not but not the least,  hawala transactions,  is more than the bilateral trade deficit, Nepal has always had adequate Indian Rupee resources to pay for its imports from India.   <P>
<P>
<h3>Treaty Of Trade, Treaty Of Transit And Agreement  For<BR>
Operation To Control Unauthorised Trade</h3>

	<LI>Formal trade relations between the two countries were established in 1951 with the signing of the Treaty of Trade.  It was modified and renewed in 1961 and 1971, and incorporated provisions regarding transit facilities extended by India for Nepal's trade with third country, as well as on cooperation to control unauthorised trade - mainly smuggling of third country goods from Nepal into India.  In 1978, instead of a single treaty, three different agreements were signed as indicated in the heading above.  These have since been modified; the currently valid Treaties/Agreements were signed on December 6, 1991.  Some salient amendments to these were subsequently effected through Exchange of letters on February 16, 1993, in pursuance of the understandings agreed between Prime Ministers of the two countries.<P>
<P>
	<LI>Under the Treaty of Trade, both countries allow free trade between them in agreed primary products.  Additionally India provides, on a non-reciprocal basis, duty free access and without quantitative restrictions, to the Indian market for Nepalese manufactured articles which contain not less than 50% of "Nepalese labour content, Nepalese material content and the Indian material content" barring a short negative list.  In 1971, such facility was available for Nepalese manufactured items containing not less than 90% of Nepalese material or Nepalese/Indian material, but the provision has since been progressively relaxed in stages.  Such imports from Nepal are now facilitated through a simple procedure of certificates of origin issued by HMGN.  In certain cases, the requirement of the 50% may be reduced by upto 40%.  Imports from Nepal remain subject to Indian countervailing duty or "additional duty" but CVD may be reduced for items manufactured in 'small' units in Nepal.<P>
<P>
	<LI>On its part, Nepal extends to imports from India 20% reduction in rates of import duties on goods 
attracting upto 40% customs tariff, and 10% reduction in import duties on goods attracting customs tariff of 
more than 40% and upto 110%. <P>
<P>
	<LI>Under another provision of the Treaty, India allows and facilitates supply of certain essential 
commodities which are normally not exportable from India but are needed in Nepal.  The list of such items for the current year includes baby food, milk products, cotton, waste cotton, cotton yarn, sugar, rectified spirit and rice.<P>
<P>
	<LI>Trade transactions are in local currencies.  However, India has agreed to payments in convertible 
currencies for exports from India, alongwith the normal benefits for such exports.<P>
<P>
	<LI>Under the Treaty of Transit, India provides for Nepal's trade with third countries port facilities at 
Calcutta, including procedural and other concessions, and the facility of 15 points of entry/exist on Indo-Nepal border and as many transit routes to Calcutta.  The international obligation is for one transit route to the sea.  In addition, India has provided 22 entry/exist points along Indo-Nepal  border for bilateral trade and for Nepal-Nepal transit, and a route by rail to Bangladesh through Radhikapur for Nepal's trade with Bangladesh and for Nepal's overseas trade via Bangaldesh.  Nepal's traffic in transit through Indian territory is exempt from Indian customs duty and from all transit duties  or  other  charges  except  for transportation.  <P>
<P>
India has also agreed, in principle, to allow Nepal to avail of the facilities at Bombay and Kandla ports  for transit of  Nepalese imports from third countries.  However, the modalities of the proposed arrangement are yet to be worked out.  <P>
<P>
	<LI>There are separate arrangements for airlinks; Royal Nepal Airlines flies to Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, 
Patna and Varanasi.  Merchant ships sailing under the flag of Nepal are accorded MNF treatment at the Indian ports.<P>
<P>
	<LI>Under the Agreement of Cooperation to Control Unauthorised Trade, the two governments are to 
cooperate with each other to prevent violation of laws of each other, interalia, in order to ensure that economic interests of the other party are not adversely affected such as through unauthorised trade across the border.<P>

<h3>Consultations</H3>
<P>
	<LI>Matters pertaining to trade, transit and control of unauthorised trade are reviewed periodically in the forum of the Inter-Governmental Committee constituted for this purpose.  More important or policy issues, as well as trade promotion measures, are discussed in the Sub-Group on Trade within the framework of the Indo-Nepal Joint Commission.  A High Level Task Force (HLTF) was set up in February 1991 to monitor the progress and implementation of projects being executed in Nepal with Indian cooperation.  At business level, the Confederation of Indian Industries and the Federation of Nepal's Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) have set up a Joint Task Force to promote interaction in mutually beneficial areas and identification of ways and means whereby Indian investments in Nepal and Nepalese exports to Indian can be enhanced.  <P>

	<LI>A recent important consultation meeting between the two sides in regard to trade and transit etc matters was held during the visit of former Prime Minister of Nepal Man Mohan Adhikari to India in April 1995, when new concessions, facilitating Nepal's trade and transit through India were granted.  These concessions included the decision to allow Nepal the use of Bombay and Kandla ports for import of third country goods and development of dry port facilities including customs clearance at  Raxaul.   <P>

<H3>Joint Ventures</H3>
<P>
	<LI>HMGN has recently adopted the policy, in its liberalisation process of attracting foreign investment 
particularly Indian investment into Nepal, for setting up JVs including for third country exports and on buy-back basis. Such JVs could make a significant impact to narrow the trade deficit between the two countries.  While Nepal offers several benefits for investment, such as free access to the large Indian market, it may still need to overcome several problem areas - real or perceived  - before investments materialises at levels as hoped for.<P>
<P>
	<LI>The total number of Indian joint ventures registered in Nepal is 95.   These joint ventures account for 40% of all foreign investment in Nepal.  <P>
<P>
<H3>Aid to Nepal</H3>
<P>
	<LI>Over the past four decades, India has extended very substantial economic and technical assistance to 
Nepal's developmental efforts.  The initial thrust of the Indian aid programme was in infrastructural projects, 
including roads, bridges, airports, telecommunication, power and irrigation.  Now these projects also included health, education and the industrial sector.  Over 118 agreements for Indian aided projects, apart from water resources development, totalling Rs 343 crores, have been concluded so far The Indian aid has averaged Rs 15 to 20 crores a year; it would be around Rs 22 crores during the current year.  In terms of grant assistance, India's contribution in Nepal's developmental activities remains major.  In addition, supply of essential commodities at subsidised prices involves assistance to the tune of Rs 50 crore every year; and the refund of excise duties to HMGN was Rs 38 crores in 1993-94.<P>
<P>
<H3>Vehicular Traffic</H3>
<P>
	<LI>Presently, vehicles from the other country crossing over the border are regulated by ad hoc 
administrative regulations of each country.  On the Indian side, Nepalese vehicles are allowed entry into India for specified periods on the basis of a bank guarantee/insurance without charging any customs duty or any other levy.  The requirement is waived in serval categories including for vehicels operated by HMGN.  For entry into Nepal, Indian vehicles are allowed a free period of 7 days, beyond which they are subject to a levy of Rs 100-500 per day depending upon the period of stay in Nepal.  It is proposed to conclude a bilateral agreement on trans-border movement of motor vehicles in order to streamline the procedures from both sides.<P>

<H3>Indian Aided Projects In Nepal - An Overview</H3>
<P>
       <LI>Economic relations between India and Nepal have been in existence from time immemorial though 
economic cooperation in the modern sense may be said to have commenced with the advent of independent India in 1947.<P>
<P>
      <LI>On a request from His Majesty's Government of Nepal, India started the construction of the aerodrome at Kathmandu and the Tribhuvan Rajpath connecting Kathmandu with Raxaul, the Indian border town, in the early '50s.  This was the beginning.  Around the same time a separate body was set up to execute projects with Indian technical and financial assistance in Nepal.   The focus of India's assistance in the beginning was on the infrastructural development of Nepal and Indian activities cooperated in the first two five-year-plans of Nepal.  Later, other donor countries and international bodies started participating in the economic development of Nepal.  Although at present India's contribution to Nepal's economy is a small percentage of total aid received by Nepal from other sources, in absolute financial terms Indian aid has increased manifold.  From the available records, it is observed that so far over 118 agreements/letters of exchange have been concluded for the Indian aided projects in Nepal totalling some IRs.343 crores.<P>
<P>

       <LI>In the <B>Surface Transport Sector</B>, about 70% of the East- West Highway (a total length of more than 1000 kms.) roads from Kathmandu to Dakshinkali, Trishuli, Balaju, Godavari and Raxaul via Hetauda, are the main contributions of India.  Other important roads constructed by India include Sunauli to Pokhara, Rajbiraj to Koshi Barrage and Janakpur town road.  India has also constructed a number of bridges on these roads and separately two bridges on the river Bagmati at Kathmandu and one on the river Mohana.  The bridge on the river Sirsiya  between the towns of Raxaul on the Indian side and Birgunj on the Nepalese side has recently been completed   and opened for traffic movement. <P>
 <P>
  	<LI>In the <B>Health Sector</B>, India has been associated with the construction/expansion work in case of Paropkar Hospital, Bir Hospital and Police Hospital, all at Kathmandu. Since the last 22 years, India has also been assisting in Goitre Control through the supply of iodised salt to Nepal.  Five ambulances were also gifted to the Nepal Red Cross Society recently.<P>

   	<LI><B>Three Industrial Estates</B>, one each at Patan, Nepalganj, and Dharan  have been constructed by India.  Recently, Government of India assisted in the cosntruction of an Industrial Estate at Rajbiraj at a total cost of IRs.2.5 crores.   Apart from the Tribhuvan Airport, India has constructed a number of airports at various locations including Janakpur, Biratnagar, etc.  <P>

	<LI>In the<B> Education Sector</B>, India has contributed towards the development of Tribhuvan 
University, Engineering School, development of National Archives, etc.  India has recently constructed a Library, Museum-cum-Documentation centre at the Institute of Forestry, Hetauda at a total cost of IRs. 2.6 crores. The renovation/repair work has recently been completed and the Museum building would be shortly handed over to the HMGN authorities.  Government of India contributed IRs.2.5 crores towards the development of Lumbini Museum.  Books worth IRs.7 lakhs were also presented by GoI for the Lumbini Library which was built with the assistance of the Government of Japan.  The GoI would also supply  exhibits for the Lumbini Museum .   India has been regularly deputing experts to various Departments of Universities and Hospitals.  GoI has also been assisting the various Educational Institutions in Nepal by way of gifting books for their Libraries. India has also been associated in such other sectors as Posts and Telecommunications, village and town development, urban development and Traffic Management, forestry, horticulture, veterinary sciences, geological investigation, etc.<P>

     <LI>In the <B>Telecommunication  Sector</B>, India has assisted in setting-up and commissioning of 
Telephone Exchange and cable network at Rangeli.  This exchange has 256 ports capacity and is equipped with 150 subscribers lines.<P>

       <LI>Government of India released an amount of IRs.1.5 crores  during l993-94 towards supply of Corrugated Galvanised Iron sheets for emergency construction of houses for flood affected victims.  Also, GoI supplied 10,000 mt. tons of rice worth IRs.12 crores for the flood affected victims.<P>

<h3>Important ongoing Indian projects in Kathmandu</h3>
<P>
         <LI> After the construction of the Out-Patient Department and supply of modern equipment to Bir Hospital, India has agreed to undertake a 200-bed-Super Speciality Centre expansion project at the same hospital.  Government of India have appointed the Consultant for this Project and the site plans and architectural parameters are under preparation in consultation with HMGN authorities.  A High Level Task Force for discussing the various Project parameters etc have been formed from the HMGN side and Indian side.    The Bilateral Agreement between HMGN and GoI for setting up of this Project would be concluded shortly.  In 1991 the resident doctors' quarters and a research wing have been constructed at the Paropkar Hospital.  Recently,  GoI has agreed to assist Paropkar Hospital in  establishment of  Neo-natal Intensive care Unit and Intensive Care Unit for adults at the Hospital.  This announcement was made by Ambassador of India to Nepal Mr. K.V. Rajan in a function held recently on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee Birthday of His Majesty the King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. For the ex-servicemen in Nepal, a number of ongoing welfare projects undertaken by Go I which,interalia, include "Supply of Drinking water" and "Medicine Packs " are helping in improving their quality of life after their return to civilian life.  For execution of these projects, GoI extend financial assistance of IRs. 1 crore every year.    India has been contributing towards the repair work and supply of materials to the Tulsi Mehar Ashram. For Kathmandu Municipality, Government of India have recently supplied wide variety of sophisticated cleaning equipment ranging from dumper placers, containers, water sprinklers, cranes, etc., towards cleaning up of the capital city.   The services of Indian experts are also being extended to Tribhuvan University, Nepal Creative Art Trust, Kathmandu Municipalilty and Bir Hospital in Kathmandu. <P>
<P>
<h3>Important ongoing Indian Projects outside Kathmandu</h3>
<p>
	<LI>Currently, a project on the development of  B.P. Koirala Institute of Health  Sciences at Dharan, Nepal is under construction at a cost of NRs.1280 million.  The construction work for phase - I of the project has been completed and the first session of MBBS at the Institute started from October, 1994.  The selection of a faculty members and medical equipment/machinery for the first session of the MBBS has also been completed.  The Nepalese Prime Minister had  laid the foundation stone in October 1994 for construction of phase-II of the building. The civil construction work, of  Phase II has been split into part I, part II and part III.  The  Part I civil  construction work have already commenced and Part II of Phase II would commence shortly.  Phase II would cover  the construction of the new hospital building of 350 beds and a college building along with other ancilliary service buildings, so as to eventually provide a 500-bed teaching hospital.  Facilities like supply of bulk electricity, bulk water, approach roads and accommodation would be provided by the HMGN authorities.   The entire project would be completed by December 1998. As on date, 25 doctors from India are on deputation with the Institute.<P>

	<LI>Road work on a 203-kms. length has been completed in 1992 at the Kohalpur-Mahakali sector of the East-West Highway at the total cost of IRs.50 crores.  India has taken up the "Construction of 22 bridges" on the same Kohalpur-Mahakali sector of the East-West Highway.  Government of India have awarded consultancy and project management contracts to the two Consultants namely - M/s. Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) and M/s. National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) for construction of 22 bridges.  This project is being taken up on turn-key basis.  Indian delegations comprising of officials from Governemnt of India and consultants from  RITES and NATPAC.visited the project site  and carried out a joint survey for construction of 22  bridges at 51 kms. to 127 kms. of Kohalpur - Mahakali sector.   The site plans and drawings have been discussed with HMGN authorities and  have been finalised.  The tendering process is underway and very shortly the contractors would mobilise at the site.  The Government of India have recently supplied two Diesel locomotives and six railway coaches to Janakpur Railways, Nepal, at a total cost of IRs.4.5 crores.   The RITES team is at the track site to train the Nepalese drivers and upgrade the railway track between Jayanagar and Janakpur. GoI has recently agreed to supply two additional diesel locomotives and twelve coaches for Janakpur Railways at a total cost of approximately I Rs. 6 Crores.<P>
</UL>
	<UL><LI> Go I has also agreed in principle to construct a Broad Gauge rail link between 	  Raxaul and Birgunj.<P>
	<LI> A joint survey for East-West Electric Railway in Nepal will soon be conducted 	  by GoI. <P>
	<LI>The work on the proposal  on construction of Outer Ring Road in Janakpur  under greater 
Janakpur Development Project  which was agreed to by GoI in   June, 1994 would start shortly.<P>
	<LI> The  feasibility studies of constructing the road between Chatra- Birpur and  Biratnagar-Rangeli-Bhadrapur have been completed by the consultants and  are under examination with the Government of  India.   <P>

<h3>India-Nepal Cooperation in Hydro Power Sector</h3>
<P>
	<LI>The hydro-power sector represents a window of opportunity for bilateral cooperation between India and Nepal in view of the fact that Nepal has one of the largest hydro-power potential in the world which still remains to be utilised.  The Nepalese Government has liberalised the policy of investment in hydro-power sector which enables Indian private companies to be able to invest in Nepal.  There is also an Action Plan for bilateral India-Nepal cooperation at inter-governmental level with a view to focus attention on important hydro-power schemes in Nepal which can be developed with bilateral cooperation.    These includes the Sapta Kosi High Dam, Pancheswor Multi-purpose Project, Buri Gandaki Project, Karnali Project.  Under the Action Plan, the two countries are also working together on Flood Control and Prevention in the Gangetic plains including the tributaries of the Ganges.  <P>
