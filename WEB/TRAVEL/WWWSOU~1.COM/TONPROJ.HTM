<H4>THE ANNAPURNA CONSERVATION AREA PROJECT (ACAP)</H4><P>

Under the aegis of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation, ACAP was launched in 
1986 as an innovative concept in the protected area management system of the country, 
covering an area of over 7,000 sq.km. with a wealth of biological diversity. ACAP has five 
regional headquarters located in Ghandruk, Sikles, Bhujung, Manang and Jomsom and two 
sub-regional headquarters in Lwang and Lo-Manthang . The conservation area embraces the 
multiple land use principles of resource management, combining environmental protection with 
sustainable community development. As the catchment of one of the major river systems in the 
Himalayas, the Annapurna Basin is not only of aesthetic value to foreign visitors but also vital to 
the conservation of soil, water and other natural resources of Nepal. Traditional subsistence 
activities are woven into a framework of sound resource management, supplemented by small-
scale conservation, development and alternate energy programs to minimize the negative 
impacts of tourism and enhance the local standard of living.The "users' fee" levied on visitors is 
used for ACAP's development and conservation activities in the region.

ACAP has a grassroots philosophy and involves the local people in all aspects of the 
conservation and development process. By empowering the local people with appropriate skills, 
knowledge, technical and financial assistance, ACAP helps the villagers to improve their quality 
of life now and for the future. Recognizing that environmental and social problems are 
inseparable, ACAP strives to strengthen the cultural integrity of the area as well. The main focus 
of ACAP is the Conservation Education and Extension Program. ACAP believes that without 
increasing the level of awareness of both villagers and visitors, lasting environmental protection 
and preservation of cultural diversity cannot be achieved.<P>

In order to best assure a responsible approach to tourism management in Upper Mustang, His 
Majesty's Government of Nepal, Ministry of Tourism, delegated the responsibility of managing 
the Upper Mustang  Conservation and Development Project (UMCDP) to ACAP. ACAP's 
office for UMCDP was established in Lo Manthang in December 1992. As in other ACAP 
areas, the cornerstones of UMCDP are conservation, people's participation and sustainability. 
UMCDP is working with local communities in the fields of natural resource conservation, 
heritage conservation, community development, alternate energy and tourism development.<BR>
