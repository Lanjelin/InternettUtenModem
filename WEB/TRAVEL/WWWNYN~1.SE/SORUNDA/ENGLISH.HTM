Sorunda parish with its billowing plains and valleys between a couple of beautiful, mighty ores which stretches out from the north.
<br>
<br>
A few tranquil, glittering lakes where even cranes find their peace. In the west, the coast with all of its boatlife and fishing. The forrest with its pantry of berries and wildlife which has fed people for milleniums. Tilled fields which mostly gives good harvests...
<br>
<br>
Sorunda has about 2 500 inhabitants and lies on Södertörn, barely 5 miles south of Stockholm.
