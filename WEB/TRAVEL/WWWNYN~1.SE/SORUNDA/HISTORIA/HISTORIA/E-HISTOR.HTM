When the inland ice melted 10 000 years ago, southern Södertörn was lifted out of the sea and created a archipelago with islands popping up over the water. Sorunda became a part of the coast where hunters and fishermen could set camp and find food.
<br>
<br>
Traces of these first humans in Sorunda are there today, as ancient remains from the later part of the Stone Age. For example the finds at Fagersjön and in Stora Vika.
<br>
<br>
The farming Bronze Age-humans who for about 3-4000 years ago lived in Grimsta has left rock-carvings with motifes of ships and hundreds of so-called cup-shaped cavities.
<br>
<br>
In the Iron Age, during the time of the Great Migration 500-600 AD, the villages people was buried in huge grave-mounds which dominates the landscape at for example Berga and Billsta. The runestones from the late Viking Age became the memories from the 1100-century which tells most about what the early farmers of Sorunda was named and where they lived.
<br>
<br>
By its geographical position at "the end of the world", Sorunda has been preserved from the worst exploitation. Here are villages with ancestry the Medievial Times and traditions that has lived through generations.
