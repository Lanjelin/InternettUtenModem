<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><b>When the SALT Treaty called for the de-activation of the 18
Titan missile silos that ring Tucson, volunteers at the Pima Air
Museum asked if one could be retained for public tours. After
much negotiation, including additional talks with SALT officials,
the Green Valley complex of the 390th Strategic Missile Wing was
opened to the public. </b></p>

<h3><b>What You'll See</b></h3>

<p><b>After watching a video about the history of the Titan and
its deadly nuclear delivery capability, you're taken deep in to
the &quot;hardened&quot; command center. Here, essential
equipment--indeed the center itself--is mounted on springs to
withstand anything but a direct hit. Then you pass through a
couple of 6,000 pound blast doors and walk along a space-age
corridor to the silo itself. The 110 foot tall missile weighed
170 tons when it was fueled and ready to fly. It's empty and
harmless now, but it still looks deadly, crouched on its launch
pad.</b></p>

<h3><b>Public Tours Dates and Times</b></h3>

<p><b>The Titan Missile museum is open from 9am to 5pm Wednesday
- Sunday from May through October and daily from November through
April. One hour tours start every hour, with the last at 4pm.
Call (602) 625-7736 for additional information.</b></p>

<h3><b>How to Get There</b></h3>

<p><b>The Titan Missile Museum is located in Green Valley, about
20 miles south of Tucson, Arizona. Take I-19 south to exit 69 and
head west for about half a mile until you see the signs on the
right.</b></p>
