<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><b>Operated by the Department of Energy (DOE), the National
Atomic Museum contains a large collection of declassified nuclear
technology. Since its opening in 1969, the objective of the
National Atomic museum has been to provide a readily accessible
repository of educational materials, and information on the
Atomic Age. In addition, the museum's goal is to preserve,
interpret, and exhibit to the public memorabilia of this Age. In
late 1991 the museum was chartered by Congress as the United
States' only </b><b><i>official </i></b><b>Atomic museum.</b></p>

<h3><b>What You'll See</b></h3>

<p><b>Prominently featured in the museum's high bay is the story
of the Manhattan Engineer District, the unprecedented 2.2 billion
dollar scientific-engineering project that was centered in New
Mexico during World War II. The Manhattan Project as it was more
commonly called, developed, built, and tested the world's first
Atomic bomb in New Mexico. This display also includes casings
similar to the only Atomic bombs ever used in warfare. Dropped on
the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, these two bombs
helped bring World War II to an end in mid-August 1945. The story
of the Manhattan Project's </b><b><i>three secret cities</i></b><b>,
Hanford, Washington, Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Oak Ridge,
Tennessee, is also presented in this area.</b></p>

<p><b>A portion of the museum, the </b><b><i>low bay</i></b><b>,
is devoted to exhibits on the research, development, and use of
various forms of nuclear energy. Historical and other traveling
exhibits are also displayed in this area. Also found in the low
bay is the museum's store, which is operated by the museum's
foundation. In the store you will find many gift ideas, that
preschoolers to adult will find exciting! The store features
items that will remind you, upon each glance, of your visit to
the National Atomic Museum.</b></p>

<p><b>Adjacent to the low bay is the theater. The featured film
is David Wolpers classic 1963 production, </b><b><i>Ten Seconds
That Shook The World</i></b><b>. This excellent film is a
53-minute documentary on the Manhattan Project. Other films
relating to the history of the Atomic Age are available for
viewing and checkout from the library.</b></p>

<p><b>Next to the theater is the library/Department of Energy
public reading room, containing government documents that are
available to the public for in-library research. The library also
has many nuclear related books available for reference and
checkout.</b></p>

<p><b>Located around the outside of the museum are a number of
large exhibits. These include the Boeing B-52B jet bomber that
dropped the United States' last air burst H-bomb in 1962, and a
280-mm (11 inches) Atomic cannon, once America's most </b><b><i>powerful</i></b><b>
field artillery. Also found in this area is a Navy TA-7C (a
modified A-7B) Corsair II fighter-bomber, a veteran of the
Vietnam War. Many other nuclear weapons systems, rockets, and
missiles are found in this area.</b></p>

<p><b>In front of the museum are a pair of Navy Terrier missiles.
The Terrier was the Navy's first operational surface to air
missile. To the south of the museum, next to the visitors parking
lot, is a Republic F-105D Thunderchief fighter-bomber. Further
south is the museum's latest acquisition, a World War II Boeing
B-29 Superfortress, nicknamed </b><b><i>The Duke of Albuquerque</i></b><b>.
This plane is similar to the B- 29's, </b><b><i>Enola Gay</i></b><b>
and </b><b><i>Bockscar </i></b><b>that dropped the Atomic bombs
on Japan.</b></p>
