<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor was established in 1942 for the
sole purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of producing
plutonium from uranium -- the first milestone in the creation of
the atomic bomb that ended World War II. </p>

<h3>What You'll See</h3>

<p>Here's where it all began. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory's
expansive research into fission, fusion, fossil, and other
sources of energy grew frm the frenzied wartime effort to produce
plutonium from uranium. In early 1944, this small pilot plant --
and an accompanying processing facility -- achieved that
objective, producing the world's first gram quantities of
plutonium. In the process, the Graphite Reactor paved the way for
a full-scale plant in Hanford, Washington, to produce the larger
quantities of plutonium needed to create the bomb dropped on the
Japanese city of Nagasaki, ending World War II.</p>

<p> After the war, the Graphite Reactor produced the first
electricity from nuclear energy, using a thimbleful of water, a
tiny generator, and a single light bulb. It was the first reactor
used to study the nature of matter and the health hazards of
radioactivity. And for nearly 20 years, it was also the world's
foremost source of radioisotopes for medicine, agriculture,
industry, and research.</p>

<p> Decommissioned in 1963, the Graphite Reactor is now a
National Historic Landmark.</p>

<p> As you tour the world's oldest reactor, you'll sense the
excitement of those pioneering scientists who raced to create the
atomic age.</p>

<h3>Public Tours Dates and Times</h3>

<p>The ORNL offers a self-guided tour free of charge Monday
through Friday from 9am to 5pm. Facilities are closed on Sundays
and holidays. Bus parking and access for the physically disabled
are available at each of the three stops. Rest rooms are located
only at the Graphite Reactor. For additional information call the
Office of Public Affairs at (615) 574-4160.</p>

<h3>How to Get There</h3>

<p>The Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor is on Bethel Valley Road, just
south of Oak Ridge, Tennessee.</p>
