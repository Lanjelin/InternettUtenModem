<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Trinity Site is where the first atomic bomb was tested at
5:29:45 a.m. Mountain War Time on July 16, 1945. The 19 kiloton
explosion not only led to a quick end to the war in the Pacific
but also ushered the world into the atomic age. All life on Earth
has been touched by the event which took place here.</p>

<p> The 51,500-acre area was declared a national historic
landmark in 1975. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>What You'll See</h3>

<p>Included on the Trinity Site tour is Ground Zero where the
atomic bomb was placed on a 100-foot steel tower. A small
monument now marks the spot. Visitors also see the McDonald ranch
house where the world's first plutonium core for a bomb was
assembled. The missile range provides historical photographs and
a Fat Man bomb casing for display. There are no ceremonies or
speakers. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Public Tours Dates and Times</h3>

<p>Trinity Site is open to the public twice a year--on the first
Saturday in April and October.</p>

<p> Portable toilet facilities are available on site. Hot dogs
and sodas are sold at the parking lot. Cameras are allowed at
Trinity Site, but their use is strictly prohibited anywhere else
on White Sands Missile Range.</p>

<p> In deciding whether to visit ground zero at Trinity Site, the
following information may prove helpful to you.</p>

<p> Radiation levels in the fenced, ground zero area are low. On
an average the levels are only 10 times greater than the region's
natural background radiation. <i>A one-hour visit to the inner
fenced area will result in a whole body exposure of one-half to
one milliroentgen.</i></p>

<p> To put this in perspective, a U.S. adult receives an average
exposure of 90 milliroentgens every year from natural and medical
sources. For instance, the Department of Energy says we receive
between 35 and 50 milliroentgens every year from the sun and from
20 to 35 milliroentgens every year from our food. Living in a
brick house adds 50 milliroentgens of exposure every year
compared to living in a frame house. Finally, flying coast to
coast in a jet airliner gives an exposure of between three and
five milliroentgens on each trip.</p>

<p> Although radiation levels are low, some feel any extra
exposure should be avoided. The decision is yours. It should be
noted that small children and pregnant women are potentially more
at risk than the rest of the population and are generally
considered groups who should only receive exposure in conjunction
with medical diagnosis and treatment. Again, the choice is yours.</p>

substance found in the area, is still radioactive and must not be
picked up.</p>

<p><br>
Typical radiation exposures for Americans Per The National
Council on Radiation Protection </p>

<ul>
    <li>On hour at ground zero = 1/2 mrem </li>
    <li>Cosmic rays from space = 40 mrem at sea level per year </li>
    <li>Radioactive minerals in rocks and soil = 55 mrems per
        year </li>
    <li>Radioactivity from air, water, and food = anywhere from
        20 to 400 mrem per year </li>
    <li>About 22 mrem per chest X-ray and 900 mrem for
        whole-mouth dental X- rays </li>
    <li>Smoking one pack of cigarettes a day for one year = 40
        mrem </li>
    <li>Miscellaneous such as watch dials and smoke detectors = 2
        mrem per year </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Get There</h3>

<p>Trinity is located on the northern end of the
3,200-square-mile White Sands Missile Range, N.M., between the
towns of Carrizozo and Socorro, N.M. There are two ways of
entering the restricted missile range on tour days.</p>

<p> Visitors can enter through the range's Stallion Range Center
which is five miles south of Highway 380. The turnoff is 12 miles
east of San Antonio, N.M. , and 53 miles west of Carrizozo, N.M.
The Stallion gate will be open 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Visitors arriving
at the gate between those hours will receive handouts and will be
allowed to drive unescorted the 17 miles to Trinity Site. The
road is paved and marked.</p>

<p> The other way of entering the missile range is by travelling
with a caravan sponsored by the Alamogordo (N.M.) Chamber of
Commerce. The caravan forms at the Otero County Fairgrounds in
Alamogordo and leaves at 8 a.m. Visitors entering this way will
travel as an escorted group with military police to and from
Trinity Site. The drive is 170 miles round trip. There are no
service station facilities on the missile range. The caravan is
scheduled to leave Trinity Site at 12:30 p.m. for the return to
Alamogordo. The caravan may leave later if there is a large
number of vehicles in the returning caravan.</p>
