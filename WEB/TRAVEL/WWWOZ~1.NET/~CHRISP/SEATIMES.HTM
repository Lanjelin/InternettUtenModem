<h3>Four Stars: The Bureau of Atomic Tourism</h3>

<p>Stuck in the office while your colleagues pack those holiday
suitcases? Well, with a Web browser you can take a virtual
vacation! There are certainly countless fascinating destinations,
but I nominate this one as stunning and educational.</p>

<p> Initially, I was looking for &quot;the bureau of <i>comic </i>tourism.&quot;
But this bureau made me into a long-term visitor. You, too, could
be won over by its snappy prose, impressive pics and vivid
notation.</p>

<p> The site promotes &quot;tourist locations around the
world&quot; that have links to the power of the atom. This
includes 11 atomic museums, four sites of explosions, catalogs
and related links. Each indeed provides a virtual visit: telling
(and showing) you what there is to see, how things are displayed,
times of opening, costs, routes, etc.</p>

<p> For a touchy subject, this is fascinating. You get peeks at
the World&#146;s Only Public Underground Missile Complex, Virtual
Los Alamos and the Oak Ridge Reactor (&quot;First to Make
Plutonium&quot;); &quot;Where it all started&#133;&quot;.
Sections on Hiroshima and Nagasaki offer city guides that make
them more then historical footnotes.</p>

<p> No punches are pulled in terms of the subject matter. And
this is just as true on its best linked site &quot;Todd&#146;s
Atomic Homepage&quot;
(http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/neutronics/todd.html). Todd, a
student of particle transfer theory, proves to be talented and
friendly Web activist. His page, which disdains sponsors, offers
everything from career guidelines to militant anti-nuclear
bulletins. Want to compute your own radiation levels? Want to
&quot;surf the atomic superhighway&quot;? You can even e-mail to
discourage France from nuclear testing.</p>

<p> Both these sites have good design, unusual presentation and
awareness of atomic pros and cons. Both function flexibly and
invite constructive comment. Plus, Todd&#146;s sections on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki are bilingual (just &quot;choose your
compatible kanji code&quot;). In the virtual vacation stakes,
they&#146;re tops.</p>
