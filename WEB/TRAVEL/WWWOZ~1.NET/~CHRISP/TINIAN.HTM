<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><b>In 1990, while doing some work on Guam, I took a weekend to
fly north to Saipan and then to Tinian. From 1944, when these
islands were captured from the Japanese, until the end of the
war, they were the site of a tremendous level of activity by the
U.S. Army Air Corps. The islands (and Tinian in particular) were
used as bases for long-range B-29 bombers that flew 1500 miles to
Japan and back on bombing raids. The B-29 raids on Japanese
cities were mainly conducted with firebombs, but when atomic
bombs became available, specially trained B-29 crews arrived on
Tinian. These crews used modified B-29s that were to carry
extraordinarily large bombs--so large that the bombs had to be
loaded into the planes from specially constructed pits dug into
the airfield apron.<img src="IMAGES/RUNWAY1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.oz.net/~chrisp/images/runway1.jpg" align="right"

<p><b>I went to Tinian to find whatever was left of the B-29
base, and possibly (I hoped) find the bomb pits where Enola Gay
and Bock's Car were loaded. (The Little Boy and Fat Man bomb
designs were too large to be rolled under a B-29; therefore,
special concrete-lined pits were constructed for the purpose of
holding the atomic weapons below ground level prior to loading.
The bomber aircraft would be rolled over the pit, until the bomb
bay was directly above the bomb. Then, the bomb would be hoisted
into the aircraft weapon bay.) Tinian, I discovered, was
something of a backwater. (In 1990, the islanders were debating
the pluses and minuses of legalized gambling on the island, to
boost the local economy by increasing Japanese tourism. I don't
know if they finally did it or not.) </b></p>

<p><b>Tinian is about the same size and shape as Manhattan, and
when U.S. forces occupied it during the war, they laid out a
system of roads with the same general plan and orientation as on
Manhattan. The main north-south road, for example, is Broadway,
and it runs parallel to the other main north-south road, 8th
Avenue. I inquired in the main town, San Jose (at the south end
of the island), about the main wartime airfield (at the north end
of the island), but nobody knew much about it. So, I drove north
on Broadway. The road became less and less maintained, until,
nearing the north end of the island, it degenerated into almost a
trail, with forest growth on either side and overhead that was
just barely wide enough for the car to pass through. The trail
ran near some beautiful beaches. Then it turned back into the
forest, and seemed to wind around. I began to think that I might
not find the airfield, and then all of a sudden I broke out into
the clear, and in front of me was an 8000-ft runway (as measured
later on my car's odometer). It was grayish and
weathered-looking, but very driveable (only some weedy growth
crawling out onto it here and there). I drove around on the
taxiways, and found four parallel runways oriented nearly
east-west. I drove the car to the end of one of them, and floored
it to the other end. I was imagining the takeoff run in a B-29.<img

<p><b>Other than the runways, nothing seemed to be left of the
old facilities. No buildings were to be seen. The forest had
grown right up to the edges of the runways and taxiways. But
then, at the northwest corner of the airfield, just off one of
the taxiways, I found a little clear area, triangular-shaped,
still covered by concrete. The taxiway connected to one of the
triangle's corners, and at each of the other two corners was a
concrete-walled pit. Both pits were filled in with dirt, and were
sprouting small trees that spread out over neatly tended little
Japanese-looking gardens. Next to one pit was a wooden sign, with
letters cut into it by a router (like signs in National Forests
in the U.S.). The letters were painted yellow. The letters said,
&quot;Atomic Bomb Pit No. 1,&quot; and below this message was a
set of Japanese characters that presumably said the same thing.
Next to the other pit was the same kind of sign, labeled Atomic
Bomb Pit No. 2. Beautifully kept, and no clue as to who came out
into the jungle to tend these little plots. Slightly spooky.</b></p>

<h3><b>What You'll See</b></h3>

<p><b>A plaque marks the location of where the atomic bombs were
loaded for their flights to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. </b></p>

<h3><b>Public Tours Dates and Times</b></h3>

<p><b>The runway and bomb pits can be seen at anytime, no tours
are offered.</b></p>

<h3><b>How to Get There</b></h3>

<p><b>As interpolated from a USGS topo map, the bomb pits are
located at east longitude 145 deg 37' 53&quot;, north latitude 15
deg 04' 58&quot; </b></p>

<p><b>To get to the runway and bomb pits, drive north from the
Tinian airport (or from San Jose) on Broadway. Stay on the road,
even as it degenerates inside the forest. You'll eventually pop
out on the runway/taxiway complex. Drive to the taxiway at the
northwest corner of the northernmost runway. That's where the
bomb pits are located.</b></p>

<p><b>To get to Tinian first go to Guam, then get a commuter
flight north to Saipan, then hop south a few miles to Tinian on
another commuter flight. Rental cars are available at Tinian
airport.</b></p>
