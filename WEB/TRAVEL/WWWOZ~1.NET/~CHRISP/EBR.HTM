<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><b><img src="IMAGES/LEFTENG.JPG" tppabs="http://www.oz.net/~chrisp/images/lefteng.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
width="400" height="283"></b><b>In the 1950's an attempt was made
to build atomic powered bombers that could remain aloft for
extended periods, before ballistic missiles were perfected. They
were so big that they would have required a 10 mile runway (hence
the eastern Idaho location). The pilots would have received a
fairly large dose of radiation, because good shielding would have
been too heavy to fly, and there were the obvious safety problems
with airborne reactors.</b></p>

<p><b>In 1955, at this site in Idaho, the X-39 was run on a
ground test stand in what was called the Heat Transfer Reactor
Experiment No. l (HTRE-l). Engineers tested a complete aircraft
power plant consisting of a reactor, a radiation shield, two X-39
engines, ducting, control parts and instrumentation; the whole
assembly was called a core test facility because it was designed
for the insertion of different reactor cores as they were
developed. In January 1956, the engines were operated
successfully but, because there had been no attempt to restrict
the weight of the shielding, they would not have been flyable.
Later in 1957, other cores that were tested, HTRE-2 and -3, did
reduce the weight somewhat. The HTRE-3 assembly produced enough
thrust to theoretically sustain a flight at 460 mph for about
30,000 miles. However radiation levels were still a problem; at
one point in the tests, controls failed and released enough
radioactivity to contaminate 1,500 acres.</b></p>

<h3><b>What You'll See</b></h3>

<p><b><img src="IMAGES/RIGHTENG.JPG" tppabs="http://www.oz.net/~chrisp/images/righteng.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
width="400" height="283"></b><b>The two X-39 atomic aircraft
engines are on display. EBR-I is the first atomic reactor to
generate electricity.</b></p>

<h3><b>Public Tours Dates and Times</b></h3>

<p><b>The engines are on display next to EBR-1 and can be seen at
anytime. EBR-1 was the first atomic reactor in the world to
generate usable amounts of electricity. The historic
accomplishment took place on December 20, 1951. Today, EBR-1 is a
Registered National Historic Landmark, open daily to the general
public from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day each year and
by appointment the rest of the year. Hours of operation are 8am
to 4pm. All tour members must be at least 16 years old and a U.S.
citizen. </b></p>

<h3><b>How to Get There</b></h3>

<p><b><img src="IMAGES/ARCO.JPG" tppabs="http://www.oz.net/~chrisp/images/arco.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
width="320" height="125"></b><b>EBR-1 is located 18 miles
southeast of Arco, Idaho on highway 26, or 50 miles west of Idaho
Falls on highway 20. The facility is about 2 miles south of the
highway. For more information call the Public Affairs Office at
(208) 526-1299.</b></p>
