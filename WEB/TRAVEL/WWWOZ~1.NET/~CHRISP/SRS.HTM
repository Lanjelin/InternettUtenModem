<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><b>The Savannah River Site was constructed during the 1950's
to produce the basic materials used in the fabrication of nuclear
weapons, primarily tritium and plutonium-239. Five reactors were
built on the site. The reactors produced nuclear materials by
irradiating materials with neutrons. Also built were support
facilities including two chemical separations plants, a water
extraction plant, a nuclear fuel and target fabrication facility
and waste management facilities.</b></p>

<p><b>Irradiated materials were moved from the reactors to the
two chemical separations facilities -- the next step in the
production process. In these facilities, known as
&quot;canyons,&quot; the irradiated fuel target assemblies were
chemically processed to separate useful products from waste.
After refinement, some nuclear materials were shipped to other
Department of Energy sites for final use. </b></p>

<h3><b>What You'll See</b></h3>

<p><b>Basically the tour consists of a bus trip by the 5 reactors
(L, P, C, R, and K) and the 2 canyons (F and H).</b></p>

<p><b>All adults receive a tour packet consisting of a Personal
radiation dose chart, a SRS fact sheet, a SRS map, a tour
evaluation form, a Recyclable SRS bag, and a SRS pen.</b></p>

<h3><b>Public Tours Dates and Times</b></h3>

<p><b>Anyone is welcome to tour SRS. The only restrictions are
that groups must consist of 10 people, all of whom must be U.S.
citizens at least 16 years old. Tours are usually scheduled four
to six weeks in advance. Days fill quickly, especially during the
school year. Although rare, groups less than 10 people can
sometimes be accommodated. For additional information call (803)
644-6817 or (803) 644-6969.</b></p>

<h3><b>How to Get There</b></h3>

<p><b>The Savannah River Site is located about 20 miles south of
Aiken, South Carolina or 20 miles southeast of Augusta, South
Carolina.</b></p>
