<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><b>A secret Eisenhower-era underground bunker, designed to
house members of Congress and their staffs during [and after]
nuclear attack, will soon be open to tours by guests of the
Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. Last July, the
Federal Government relinquished control of the
112,544-square-foot bunker, which is 700 to 800 feet below the
West Virginia Wing of the Greenbrier resort. The resort is a
national historic landmark</b></p>

<p><b>When the Government decommissioned the facility, all
furnishings and equipment were removed. The Greenbrier has
replicated the original contents as closely as possible, and will
begin offering guided tours to registered guests in April. </b></p>

<p><b>Areas on the tour include the cafeteria, dormitories, the
decontamination chambers, a clinic including an operating room,
areas designated as chambers for the House and Senate, and the
power plant, which was the source of emergency generators, water
storage and air filtering systems there was also a
&quot;pathological waste incinerator&quot; here (a.k.a. an oven
for cremations). Not included, apparently, are the television
studio, radio and communications room (including cryptographic
equipment), and the dining room, the walls of which featured
false windows complete with wooden frames and country scenes
painted on them]. </b></p>
