<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><strong>Nike Missile Site SF88L lies nestled in the low
coastal hills of Marin County, just west of the Golden Gate
Bridge. The base is typical of more than 300 identical missile
batteries that once guarded U.S. cities and military
installations (eleven NIKE sites ringed San Francisco Bay alone
during the 1950s). But Site 88L is unique; it is the only NIKE
missile battery in the country preserved in its historic
appearance. Today, it offers visitors a rare opportunity to visit
a complete missile installation and learn the history of
America's defenses during the Cold War.</strong></p>

<p><strong>During World War II, the world's nations learned a
painful lesson. High-altitude bombers dropping tons of explosives
-- or nuclear weapons -- could level entire cities. New defensive
measures were needed, and in early 1945 the U.S. Army began
developing a radar-guided missile capable of knocking down enemy
planes flying higher and faster than any gun could hope<br>
to reach. The research led to the development of the original
&quot;NIKE&quot; missile in 1951. (The United States once named
its rockets and missiles after mythological figures, and NIKE was
the Greek goddess of victory.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Site 88L at Fort Barry, constructed in 1954-55,
originally housed a battery of twenty NIKE-AJAX missiles. These
early surface-to-air missiles, equipped with liquid fuel engines,
could knock down an enemy airplane traveling at Mach 2.5 (two and
a half times the speed of sound) at a range of 25 miles.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In 1959, Site 88L was re-equipped with larger and more
powerful NIKE-HERCULES missiles. These &quot;birds&quot; had a
range of 87 miles and could hit a plane traveling at Mach 3.5 at
an altitude of 28 miles. In addition to a conventional
high-explosive warhead, the HERCULES could carry a nuclear
warhead capable of destroying entire formations of enemy planes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>No missile was ever launched from Site 88L, or from
any of the nearly 300 other permanent NIKE sites protecting the
continental United States. Although &quot;state of the art&quot;
in the 1950s, the system became obsolete during the late 1960s;
the missiles could destroy any conventional aircraft, but they
could not shoot down the newer Inter-Continental Ballistic
Missiles (ICBMs) developed by the world's super power nations.
The Army Air Defense Command ordered Site 88L closed in the
spring of 1974.</strong></p>

<h3><b>What You'll See</b></h3>

<p><strong>The National Park Service and a crew of dedicated
volunteers preserve Site 88L as it looked at time of its
deactivation, complete with three HERCULES missiles housed in
cavernous underground magazines. </strong></p>

<h3><b>Public Tours Dates and Times</b></h3>

<p><strong>The Site is open to the public on the first Sunday of
each month, between 12:30pm and 3:30pm. For more information,
call the Marin Headlands Visitor Center at (415) 331-1540.</strong></p>

<h3><b>How to Get There</b></h3>

<p><b>The site is located near San Francisco, California in Marin
County, just west of the Golden Gate Bridge. </b></p>
