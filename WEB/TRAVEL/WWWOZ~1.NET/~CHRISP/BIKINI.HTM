<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p><b>The Bikini Atoll was the location of 23 atmospheric atomic
bomb tests from 1946 through 1958.</b></p>

<p><b>The Bravo test, in February 1954, was at 15 megatons the
most powerful bomb ever detonated by the United States--far
bigger than expected. An H-bomb, it vaporized three islands and
threw radioactive debris over nearly 50,000 square miles.</b></p>

<h3><b>What You'll See</b></h3>

<p><b>Scuba divers may explore Bikini's sunken ghost fleet, ten
major ships from the ninety-five target vessels that were
anchored in the lagoon during the tests, including the 880-foot
U.S.S. </b><em><b>Saratoga, </b></em><b>which is the only
aircraft carrier in the world in which to dive, and the
battleship </b><em><b>Nagota, </b></em><b>once the flagship of
the Japanese Navy, from which admiral Yamamoto directed the
attack on Pearl Harbor.</b></p>

<h3><b>Public Tours Dates and Times</b></h3>

<p><b>Currently, the only way to visit Bikini is through a pilot
program initiated by the Bikini Council to test the potential for
tourism. Its one-week trips run mid April through mid November,
with a maximum of 12 people each week--virtually all of them
scuba divers. Nobody will force you to put on a tank, but right
now it is assumed that this is what you're there for. In fact,
its assumed you a an </b><em><b>advanced</b></em><b> diver. For
more information contact Central Pacific Dive Expeditions at
800-846-3483, or fax them at 714-851-3111.</b></p>

<h3><b>How to Get There</b></h3>

<p><b>Currently you must go as part of a tour, which leaves from
Honolulu, Hawaii to Majuro, then from Majuro to Bikini. There is
a brief refuelling stop at Johnston Island, an atomic tourist
site in its own right.</b></p>
