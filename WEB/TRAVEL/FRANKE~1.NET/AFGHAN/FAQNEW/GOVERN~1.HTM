 Government
 |   
 +- Just as the Taraki-Amin-Babrak-Najeeb regimes were not the 
 |  true, representative governments of the Afghanistan, today,
 |  the Masoud-Rabani-Gulbudin-Dostam-Ismayel hash and rehash of   
 |  government and war-lordship can not be seriously considered  
 |  as an Afghan government. Therefore in this area we will only 
 |  focus on the traditional governmental norms and setups that   
 |  would have been in place under normal circumstances. For 
 |  info on the current situation and who is who of the clients
 |  who are fighting the regional proxy-war in Afghanistan, please
