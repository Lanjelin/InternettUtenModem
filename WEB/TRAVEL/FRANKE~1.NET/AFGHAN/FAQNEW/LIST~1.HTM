<i>
The Afghan Newsgroup was founded by S.W.Hussaini back at 1990. Through
the years it has evolved to be the main source of social, cultural and 
especially political discourse among the Afghan netizens of the world.
Depicted as a microcosm of Afghanistan and its socio-political realities, the
newsgroup is a great resource both for Afghans as well as non-Afghans who 
would like to educate themselves in Afghanistan or Afghan related issues.
<p>
The news group name is <b>soc.culture.afghanistan</b> and can be accessed 
by any Internet newsreader.

This is the DOWN TOWN of the Afghan Net Community. When the the Afghan
Newsgroup became too clogged up with the irrlevant postings the Afghan
Community on the net went "underground" and build their own little 
virtual Afghanistan for purely Afghan related discussion. 
<p>
Hailed as the MICROCOSM of Afghanistan, subscription into the server
brings you to a brave new world of heated discussions, latest news, 
and an instant source of information should you need any. A must for

The "Afghanistan Today" country-page is the online realization of the Afghan 
FAQ. All the information currently available in the Afghanistan Today page was 
originally compiled for the FAQ. With the arrival of WEB technology the FAQ
was made more accessible by indexing and organizing it into the format of 
a country page on WWW, thus the realization of the "Afghanistan Today". </i><p>
