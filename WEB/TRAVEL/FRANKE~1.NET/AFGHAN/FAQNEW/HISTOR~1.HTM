 |   |  |         |  in the northern provinces of Afghanistan (bordering

 |   |  |  |  began spreading its deadly web into every aspect of
 |   |  |  |  social structure. Religion was derided and the Afghan
 |   |  |  |  traditional tri-colored flag was replaced by the      
 |   |  |  |  Communist's all red flag. With this day opened a new      
 |   |  |  |  chapter in Afghan history. Every aspect of Afghan life

 |   |  |  |  Afghans. This once peaceful and beautiful nation was about       
 |   |  |  |  to lose 2,000,000+ of its best sons and daughters. Afghans      
 |   |  |  |  who in the past never dreamed of leaving their country,      
 |   |  |  |  were forced to abandone their homeland. At one time their     
 |   |  |  |  number reached 5,000,000+, as they became "Awara wa bechara".

 |   |  |  |  |  the head of "Revolutionary  Council" and President of       
 |   |  |  |  |  the so called "Democratic Republic of Afghanistan".        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 4th May 1978, First interview with Noor Mohammad         
 |   |  |  |  |  Taraki with western massmedia. He denied that his       
 |   |  |  |  |  party was a Communist party.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- June 1978, Purge of Parchamies by the Khalq faction 
 |   |  |  |  |  of PDPA. Parcham leaders are exiled as "ambassadores"       
 |   |  |  |  |  abroad.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 12 July 1978, Revolutionary Council's Decree #6 is         
 |   |  |  |  |  announced. The decree abolished the subsidy of 
 |   |  |  |  |  landowvers over the farmers.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 20th July 1978, The first anti-Communist uprisal in 
 |   |  |  |  |  Noristan and Kunar.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 16th August 1978, Further split within Khalq-Parcham        
 |   |  |  |  |  party and the arrest of General Qader, the key figure        
 |   |  |  |  |  of the 27th April coup, and also that of Sultan Ali       
 |   |  |  |  |  Keshtmand, key member of political burue and central 
 |   |  |  |  |  committee of the PDPA. They were accused of master- 
 |   |  |  |  |  minding a Parchami plot against the Taraki government.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 17 October 1978, Revolutionary Council's decree #7        
 |   |  |  |  |  was announced. It advocated the liberation of the
 |   |  |  |  |  women and the rights of the women to choose their 
 |   |  |  |  |  own husband. The agenda behind this decree was not
 |   |  |  |  |  the much needed liberation of women and the evolution
 |   |  |  |  |  of social justice and equality among the sexes, but was 
 |   |  |  |  |  designed as a pretext for a direct and open attack on
 |   |  |  |  |  Afghan cultural and Afghan honour.  
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 19th October 1978, The celebration of the raising         
 |   |  |  |  |  of the new all red flag. The occasion was accompanied       
 |   |  |  |  |  with the typical Communist fun fare and this was a        
 |   |  |  |  |  major provocation for the Afghan people. This change 
 |   |  |  |  |  of the traditional tri-colored flag sent a clear 
 |   |  |  |  |  message to the people about the roots and loyalties
 |   |  |  |  |  of the new regime [as does the Flag of the current       
 |   |  |  |  |  breed of puppet fundamentalists].       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 28th November 1978, Revolutionary Council's decree          
 |   |  |  |  |  #8 which advocated land reform. As it might appear
 |   |  |  |  |  it was not a move for social betterment but was more       
 |   |  |  |  |  like a ploy to get those, to whom they promised land,       
 |   |  |  |  |  in the rank of the so called "98% pro-Khalq 
 |   |  |  |  |  proletariat".       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 5th December 1978, Taraki signed a treaty of
 |   |  |  |  |  "friendship, good neigbourliness and cooperation"       
 |   |  |  |  |  with President Brezniv of Soviet Union in Moscow.      
 |   |  |  |  |  This treaty had a clause which expressed that both       
 |   |  |  |  |  sides will consult and take appropriate measures      
 |   |  |  |  |  when their security was threatened. Later on this      
 |   |  |  |  |  very clause was used as a pretext for the Soviet        
 |   |  |  |  |  invasion of Afghanistan.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 14th February 1979, Adolph Dubs, American Ambassadore        
 |   |  |  |  |  in Kabul was kidnapped by a, little known, radical left       
 |   |  |  |  |  group. He was taken to Kabul Hotel adjacent to the         
 |   |  |  |  |  presidential palace. After a couple of hours Hafizullah        
 |   |  |  |  |  Amin ordered the soldires to storm the hotel room. This       
 |   |  |  |  |  action was taken in absence of the American security         
 |   |  |  |  |  personnel who were at hand. As a result of this action        
 |   |  |  |  |  U.S ambassadore was killed by the bullets of Amin's          
 |   |  |  |  |  storming police. Russian advisors were allowed to 
 |   |  |  |  |  oversee the operation. Since then Washington has not 
 |   |  |  |  |  sent another ambassadore to Kabul.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 25th February 1979, Second popular uprising in Dara-e        
 |   |  |  |  |  Soof in Northern Afghanistan.

 |   |  |  |  +- 10th-20th March 1979, Mutiny in the Herat Garrison
 |   |  |  |  |  by the Afghan army officers. It was crushed with  
 |   |  |  |  |  a brutal show of force.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- April 1979, A high-level military team headed by         
 |   |  |  |  |  General Aleksey Alekseyevish Yepishev visits Kabul.       
 |   |  |  |  |  Yepishev was sent to assess the "political reliability"       
 |   |  |  |  |  of the Afgahn armed forces, i.e, their loyalty to the       
 |   |  |  |  |  regime and to Soviet connections. When, as a result
 |   |  |  |  |  of his visit, he concluded that Afghan forces were
 |   |  |  |  |  not "politically reliable", plans were set in motion       
 |   |  |  |  |  massive intervention by the Soviet forces.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 23rd June 1979, The Chindawul upprisal in down town

 |   |  |  |  +- 8th August 1979, Mutiny of the army officers in
 |   |  |  |  |  Bala-e-Hesar garrisson in downtown Kabul.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- Soviet ambassadore in Kabul, Vassily Safronchuk, 
 |   |  |  |  |  favours  a more broad based government in Kabul i.e.  
 |   |  |  |  |  he wants the Parchamies and some socialist groups       
 |   |  |  |  |  to be incorporated in the government. Hafizullah       
 |   |  |  |  |  Amin opposes this idea and this lays the seed of        
 |   |  |  |  |  events to come. It became clear back then that the      
 |   |  |  |  |  Soviets favoured the Parchamies over the the more
 |   |  |  |  |  self assertive and nationalism-prone Khalqies.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 1st Septermber 1979, Noor Mohammad Taraki travels        
 |   |  |  |  |  to Havana, Cuba to participate in the Non-Alligned

 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- Enrout to Havana and on his way back from Havana
 |   |  |  |  |  Taraki stops at Moscow. During this stop the plot of  
 |   |  |  |  |  coup against Amin, re-installation of Babarak in        
 |   |  |  |  |  in the government and in the party, a re-union of the       
 |   |  |  |  |  of the two factions of the PDPA with the Soviets       
 |   |  |  |  |  as the arbitrator and finally the ground work for       
 |   |  |  |  |  the subsequent invitation of the Soviet Army by        
 |   |  |  |  |  Afghan government is laid. Taraki meets Babrak        
 |   |  |  |  |  during this mission. Watanjar, Gulabzoe, Sarwari      
 |   |  |  |  |  and Mazdoryar were allied with Taraki by 
 |   |  |  |  |  the Soviets. All of the above were key military       
 |   |  |  |  |  figures who could have played important rule in        
 |   |  |  |  |  in the plotted coup.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- Hafizullah Amin is tipped off about the plot and at         
 |   |  |  |  |  the last moment he is able to turn the tide of events        
 |   |  |  |  |  to his own favour.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- Following this failure to assasinate Amin, the key plotters
 |   |  |  |  |  Watanjar, Gulabzoe and Sarwari escapes Amin's subsequent 
 |   |  |  |  |  roundup and later manage to seek sanctuary in the Soviet 
 |   |  |  |  |  embassy.
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 14th september 1979, Amin is invited to Presidential
 |   |  |  |  |  palace by Taraki. It is a trap to assasinate Amin but,       
 |   |  |  |  |  only Taron and Amin's body gaurd, Zerak, are killed.
 |   |  |  |  |  All this happens in front of the Soviet ambassadore who 
 |   |  |  |  |  was present in the palace. The Soviet ambassadore, Alexander
 |   |  |  |  |  M. Puzanov, was an active particpant in this 2nd attempt
 |   |  |  |  |  to kill Amin. After this close brush with death, 
 |   |  |  |  |  Amin escaped to the Defense ministry and takes charge of 
 |   |  |  |  |  the armed forces and the party. 
 |   |  |  |  | 
 |   |  |  |  +- That same night Taraki is arrested and after a couple 
 |   |  |  |  |  of weeks he would be killed by Amin's agents. Quietly,  
 |   |  |  |  |  at night, he was then buried in the Qul-e-Chakan graveyard
 |   |  |  |  |  in Kabul.
 |   |  |  |  |  
 |   |  |  |  +- 16th september 1979, In a joint meeting of the Revolutionary
 |   |  |  |     Council of PDPA and its Central Committee, Taraki was 
 |   |  |  |     stripped from all of his titles, including his membership of
 |   |  |  |     PDPA and Hafizullah Amin was elected General Secretary of 
 |   |  |  |     the PDPA, Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and the

 |   |  |  |  | 
 |   |  |  |  +- Kabul radio announced Taraki's resignation, sighting ill-
 |   |  |  |  |  health. Amin's ascent to power makes the rest of the news.
 |   |  |  |  |  On the following day, a flier was distributed among the
 |   |  |  |  |  government officials, army personnel and the general
 |   |  |  |  |  public in which a chronological, hour to hour, account
 |   |  |  |  |  of the Taraki's plot against Amin was exposed.
 |   |  |  |  | 
 |   |  |  |  +- 17th september, Soviet Ambassadore Puzanov meets Amin 
 |   |  |  |  |  and signs Taron's condolence book -- thus condemning

 |   |  |  |  +- Amin asks Moscow to call back Puzanov from his post         
 |   |  |  |  |  in their embassy in Kabul.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- In the middle of October there was an failed coup
 |   |  |  |  |  attempt by the followers of Watanjar against Amin.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 21st October 1979, In a TV statemnet, Amin explained        
 |   |  |  |  |  his future policy in which he stressed both on        
 |   |  |  |  |  friendship with the Soviet Union and also the traditional
 |   |  |  |  |  policy of non-alliagnement of Afghanistan. In this speech     
 |   |  |  |  |  he promised that the future policy of the government       
 |   |  |  |  |  will be based on "legality" vs dictatorship. He changed      
 |   |  |  |  |  the name of the Afghan security agency from AGSA to        
 |   |  |  |  |  KAM. He also declared amnesty for the refugees in        
 |   |  |  |  |  in Pakistan. He made promises that he will form a       
 |   |  |  |  |  new constitution and thus a 65 member commision was       
 |   |  |  |  |  assigned to initiate this process. 
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- As a favour to the Soviets, Amin later repealed the
 |   |  |  |  |  execution order of Kishtmand and Qader and reduced 
 |   |  |  |  |  the sentence to 15 years in prison.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 23rd October 1979, First offensive by the Mojahedin        
 |   |  |  |  |  of Tarakhail on Kabul International Airport.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 7th November 1979, Amin refused to participate in          
 |   |  |  |  |  the Seventh November reception in the Soviet Union
 |   |  |  |  |  embassy for their national day. Later on  he declined       
 |   |  |  |  |  another invitation of Kremlin to pay a state visit to
 |   |  |  |  |  Moscow.             
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 11th December 1979, There was another failed coup         
 |   |  |  |  |  in which Amin's nephew, Asadullah Amin, was seriously       
 |   |  |  |  |  wounded.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- During the first half of the December, the first         
 |   |  |  |  |  contingent of the Red Army were seen in the Bagram      
 |   |  |  |  |  airforce base which was totally under Soviet control.        
 |   |  |  |  |  They were also seen near the Salang Strategic Tunnel.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 22nd December 1979, Due to security reasons, Amin 
 |   |  |  |  |  moved to Tapa-e-Taj Baig from Kabul Presidential Palace.

 |   |  |  |  |  plane appears in the Kabul sky, lands in the Kabul 
 |   |  |  |  |  air port and unloads its human cargo, the RED ARMY.

 |   |  |  |  |  in the Government printhouses were distributed among 
 |   |  |  |  |  the army personnel, and the people in which the people
 |   |  |  |  |  were forwarned of an enemy attack. The interesting part
 |   |  |  |  |  was a set of instructions against air attacks. Since the
 |   |  |  |  |  Mojahedin lacked air power it was clear that this 
 |   |  |  |  |  "air attack" was expected from another source.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 27th December 1979, The Taj Baig Palace in Darulaman         
 |   |  |  |  |  where Amin and his family were residing was stormed        
 |   |  |  |  |  by the KGB's elite force and Amin and his family are      
 |   |  |  |  |  all killed. There are two theories about Amin's 
 |   |  |  |  |  death. One account says that he died defending        
 |   |  |  |  |  himself and his family while the other one says that        
 |   |  |  |  |  he was poisoned by his cook and was in no shape to 
 |   |  |  |  |  accomplish anything.
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- On the same night, via a clandestine radio broadcast        
 |   |  |  |  |  that claimed to be Radio Kabul but was actually being         
 |   |  |  |  |  broadcasted from Tashkand, Babrak Karmal, in a        
 |   |  |  |  |  speech, also claiming to be in Kabul, announced his       
 |   |  |  |  |  takeover of the government. Babrak Karmal arrived        
 |   |  |  |  |  in Kabul on First January. He said that the Soviets       
 |   |  |  |  |  had intervened upon his request as outlined in the        
 |   |  |  |  |  treaty signed earlier by Taraki-Brezniv.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- That night the Soviet invasion was already in full swing.
 |   |  |  |     Kabul sky was already humming with a pipeline of the

 |   |  |  |  +- With Babraks arrival some new internal and external        
 |   |  |  |  |  develpements are worth mentioning here.       
 |   |  |  |  |  |       
 |   |  |  |  |  +- Khalqies were purged from the Central Committe and 
 |   |  |  |  |  |  Political Bureue  of the PDPA. They were mostly       
 |   |  |  |  |  |  accused of colloaboration with Amin. Although the     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the new government was formed under the title of 
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the runion of the two factions of PDPA, in reality     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the Parchamies were more dominant in the Revolutionary
 |   |  |  |  |  |  Council, Central Committe and Political Burue of PDPA     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  as well as in the cabinet. The real governmet was 
 |   |  |  |  |  |  controlled by Soviet ambassadore, Safranchuk who 
 |   |  |  |  |  |  controlled and coordinated the day affairs of the
 |   |  |  |  |  |  regime. It is said that a single telegram could         
 |   |  |  |  |  |  not make it out of Kabul without being scanned     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  by Safranchuk's team.     
 |   |  |  |  |  |       
 |   |  |  |  |  +- Most of the political prisoners from Taraki-Amin      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  period (some included Parchamies) were freed from     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the prison. Though for a some Afghan families the      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  freedom of their loved ones was a joyous occasion      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  but for a vast majority of Afhgan people this day     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  marked the end of their last hopes for seening      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  loved ones alive.
 |   |  |  |  |  |       
 |   |  |  |  |  +- It was cold January day when the gates of Pul-e-
 |   |  |  |  |  |  Charkhi were flung open. Out of the tens of 
 |   |  |  |  |  |  thousands of Afghans who had gathered in front     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  of this notorious prison almost 95% returned to     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  their homes with out the family members they had     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  hoped to see. On this day, not only they bore the     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  pain of the loss of the the loved ones but also      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the sting of being watched, ordered about and      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  searched by Soviet soldiers who were patrolling     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the streets and major intersections of Kabul.      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  That day marked the begining of the massive 
 |   |  |  |  |  |  exodus by the people of Afghanistan towards  
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the borders. 
 |   |  |  |  |  |       
 |   |  |  |  |  +- The resistance that was slowly spreading on the       
 |   |  |  |  |  |  national level before the invasion, now took      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  an international dimension after the invasion.     
 |   |  |  |  |  |       
 |   |  |  |  |  +- Afghan issue was taken to the U.N Security      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  Council.     
 |   |  |  |  |  |       
 |   |  |  |  |  +- On the first week of the year 1980, 52 member        
 |   |  |  |  |  |  of the United nations asked for an immediate     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  meeting of the Security Council to discuss     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  the Soviet invasion in  Afghanistan. It was the     
 |   |  |  |  |  |  non-alligned countries who tabled a resolution       
 |   |  |  |  |  |  in the U.N, condemning the invasion and calling
 |   |  |  |  |  |  for the immediate withdrawl of the Soviet forces      
 |   |  |  |  |  |  from Afghanistan. This resolution was vetoed    
 |   |  |  |  |  |  by the Soviet Union.     
 |   |  |  |  |  |       
 |   |  |  |  |  +- After this veto a special session of the     
 |   |  |  |  |     General Assembly was held in Newyork, and     
 |   |  |  |  |     a resolution was passed (104 votes in      
 |   |  |  |  |     favour, 18 opposed and 18 abstentiosn)    
 |   |  |  |  |     that called for the immediate withdrawal of       
 |   |  |  |  |     the  "foreign troops" in Afghanistan. This      
 |   |  |  |  |     special United Nation's "bussines like" procedure
 |   |  |  |  |     was repeated on every normal session of the     
 |   |  |  |  |     general assembly until 1987 in which the vote      
 |   |  |  |  |     in favour was raised to 123, agaisnt to 19     
 |   |  |  |  |     and obstention to 11.    
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 25th-27th January 1980, The Islamic confrence        
 |   |  |  |  |  organization's foreign ministers met in     
 |   |  |  |  |  Islamabad and in a joint resolution condemned     
 |   |  |  |  |  the Soviet Invasion and asked for their      
 |   |  |  |  |  withdrawal.     
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- Late December 1980 and early January 1981, The       
 |   |  |  |  |  Soviets showed interest to negotiate Afghan         
 |   |  |  |  |  issue with Pakistan. Later the General Secretary       
 |   |  |  |  |  of the United Nations was included in these       
 |   |  |  |  |  negotiations.       
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- This process started in Islamabad between the         
 |   |  |  |  |  Soviet ambassadore and the Pakistani foreign        
 |   |  |  |  |  ministery.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- 11th February 1981, Pereze de Cuellar was appointed        
 |   |  |  |  |  by Mr.Kurt Waldheim, the then general secretary of        
 |   |  |  |  |  of the U.N, as his special envoy for the Afghan        
 |   |  |  |  |  issue. This  marked the begining of the the Geneva 
 |   |  |  |  |  talks which eventually ended on 14th April, 1988.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- April 1981, Mr. De Cuellar started his mission by 
 |   |  |  |  |  visiting Kabul and Moscow.        
 |   |  |  |  |         
 |   |  |  |  +- By this time, in Washington, the Republicans had taken         
 |   |  |  |     over the White House and the famous policy of the        
 |   |  |  |     "roll back" was initiated.

 |   |  |  |  +- Before the Soviet invasion, about 40 groups and           
 |   |  |  |  |  parties emerged in Pakistan from which Zia choose six
 |   |  |  |  |  according to his own idiological tast and political
 |   |  |  |  |  goals. Later the Seventh party was added due to
 |   |  |  |  |  pressure from the Saudies.        
 |   |  |  |  |        
 |   |  |  |  +- August 1979, The first alliance of th Peshwar       
 |   |  |  |  |  Mojahedin is forged and this includes Gulubudin       
 |   |  |  |  |  Hekmatyar, Sibgatullah Mojaddidi and Mohammad Nabi
 |   |  |  |  |  Mohammadi group. This was called "Covenant of the 
 |   |  |  |  |  Islamic Unity of Afghanistan". This was a short 
 |   |  |  |  |  lived alliance.
 |   |  |  |  |

 |   |  |  |  |       Dear Afghan netters,
 |   |  |  |  |       The rest of the historical facts will be added
 |   |  |  |  |       in a slower pace. Since the proceeding of the 
 |   |  |  |  |       Afghan Jihad is of vital historic importance,
 |   |  |  |  |       I, therefore, need to do proper research to provide  
 |   |  |  |  |       you a chronologically detailed account and analysis 
 |   |  |  |  |       of the Jihad years. This will take time and so I  
 |   |  |  |  |       will probably need a few months to complete this
 |   |  |  |  |       sections. Any contribution by Afghans netters is  
 |   |  |  |  |       most welcome. A very general outline of this section  
 |   |  |  |  |       is listed below.
