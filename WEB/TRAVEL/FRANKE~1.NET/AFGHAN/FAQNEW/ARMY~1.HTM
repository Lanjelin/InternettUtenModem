 Armed Forces
 |
 +- Current Status (An Overview)
    |
    +- Currently there is not central army command of the previous
       Afghan National Army. 

       Afghan army was disintegrated after the coup in Kabul which 
       toppled Najeeb's regime and then under the provisions of the
       Itelaf-e-Shamal a major portion of the army was divided 
       basically between the  members of the Itelaaf-e-Shamal.

       They are:
       |  
       +- Jamiat's Main Commanders
       |  |
       |  +- Ahmad Shah Masoud 
       |  |
       |  +- Toran Ismayel Khan
       |  |
       |  +- Mullah Naqeebullah 
       |  |
       |  +- ETC

       |  | 
       |  +- General Baba Jan
       |  | 
       |  +- ETC
       |
       +- In the Paktia, Ghazni and Nangrahar provinces  
       |  the army divisions were divided between Gulbudin
       |  Hekmatyar, Mohammad Yonus Khalis and Sayed Ahmad 
       |  Gailani's Tanzeems. 
       |
       +- In some places, particularly in the Bagram and 
          the Shindand Airbases, Gulbudin forces confronted
          with the memeber of Ietelaf-e-Shamal and each
          side captured as much of the Afghan army military 
          equipments, including transport and fighter planes, 
          helicopters, tanks, APCs, artillary pieces etc, as 
          they could.
