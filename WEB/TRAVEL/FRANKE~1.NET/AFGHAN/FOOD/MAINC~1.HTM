<h2>Shish Kabab </h2>
<i><b>
Marinated choice pieces of lamb with grilled onion and bell peppers, tomatoes. Served
with freshly cooked crisp Afghan bread called "Naan". <br>Squeeze some lemon on the meat, wrap 
the meat with some bread and enjoy.<br> The onions and bell peppers are not the traditional form
of this Kabab. In its traditional form Afghans cook this Kabab with alternating 
pieces of Lamb and pure white chunks of lamb fat. The fat enhances the flavour of the 
meat. Though the traditional version may not be the best choice for the health
concious, it must be tried at least ONCE. It is truly unique. </i></b>

<i><b>

<h2>Qabelee Palaw</h2>
<i><b>
Delicately seasoned pieces of lamb shank and saffron rice topped with thinly
sliced carrots and raisins.<br> Qabali Palaw is a highly traditional and celebrated 
dish in Afghan cuisine. An Afghan party is incomplete without this dish. <br>A must if you 
want to experience true Afghan food.
<br>
Remember,<br> "PALAW" signifies rice seasoned Reddish-Brown while <br>"Chalaw" means white rice.</i></b>

<h2>Sabzee Chalao</h2>
<i><b>
Chopped spinach, "Sabzee", sauteed with scallions and touch of garlic. Served
with white rice and lamb shanks.

<h2>Banjan Boolani</h2>
<i><b>
Sliced eggplants sauteed and then steamed with tomato. Once ready it is
served on a bed of sourcream which has been mixed with garlic. <br>The whole
dish is then topped with the oil which was used to sautee the eggplants.<br>
Each egg plant is topped with a steamed tomato and more sourcream. This is
egg plant with a twist. A must try. </i></b>

<h2>Salata and Maast</h2>
<i><b>
Afghan food always has a vegetable or  yogurt "Maast" supplement. The 
Afghan salad, "Saa-la-ta", is a  simple combination of fresh tomatoes
and onions -- chopped into small rectangles. <br> The salad is always topped with
fresh squeezed lemon and cut parsely. Since the ingredients are fresh
the traditinal Afghan Salad makes a delicious supplement to the food. 
<br>
Remember, <br>Afghan salad is eaten WITH the food -- not before or after 
the meal.
<br>
Afghan yogurt, "Maast", is very rich and sharp in taste. It is served with
chopped cucumbers and dry mint. If it is prepared from fresh milk in 
traditional goatskin containers, it is unlike any yogurt you have ever tasted.  </i></b>
