<h1> Where to Look for Afghans on the Net</h1>

Dear Net Surfer, 

If you are new to the Afghan scene on the net and would like 
to join the online Afghan community then there is only ONE place
which has everything in terms of news, discussions, debates, 
arguments etc etc by hundreds of Afghans on the Internet.

This place is the Afghan Online Down Town, namely the Afghan
listserver at  

		afghanistan@hypermall.com

Here is what you do to join the server.

	1) Send an e-mail to  majordomo@hypermall.com
	2) Leave the subject area blank
	3) In the body of the mail write

		subscribe afghanistan

	4) Send the mail

You should get a welcome letter within five or ten minutes
and then you will be part of the listserver.

I want to warn you, however, that the volume of MAIL on this
server is VERY HIGH. You get a mix of everything on this server.
You get the latest news, debates, lots and lots of flame wars
among various opposing factions etc but if you are an Afghan
then this is truly the place to be.

If you need NEWS online then try the </pre>
<A HREF="FAQNEW/NEWS1~1.HTM" tppabs="http://frankenstein.worldweb.net/afghan/FaqNew/news1.html"> News </a>
<pre> 
link on this webpage. In the list provided, there are some sources which 
are particularly punctual and consistant in their reporting of in their 
news. They are

	Voice of America
	Dawn Weekly Digest Karachi
	Afghan News Service 

If you are looking for some friends who may be online or would like to 
be of help to the Afghan Community then try the Afghan White Pages -- a 
three year long compilation of the info about Afghan on the net. Don't 
leave this home (page) without it. Also pause to add your name to the
list. Perhaps one day a friend may find you through this medium.

Again, all of the above info is available on different parts of
this web page but I just want to provide you with the STARTER
KIT of getting on the Afghans online bandwagon.

Good luck and do write me a line or two if you have any comments or
suggestions,

Abed  [Afghanistan Today Coordinator]
