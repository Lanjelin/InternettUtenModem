<h2>Gateway to Scotland</h2>

<blockquote><i>
We look to Scotland for all our ideas<br>
of civilisation     -- Voltaire
</i></blockquote>
<p>
These pages are intended to provide a gateway to the country of Scotland; its
geography, history, people, traditions and culture.  No-one was providing this
information, so <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3115" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/geoghome.html">we</a> decided to take the
initiative. Much information is provided locally by ourselves, but there are
also links to other providers of Scottish information. Please 
<A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3117" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/feedback.html">tell us</a> if you think there is other information
out there which we have missed.

<h2>Scotland - Introduction</h2>

Scotland is one of four constituent nations which form the 
<a href="BRITAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/britain.html">United Kingdom</a> 
(the other three are England, 
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3118" tppabs="http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk/Places/wales.html">Wales</a> and 
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3119" tppabs="http://www.interknowledge.com/northern-ireland/index.html">Northern 
Ireland</a>).  Scotland forms the northern part of the island of 
<a href="BRITAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/britain.html">Great Britain</a>. 
<P>
Scotland is 31,510 sq. miles in area;  it is 274 miles long from North
to South and varies in breadth between 24 and 154 miles. An 
<a href="SCOTMA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotmap.html">active map of Scotland</a>  
 is available, which details Scotland's major cities.
<P>
Population statistics for Scotland (1811 - 1991) are available
<a href="POP~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/pop.html">here</a>.  Other 
<a href="STATS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/stats.html">demographic and socio-economic statistics</a>
are also available.
<P>
The official language is English, although <a href="GAELIC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/gaelic.html">Gaelic</A> is
spoken, primarily in the North and West of Scotland. For your information,  the 
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3120" tppabs="http://www.sst.ph.ic.ac.uk/angus/bin/uair.cgi">local date and time</a>
are available in Gaelic.
<p>
The Scots language (which has many similarities to
English, but also draws on French and Gaelic) is also spoken.  Whereas
Gaelic is the language of the Highlands &amp; Islands,  Scots is the
language of the Lowlands.
<P>
<P>
<h2>Scotland - Physical Characteristics</h2>

<img align=bottom alt="[IMAGE: Highland Cow]" src="HIGHCOW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/highcow.gif">
<p>
Scotland is divided into three main regions;  the Highlands, the Midland Valley
and the Southern Uplands.  The cities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee together
with numerous towns, most of the population and the majority of Scotland's
industry is located within the Midland Valley.  This broad valley averages 50
miles across and runs WSW to ENE across the centre of the country.  It is
geologically distinct from the surrounding regions, being composed of Devonian
Old Red Sandstone,  peppered with ancient volcanoes, as against the older
sedimentary rocks forming the Southern Uplands or the ancient metamorphic
melange, comprising the Highlands to the north.

<p>
Scotland includes 787 islands,  of which most belong to groups known
as the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland.  Only 62 exceed three sq. miles in area.
<p>
Of 26 rivers flowing directly into the sea,  the most significant are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Tay 
<LI> Spey 
<LI> Clyde 
<LI> Tweed 
<LI> Dee 
<LI> Don 
<LI> Forth 
</UL>
(Further information is available <a href="PHYSCH~1.HTM#river" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/physchar.html#river">here</a>)
<p>
Of these, the Clyde, Forth and Tay open into significant estuaries and support
three of the major cities of Scotland (Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee 
respectively).
<P>
Scotland is well known for its mountainous and beautiful scenery.  Much of
the upland within the UK is contained within the borders of Scotland,  along 
with the highest peaks.  The highest mountains in Scotland are:
<P><UL>
<LI> Ben Nevis 
<LI> Ben Macdhui 
<LI> Braeriach 
<LI> Cairntoul 
<LI> Cairngorm 
<LI> Ben Lawers 
</UL>
(Further information is available <a href="PHYSCH~1.HTM#mount" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/physchar.html#mount">here</a>)
<p>
Scotland is also noted for its lochs (this name is generally used for lakes
in Scotland).
Much of the west coast of the country is intersected by Sea Lochs, the longest
of which, Loch Fyne, penetrates more than 40 miles inland.  
<P>
Notable fresh-water lochs include:
<P><UL>
<LI> Loch Lomond 
<LI> Loch Ness - <a href="MONSTE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/monster.html">the one with the Monster</a>
<LI> Loch Awe 
</UL>
(Further information is available <a href="PHYSCH~1.HTM#loch" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/physchar.html#loch">here</a>)
<p>
<P>
<h2>Scotland - Government and Commerce</h2>

Government in Scotland is currently (1994) in three tiers.  National 
goverment is via the UK parliament in London, through the Secretary of State
for Scotland and the 
<A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3121" tppabs="http://www.open.gov.uk/scotoff/scofhom.htm">Scottish Office</a>
based in Edinburgh.  
A list of documents relating to government in Scotland is available
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3122" tppabs="http://www.open.gov.uk/?qparser=simple&query=Scotland">here</a>.
<p>
<a href="LOCALG~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/localgovt.html">Local government</a> is divided 
into 29 unitary authorities and three island authorities, having been
subject to a major reorganisation in 1995.
<p>
Scotland has its own legal system, judiciary and an education system which, at
all levels, differs from that found "south of the border" in England and Wales.
<p>
Scotland also has its own <a href="BANKIN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/banking.html">banking system</a> and  its
own banknotes.  Edinburgh is the second financial centre of the UK and one of
the major financial centres of the world.
<BR>
<p>
<h2>Scotland - Famous People</h2>

Scotland has given rise to many more famous people, notable in the arts,
literature, the sciences and as inventors, philosophers, architects and so on,
than would be expected for a country of such modest size and population.
A list of some of these individuals is available 
<a href="GREATS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html">here</a>.

<BR>
<p>
<h2>Scotland - History</h2>

<UL>
<LI>
The Midland Valley of Scotland represented the most northern extent of
the Roman conquest of Britain after 79 A.D.  Remnants of the Antonine Wall,
which the Romans built between the River Forth and the River Clyde to defend
this frontier, can still be seen.  The lands to the north (known to  the Romans
as <I>Caledonia</I>) were occupied by a war-like tribe called the Picts. Little
is known of the Picts, whether they were a Celtic or Germanic race and what
language they spoke is still debated.  The more famous Hadrian's Wall which is
over 100 miles long and lies close to the current border between England and
Scotland was built by the retreating Romans (having been harried by continuous
Pictish attacks) around 119 A.D.
<P>
<LI>
In the 5th Century the "Scots" came from their home in Ireland and settled
in the West of Scotland.  The Scots, partially christianised when they came, had
<a href="GREATS~1.HTM#columba" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#columba">Saint Columba</a> as their
great missionary, and through him and his followers, built on the work
of <a href="GREATS~1.HTM#ninian" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#ninian">Saint Ninian</a> converting the Picts and
other tribes to christianity.  Saint Columba is buried on the sacred island
of Iona off the west coast of Scotland.
<P>
<LI> 
After centuries of wars with the Picts, they put the crown of Scots and Picts on
the head of their king, Kenneth MacAlpin, in  843.
<P>
<LI> 
The reign of Malcolm Canmore (1057 - 93) was a time of great social,
political and religious revolution.  Malcolm had spent much time in England
and he and his saintly queen (<a href="GREATS~1.HTM#margaret" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#margaret">Margaret</a>) 
encouraged the introduction of
english customs, civilisation, the english language and settlers.  Many
Normans (the normans having conquered England in 1066) brought French
culture to Scotland.
<P>
<LI> 
Scotland was a wealthy country through until the beginning of the 14th
Century, when Edward I of England (known as the "Hammer of the Scots") was
determined to incorporate Scotland into the English crown.
<P>
<LI>
The defeat of Edward II at Bannockburn in 1314 was a great victory, reflected in
the <a href="SONGS/FLOWER~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/songs/flower.html">songs</a> and spirit of Scottish
nationalism until present times. The desire to preserve independence was
embodied in a plea to the Pope, known as the <a href="ARBROA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/arbroath.html">Declaration
of Arbroath</a>.  Long, bloody and destructive wars over the succeeding 300
years ensured that, while Scotland remained free, it was also poor.
<P>
<LI> 
<a href="GREATS~1.HTM#knox" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#knox">John Knox</a>, the Edinburgh churchman, played
his part in the reformation in Scotland, which adopted a Presbyterian tradition
losing the link between church and state (which is retained in England).
<P>
<LI> 
England and Scotland were linked through  <a href="GREATS~1.HTM#james" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#james">James
VI</a> of Scotland acceding to the English throne in 1603, following the death
of Queen Elizabeth I.  Elizabeth had persecuted (and finally executed) James'
mother,  <a href="GREATS~1.HTM#mary" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#mary">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, but died
childless.
<P>
<LI> 
Succeeding English monarchs were not as well disposed towards Scotland as
James had been.  Following the formal Act of Union in 1707,  displeasure
particularly amongst Highland Scots, supported the rebellions of 1715 and 1745
which attempted to restore respectively the Old and Young  (<a
href="GREATS~1.HTM#cestuart" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#cestuart">Bonnie Prince Charlie</a>) Pretenders to the
throne of Scotland. 
<P>
<LI>  Here is the complete Genealogy of
<A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3123" tppabs="http://www.dcs.hull.ac.uk/cgi-bin/gedidex/n=royal?Scotland">Scottish</a> and
