This is a somewhat romanticised etching of 
<A HREF="GREATS~1.HTM#CEStuart" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#CEStuart">Prince Charles Edward Stuart</a>
("Bonnie Prince Charlie") wearing the dress of the scottish nobility
from the 18th Century.
<P>
The more usual garment associated with the patterned woollen cloth (known as
tartan) is the <b>kilt</b>.  In its simple form,  this was widely worn by
Highland Scots in centuries past.  It is worth noting that the kilt was not
worn by the Lowland Scots, who formed the majority of the population of the
country. 
<p>
The highland dress which we know today,  was much adapted and
modernised during Victorian times.  This was undertaken to fit a taste for all
things Scottish promoted by Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert.
<p>
Thus, while the basic garment is traditional,  the style and much of the other 
regalia (including jackets, sporran, kilt hose and garters, skean dhu, etc.),
and certainly the range and formality of tartans which we see today were
an invention of the Victorian gentry.
<p>
However, their remains an association of the <i>tartans</i> with the
<i>clans</i> (or family-based groupings) of Scotland.  Most scottish
surnames have an associated tartan,  and some have several, which
may be classified as:
<ul>
<li> Modern Colours
<li> Ancient, Subdued or Hunting Colours
<li> Dress Colours
</ul>

<p>
Note that while women can and do wear tartan,  they do not, however, wear the
kilt. The kilt is a male garment,  and is distinguished from the female pleated
skirt by the length of cloth used in its construction (7 or 8 yards), the large
number of pleats and its weight.  The length of the kilt is very precise,
stretching only to half way down the knee.  The pleated skirt is usually much
longer, as well as being narrower, with a smaller number of broader pleats.
<p>
Other tartan garments are rarely worn today in Scotland,  being primarily sold
to the tourist market.  For example, few Scots would be seen in tartan trousers
or a tartan bonnet,  preferring to smile at the sight of rather more of our
American cousins so attired.
