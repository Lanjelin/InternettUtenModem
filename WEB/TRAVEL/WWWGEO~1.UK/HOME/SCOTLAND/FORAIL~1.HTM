One of the most spectacular man-made landmarks in Scotland is the 
Forth Rail Bridge.  This solid cantilever bridge, built by 
<A HREF="GREATS~1.HTM#arrol" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#arrol">Sir William Arrol</A>, 
was opened in 1890.  The bridge crosses the River Forth between
South Queensferry and North Queensferry, and still carries the
East Coast mainline railway north from Edinburgh to Perth and
Dundee.
