<h1>Using the Information you found here</h1>
<hr>
The material which forms part of &quot;Gateway to Scotland&quot; has taken me a
long time to collate, involved many hours of work in the library, together with
typing it in  and scanning old copyright-expired images.  This material is my
intellectual property,  and the copyright belongs to me (except where explicitly
stated otherwise).
<p>
However,  I want people to be able to use and enjoy information which forms part
of the "Gateway to Scotland".  All I ask is that you appropriately credit my
work.  Provided you do this, I am very happy that you make use of the material
presented here in your own work,  as long as you are not gaining commercially
from it.
<p>
An appropriate citation would be:
<blockquote><i>
Used with Permission from &quot;Gateway to Scotland&quot;<br>
URL:  http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html<br>
&#169; 1996 Bruce M. Gittings.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
Where individual pages display a different copyright status, please modify
the above citation appropriately.
<p>
It would also be nice if you could let me know how the information will be
used, especially if you are publishing it.  You can drop me an email
at <a href="mailto:bruce@geo.ed.ac.uk">bruce@geo.ed.ac.uk</a>.
<p>
If you would like to use the material for commercial purposes,  please 
do contact me, because I am unlikely to say no.  But if you do make your
millions on the back of my work, I would quite like a share!
<p>
Thank you for your interest in the "Gateway to Scotland",  I hope it
has proved useful to you.
