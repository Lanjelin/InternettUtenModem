Scottish Sports &amp; Interests</H1>

<HR>
Sports have traditionally been important to the Scots, and we have been 
influential in the development of many.

<HR>
<h3><A NAME="Football">Football (Soccer)</A></h3>

Scotland's national sport is Football (known to some as Soccer) which is played
widely on both a professional and amateur basis.  Most cities and towns have a
professional team.  For such a small country we have had a remarkable record in
international competitions such as the World Cup.
<p>
Football has been played in Scotland since at least the 15th Century.  It had
reached such popularity with ordinary people that in 1457 an Act of parliament
decreed "that the Fute-ball and the Golfe be utterly cryit doune and not usit".
Football seemed to survive.  By 1871 the first international between Scotland
and England was played in Glasgow (the score was 0-0).  The following year
the Scottish Football Assocation (SFA) was formed as the sport's governing body in
Scotland, with the support of eight clubs.  Also in 1872, Rangers Football
club was formed in Glasgow.  Celtic were formed and played the first "old firm"
game against Rangers in 1888, beating them 5-0.
<p>
In 1885 the world record was set for the greatest winning goal differential, 
when Arbroath beat Bon Accord 36-0.

<h3><A NAME="Rugby">Rugby</A></h3>

Rugby is also an important sport, followed by a large number of people.
Only the amateur game (Rugby Union) is played in Scotland;
the professional Rugby League is played exclusively in central England.
Scotland is a major force in international rugby,  taking part 
in the "<em>Five Nations</em>" Championships (with England, Ireland,
Wales and France) and regularly touring other Rugby nations.
<p>
The first Scotland - England international was played in 1870, although
very few of the "scottish" players actually had much scottish blood.
A more representative game was played in Edinburgh in the following year, with 
the English being beaten by a more wholesome Scottish side.

<h3><A NAME="Golf">Golf</A></h3>

The game of Golf was invented in Scotland and enjoyed by the nobility
as early as the 15th Century.  Indeed it was regarded as with some
disdain and actively discouraged by an Act of Parliament in 1457.
In 1491 it was decreed that "no place in the realm there be usit Fute-ball,
Golfe or other unprofitabill sportis".
<p>
Despite these attempts to outlaw its playing, golf was enjoyed by James IV,
James V and Mary Queen of Scots (who is said to have popped out for a game
after successfully plotting to murder her husband, Lord Darnley).  James VI
was also an avid player and encouraged the game in London when he became King
of England in 1603.
<p>
Golf was reported as being regularly played on Glasgow Green in 1721, and in
1744 the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers was founded, which was the
world's first Golf Club.  Their course, which was the first recognised course,
was at Bruntsfield Links in Edinburgh.  Although this area is still public
parkland, the only remaining connection with the game is the "Old Golf Tavern".
They played for a silver golf club donated by the City of Edinburgh.  The
Honourable Company moved to a more spacious links course at Muirfield in East
Lothian (some 20 miles from Edinburgh) where they remain to this day.
<p>
The first rules of the game were also laid down in 1744.
<p>
St. Andrews is now regarded as the home of golf.  The Royal and Ancient
Golf Club (known as the R&amp;A), was founded in 1754.  It
is the world governing body for the game and is based in St. Andrews,
along with the "Old Course" - perhaps the world's most famous golf course.
The Old Course is a public course (a tradition widespread in Scotland,
where the City Council owns and maintains the course) and as such is
open to locals and visitors for a modest fee.
<p>
Most Scottish towns and cities have at least one golf course (Edinburgh has
at least twenty-one courses!).
<p>
The world's first professional golf tournament was held in Prestwick (on 
Scotland's
West coast) in 1860, and the first British Open Championship was held there
in the following year.
