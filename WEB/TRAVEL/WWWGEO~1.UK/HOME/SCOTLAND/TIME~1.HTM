Time in Scotland</H1>

Care has to be taken in examining historical dates in Scotland, especially
when these are being discussed by English historians or are related to events 
in English history.
This is because of the different calendars used by England and Scotland for
a significant period of history.
<p>
By the middle ages it was recognised that the Julian calendar,
which had been designed in Roman times, was unsatisfactory. 
This was because it did not take account of the length of the year,
determined by the exact time taken by the earth to revolve around the sun.  
This was a slight but cumulative error which gave rise to 
progressive shifts in the seasons.

<p>
Pope Gregory decreed that a new calendar should be designed which took
account of these shifts (the concept of leap years was introduced)
and this was adopted throughout the Roman Catholic world.  
This new innovation became known as the Gregorian Calendar.
<p>
The problem arose from the fact that post-reformation Scotland was far from the
Roman Catholic community in idealogy, as indeed was England since the time
of Henry VIII (1491 - 1547).
<p>
However, the Scots were pragmatic folk, and they realised that trading with
countries such as France was being hampered by the use of a different
calendar.  Conforming with England was not such a priority.  Thus in 
1600, Scotland adopted the Gregorian Calendar.
<p>
Even following the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the two countries continued
on different calendars for more than 150 years.  
Thus there was a difference of eleven days between Scotland and England
during this period,  which sometimes results in ambiguity in the dates
of historical events.
<p>
It was not until 1752 that England swallowed its principles and adopted what
they had regarded as a Papist invention. It was not easy to move to this new
calendar;  people widely believed that they were being robbed of the intervening
days and they protested.
<p>
Interestingly,   Russia didn't adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1918, 
which results in the fact that what is widely known as the
October revolution was actually in November!  Ethiopia still uses the Julian
calendar.
<p>
A further confusion results from another change which was adopted in Scotland.  
In 1600 the definition of what date marked the start of the year was changed.
Prior to 1600 the start of the year was regarded as the 25th March (which
was the beginning of Spring).  After that date the 1st January was adopted as
the start of the year.

<p>
Interestingly the 25th March was retained as the start of the financial
year by the government.  But this was the 25th March by the old Julian
calendar.  If we make the appropriate correction,  we get to the 6th April
which is the start of the government year (often regarded as the Tax
Year) today.

<!--  25th March = (St. ? Day) -->
