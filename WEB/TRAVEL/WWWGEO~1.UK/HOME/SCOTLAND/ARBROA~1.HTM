The Declaration of Arbroath</H1>

<HR>

Although the English armies under Edward II were routed at Bannockburn in 1314
and by 1319, with the recapture of Berwick, effectively expelled from Scottish soil,
they continued to mount attacks into <a href="GREATS~1.HTM#bruce" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#bruce">Robert the
Bruce's</a> Scotland over the succeeding years.
<p>

The Pope had not accepted Scottish independence, perhaps partially because
Robert the Bruce had been excommunicated for killing John Comyn in a 
church in Dumfries in 1306  (Comyn had formed an alliance with Edward,
but perhaps had more of a right to be King than Bruce).
<p>
Thus the <em>Declaration of Arbroath</em> was prepared as a formal Declaration
of Independence.  It was drawn up in 
<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs32.htm#3206" tppabs="http://www.arbroath.org.uk/~arbroath/abbey.htm">Arbroath Abbey</A>
on the 6th April 1320, most
likely by the Abbot,  Bernard de Linton, who was also the Chancellor of
Scotland.
<p>
The Declaration urged the Pope to see things from a Scottish perspective
and not to take the English claim on Scotland seriously.  It used 
stong words,  indicating that without acceptance of the Scottish case
that the wars would continue and the resultant deaths would be the
responsibility of the Pope.

The Declaration was signed and bore the seals of 38 Scots Lords.  It was
conveyed to Rome and the Pope accepted the Scottish case.
