<P>
The name of the restaurant was Restaurant.  Anywhere else the
meals on such a scenic waterfront would have been what the Scots
describe as &quot;dear.&quot;  But this was the remote Isle of
Iona.  I was the only diner and the only tourist in the room,
perhaps the only tourist left on the island as winter bore down
on the western shore.  A group of local youths sat nursing pints
of ale nearby.
<P>
The tune delivered softly by the scratchy speakers was familiar.
I concentrated and then connected:  the soundtrack from &quot;Local
Hero,&quot; a low budget 1983 film produced by Scotsman Bill Forsyth.
I had watched the film on video before moving to Scotland.  
How fitting, I thought, as I recalled that thoroughly Scottish
film in this most Scottish of places.
<P>
Then a young woman who had grown louder as her tankard had grown
lighter summoned the manager.  &quot;Can't you find anything better
than that to play?&quot; she said.  Her friends concurred in a
mumbled sneering sort of a way.
<P>
My reverie cut short, I wondered whose truth Forsyth had really
captured in his film about a wheeling, dealing Houston oil man
who is sent to a Scottish village called Furness.  Perhaps after
living in Scotland for a year, all I really knew was Scotland
filtered through American eyes.  Smug at first -- as is Forsyth's
Mac MacIntyre who was sent to buy a piece of Scotland to fuel
American gluttony -- perhaps I had succumbed too easily to infatuation.
<P>
To trace Mac's fictional steps, as I decided to do, is to follow
thousands of earlier pilgrims seeking to unearth and pay homage
to Scotland's truth.

Pennan,  the village filmed in "Local Hero," rests in the shadow
of huge bluffs that lead to farmland above.
</H5>
<p>
&quot;We've had visitors from as far away as Australia and the
Falkland Islands,&quot; said Norrie Grierson, owner of the Pennan
Inn. Much of &quot;Local Hero&quot; was shot in Pennan, a tiny
village that teeters on the edge of the northern coast where the
Moray Firth enters the North Sea.  Visitors from the United States
and Australia are most common, Grierson said, but tourists from
Switzerland, Russia, Hong Kong -- the list is long -- still pop
in.
<P>
What they seek first is one of the best-known phone booths in
all of Britain.  The red phone box, at first Mac's lifeline to
the outside, becomes ultimately his link to the simplicity and
beauty he comes to cherish in the fictional Furness.
<P>
<img src="PHONEBOX.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/phonebox.gif"><p>
<H5>
After nine years, fans are still ringing this Pennan Phone box
from around the world, unaware of the fact that it is a fraud.
The phone box, so crutial in the movie, was a fabrication.
</H5>
<p>
Mac's phone box was a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; illusion built
on the quay.  The real McCoy is a few houses away in front of
the Pennan Inn.  That is a detail that troubles few pilgrims who
love to pose for pictures there.  Fans who cannot make the trip
to Pennan have telephoned the famous red booth from as far away
as New Zealand.
<P>

<H5>
This view of Pennan Harbour, looking south, reveals the treachery of
the camera.  Pennan has a rocky shore.  The beach in "Local Hero" is
147 miles to the southwest.
</H5>
<p>
Forsyth is party to another deception.  Buttressed on three sides
by towering cliffs, Pennan can boast only a rocky gash of beach,
and then only at low tide.
<p>
<img src="HARB.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/harb.gif"><p>
<H5>
Pennan Harbour provides a landing site in "Local Hero" for a visitor
from a Russian fishing trawler.
</H5>
<p>
The pristine beach that a treacherous
camera portrays as part of the fishing village of Furness is 147
miles away on the west coast.  &quot;There was a lot of artistic
license,&quot; said Grierson.  But the treachery is gentle, as
if Forsyth's love for his homeland is just too expansive for the
geographic facts.
<P>
<img src="CAMUS.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/camus.gif"><p>
<H5>
A burn finds its way to Camusdarach Beach where much of "Local Hero"
was filmed.
</H5>
<p>
Camusdarach beach sees fewer pilgrims than Pennan.  So remote
that it can be reached only via dirt road and a challenging hike
over gale-swept dunes, the beach does draw some visitors.
<P>
<img src="BEN.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/ben.gif"><p>
<H5>
Ben's Beach shows its true colours here.  Acres of dunes serve as foothills
to some of the wildest mountains in the Highlands.
</H5>
<p>
&quot;I still get strangers knocking on my door to ask about
the beach,&quot; said Angie Lewis, who lives nearby.
<P>
The windy, wet day in September when we visited Pennan was inhospitable,
but there were still a few tourists about, most of them forced
inside by the weather.  They sat packed tightly, but amicably,
around the four tables in the lounge of the Pennan Inn.  A framed
newspaper clipping and several enlarged stills from the movie
confirmed that we were indeed in the right place.
<P>
<img src="STORM.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/storm.gif"><p>
<H5>
A storm moves inland toward Camusdarach Beach obscuring the view
of the Western Isles.
</H5>
<p>
The village bore the brunt of a storm coming in off the sea,
a wild side to the community that Mac never got to see.  The weather
in fictional Furness is too kind, boring by Scottish standards.
The Scottish landscape can only be appreciated, the Scottish
character only fathomed in light of the wind and the rain, the
endless summer days and interminable winter nights.
<P>

<H5>
Workers repair windows at the Pennan Inn.
</H5>
<p>
As we settled into the room we had booked at the Inn, we heard
a hammer hard at work nearby, an amusing reminder of the hammering
that punctuates life in the fictional Furness.  A search revealed
that windows at the front of the inn were being replaced by a
father-son team, Bert and Stephen Young.
<P>
&quot;I also deliver the mail in town,&quot; said Bert with a
huge grin.  I took this as an amusing reference to the versatile
villagers created by Forsyth.  In this case, I chose not to try
to separate truth from fiction.
<P>
Inside, Grierson took time to talk about his adopted village.
In 1900 Pennan was a prosperous fishing community, home to 1,000
residents and 80 fishing boats, he said.  &quot;They used to haul
the fish in here and then transport it to the markets.  But now
there are two sophisticated international fish markets on the
coast.&quot;  Only one working fishing boat remains in Pennan,
Grierson said, a lobster boat.
<P>
Most of the year-round residents commute 45-50 minutes to Aberdeen,
the &quot;Houston of the north&quot; where they work in the oil
business, a development portended by Forsyth's story.  As Pennan
residents age and die, many of the homes are sold to outsiders
for holiday homes.
<P>
According to Beden Gibson, the only fisherman left in Pennan,
the fishing industry is now centered in Fraserburgh and Peterhead
west of Pennan.  &quot;Fishing is no longer a viable occupation
here,&quot; said Gibson.  &quot;The price to the fisherman has
stayed static for five years and costs have risen 50 percent.&quot;
<P>
Gibson catches lobster and crab in addition to doing some line
fishing.  His fishing expertise earned him a berth on the Russian
trawler used in the filming of &quot;Local Hero.&quot;  He can
testify to a melancholy truth stated in the film:  Lobster fishermen
cannot afford to eat the lobster they catch.  &quot;If we ate
them, we wouldna' make any money,&quot; he said.  &quot;We ship
them off to Spain.&quot;
<P>
Don't look for the Furness shop where Mac bought dandruff shampoo
in Pennan.  There's no variety store in Pennan, no news agent,
no confectionery.  &quot;You canna' justify it,&quot; Grierson
said. &quot;In the winter, there's just no livin'.&quot;
<P>
<img src="COOK.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/cook.gif"><p>
<H5>
Norman Grierson prepares breakfast at the Pennan Inn.  Bill Forsyth,
producer of "Local Hero" is still a hero to Grierson,  although other
residents believe that the film has ultimately done more harm than good.
</H5>
<p>
What keeps the Griersons' in business is their restaurant.  Formerly
owners of a pub in the Borders region of Scotland, the couple
were scouting around for a rural location for a restaurant.  They
saw the sign for Pennan and dropped in for a cup of tea.  &quot;We
had never heard of Local Hero,&quot; he said.  While waiting for
their tea, they heard that the inn was coming on the market. 
It never got that far because the Griersons snatched it up.
<P>
Now the chief benefactor of Forsyth's tale, Grierson is well-versed
in its lore.  Only a few village residents earned roles as extras.
They appear in the <I>ceilidh</I> (kay-lee) and in the scene
of the villagers descending on the beach.  Only one of them actually
still has a home in the village, a teacher working overseas. 
As to the direct profit for the city itself from the film, &quot;the
city received the princely sum of &#163;1,500,&quot; Grierson
said.
<P>
But Mac's greatest legacy to the village is not cash.  It is
very much the opposite -- fame without fortune, according to Gibson.
&quot;At the time, it seemed like a good thing,&quot; he said.
&quot;But it's almost 10 years and still the people come.  It
has made things beyond reach for ordinary people.  I dinna' think
it's been a good thing.&quot;
<P>
Unlike Pennan, Morar and Arisaig on the west coast were tourist
destinations long before Forsyth created Furness using the beach
close by.   &quot;It's been absolutely good for business,&quot;
said Colin MacDonald who works at the Morar Motor Garage.  &quot;Especially
with Americans, they all come here and ask where the beach is.&quot;
<P>
Despite the disdain of those youths gathered at the Restaurant
on Iona, &quot;Local Hero&quot; is appreciated by many Scots.
Some of its biggest boosters are with the Scottish Film Council.
&quot;It's a sleeper,&quot; said Kevin Cowle, head of training
for the Council.  Slow to catch on, the film has achieved &quot;cult
status,&quot; said Eddie Holmes, public relations manager.  Fans
watch it again and again and are rewarded each time with fresh
discoveries, subtleties of British humor we Americans are slow
to fathom.
<P>
Even Gibson who is saddened by the film's impact on Pennan liked
it.  &quot;It was good fun,&quot; he said, &quot;although they
left out some of the funnier parts.&quot;
<P>
Eleanor MacVarish, postmistress in Morar, was less restrained.
When she saw the film in London, she was thrilled to hear that
cosmopolitan crowd applaud the rescue of the fictional Scottish
village from an ugly industrial doom.  &quot;I was so proud,&quot;
she said.  &quot;I felt like laying on a thick Scottish accent
on the way out.&quot;
<P>
Forsyth does not deal in reality, but he does deal in truth.
Furness is true to the Scotland I know, and, camera wizardry
aside, it's true to the reality I found in Pennan and on Camusdarach
beach.  Sadly, the fictional Furness fared better than the town
that the film immortalized.  I mourn the changes to life in Pennan
just as I mourned the change that threatened Furness. 
<P>
Back home now, I find that the reality begins to fade, but the
truth doesn't.  And when I'm feeling sentimental, I have this
telephone number I jotted down -- 44 3466 210.  I dialed it just
now and no one answered.  I imagine it's windy there, certainly
raining as well.  The surf will be throwing rocks at the waterfront
windows.  Visitors will be crowded around those tiny tables quaffing
80 shilling ale.  When the wind sweeps the rain away, the air
will smell of seaweed thrown ashore by the storm.  Surely then
they will venture out.
<P>
I will try again later.
