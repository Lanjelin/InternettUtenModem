Cold steam slides off the window onto your numb hands.  Heavy
fog shrouds the scene beyond, and black soot seeps through the
drafty margins.
<P>
The weather on this October day is what the Scots describe as
&quot;drich,&quot; which can be pronounced correctly only when
you spit.   But the mood inside this train between Fort William
and Mallaig on British Rail's West Highland line leans more toward
&quot;bonnie.&quot;  Such a day attracts only the hard-core train
junkies who will be the first to confess that they are savoring
every bone-chilling mile.
<P>
&quot;Why am I here? It's great to stick your head out the window
and get soot in your eyes,&quot; said one English holiday-maker
and railroad buff I cornered on the train's last run for the season.
<P>
&quot;It's a religion...a form of madness,&quot; he said.

<H5>
The view from the train. The beautiful colours of a Scottish Glen and Loch.
</H5>
<p>
The Scottish landscape favors misty greys and browns in October,
but in May the countryside basks in color, yellow gorse, blushing
wild rhododendron and greens of every hue.  Each season promises
new wonder here where the mountains meet the western shore and
this old-fashioned steam train plies its rugged trade.
<P>
Intrigue is guaranteed by the fickle Scottish climate.  And the
passengers hale from many an unusual place.  But be forewarned:
This is not the Orient Express.  On board, the conversation leans
more toward nostalgia than who-dun-it.
<P>
I first journied on the crowded train through scenic Lochaber
in May with veteran travelers of the route, owners of a farm in
the Yorkshire Dales.  The panorama that unfolded as the portly
steam engine labored to conquer each incline enchanted even my
travel-weary companions.  Highland light fashioned romantic vistas
worthy of the finest palette.
<P>
The mood was festive, the car full of chatter with a decidedly
international flavor.  On board were Germans, Italians, English,
Scots and at least one American.
<P>
This ride through Scotland's wildest highlands is popular as
well with young people taking a break from what is euphemistically
known in Scotland as &quot;hill walking.&quot;  Many are just
down from Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Scotland at 4,418
feet.
<P>
<img src="PHOTOG.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/photog.gif"><p>
<H5>
A photographer bravely hangs out of the train window to capture the view.
</H5>
<p>
Photographers lined up in the compartment between 
the cars where the open window accommodated those who 
dared to lean out and shoot a picture, a practice now 
outlawed because of the 11 tunnels on the line.
<P>
On this warm day, the open window vents admitted enough of the
engine's hearty discharge to lend the occasion authenticity. 
At each crossing, the engine tooted modestly at the photographers
gathered to snap its picture.
<P>
The narration delivered in heavy Scottish brogue over an ancient
public address system was incomprehensible.  But on a rainy day
in July the train attracted fewer passengers and the history of
Lochaber was that much easier to hear and comprehend.
<P>
The 41 mile journey begins at Fort William on the sea Loch 
Linnhe in the shadow of Ben Nevis.  Here during the highland 
clearances many reluctant crofters were loaded onto ships for
the long journey to America.
<P>
From Fort William the train travels west crossing the 
Caledonian canal just below Neptune's Staircase, a series of 
eight locks built in 1822.  No longer wide enough for naval 
vessels, the locks provide fishing and pleasure craft a route
from the Atlantic ultimately to the Moray Firth via Loch Ness
thus avoiding the treacherous route around the north of Scotland.
Looking back toward Fort William, travelers will see Ben Nevis
towering over Loch Eil.
<P>
<img src="NEVIS.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/nevis.gif"><p>
<H5>
Ben Nevis beyond Loch Eil.  Ben Nevis is the highest mountain in
the United Kingdom.
</H5>
<p>
Beyond Loch Eil, <a href="../GREATS~1.HTM#cestuart" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#cestuart">Bonnie 
Prince Charlie</a> lore begins to enhance
the landscape.  The Bonnie Prince, pretender to the throne, is
second only to poet <a href="../GREATS~1.HTM#burns" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/greatscots.html#burns">Robbie 
Burns</a> in the hearts of the Scots for
his ill-fated Jacobite rebellion against the hated English.
<P>
Charles Edward Stuart first raised his standard at Glenfinnan
on the west coast in August 1745.  His rag-tag followers managed
to get as far as Edinburgh in the east but were soon forced into
a desperate retreat.  Their brutal defeat came at Culloden near
Inverness on April 16, 1746.  Much of the lore that attaches to
Charlie's legendary escape is based in Lochaber, the home of the
West Highland Line.
<P>
At Fassfearn Prince Charlie was said to have plucked a white
rose from a bush and stuck it in his hat, creating the White 
Cockade, the emblem of the Jacobites.
<P>
Just beyond, the train begins to cross the Glenfinnan 
Viaduct, considered an engineering marvel in its day, the first
mass concrete viaduct ever built in Britain.  To the west of the
viaduct lies Loch Shiel and the monument to the Bonnie Prince.
<P>
The inscription notes that there Charlie &quot;made the daring
and romantic attempt to recover a throne lost by the imprudence
of his ancestors.&quot;  On Loch Shiel Charlie was secreted through
enemy lines lying in a hollowed out log to make his retreat to
the Isle of Skye and ultimately to France where he died a drunkard.
<P>
At Loch Shiel the train begins the arduous assault on the wildest
of the highlands passing somber lochs and lonely 
glens.  A hard-won hill often garners a grateful, but always polite,
cheer from the passengers.
<P>
Again, the Bonnie Prince lends romance to the vista where a 
cave is said to have provided refuge during his flight.  I 
saw here one of Scotland's majestic red deer standing on a 
promontory, shocked by the intruding engine's belching, soot-spewing
manner.
<P>
<img src="CHAPEL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/chapel.gif"><p>
<H5>
The Chapel at Polnish.  This was the model for the church in "Local Hero"
</H5>
<p>
Film lovers may recognize an abandoned chapel at Polnish -- Our
Lady of the Braes.  The church was used as the model for a church
erected in the filming of the movie &quot;Local Hero,&quot; starring
Burt Lancaster.
<P>
Crossing Loch Nan Uamh on another viaduct, the cairn marking
the arrival and departing location of Bonnie Prince Charlie comes
into view.  
<P>
<img src="MORAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/tales/morar.gif"><p>
<H5>
The Sands of Morar with the Hebrides beyond.
</H5>
<p>
At this point, the train turns north to run along the 
western shore offering remarkable vistas of creamy beach, aquamarine
sea, and the isles of the Hebrides beyond.
<P>
Arisaig on the shore is the westerly most station on British
Rail.  Here the British climate is at its mildest thanks to the
proximity of the Gulf Stream.  Offshore are the islands of Eigg,
Rhum and Skye.
<P>
Most travelers stay on board all the way to Mallaig, Europe's
largest shrimp fishing port.  Residents of this scruffy little
town cater only reluctantly to tourists, an attitude I have found
rather endearing during my brief visits there.
<P>
Mallaig serves up the traditional fish and chips or a more proper
Bristish tea.  On a cold, rainy day passengers gravitate to the
pubs.
<P>
My favorite stop is at a book shop in a ramshackle trailer where
I found a fascinating selection of books including Gaelic, Self-Taught,
and a full-size inflatable Frankenstein.
<P>
I took time in October after the train pulled out of Mallaig
to question my traveling companions who were trying to squeeze
the last dregs out of their ale and their summer.
<P>
The youngest was Christopher Doig who at age 4 is, according
to his mother, &quot;already a train fanatic.&quot;
<P>
The loudest were a group on a tour arranged by an English 
firm called Inside Track. I asked how Lochaber compared to the
other lines they had seen.  On this rainy day, the answer was
&quot;It's wetter.&quot;
<P>
The fireman had abandoned his post long enough to grab a cup
of coffee, his face a shocking red from the day's work.  &quot;
'Tis dirty work,&quot; said Derek Pattrick, with a grin that betrayed
his love for the job.
<P>
The most well-informed traveler I spoke with that day was 
Graham King who had retired as a finance manager for British Rail
four years earlier. A frequent train traveler himself, he favors
the Lochaber line.  &quot;I guess it's the weather, the scenery,
the quietness about it,&quot; he said.  &quot;You can hop off at one
of the smaller stations and just get away completely.&quot;
<P>
Fascination with steam is growing, he said, among those who 
have known only diesel-powered trains.  &quot;We lived with the
beasts,&quot; King said, of the steam engines. &quot;We were glad
to get rid of them.&quot;
<P>
The other well-informed hobbyists on board represented the 
Scottish Railway Preservation Society, which provides the commentary
and operates the souvenir shop.
<P>
Nicholas McKellar explained that steam engines traveled 
Lochaber between 1901 and 1950 when diesel took over.  The steam
train was resurrected in 1985 and now operates four days a week
from May to October.  A diesel-powered Bristish Rail train 
operates on a daily schedule along the same line.
<P>
McKellar said he learned to love trains as a child when his 
father worked for British Rail.
<P>
&quot;What is it,&quot; I asked, &quot;that is so special about
steam trains?&quot;
<P>
&quot;It's just popular,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe you can't
understand it until you get soot in your eyes.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asked.
<P>
I looked at my soggy sneakers and the water on the inside of
my rain-proof coat.  &quot;You might say it's a form of madness,&quot;
I said.
<P>
McKellar smiled knowingly at his rail-loving buddies.
&quot;Aye, lassie,&quot; he said.  &quot;Aye.&quot;
