We had started our first year in Scotland as insecure and very
American travelers.  We wanted our own bathroom and a nice green
salad on every menu.  But returning for a second tour, we felt
more daring and planned a weekend devoted to spontaneity.
<P>
Still very American and not wanting to admit it, we set out with
every conceivable piece of gear we might need for this first weekend
we'd planned not to plan ahead.  Of course the weather justified
our over-packed boot somewhat--cold weather, hot weather, rainy
weather being all possible and more than likely all on the same
day.
<P>
I was also prepared to feed us for three days if no amenable
restaurant crossed our path.  The only snag here was that our
large cooler had very little to keep it cool.  The freezer in
the flat holds only two ice trays, no more, and less if we want
to store anything else there.  
<P>
I inquired at several supermarkets about bags of ice and was
greeted with an icy, and somewhat scolding &quot;no&quot; that
included the understanding that Scots, if they ever actually need
ice, make their own.  That Americans actually pay for this commodity
was shocking.  I was embarrassed to have revealed this shameful
thing.  
<P>
Also on board were our guidebooks, now aged a year beyond their
prime, but I considered them vital emergency protection.
<P>
The first leg of our journey took us over the A9, Britain's
most notorious killer road that staggers back and forth from two-
to four-lane highway as it blasts north through the Highlands.
Most of Scotland was traveling north, half of them with caravans
in tow, for this fine autumn weekend.  It was not a relaxing start.
<P>
We escaped the traffic when we veered east at Boat of Garten
and entered the Spey Valley.  The sun was still high and our relief
at leaving the motorway put us in the mood for traveling further.
A look around convinced us that this valley must be a land flowing
with bed and breakfasts.  We would look for the perfect scenic
spot, a riverside farmhouse perhaps with a charming pub nearby.
Another hour, we said.  Plenty of time.
<P>
The hour passed pleasantly as the scenery grew wilder and the
traffic saner.  Our target for stopping was 6:30.  We began to
look in earnest at 6:15 for that perfect B&amp;B.  At 7, we were
still searching.  A stop in one quaint village found both the
inn and the B&amp;B full. Sportsmen, we began to nervously surmise.
When exactly is the hunting season around here?
<P>
Then at last another sign.  A hotel ahead.  Expensive perhaps,
but possibly worth it.  The grounds of the place were shrouded
in mist as Scottish cattle with enormous horns roamed peacefully
about.  
<p>

<p>
Only a few cars sat in the car park, another hopeful sign.
We freed ourselves from three hours worth of oatcake crumbs and
gum wrappers and stumbled out of the car.
<P>
The sleek attire of the women who greeted us and the whispering
darkness of the lobby bespoke high rates.  But it was too late
to back out. We had to ask.  A double sir? Of course.  That will
be &#163;97,  an easy number to convert to dollars, about $170
per night.  Trying to retain our dignity we indicated that was
a little &quot;dear&quot; for us and hurried out into the misty
darkness.  I began to suspect that darkness was a serious handicap
to the successful spontaneous weekend.
<P>
We prayed and trekked onward, both apologizing profusely as though
we should have known better.  &quot;That's OK. It makes a better
story.&quot;  My husband, Mike, tried enthusiastically to agree.
<P>
Next stop: Elgin, a large splotch on the map and surely home
to innumerable B&amp;Bs.  Forget the scenery, let's just find
a bed.   Lots of traffic and lots of ugly orange street lights
later, we still had seen no B&amp;Bs.  &quot;Maybe this isn't
the main route through town,&quot; Mike said.  But it didn't look
like we would like any road through that town.  So we stuck to
our northward-bound course.
<P>
A few miles out we spotted it.  Farmhouse B&amp;B it said.  &quot;Shall
we ...?&quot; Mike said.  &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, with as much
authority as I could muster.  
<P>
The light was dim, but as we passed through the gate, we could
just make out the name, &quot;Barmuckity.&quot;  It was a funny
name and inspired some comments on what the muckity stood for.
<P>
Our hostess led us to a whole section of the house that we were
to have to ourselves and directed us to a pub nearby for a meal.
While we were settling in, she returned acting like she was the
intruder instead of us and advised us we might want to hurry.
&quot;I took a wee look at the paper,&quot; she said.  &quot;They
only serve until 8.&quot;
<P>
Outside we could just make out the shape of small sheds spread
widely about. Mike peered into the darkness and concluded without
too much confidence that we were looking at pigs. Perhaps an
explanation for the &quot;muckity.&quot;
<P>
Our first attempt to enter the pub at the Tenant Arms took us
through the wrong door.  This was the room for serious drinkers,
who also smoked and played snooker.  We were embarrassed by our
error.  When we finally entered aright, we were greeted by the
same woman who had shooed us out of the room on the other side.
There was something rather tentative in her welcome and very
telling in the silence and the stares of other diners.  They knew
we were foreigners.
<P>
It has happened so often that I ought to be accustomed to it
by now.  I still feel unwelcome, when more often than not, all
I should be doing is putting the waitress at ease.  We brought
an element of unpredictability into what was undoubtedly a very
familiar Friday night crowd.  We ordered our usual fish and chips.
She delivered our meals with a large dish of tartar sauce usually
an indication that we have been identified as Americans.
<P>
We tried to strike up a conversation and finally she softened.
&quot;Where is it your staying?&quot; she said.  &quot;Toward
Elgin,&quot; we said, pronouncing it properly with a &quot;g&quot;
as in gun.  &quot;The pig farm is it?&quot; she said grinning
for the first time.  &quot;Yes!&quot;  We shared the joke and
confessed we hadn't actually figured that out at first.
<P>
We soon feared that we were dawdling beyond the allotted time.
There is a rather strict limit on when you are supposed to be
eating in most of these places.  We never seem to get it quite
right.  We apologized and asked for dessert anyway.  One dish
appealed to us: Dream or cream, (she wasn't sure) Rob Roy. Mike
ordered one, and we determined it was both dreamy and creamy,
so I ordered another.  We also defied tradition when we left a
tip on the table.  It is a hard habit to break, especially when
you sense that your presence has caused more than the normal inconvenience.
<P>
 
Back at Barmuckity, the wee children were in their jams and were
shushed out of the way when we came in.  The only residents for
the night, we had the bath, the sitting room and a small kitchen
all to ourselves.  But we were ready to crash and slept quite
soundly through the night.  The sweet sound of children's voices
and breakfasting parents greeted us through the door down the
hall when we awoke.
<P>
Our breakfast was served in the living room at a table surrounded
by a large bay window.  &quot;Yup, those are pigs all right.&quot;
We watched as four huge sows poked about.  It was fascinating
as we tried to determine who was doing what out there in what
we realized were acres of pigs.  We barely flinched when the sausage
and bacon were served, although I couldn't really do them justice.
But I can't blame the pigs.  I can never do the meat in these
British breakfasts justice.
<P>
We asked our hostess about the farm.  She said we were welcome
to look around after breakfast.  Barmuckity actually means &quot;hill
of pigs,&quot; she said.  But when they bought the place two years
ago not knowing what the name meant, there were no pigs there.
That was their addition after moving away from Edinburgh.  Now
Barmuckity is home to 20 boars, 250 sows and 2,000 piglets.
<P>
Noting a large pile of boots outside the front door (obviously
important gear on a pig farm), we loaded the car and began to
shoot photos and study the operation.  We couldn't see any piglets,
but one of the workers offered to give us a tour.  We jumped at
the opportunity, stepping gingerly through the &quot;muckity&quot;
and over the 8,000 volt electric fence that segregates the various
groups of pigs.  He took us to metal huts where huge sows lay
with huge litters of piglets jockeying for a spot to feed.  A
lighthearted border collie pranced about behind us.

<p>
&quot;Would you like to hold a piglet?&quot; he said.  &quot;Sure!&quot;
He pulled one out of the shed and handed it gently to me.  The
little guy was terrified.  His squirming stopped abruptly. Only
his frightened little eyes were moving.  &quot;Do you see how
warm they are?&quot; asked our guide with a lovely touch of wonder
from one who sees the drama enacted day after day, over and over
again.  &quot;Even in winter they're warm like that,&quot; he
said.
<P>
He went on to explain proudly that the farm is &quot;environmentally
friendly.&quot;  The pigs are raised on straw, not cement, which
is more humane.  They were also scattered about over many acres.
Only in the barn where a few of them were corralled closely together
was the odour strong.
<P>
We left Barmuckity full of wonder ourselves at the goodness of
God.  &quot;I think henceforth the word Barmuckity will represent
for me the wonderful surprises God has in store for us,&quot;
Mike said.
