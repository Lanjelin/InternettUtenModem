   Moray, Lord of Man and of Annandale, Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March,

   reverence, with devout kisses of his blessed feet.
<P>   
   Most Holy Father and Lord, we know and from the chronicles and books
   of the ancients we find that among other famous nations our own, the
   Scots, has been graced with widespread renown. They journeyed from
   Greater Scythia by way of the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of
   Hercules, and dwelt for a long course of time in Spain among the most
   savage tribes, but nowhere could they be subdued by any race, however
   barbarous. Thence they came, twelve hundred years after the people of
   Israel crossed the Red Sea, to their home in the west where they still
   live today. The Britons they first drove out, the Picts they utterly
   destroyed, and, even though very often assailed by the Norwegians, the
   Danes and the English, they took possession of that home with many
   victories and untold efforts; and, as the historians of old time bear
   witness, they have held it free of all bondage ever since. In their
   kingdom there have reigned one hundred and thirteen kings of their own
   royal stock, the line unbroken a single foreigner.
<P>   
   The high qualities and deserts of these people, were they not
   otherwise manifest, gain glory enough from this: that the King of
   kings and Lord of lords, our Lord Jesus Christ, after His Passion and
   Resurrection, called them, even though settled in the uttermost parts
   of the earth, almost the first to His most holy faith. Nor would He
   have them confirmed in that faith by merely anyone but by the first of
   His Apostles -- by calling, though second or third in rank -- the most
   gentle Saint Andrew, the Blessed Peter's brother, and desired him to
   keep them under his protection as their patron forever.
<P>   
   The Most Holy Fathers your predecessors gave careful heed to these
   things and bestowed many favours and numerous privileges on this same
   kingdom and people, as being the special charge of the Blessed Peter's
   brother. Thus our nation under their protection did indeed live in
   freedom and peace up to the time when that mighty prince the King of
   the English, Edward, the father of the one who reigns today, when our
   kingdom had no head and our people harboured no malice or treachery
   and were then unused to wars or invasions, came in the guise of a
   friend and ally to harass them as an enemy. The deeds of cruelty,
   massacre, violence, pillage, arson, imprisoning prelates, burning down
   monasteries, robbing and killing monks and nuns, and yet other
   outrages without number which he committed against our people, sparing
   neither age nor sex, religion nor rank, no one could describe nor
   fully imagine unless he had seen them with his own eyes.
<P>   
   But from these countless evils we have been set free, by the help of
   Him Who though He afflicts yet heals and restores, by our most
   tireless Prince, King and Lord, the Lord Robert. He, that his people
   and his heritage might be delivered out of the hands of our enemies,
   met toil and fatigue, hunger and peril, like another Macabaeus or
   Joshua and bore them cheerfully. Him, too, divine providence, his
   right of succession according to or laws and customs which we shall
   maintain to the death, and the due consent and assent of us all have
   made our Prince and King. To him, as to the man by whom salvation has
   been wrought unto our people, we are bound both by law and by his
   merits that our freedom may be still maintained, and by him, come what
   may, we mean to stand.
<P>   
   Yet if he should give up what he has begun, and agree to make us or
   our kingdom subject to the King of England or the English, we should
   exert ourselves at once to drive him out as our enemy and a subverter
   of his own rights and ours, and make some other man who was well able
   to defend us our King; for, as long as but a hundred of us remain
   alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule.
   It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are
   fighting, but for freedom -- for that alone, which no honest man gives
   up but with life itself.
<P>   
   Therefore it is, Reverend Father and Lord, that we beseech your
   Holiness with our most earnest prayers and suppliant hearts, inasmuch
   as you will in your sincerity and goodness consider all this, that,
   since with Him Whose vice-gerent on earth you are there is neither
   weighing nor distinction of Jew and Greek, Scotsman or Englishman, you
   will look with the eyes of a father on the troubles and privation
   brought by the English upon us and upon the Church of God. May it
   please you to admonish and exhort the King of the English, who ought
   to be satisfied with what belongs to him since England used once to be
   enough for seven kings or more, to leave us Scots in peace, who live
   in this poor little Scotland, beyond which there is no dwelling-place
   at all, and covet nothing but our own. We are sincerely willing to do
   anything for him, having regard to our condition, that we can, to win
   peace for ourselves.
<P>   
   This truly concerns you, Holy Father, since you see the savagery of
   the heathen raging against the Christians, as the sins of Christians
   have indeed deserved, and the frontiers of Christendom being pressed
   inward every day; and how much it will tarnish your Holiness's memory
   if (which God forbid) the Church suffers eclipse or scandal in any
   branch of it during your time, you must perceive. Then rouse the
   Christian princes who for false reasons pretend that they cannot go to
   help of the Holy Land because of wars they have on hand with their
   neighbours. The real reason that prevents them is that in making war
   on their smaller neighbours they find quicker profit and weaker
   resistance. But how cheerfully our Lord the King and we too would go
   there if the King of the English would leave us in peace, He from Whom
   nothing is hidden well knows; and we profess and declare it to you as
   the Vicar of Christ and to all Christendom.
<P>   
   But if your Holiness puts too much faith in the tales the English tell
   and will not give sincere belief to all this, nor refrain from
   favouring them to our prejudice, then the slaughter of bodies, the
   perdition of souls, and all the other misfortunes that will follow,
   inflicted by them on us and by us on them, will, we believe, be surely
   laid by the Most High to your charge.
<P>   
   To conclude, we are and shall ever be, as far as duty calls us, ready
   to do your will in all things, as obedient sons to you as His Vicar;
   and to Him as the Supreme King and Judge we commit the maintenance of
   our cause, csating our cares upon Him and firmly trusting that He will
   inspire us with courage and bring our enemies to nought.
<P>   
   May the Most High preserve you to his Holy Church in holiness and
   health and grant you length of days.
<P>   
   Given at the monastery of Arbroath in Scotland on the sixth day of the
   month of April in the year of grace thirteen hundred and twenty and
   the fifteenth year of the reign of our King aforesaid.
