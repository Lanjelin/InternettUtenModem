<hr>
The Scottish flag is the cross of St. Andrew,  also known as the Saltire.
It is said to be one of the oldest national flags of any country, dating back at
least to the 12th century.
<P>
Tradition suggests that <A HREF="STANDR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/standrew.html">St. Andrew</A>
(an apostle of Jesus in the Christian religion) was put to death by the Romans 
in Greece by being pinned to a cross of this shape.
<p>
The flag of the United Kingdom - known as the Union Flag or Union Jack - is 
made up from the flags of Scotland, England (the Cross of Saint George) and
Ireland (the Cross of Saint Patrick).

There is a second flag which is associated with Scotland,  the "Rampant Lion",
or Royal Flag of Scotland.
Although based on an older Scottish flag than the St. Andrew's Cross, it should,
strictly speaking, now only be used by the monarch in relation to her capacity
as Queen in Scotland&#185;. However, it is widely used as a second national
flag.
<p>
The Rampant Lion flag flies over the offices of the Secretary of State for 
Scotland (who is the representative of the U.K. government in Scotland); that is
Dover House in London and New St Andrew's House in Edinburgh.
<p>

King George V signed a Royal Warrant in 1934 allowing the use of the Rampant
Lion flag as "a mark of loyalty" because of the forthcoming Jubilee
celebrations. The Lord Lyon&#178; officially now takes the view that this permission
"related to decorative ebullition", that is, it is permissable to wave the flag
at football matches.   It is however not allowable to fly the flag without
permission, on a flag-pole or from a building.  The Lord Lyon  once threatened
the town councillors of Cumbernauld with an Act passed in 1679 which prescribed
the death penalty for mis-use of the royal arms.

&#185; Scotland has not had its own monarchy since the Act of Union with England
in 1707.  Queen Elizabeth II is monarch of United Kingdom of 
<a href="BRITAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/britain.html">Great Britain</a> and Northern Ireland.
<p>
&#178; The Lord Lyon of Arms is the judicial officer responsible for upholding
heraldic law in Scotland.
