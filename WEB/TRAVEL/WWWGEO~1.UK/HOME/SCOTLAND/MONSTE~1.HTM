The Loch Ness Monster</H1>
<hr>

Loch Ness is located in the North of Scotland and is one of a series of 
interlinked lochs which run along the Great Glen.  The Great Glen is
a distinctive incision which runs across the country and represents
a large geological fault zone.  The interlinking was completed in the
19th century following the completion of the Caledonian Canal.
<p>
For many years it has been supposed that there is a large dinosaur-like
"monster" resident in Loch Ness.  The evidence for its existence are
a series of sightings of a plesiosaur-like dinosaur throughout the
last 100 years.  The case has occasionally been supported by indistinct
photographic evidence.
<p>
However, several scientific studies have been conducted, including 
thorough sonar surveys of the loch, and these have not revealed any
presence of such a "monster".   Many people believe that the 
size (21 square miles) and great depth of the loch (almost 800 feet), 
together with potential underwater caves, gives
the monster many places to hide.
<p>
Regardless of the truth, the suggestion of the Monster's existence
makes Loch Ness one of Scotland's top tourist attractions.

Loch Morar, in the West of Scotland, is also said to support a
monster, but the evidence for this is even more tenuous!
