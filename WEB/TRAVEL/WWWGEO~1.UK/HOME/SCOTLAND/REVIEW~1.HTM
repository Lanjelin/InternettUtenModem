We were 'reviewed' by Pointcom and awarded one of their 'Top 5% of the Web'

<P>And you thought you had management problems: Scotland's territory includes 
787 islands, an astouding number for a country 274 miles long. From the 
University of Edinburgh's geography department comes this straight-forward 
guide to things Scottish. Lots of facts and figures here: a cool historical 
database with weather and crop stats from 1550-1780 and the complete list of 
Scottish and British monarchs. But there is some life here, from Scottish 
soccer teams' pages to drawings of more than 280 tartans (the plaid patterns 
particular to the various clans). Add a quick history and links to many other 
pages round out a spartan but useful page. Certainly nothing out of kilt 
here.
