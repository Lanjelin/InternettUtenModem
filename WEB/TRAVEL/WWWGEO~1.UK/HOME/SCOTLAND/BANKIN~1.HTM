<h1>Banking in Scotland</h1>
<hr>
Scotland also has its own banking system, which supports four major 
international clearing banks:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <em><a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3166" tppabs="http://www.bankofscotland.co.uk/">Bank of 
         Scotland</a></em><br>
  Headquartered in Edinburgh,  this bank was founded in 1695 and is the oldest
  bank in Scotland.
<LI> <em><a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3167" tppabs="http://www.royalbankscot.co.uk/">Royal Bank 
         of Scotland</a></em><br>
  Headquartered in Edinburgh and founded in 1727.
<LI> <em>Clydesdale Bank</em><br>
  Headquartered in Glasgow
<LI> <em>TSB Scotland</em><br>
  Headquartered in Edinburgh.  The Trustee Savings Banks which were started
  in Scotland in 1810, were originally local banks run by a groups of trustees.
  They were incorporated in Scotland in 1985 as the TSB Group, with shares
  issued to the public the following year.

<p>
There are also a significant number of merchant banks 
(for example the British Linen Bank) and other financial
institutions (including leading insurance companies and investment funds)
headquartered in Edinburgh,  which is one of the world's
largest financial centres.
<p>
The Bank of England in Threadneedle Street, London is the U.K. equivalent 
of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.  It issues currency in the U.K. on behalf 
of the government, under Royal Charters of 1694 and 1946.
However, the Bank of Scotland, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale 
Bank have all, by long standing tradition,  issue their own banknotes.  
<p>
These banknotes are widely used throughout Scotland,  and are 
<em>generally</em> accepted elsewhere in the United Kingdom, although strictly 
are not legal tender.  Visitors are advised to exchange Scottish notes before
leaving the U.K.

are the same for Scottish and English notes.
<p>
Scottish banknotes are available in the following denominations:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> &#163;1
<LI> &#163;5
<LI> &#163;10
<LI> &#163;20
<LI> &#163;100
</UL>
The Bank of England no longer issues &#163;1 notes, since the
introduction of the &#163;1 coin.  The Scottish banks issue &#163;100 notes,
whereas the Bank of England issues &#163;50 notes.
<p>
To further confuse the visitor,
other parts of the United Kingdom also issue their own banknotes, for
example Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
