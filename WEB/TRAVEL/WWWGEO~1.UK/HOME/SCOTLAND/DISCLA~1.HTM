<h1>Aim:</h1>
The "Gateway to Scotland" aims to be the definitive source of validated
information on the geography, history, culture, tourism and traditions
of Scotland.  We hope to achieve this through locally 
provided information, together with links to carefully selected pages and
organisations which are known to provide reliable information.
<p>
The "Gateway to Scotland" confines itself to facts, and explicitly does
not present opinions.

in good faith.  No liability will be accepted under any circumstances.
