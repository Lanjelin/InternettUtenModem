<title>Scotland:  Regions and Districts after the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1974</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Administrative Divisions in Scotland after 1974</h1>
<hr>
Following the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1974 a two-tier system of
local authorities was enacted, which operated until 1995.
There were 9 Regional Authorities
(broken down into 53 District Councils) and 3 unitary Island Councils.
<p>
In both cases,  these local government institutions were run by a body
of councillors,  who are elected every four years.
