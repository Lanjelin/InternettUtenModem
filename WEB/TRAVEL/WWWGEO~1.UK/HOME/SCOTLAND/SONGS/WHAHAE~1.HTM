Bruce before Bannockburn
</H1>

<h3><em>(Written by Robert Burns)</em></h3>

<h4>
Otherwise known by its first line "Scots wha hae", this is a song of 
national pride and loyalty,  and as always with such things it relates
to fighting with the English!
</h4>
<hr>

Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled,<BR>
Scots, wham Bruce has aften led,<BR>
Welcome to your gory bed,<BR>
Or to victorie.
<p>

Now's the day, and now's the hour;<BR>
See the front of battle lour;<BR>
See approach proud Edward's power -<BR>
Chains and slaverie!
<p>

Wha will be a traitor's knave?<BR>
Wha can fill a coward's grave?<BR>
Wha's sae base as be a slave?<BR>
Let him turn and flee!
<p>

Wha for Scotland's King and Law,<BR>
Freedom's sword will strongly draw,<BR>
Free-man stand, or free-man fa'?<BR>
Let him follow me!
<p>

By oppression's woes and pains!<BR>
By your sons in servile chains!<BR>
We will drain our dearest veins,<BR>
But they shall be free!
<p>

Lay the proud usurpers low!<BR>
Tyrants fall in every foe!<BR>
Liberty's in every blow!<BR>
Let us do, or die!
