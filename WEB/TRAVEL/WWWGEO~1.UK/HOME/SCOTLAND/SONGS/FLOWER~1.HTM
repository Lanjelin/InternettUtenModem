Although "Flower of Scotland" is not a traditional song, it has been
adopted as Scotland's de facto national anthem,  along with 
"Scotland the Brave"

<hr>
O Flower of Scotland,<br>
When will we see<br>
Your like again,<br>
That fought and died for,<br>
Your wee bit Hill and Glen,<br>
And stood against him,<br>
Proud Edward's Army,<br>
And sent him homeward,<br>
Tae think again.
<p>

The Hills are bare now,<br>
And Autumn leaves <br>
lie thick and still,<br>
O'er land that is lost now,<br>
Which those so dearly held,<br>
That stood against him,<br>
Proud Edward's Army,<br>
And sent him homeward,<br>
Tae think again.
<p>

Those days are past now,<br>
And in the past <br>
they must remain,<br>
But we can still rise now,<br>
And be the nation again,<br>
That stood against him,<br>
Proud Edward's Army,<br>
And sent him homeward,<br>
Tae think again.
<p>
