<p>
Field outings to a wide range of destinations are organised by members of
the various regional centres and RSGS headquarters. <br>
Members of the Perth Centre in association with Perth Hill Walking club
made a summer visit to The Faroe Islands.<br>
Stirling Centre members recently visited the new Glenfinglas Reservoir and
Loch Katrine, where they enjoyed a comprehensive tour of the water works.
<p>
Opportunities for special trips abroad are advertised in the Society's
newsletter <a href="PUBS~1.HTM#Geogscot" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/rsgs/pubs.html#Geogscot">Geogscot</a>.  Leaders are chosen for their
experience or specialist knowledge.
<p>
Members also have the chance to contribute to geographical field work and
research.  Recently members had the opportunity to take part in the 1996
British Land Use Survey organised by the Geographical Association. The
results of the survey are due for publication in April 1997.
