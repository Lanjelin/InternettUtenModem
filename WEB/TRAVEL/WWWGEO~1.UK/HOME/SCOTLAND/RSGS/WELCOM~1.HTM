David Munro took over as Director and Secretary of RSGS on 1 November 1996.
He has a long association with the Society, having been a member for over
a decade.  He was appointed to Council in 1990 and has served on the
publications and library committees, contributing articles to <a

<a href="FIELD~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/rsgs/field.html">Field Outings</a> has included leading the last
RSGS excursion to the Inner Isles.

Dr Munro was formerly at the Geography Department of the University of
Edinburgh where he finished his doctoral thesis in Historical Geography in
1983 and went on to be appointed a Research Fellow.  He has been a
contributor to the <a href="../SCOTLA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html">Gateway to
Scotland</a> WWW site and <a href="GAZETT~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/rsgs/gazetteer.html">The

Dr Munro's achievements in the world of geographical publications include
editing the Chambers World Gazetteer and the Oxford Dictionary of the
World.  He has published articles, particularly about his travels in

David Munro now looks forward to "helping the RSGS face the challenge of
the new Millennium by engaging people's interest in exploring and
understanding the world about us".
