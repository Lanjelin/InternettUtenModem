Project</a></h2>
<p>
RSGS is involved in a collaboration with the 
<a href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs31.htm#3115" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/geoghome.html">Geography Department</a> of the
University of Edinburgh which aims to develop an online
<a href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs31.htm#3116" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/~scotgaz/gazhome.htm">Gazetteer for
Scotland</a>, a comprehensive geographical database, accessible
internationally via the World Wide Web.  The project is designed to
complement and enhance the Gateway to Scotland WWW site, "the definitive
source of information about Scotland on the Internet".
<p>
The new director of RSGS, Dr David Munro has contributed to the Gazetteer
for Scotland Project in his work with Bruce Gittings at the University of Edinburgh.  The
project has been supported by a grant from the Carnegie Trust for the
Universities of Scotland.  Sponsorship is now invited to enable completion
of the project.
