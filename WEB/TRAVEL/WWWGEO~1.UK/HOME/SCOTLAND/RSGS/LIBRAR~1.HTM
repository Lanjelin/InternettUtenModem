<p>
The Society has extensive book, journal, map and slide libraries which are
available to Members. The collections are continually updated and RSGS
welcomes donations of relevant material.
<p>
<h3>Book Collection</h3>
<p>
The book and journal collection of the RSGS is housed in a specially
dedicated reading room in the Andersonian Library of the <a
href="../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS32.HTM#3281" tppabs="http://www.strath.ac.uk/">University of Strathclyde</a>, adjacent to
the University's geography collection.  Access to the collection is free to
members of RSGS.
<p>
The collection comprises over 10,000 books and 3,000 volumes of journals
together with 150 foreign language serials formerly housed in the National
Library of Scotland.  All material is accessible through the online
catalogue of the Andersonian Library which can be accessed nationally and
internationally via JANET (Joint Academic NETwork), OCLC and the Internet.
<p>
<h3>Picture Collection</h3>
<p>
The RSGS picture collection comprises over 20,000 35mm colour slides of
geographical subjects from around the world, 5,000 antique glass lantern
slides, many of which relate to past expeditions mounted by the Society,
and a collection of historic photographs mainly of past officers of the
Society. <br>
The collection is being catalogued and transferred to CD-ROM.
<p>
<h3>Map Collection</h3>
<p>
The map collection comprises an historic collection of over 15,000 maps,
many of which were collected in association with RSGS expeditions.  The
collection is in the process of being catalogued.  Antique maps from the
collection have been transferred to the National Library of Scotland for
conservation.
<p>
<h3>Archives</h3>
<p>
RSGS has a small but important archive of material relating to past
expeditions, voyages and the work of famous explorers, together with
records of the activities of the Society since its founding in 1884.
