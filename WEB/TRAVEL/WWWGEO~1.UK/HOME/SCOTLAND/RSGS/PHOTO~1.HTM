<p>
Each year RSGS runs a photographic competition for members.  There are
prizes of photographic equipment and the winning photographs from each of
the three categories are published in <a href="PUBS~1.HTM#Geogscot" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/rsgs/pubs.html#Geogscot">Geogscot</a>. 
<p>
Each of the <a href="REGION~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/rsgs/regional.html">RSGS Regional Centres
</a>runs its own competition, the winners of which go forward to the
national competition.
<p>
The 1996 first prize winner is Anne Jenkins of the Glasgow Centre with her
dramatic image of the crater of Mount Etna.  She wins a camera donated by
Olympus.  The runner-up, David Robertson of Stirling, wins a camera bag
donated by Billingham Bags.

The 1997 photographic competition will be judged in November.
