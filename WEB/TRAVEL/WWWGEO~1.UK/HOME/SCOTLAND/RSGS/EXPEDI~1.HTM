<p>
The Society helps with the funding of Scottish-based expeditions to many
parts of the world.  Many expeditions return to Scotland with new
scientific discoveries.  Recent expeditions, part-funded by RSGS, have
visited Botswana, Madagascar, Iceland, Belize, Uganda, Chile, Canada,
Mongolia, Morocco, Ecuador, Cyprus, Indonesia, Malaysia, Norway, Bolivia,
Thailand and Trinidad.
<p>
One of the aims of RSGS is to provide geographers with the opportunity for
field work.  In 1996 RSGS supported eight research expeditions to
destinations ranging from Central Africa to Spitsbergen.
<p>
The four-member team for the expedition to Malawi, comprised third year
geography students from Aberdeen.  The girls worked in Muona Mission and
Chitera in southern Malawi.  On their return in September 1996 they
described their trip as 'an opportunity of a lifetime'.
<p>
In addition to university research expeditions, RSGS also encourages youth
projects and school field trips.
<p>
In June 1996, after many months of fund raising, twenty two pupils and
three members of staff from Portree High School on the Isle of Skye, left
for Morocco to study land use and rural settlement in the valleys of the
High Atlas Mountains.
<p>
A study tour of India by teacher trainees from Jordanhill was supported to
enable them to develop cross-cultural studies for primary school children.
<p>
The Society has also been asked to administer the expedition funds of the
Springboard Trust.  Individual as well as group expeditions may be funded.
Contact RSGS headquarters in Glasgow for application forms and details of
how to apply.
