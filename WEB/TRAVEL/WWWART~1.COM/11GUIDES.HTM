<br>
<font size="4">Guidebooks</font></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>I've encountered several backpackers who absolutely
    disdained guidebooks. They considered it pathetic how
    &quot;lemming tourists clutch their stupid books, obeying the
    dictums of some probably drunken and half-crazed
    writer.&quot; Their ideal was to float from place to place,
    traveling on circumstance and happenstance only. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I usually have a guidebook because it efficiently provides
    important information, saves time and money, and allows me to
    travel lighter upon the environment. I also prefer not to be
    cold, hungry, lost, and/or in jail. Most travelers agree with
    my view and also carry some kind of guidebook.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You don't want to get into a &quot;guidebook says&quot;
    routine, though. Use your guidebook as a tool; don't let it
    dictate everything you do. Many of my best travel times have
    been in places ignored or trashed by guidebooks, probably
    because I allowed spontaneity and happenstance to be my
    guide.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Let's Go</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Written by Harvard students on their summer tours, these
    well-written, annually-updated guidebooks pack a great deal
    of budget backpacker information in a well-designed format.
    Begun in 1961 with a student pamphlet to Europe, <em>Let's Go</em>
    now produces twenty guidebooks, including <em>Let's Go:
    Europe; Let's Go: Mexico; Let's Go: France; Let's Go: Italy;
    Let's Go: Spain and Portugal; Let's Go: California; Let's Go:
    Thailand; etc</em>. Distributed by St. Martin's Press, New

<h4 align="center">Berkeley Guides </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Written by Berkelely and other California state university
    students on their summer tours, these well-written,
    annually-updated guidebooks also pack a great deal of budget
    backpacker information in a well-designed format. Launched in
    1991 to compete with <em>Let's Go</em>, these twelve guides
    are also a great value. Distributed by Fodor's, New York. <a

</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Lonely Planet </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>These 140 guidebooks are the unquestioned leader among
    backpackers in developing countries. Their <em>Travel
    Survival Kit</em> and <em>Shoestring</em> series books are
    all packed with great value in the same practical format,
    which includes many maps and recommendations. They are
    usually written by two, three, or four writers who compile
    information as they travel. Lonely Planet guidebooks are
    updated about every three years. Originally all Australian,
    some are now produced in California. Distributed in the U.S.
    by Lonely Planet, Oakland, California. <a

    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Rough Guides </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These British guides strongly compete with Lonely Planet.
    There are over sixty in the series, from <em>Amsterdam</em>
    to <em>Nepal</em> to <em>World Music</em> (see <a
    href="25BIBLIO.HTM" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/25biblio.htm">bibliography</a>).

</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Moon Publications </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>These U.S. produced Handbook series of fifty guides
    compete with Lonely Planet and Rough Guides. I'll vouch that
    Moon's <em>South Pacific Handbook</em> qualifies as
    literature. Distributed by Moon Publications, Chico,
    California. <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs32.htm#3202" tppabs="http://www.moon.com/">moon.com</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Baedeker </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Begun by the German Karl Baedeker in 1829, these were so
    popular <em>baedeker</em> became a synonym for guidebook.
    Some rare book dealers specialize in Baedekers. Today these
    outstanding guides are beautifully color illustrated, have
    excellent maps and site information, and are
    conveniently-sized. </p>
    <p>Baedeker guides focus on the educational experience of
    travel. As for the where-to-stay, where-to-eat, and
    where-to-get-a-zipper-repaired aspects of travel, they
    typically only list addresses for upscale hotels in the back.
    Distributed in the U.K. by the Automobile Association,
    Basingstoke, Hampshire, and in the U.S. by Prentice Hall
    Travel, New York.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Blue Guides </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Begun in 1918, these higher-brow, scholar-written
    guidebooks are heavy with detailed site information. Blue
    Guides' <em>Greece</em> is the classic for those with serious
    interest in classical antiquity. Another interesting title in
    their series of fifty guides is <em>Literary Britain and
    Ireland</em>. Distributed by A &amp; C Black, London, and
    W.W. Norton, New York. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">&nbsp; South American Handbook </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>First printed in 1923, the classic <em>South American
    Handbook</em> is revised yearly. While costing $40, it is
    crammed with the maximum possible information for the South
    American traveler. Much information is supplied by readers
    sending updates, and some is always a few years out of date,
    but &quot;the Handbook&quot; (as it is universally known by
    South American travelers) more than compensates with 1500
    thin pages of small print in a surprisingly compact format.
    Published by Trade and Travel Publications, Bath, England,
    and in the U.S. by Passport Books, Lincolnwood, Illinois.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Cadogan Guides </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>This British series of fifty travel guides are filled with
    color photographs and cultural insights. <em>Cadogan's City
    Guides</em> are pocket-sized and especially good for European
    cities. Distributed in the U.S. by The Globe Pequot Press,
    Old Saybrook, Connecticut.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Insight Guides </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Are filled with beautiful photographs and interesting
    writing by a variety of journalists who know their subject.
    Insight Guides are best read before your journey to get a
    feel for the people, culture, and landscape. They also have
    an overview of practical information in the back. I have nine
    of Insight's 180 titles on my bookshelf.. Distributed in the
    U.S. by Houghton Mifflin, New York.<br>

Murray's Guidebooks </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>These nineteenth century European guides are favorites of
    today's consummate traveler and travel writer Jan Morris, who
    treasures her <em>Murray's Handbook for Spain</em> (1845).
    Aldous Huxley writes of Murray's,<em> &quot;It is delightful
    to read on the spot the impressions and opinions of tourists
    who visited a hundred years ago, in the vehicles and with the
    aesthetic prejudices of the period....The voyage ceases to be
    a mere tour through space; you travel through time and
    thought as well.&quot;</em> <br>

<h4 align="center">Gay Guidebooks </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ferrari Publications produces gay- and lesbian-friendly
    guidebooks, which list hotels, restaurants, bookstores, bars,
    meeting places, telephone help lines, etc. They also contain
    articles about gay life in various countries. Books include <em>Ferrari's
    for Women, Ferrari's for Men, Ferrari's Travel Planner, and
    Inn Places</em>. These books are updated annually and,
    according to Ferrari, are &quot;very accurate.&quot;

<h4 align="center">French Backpacker Guidebooks </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>For every city they list a couple of the cheapest hotels
    and hostels, a few museums, cathedrals, major sites, etc.,
    followed by ten pages of detailed restaurant reviews. <em>(I'll
    bet you think I'm kidding.)</em><br>

Tourist Offices </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most European cities big enough for a stoplight have some
    kind of tourist office somewhere. Indeed many large European
    cities have a tourist office at the airport, one (sometimes
    two) in each of the main train stations, and several more in
    the city center. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The tourist office almost always has free or cheap maps
    and dozens of pamphlets detailing the inestimable glories of
    their city. As soon as you get to the front of the line the
    clerk hands you a pile of tourist literature. </p>
    <p>When my turn comes I usually first ask what cultural
    events are happening around town. Then I ask about a local
    English language newspaper that lists the week's or month's
    happenings. Lastly I ask about the cheapest possible
    accomodation. Hostels and campgrounds are usually clearly
    marked on the map and circled by the clerk. I'm well on my
    way if I leave the tourist office at least thinking I know
    which way to begin going.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many tourist offices offer an accomodation-finding service
    for free or a few dollars. Note there is often a separate,
    longer line for this. The clerk makes the calls and finds a
    room, then directs you there.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">City Orientation </h4>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> The highest spot in town is
        usually high on my agenda. Having a look from up there is
        an aid in your future navigation. You will also feel more
        at home, more relaxed, and have more empathy for the
        city. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>2</strong>. I sometimes keep a small compass
        in my pocket for navigating large cities. With a map and
        compass I often only need one street sign and a few
        seconds to determine directions. Without a compass much
        depends upon my physical and mental state, which are not
        always dependable. A compass is especially useful when
        coming up from the netherworld of a subway. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> The best travel, wherever you are,
        is simply checking out the local scene. What could be
        easier? <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Newspapers </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travelers do not have to go without news from back home
    and around the world. <em>The International Herald Tribune</em>
    is widely distributed in Europe, somewhat less so in Asia. A
    compilation of the <em>Washington Post </em>and the <em>New
    York Times</em>, it was begun in Paris in 1887 for the
    American expatriate community in Europe. It's always a treat
    to relax at a café with a copy of the IHT. </p>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/IHT.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/iht.jpg"
    alt="Enjoying the view with the International Herald Tribune in Venice."
    align="right" hspace="9" vspace="4" width="240" height="187"><em>The
    Wall Street Journal </em>has European and Asian editions, and
    <em>USA Today </em>is also widely available. <em>The Miami
    Herald International Edition</em> is the pre-eminent American
    newspaper in Central and South America, if not the
    pre-eminent <em>newspaper</em> in Central and South America.</p>
    <p>The English newspapers <em>The Guardian</em> and <em>The
    Times</em> differ from American newspapers in that their
    reporters interject more of themselves into articles than is
    customary in the U.S. This may take the form of opinion or
    humor. Both are acclaimed for in-depth reportage. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Belizean newspapers, on the other hand, make no pretense
    whatsoever at objective reporting. Depending upon which
    political party they support, one paper may report a
    thoughtful speech of the highest statesmanship, while another
    proclaims it a pack of stuttered lies by a thieving
    scoundrel. </p>
    <p>Many major cities around the world have a daily or weekly
    English newspaper for their English-speaking communities. I
    especially enjoy these because they provide an intimate view
    of what's going on politically, economically, and culturally.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The above newspapers are usually available at some
    newsstands in the downtown area of a major city, although in
    some far-out countries you many need to go to a major tourist
    hotel, and then they may be a few days old.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Students Cafés </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>An often overlooked source of information and camaraderie
    is student cafés near universities. These are among the best
    places to find conversation, since people there are usually
    open to meeting new people, are likely to have at least some
    skill in English, and are not always students. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Internet Relay Chat (IRC) </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The IRC allows you to chat (via typing) in real-time with
    people from all over the world among thousands of channels.
    These range from the infamous &quot;hottub&quot; channel
    (where everyone pretends to be in the same hot tub) to
    country-chat channels for every country from Afghanistan to
    Ireland to Zambia. If you mention on one of these channels
    you are planning to visit, you may be hit with a wealth of
    advice and recommendations. Some travelers have even scored
    invitations through chats on the IRC. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I understood its power while chatting one sunny Texas
    afternoon with a fellow in Sweden. He ended our conversation
    with, &quot;Well, I have to say goodbye now, my wife wants me
    to shovel some snow!&quot; </p>

<h4 align="center">Decision Making</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/OLYMPF~1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/olympfoot.JPG" alt="Watch your step."
    align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="200"
    height="255">Common examples of poor decision-making are: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting out unprepared </li>
            <li>Setting out without the right or any equipment </li>
            <li>Not knowing what the hell you are doing </li>
            <li>Biting off more than you can chew </li>
            <li>Not beginning the return hike early enough </li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Often the one in trouble has made a series of bad
    decisions to get him where he is. Thus it becomes crucial
    that this streak is stopped, and some right decisions made.
    This could be the difference between life and death. </p>
    <p>Sit for five minutes and consider the best course of
    action. Don't act rashly or hastily, especially if that's
    what you've been doing. If, due to the late-return-hike
    scenario, your foot has just given way to a shadow causing
    your head to forcefully collide with a rock, don't
    immediately stagger to your feet, wipe away the blood, and
    carry on as if nothing has happened. You may not get a second
    chance.</p>
    <p>The earlier you recognize you are in trouble, or heading
    into trouble, the better. Self-deception and denial of
    reality are two of the biggest troublemakers.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Instincts </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The mind has a way of processing information unperceived
    by the conscious self, and it often comes up with ideas you
    may interpret as intuition or a hunch, or see through a dream
    or an omen. Sometimes these ideas come all at once, sometimes
    you must build them slowly. Don't ignore them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Eyes, ears, and instincts are the traveler's most
    important allies.<br>

</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Limits </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travel conditions will not always be favorable just
    because you want them to be. New Zealand park rangers tell
    stories of backpackers marching off on arduous, high-mountain
    treks with sandals on their feet and t-shirts in their packs.
    In New Zealand even summer weather can become extreme, and
    these backpackers have neither the gear nor the experience to
    cope. Several die from falls or exposure every summer. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While I was on New Zealand's South Island an American
    backpacker was heroically rescued from her sea kayak when a
    storm blew in. Her two equally inexperienced women friends
    raced into the pounding surf to pull her from the water.
    While they had been cautioned to head for shore at the first
    sign of a storm, they thought they could go on a little
    further. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I spent three days climbing and exploring Mount Olympus in
    Greece before stopping two hundred yards shy of the summit.
    The last bit seemed too difficult to safely climb with my
    shoes, skills, and somewhat shaky physical condition. My
    English travel buddy, however, zoomed to the top. While he
    was gone I saw two separate climbers nearly fall to their
    deaths, both just catching themselves at the last instant. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Upon returning the Englishman said there was a plaque on
    the summit memorializing an American backpacker who had
    fallen a few years before. When I returned to the hostel at
    the base of the mountain the owner said about one American
    gets killed up there every year, and when I left for the
    summit he had wondered if I would be the one that year. </p>

        know. Then there is the great majority of what there
        is--which is what you don't know you don't know. To
        minimize your risks while traveling the most important
        thing is to actively and creatively use whatever you've
        got to work with. </em></p>

        <p><em>By far the best place to get information is

        know, including what and where is good to see and do,
        tips on work, getting lifts, etc.</em> <strong>Pete the
