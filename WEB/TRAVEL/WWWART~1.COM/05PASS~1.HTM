<blockquote>
    <p>A passport declares you are a citizen of a country and
    gives you the right to leave that country. The earliest
    passports were letters issued by the traveler's king or
    sultan that referenced the character of the traveler, and
    asked that he be allowed passage and favorable treatment. The
    current passport system came into wide use during World War I
    when governments restricted travel due to spy paranoia.
    Before then many European nationals could come and go as they
    pleased without securing permission from any government. </p>
    <p>American passports now read: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The U.S. Government issues three types of passports:
    diplomatic, official, and regular. Diplomatic passports are
    given to the top staff of the State Department and Foreign
    Service, and confer immunity from prosecution from the laws
    of other countries. Official passports go to other government
    workers who don't qualify for diplomatic passports, but need
    extra status in lieu of higher pay. Regular passports are for
    the rest of us. </p>
    <p>Note that passports are the property of the issuing
    government, not the person on the inside cover.<br>

    latest information at 202-647-0518. To obtain a passport,
    U.S. citizens must present the following in person to a
    designated post office, a designated clerks of court, or one

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof of U.S. citizenship. This can be a previous

    <p>Normal processing takes up to four weeks. Rush services
    cost extra. Passports are valid for ten years, or until age
    eighteen. Second passports may be available if you are
    traveling to Israel and certain Arab countries which boycott
    anyone who has been in Israel. Twenty-four pages is the
    normal-sized passport, forty-eight pages if requested.
    Additional pages can be added later if necessary. </p>

    <p>Always keep your passport in a hidden money belt next to
    your skin. They are valuable on the black market, and some

    <font size="5">Visas, </font><a name="onward"><font size="5">Onward</font></a><font
    size="5"> Tickets, and Sufficient Funds</font> </h3>
    <p>A visa is a stamp or piece of paper placed in your
    passport granting permission to <i>enter</i> a certain
    country, and issued by that country. Depending on the country
    and your nationality, visas may be obtained at the border at
    time of entry, or in advance through that country's consulate
    or embassy. </p>
    <p>Since visa rules change, it is best to call the embassy or
    consulate of that country for the latest information.
    Following are some examples. Many heavily-touristed
    countries, including all Western European countries, only
    require a United States citizen to have a valid passport at
    time of entry. They want to make it easy for tourists to come
    and spend money. </p>
    <p>Canada requires Americans to have official identification
    (such as a driver's license) and sufficient funds, while
    Mexico requires only official identification for border
    towns, but issues a free visa good for thirty, sixty, or
    ninety days (your request) at the border if you are traveling
    into the interior. </p>
    <p>If an American lands in Bangkok without a visa, she is
    automatically granted a free <strong>transit visa</strong>
    valid for fifteen days, provided she also has an airline
    ticket out of the country. If she gets a visa from a Thai
    embassy or consulate in advance of landing in Bangkok, she
    can get permission for thirty, sixty, or ninety days of stay
    from the <strong>date of entry</strong>, and the <strong>onward
    ticket requirement</strong> is waived. This visa costs $25. </p>
    <p>United States citizens arriving at the Guatemalan <strong>frontier</strong>
    (international term for border) with a valid passport are
    granted visas good for thirty days, with a variable
    &quot;tax&quot; charged on entry and exit. This is usually
    just a few dollars. Guatemalan visas are <strong>single entry</strong>,
    which means if you leave the country you must get another
    visa to re-enter, and pay another &quot;tax.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Indian visas, on the other hand, are <strong>multiple
    entry</strong><i>--</i>you can leave and re-enter the country
    with the same visa. This is useful for making a side-trip to
    Nepal or Tibet. Call the Indian embassy in your country's
    capital to get the latest visa information. They will send a
    one-page application, which you return by registered mail,
    along with your passport and the appropriate fee ($25 for a
    six-months validity). They then return your passport with the
    visa inside. Regular processing takes about two weeks,
    although a two-day fast turnaround is possible for an extra
    $50 or so. </p>
    <p>If you need visas from several countries, you may need to
    start the process several months before departure. An
    important consideration for Indian visas is they are valid
    for six months from the<strong> date of issue</strong>, not
    from the time you eventually get to India. </p>
    <p>Visa <strong>extensions</strong> may or may not be
    possible from within a country. Since extensions usually
    require some bureaucratic shenanigans, many travelers prefer
    to leave the country and then re-enter. </p>
    <p>While New Zealand does not require Americans to obtain a
    visa in advance of landing there, they do require we have a
    return or <strong>onward ticket</strong>, and a valid visa
    for that next country, if required by that country. Since I
    was going on to Australia, I had to get an Australian visa
    while I was still in the U.S. Australia also requires a
    return or onward ticket for entry, so I bought a ticket from
    Darwin, Australia, to Kupang, Indonesia while in New Zealand.
    This is the cheapest onward ticket out of Australia at about
    $150. </p>
    <p>While Indonesia also requires an onward ticket for entry,
    many backpackers buy an inexpensive one upon landing at the
    Indonesian airport. They then cash it in later as they travel
    on by bus, train, or ferry. </p>
    <p>It is wise to look respectable when applying for a visa.
    No country is obligated to grant you entry into their
    country. Some countries require travelers have <strong>sufficient
    funds</strong> to support themselves, and may request to see
    credit cards or travelers' checks. Sometimes a couple of
    passport-sized photos are also required. </p>
    <p>Sufficient funds can be an issue at some borders. New
    Zealand wants backpackers to have about $15 (U.S.) per day of
    intended stay, while Canada wants Americans coming down from
    Alaska to have &quot;enough&quot; to make it through the
    country. I could only shake my head sadly while a fellow
    hitcher who had been on the road all over North and South
    America for two years was denied entry into Canada at the
    Alaska border because he had only $75. (Back to the slime
    line for him.) </p>
    <p>If you have a credit card--even if it's maxed--you won't
    have a problem with sufficient funds, at least at the border.
    In my experience most countries with sufficient funds
    requirements have waved me through without checking my
    financial situation. Of course I make a point to shave and
    put on my best shirt when crossing frontiers. (If you don't
    have a credit card, at least bring something plastic like an
    old Columbia House Compact Disc membership card. After all,
    if they would trust you to buy six more CD's over three
    years...) </p>
