<blockquote>
    <p>Travel clothing should offer enough flexibility and
    protection so you can comfortably go about your affairs
    without remaining at the mercy of the elements. It should
    also be as light and compact as possible since your space and
    strength are limited. Clothing should also project the image
    or style of your choice, because to a great extent clothing
    determines how you are perceived as a traveler in foreign
    lands. Like it or not, clothing is a basic form of
    communication. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Traveling lightly upon the cultural environment demands
    some consideration to clothing and appearance, since both are
    often perceived as forms of respect. Many religious buildings
    have clothing requirements such as skirts for women, pants
    for men, or removal of shoes. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In some countries it is objectionable and unsafe for women
    to wear revealing clothing--which may mean showing any skin
    other than a bit of face and hands, or by not wearing a bra.
    Some smaller societies are disturbed by visitors wearing
    copies of their clothing as they connect religious and/or
    cultural significance to their apparel. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My recommendation is to try to look at least neat while
    traveling. The world's peoples may think better of you, may
    want to talk to you more often, and may be more likely to
    offer you some kind of hospitality. Moreover, you will make
    it through customs faster and get hassled by the police less
    often. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>On the other hand one of the great things about travel
    backpacking is there is no mold we have to fit. If you can
    just be yourself you'll do great. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    alt="Good hot weather clothing." align="right" hspace="10"
    vspace="6" width="134" height="157">Sun and mosquito
    protection are the primary functions of clothing in the
    tropics, and clothing which does these jobs well will keep
    you far cooler and healthier in the long run. Long sleeves,
    collars, hats with a generous brim, and baggy pants will keep
    you cooler and fend off heat exhaustion better than tank tops
    and shorts. Knit or extremely fine materials offer little sun
    or mosquito protection as rays and proboscises easily
    penetrate. A 100% cotton, long-sleeved, loose-fitting shirt
    with buttons, collar, and a breast pocket or two works great.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Tight denim jeans are a bad idea for jungle trekking, and
    not so comfortable in any hot climate. They are hot to wear,
    slow to dry, and heavy to carry.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A straw or canvas hat with at least a three-inch brim all
    around is essential for many backpackers--especially
    hitchhikers--in sunny climes. Baseball caps don't offer much
    protection. I usually buy locally-made hats for a few
    dollars. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Cold Weather Clothing </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sleeping cold and being cold are among the big daddies of
    hardships for travelers. For winter travel you'll want a
    number of wicking/insulating, insulating, and windblocking
    layers as detailed in the <a href="#glossary">glossaries
    below. </a></p>
    <p>I highly recommend having at least a layer or two of of
    the new synthetics. They are easy to wash, can often be dried
    with body heat, and provide the most warmth for the weight
    and bulk. </p>
    <p>For winter travel in continental Europe you will want
    either a long heavy windproof coat or rain shell, insulating
    layers of pile and/or down, and quality long underwear, in
    addition to gloves, heavy socks, and headgear. As opposed to
    spring, summer, and fall travel where weight, bulk, and style
    are factors, for winter travel you will probably wear most or
    all of this clothing anytime you're on the move, if you're
    not sleeping in it, too.</p>

Travel Clothing Coordination</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Versatility is the key. Select clothing that goes
    double-duty for day and evening wear, and can be worn with
    every other item of clothing. An outfit that can only be worn
    by itself becomes very heavy in the pack. Simple styles and
    basic colors work best. Black and white are good for day and
    evening. </p>
    <p>If you wear one set, carry two in your pack, and
    everything more or less mixes or matches, you'll have enough
    clothes to begin your trip. As they wear out or your needs
    change you can easily buy more clothes exactly appropriate
    for the climate or conditions at hand. (That's kind of how
    the world works.) </p>
    <p>Don't be so delusional as to bring anything reserved for
    one special event or purpose. While that special night or
    purpose may or may not suck, carrying clothing with limited
    utility <em>will</em> suck.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I've gone to quite a few concerts in fine halls wearing
    slacks and a decent shirt. While I can't say I felt
    particularly comfortable being in the sartorial bottom one
    percent, it was no big deal, either. Many women backpackers
    include in their packs a combination which looks more than
    okay at such events, but can also be worn everyday. <br>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Wicking</strong></dt>
        <dd>Property of a fabric to transport moisture away from
            the skin to the outer side of the fabric where it can
            evaporate. Wicking is crucial when working up a sweat
            in cold weather, since you can later become chilled
            from your own sweat.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Layering</strong></dt>
        <dd>Best method of dressing warmly. Inner layer of
            clothing is a wicking fabric such as polypropylene,
            pile, or Thermax. Next layers consist of whatever
            warm clothing you have; a synthetic pile or fleece
            jacket is ideal. Down jackets and wool sweaters are
            also good. Outer layer is a shell, which blocks wind
            and rain. Layers can be removed and added as
            conditions change.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Polypropylene</strong> (polypro)</dt>
        <dd>Synthetic fiber with excellent wicking and warmth. It
            retains very little water. Walmart has them.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Polyester</strong></dt>
        <dd>Backpackers consider the new formulations of
            polyester a wonder fiber, even a life-saver. The new
            polyesters are soft and comfortable to the skin,
            retain very little water, keep you warm when wet, dry
            with your own body heat, and wick well. Brand names
            include Thermax, MTS, and Capilene.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Pile and fleece</strong></dt>
        <dd>Generic terms for a thick and fluffy polyester fiber.
            It is warmer and lighter than wool, soft and
            comfortable on skin, wicks well, absorbs very little
            water (comes out of the washer 99% dry), and is
            durable. Pile is not windproof, but some pile
            clothing incorporates a wind barrier which makes them
            much warmer.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Cotton</strong></dt>
        <dd>Best used in hot and humid climates where cotton's
            breathability and coolness are </dd>
        <dd>matchless. These same characteristics make cotton
            clothing a bad idea for backpacking in cold and rainy
            climates. Wet cotton clothing in temperatures
            well-above freezing is a leading cause of hypothermia
            and resulting death.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Wool</strong></dt>
        <dd>Heavier for equal warmth than pile, fleece, and
            polyester fabrics. Wool retains some insulating
            capability when wet. Look for a tight weave as in
            British Army-type sweaters.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Shell</strong></dt>
        <dd>An outer garment such as a rainjacket which blocks
            wind and rain. Due to this wind-blocking function
            shells provide the most warmth per weight of any
            garment.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><a name="goretex"><strong>GoreTex</strong></a></dt>
        <dd>Brand of waterproof/breathable fabric. GoreTex is a
            membrane attached underneath the outer fabric and
            protected on the inside by a nylon or mesh liner. Its
            pores are 700 times smaller than a water drop, but
            still large enough for perspiration vapor to pass
            through. Thus after several hours of wear you don't
            become damp or wet from your own perspiration. It's
            also windproof. Not a necessity (I've not yet
            afforded it), but it works. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>DWR</strong></dt>
        <dd>Durable Water Repellent. A Teflon, silicone, or other
            treatment on the outside of a fabric to provide
            moderate water protection, yet maintain
            breathability. Available in spray cans from outdoor
            shops and Walmart.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Coated nylon</strong></dt>
        <dd>Nylon fabric coated with polyurethane to make it
            waterproof, windproof, and non-breathable. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Rolling</strong></dt>
        <dd>All over the world backpackers carry their clothing
            the most compactly and with the least wrinkles by
            rolling-up each item. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Organization</strong></dt>
        <dd>Nylon bags are the traveler's drawers. While many use
            different-colored nylon ditty bags, I prefer mesh so
            I can plainly see what's inside the bag. Socks and
            underwear go in one, shirts in another, etc. For more

<h3 align="center">Backpacker Apparel </h3>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Rainjacket</strong></dt>
        <dd>I recommend a long waterproof/breathable jacket with
            a hood and several pockets. The extra length helps
            keep your lower body dry, and doesn't bunch-up under
            the hipbelt when wearing a pack. Weight will be about
            1.5 pounds, and packed-size about 4x9 inches.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>A simple coated nylon jacket, such as the Sierra
            Designs Microlite ($30, 8 oz.), works well for warm
            weather travel, and its packed-size and weight are
            unbeatable. Some water may leak in the seams in a
            heavy downpour, and perspiration vapor will condense
            on the inside, but usually this isn't a great
            problem.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Ponchos</strong></dt>
        <dd>Popular with many backpackers, although I prefer a
            regular rainjacket.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Shoes</strong></dt>
        <dd>Should be comfortable, supportive, and lightweight.
            Most American travelers will be walking far more than
            they are used to. Shoes should be roomy since with
            heavy walking your foot size noticeably increases (up
            to a full shoe size with long distance trail hikers.)
            The tread should have a good grip and be
            long-wearing. My last pair of soft rubber soles was
            only good for 200 miles before becoming dangerously
            slick.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Boots</strong></dt>
        <dd>Most backpackers don't need boots since you really
            don't even need them for trail-walking. If you plan
            on blazing your own somewhere, then yes, you may need
            a pair of boots, along with a machete and anti-venin.
            Otherwise they are too much extra weight for limited
            utility, and take too long to dry. Most true long
            distance hikers on the Pacific Crest and Appalachian
            Trails switch to to simpler leather, canvas, or light
            trail shoes within a few hundred miles.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Sandals</strong></dt>
        <dd>Birkenstocks are incredibly popular among
            backpackers. I carry a cheap and light pair of sport
            sandals. In the developing world many backpackers buy
            locally-made sandals, which are cheap but not always
            available in large sizes. Others use flip-flops.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Pants</strong></dt>
        <dd>I travel with two pairs, usually along the line of
            Levi's Dockers. Comfort over the long haul is my
            primary consideration. These pants weigh under one
            pound each, and dry quickly. Regular denim jeans take
            forever to dry and weigh about 1.5 pounds. Thus you
            easily save a pound of dead weight by choosing
            lighter pants. Nevertheless, most backpackers pack at
            least one pair of jeans.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Shirts</strong></dt>
        <dd>I begin with three or four of my favorite,
            best-looking, or luckiest shirts, which usually means
            one nice, long-sleeved, 60% cotton/40% polyester
            shirt, one nice, long-sleeved 100% cotton shirt, and
            one or two t-shirts or polo shirts. Long sleeves are
            good for sun protection, and can always be rolled up.
            Also, depending on the climate, a turtleneck made of
            Thermax.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Shorts</strong></dt>
        <dd>A pair of nylon shorts with pockets weighs about
            three ounces, doubles as swim trunks, and rolls-up to
            almost nothing. Heavy cotton shorts weigh about nine
            ounces.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Underwear</strong></dt>
        <dd>Some backpackers take one pair of boxers for
            emergencies and nightwear, and go commando the rest
            of the time. Saves weight, but requires extreme
            caution when up-zipping. In hot and humid climates
            women should have 100% light cotton underwear, as
            these are cooler than nylon and may help prevent
            gingrich.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Layering pieces</strong></dt>
        <dd>A mid-weight, high-tech polyester top will give you
            the most warmth and comfort for the weight, space,
            and money. <img src="IMAGES/DOWNVEST.GIF" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/downvest.gif"
            alt="Down vest" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5"
            width="160" height="193">A midweight, zippered
            turtleneck has served me well. For traveling in
            winter or at altitude you will want heavy-weight top
            and bottom underwear, a pile or down jacket, and a
            long shell.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Down jacket or vest</strong></dt>
        <dd>Traditional layering piece. While it loses nearly
            100% of its loft and warmth if it becomes soaked,
            many backpackers use down jackets because they are
            lighter and compact 50% smaller than comparable pile
            jackets. The down vest at right supercompacts to the
            size of two of my fists and also makes a supergreat
            pillow.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Headgear for cold protection</strong></dt>
        <dd>Most flexibility and warmth for the weight comes from
            a polypropylene baclava (1 oz, $7) It can also be
            worn as a cap or scarf. If it's really cold you will
            also need a pile, acrylic, or wool cap.</dd>

        <dd>Are crucial travel equipment. I recommend the Thorlo
            or equivalent brand of hiking, walking, and sports
            socks. These have thick padding at the heel, ball,
            and toe areas, and are made of acrylic, which wicks
            moisture away from your feet and dries quickly.

        <dd>Some backpackers swear by these for preventing

            your regular socks. They are made of polypropylene or
            silk to wick moisture away from your foot, and to
            provide a smooth, sliding surface to prevent
            blisters. </dd>

<h2 align="center">Travel Laundry </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travelers do much of their laundry by hand. Frequent
    clothes washing is universally seen as more efficient than
    carrying twenty pairs of socks, twenty pairs of underwear,
    and eleven shirts, as did one Kierkegaard-toting,
    poor-bargaining backpacker friend (who prefers to remain
    anonymous). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hotel, hostel, and campground handwashing is easy. Hostels
    and campgrounds will usually have several washing boards
    where you mix soap, water, clothes, and labor. In Europe and
    the rest of the developed world most hostels also have
    machines, as will most campgrounds. </p>
    <p>Note that the &quot;90&quot; setting on international
    laundry machines represents 90 degrees Centigrade, which is
    almost boiling. Not realizing this I shrunk my best down
    jacket half-a-size and turned my clothes several shades of
    gray. (Got 'em really clean, though.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You can start your trip with a small plastic zip bag of
    powdered laundry detergent and buy additional powder as you
    go. A small handbrush or nylon potscrubber gets your clothes
    much cleaner. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the developing world you might ask at your hotel if
    anyone washes clothes. Probably one of the maids will do an
    outstanding job--including getting out stains you thought
    were permanent--for a fair price. Benefit from my experience
    by determining in advance exactly when you'll get your
    clothes back, though. <br>

<h3 align="center">Handwashing Socks and Other Tricks </h3>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Put your hands inside the socks and scrub. Brilliant,
            huh? <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>A good way to hang clothes without clothespins is to
            double-up your cord and twist it together a few
            times. You then tuck your clothes between the two
            cords. <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>If you are going to be washing clothes in sinks (you
            will), bring along a flat rubber drain stopper which
            fits over drain holes. It weighs only an ounce, takes
            up hardly any space, and you will need your own as
            there is an amazing worldwide shortage of drain
            plugs. Buy one at your supermarket for $1.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Travelers' Tips </h3>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Bring at least one good pair of pants, one dress
        shirt, and a polishable pair of walking/disco shoes like
        Rocksports or Dexters. You may badly want them to get
        where dancing women are. You may also want them to take
        advantage of the swimming pools and other accouterments
        of better hotels.</em> <strong>Turbo Maserati, USA </strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>(Don't forget your cohones.) <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </em></p>
