<h3 align="center"><font size="4">Hostels </font></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hostels are the <font size="3">traditional</font>
    backpacker accommodation, providing cheap beds in a communal
    atmosphere. Most have rooms with four to ten bunks each,
    kitchen facilities for individual use, showers, a common room
    with television, and clothes washing machines. Some have
    swimming pools, gardens, camping areas, pool tables, and
    other amenities. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hostels which belong to Hostelling International (HI)
    (formerly International Youth Hostel Federation (IYHF))
    usually enforce certain rules and standards. These include a
    midnight curfew and a mid-morning until late-afternoon
    lockout when all guests are required to leave the premises,
    although you can leave your stuff there. Non-HI hostels
    generally do not have a lockout period, and curfews are
    non-existent or flexible. Most hostels segregate guests by
    sex, but not all of them all the time. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Membership cards are available at HI hostels. HI hostels
    usually do not require membership, but charge an extra $3 per
    night for nonmembers, which goes toward your eventual
    membership. (Each time you pay $3 you get a stamp in your
    membership card until it's paid off.) Many hostels are not
    affiliated with HI and do not require membership. If you join
    in the U.S. membership costs are $15 per year for those under
    eighteen and over fifty-four, $25 for others. It is slightly
    cheaper to join in some other countries. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some hostels are in truly magnificent settings--I have
    stayed in a few castles transformed into impressive and fun
    backpacker quarters, and were practically the highlight of my
    trip. In Prague you can even stay in Vaclav Havel's old cell
    in the former political prison. Of course some hostels are
    better than others, but travelers will regularly recommend
    ones they have enjoyed. Almost all hostels are good places to
    meet other travelers. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>While some--especially European--hostels are extremely
    crowded and hectic during the height of the summer tourist
    season, they can be delightful and casual the rest of the
    year. You may get a room to yourself, and it will be easier
    to meet and get to know fellow travelers. Plus the price
    often goes down. I highly recommend off-season hosteling in
    Europe, although it's great fun any time of the year. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hostels are open to people of any age. Only in Bavaria
    during the summer are hostels limited to persons under
    twenty-six. Otherwise plenty of older folks go the hostel
    route. Some people tire of hostels because of the almost
    hyper-social atmosphere, but I generally enjoy meeting people
    when traveling. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some Scandinavian hostels cost over $20 per night/per
    person, but most European, U.S., and other western hostels
    average around $7-$15 per night. Eastern European and
    developing-country hostels--where available--are less. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many HI hostels require the use of a sleepsheet, which you
    can rent, buy, or make by sewing up one regular sheet into a
    kind of sleeping bag. This may be to protect you from some
    hostel bedding, which apparently only gets washed every five
    years or so, or possibly only in the initial euphoria when
    new owners take over. &quot;Yah, Gert, when I buy that hostel
    the first thing I'm gonna do is wash all the blankets!&quot; </p>
    <p>The first link below takes you to the HI homepage, from
    which you can get to sixty country federations of HI and a
    book listing 4500 HI hostels. You can also learn about their
    IBN hostel reservation system.for up to six months in
    advance. (You front the money.)</p>
    <p>My estimate is that HI has about thirty percent of the
    worldwide hostel market. Other hostels are often termed
    &quot;unofficial&quot; or &quot;independent,&quot; but in
    fact usually belong to a national or regional network of
    hostels or backpacker hotels. The network may be beyond loose
    or all-powerful, but it simply makes economic sense to belong
    to something. </p>

<h3 align="center">Backpacker Hotels </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Backpacker hotels are such a force in Australia and New
    Zealand that they are simply referred to as
    &quot;backpackers'.&quot; There are about thirty in Sydney, a
    dozen in Auckland, and every other city and town of any size
    has at least one or two. </p>
    <p>While similar to hostels, they usually have fewer
    unnecessary rules such as lockouts and curfews. Some guests
    really enjoy the atmosphere and stay for months while
    working, or looking for work. Some are large, older houses,
    while others are former regular hotels that have been adapted
    to meet the new backpacker market.</p>
    <p>Standards of cleanliness vary, of course, but usually a
    backpacker or two is employed to mop the floors and clean the
    kitchen and bathrooms. Prices for these ubiquitous hotels in
    Australia and New Zealand range from $8-$15 per night. </p>

Bed-and-Breakfast Hotels, Pensions, <br>
And Private Homes in Europe </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Traditional bed-and-breakfast accommodation is common in
    Britain and Ireland. In Scarborough, England I remember
    walking down several streets where almost every house had a
    little sign out front saying &quot;vacancy&quot; or &quot;no
    vacancy.&quot; Bed-and-breakfast hotels are often clustered
    together like this, so it can be relatively easy to find an
    available room. <i>Pensions</i> are the rough equivalent to
    bed-and-breakfast hotels on the European continent. </p>
    <p>Small hotels such as these have two to ten rooms to let,
    with usually shared bath facilities. Breakfast is provided in
    the morning, which is something of a social event as the
    guests chat with each other. Many English patrons go to the
    same bed and breakfast at the same time every year, so it can
    be something of a family atmosphere. English and Irish bed
    and breakfasts range in price from a low of about $12 per
    person up to $30 or more. </p>
    <p>Accommodation in private homes is also common in Eastern
    Europe and developing countries, where enterprising families
    trying to make ends meet take in guests on an informal basis.
    You may be met at train stations by groups of older women
    holding signs saying &quot;room&quot; or &quot;zimmer&quot;
    (German for &quot;room&quot;). </p>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/COMBLOCK.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/comblock.jpg" align="right" hspace="16"
    width="150" height="262">Sometimes their initial offer will
    be high, but the price comes down if you don't act too
    interested. Do agree on the price beforehand, though, and
    find out where the room is before you agree. In Warsaw I went
    walking forever with an older lady. &quot;Only a little
    further,&quot; she kept saying with her fingers. Then we got
    on a bus and rode out to the suburbs, finally arriving at a
    huge communist-concrete tenement. (Actually I had a great
    time as I stayed for several nights and met a few neighbors
    as they came over to meet &quot;the American.&quot;)</p>
    <p>Many popular backpacker destinations are likely to have
    this kind of accommodation. Finding it, however, may be a
    problem, since it may be a slightly illegal operation.
    Inquire at the tourist office, but you may need to ask at
    restaurants, markets, small grocery stores, or even a
    postman. Sometimes &quot;room,&quot; &quot;zimmer,&quot; or
    in Italy, &quot;affitti camere&quot; will be displayed on a
    gate or window. </p>
    <p>These entrepreneurs infinitely prefer someone who stays a
    few days or longer, so you should be able to work out a
    price-break for longer-term accommodation.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Hotels in Developing Countries</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Accommodation is quite affordable in the developing world.
    While the big tourist or business hotels--even in Bombay,
    Nairobi, or Quito--will charge $100 or more per night, the
    midline and bottom-end hotels which serve the local middle
    classes will have affordable prices. They are often
    conveniently clustered within walking distance of rail and
    bus stations. You can expect to pay from $3-$20 per night. </p>

    have set up &quot;guest houses&quot; for the budget tourist
    trade. These are not really houses, but small, Spartan rooms
    that sell for $5-$10 per night. In Morocco most Moroccans and
    backpackers stay in &quot;unclassified&quot; hotels in the
    medina. These cost from $3-$7 per night, and range from dirty
    and dangerous to not bad at all. In Egypt backpackers stay in
    pensions and &quot;student hotels,&quot; which have sprung-up
    specifically for backpackers. </p>
    <p>Hotels in India are classified according to the style of
    their toilet facilities: Western and Indian. With Western you
    get a place to sit; with Indian a place to squat. One very
    civilized feature of some Western and many Indian hotels is
    that check-out is twenty-four hours after check-in--not
    merely the next morning. You can also usually buy half-a-day
    of stay. These hotels range in price from $2 to $20. </p>

    </center></div><p>Some of the best-value backpacker
    accommodation is in Bali, where family-run hotels called
    &quot;losmen&quot; dot the island. They have no more than a
    dozen rooms, and feature the indoor/outdoor Bali style of
    living. Breakfast is included with the $4-$10 per night
    price.</p>
    <p>Most other popular developing-world countries also have
    hotels that cater to a largely backpacker clientele. Again,
    these are usually small, family-run operations which
    traditionally have provided an inexpensive roof for local
    travelers, and are now encouraging the backpacker trade with
    low-priced private rooms. Sometimes if you get there late and
    the place is full-up, the owner will throw down a mattress in
    a back hall or common room. </p>
    <p>Rooms vary greatly, of course, but usually are basic, with
    a bed, nightstand, closet, concrete floor, window, and a fan
    of some kind. The least I ever paid for such a room was $1,
    and it had all the above, except the window. (No, there were
    no iron bars and I could leave whenever I wanted.) </p>
    <p>The main point is that low-priced accommodation is
    available almost everywhere--especially anywhere the
    first-time backpacker is likely to go--and is relatively easy
    to find once you get there.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Reservations </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>I rarely make reservations while backpacking. For travel
    in Europe during July and August, however, it's a good idea
    to make reservations. For summer Eurrailing, I would call
    from one city to the next to find a room or hostel space.
    Many developed-world hostels do this for free or a small
    charge. But it all depends on what you want and your style of
    travel. I would almost choose to sleep in the rain over
    fronting my money all over Europe.</p>
    <p>For the rest of the year the tourist office--which is
    almost always located in or near the train station in
    European cities of any size--should be able to find you a
    room when you arrive. Otherwise you can find something by
    phoning around the morning of your arrival. </p>
    <p>Throughout the developing world I never make reservations,
    and neither do most backpackers there. Phoning is often
    expensive and difficult, you don't really know when you are
    going to arrive, and in most backpacker-type hotels you
    probably want to look over the place before committing
    yourself, anyway. </p>
    <p>Even if you make a reservation the room may be gone when
    you get there, and you may pass something better on the way.
    While I have been turned away from quite a few full hotels
    and hostels, usually the clerk recommends a place nearby that
    may have space. Something always works out, even if once in a
    great while it's the hard floor of a train station. </p>
    <p>Once you start traveling you will probably enjoy the
    freedom and flexibility of planning your trip as you go. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Room Bargaining </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In developing countries you can often pay less for a room
    with very little effort. After being quoted a price you can
    say something like, &quot;Do you have another room for
    less?&quot; Or while shaking your head sadly, try &quot;I'm
    sorry, but I can't pay $8 for a room without a fan/toilet
    seat/hot water/etc.&quot; Just give the clerk an excuse to
    give you a lower price, and you may get it. Of course this
    only works when they expect to have empty rooms that night. </p>
    <p>Some experienced travelers get peeved at neophytes for <i>not
    bargaining </i>since this makes it more difficult for them to
    get rates closer to what locals pay. One impecunious Dutchman
    shamed me for agreeing to a too-high price. That was $7 for a
    good double, which was down a buck and a half from the first
    quote.</p>
    <p>Sometimes when you ask to see a hotel room you will be
    shown the worst one first, as they know many travelers will
    take just about anything. Ask to see another--often you can
    get a better view, bed, or fan, and once in a while an
    altogether superior room, for the same money. In the seedy
    hotels I sometimes find myself, I usually ask to see at least
    one other room, and then make a decision. </p>
    <p>In some countries you cannot make the assumption that
    something works just because it's there. Check the lock on
    the door, and give the toilet a test flush.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

<h3 align="center">Camping in Europe </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>For every hostel in Europe there are four or five legal
    places to erect a tent, ranging from delightful municipal
    campgrounds in city parks, to gigantic caravan (RV) parks.
    Many small towns and villages, and nearly all medium-sized
    and larger towns, have a campground, usually within the city
    limits. </p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0" width="85%">
        <tr>
            <td valign="bottom" width="38%"><font size="2"><em>Photo:

            gets livelier in the evenings as campers return from

            features free Heineken.)</em></font></td>

    </table>
    </center></div><p>Norway, Sweden, and Finland have an
    &quot;Everyman's Right&quot; law. This means campers are
    allowed one or two nights on private lands outside city
    limits as long as they stay out of sight and leave without a
    trace. Ireland, with its long tradition of tinkers (traveling
    menders), has many accommodating farmers if you ask
    permission. Many hostels have a lawn area where they allow
    campers to set up at half-price, but with full use of all
    facilities.</p>
    <p>While some campgrounds may be extremely crowded in the
    summer tourist season, if you arrive at the reception on foot
    with a pack on your back, and perhaps a tired look in your
    eye, you probably won't be turned away, even if the sign says
    &quot;full&quot; in five languages. Most campgrounds only
    turn away campers with vehicles. This is a major
    consideration if you have ever raced around all afternoon to
    win the right to pay a lot of money for a bit of hotel space.
    </p>
    <p>Another point is cost-- campgrounds run about half your
    cheapest hostel. The most expensive campground I encountered
    was in costly Oslo; it was sited relatively close-in on a
    mountain with a fabulous view of downtown ($14 in 1994). You
    will generally pay between $3 and $8 per night, per person. </p>
    <p>Many European campgrounds are open from early May to the
    end of September, others an extra month or two on each end,
    and some all year. Some city-sponsored campgrounds are only
    open in July and August. More campgrounds are open year-round
    in Spain than elsewhere. </p>
    <p>France is a camper's paradise, with private campgrounds
    practically everywhere, and municipal campgrounds often
    located in central park areas. In Greece summertime weather
    is so comfortable and predictable it's easy to throw down
    your sleeping bag on a beach and get a great snooze. Also
    many Mediterranean hostels and backpacker hotels will let you
    have sleeping bag space on their roofs for $5 or less. </p>
    <p>Camping in Europe is by no means &quot;roughing it.&quot;
    To my way of thinking it's &quot;the cheap and easy
    way.&quot; For many couples camping is an ideal way to
    travel. Indeed European campgrounds are filled with
    frolicking young lovers. Many European campgrounds have some
    combination of store, cafe, swimming area, playground,
    kitchen, laundry facilities, and hot showers. Some even have
    a bar and disco. <br>

<h4 align="center">Drawbacks of Camping </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>A tent adds significant weight and bulk to your pack, so
    you don't want to be hauling one around without good reason.
    Hence the vast majority of backpackers don't carry a tent. </p>
    <p>On the other hand I carried a tent on four tours: twice in
    Europe where it saved money and hassle in finding
    accommodation; once in Central America where I used it mostly
    for mosquito protection under palapas in national parks and
    archaeological sites; and in New Zealand and Australia where
    its best use was a few weeks camped on the grounds of my
    all-time favorite hostel. (An English manor-style house with
    a great front porch where every day I sat drinking tea or
    beer, making conversation, and watching international co-ed
    volleyball on the front lawn.) </p>
    <p>Some campgrounds in major cities are far from the center,
    which adds to costs in money and time. On the other hand some
    major city camping areas are amazingly central. And in small
    and medium-sized towns it's usually easy to get to the
    campground. There will always be a bus stop nearby.</p>
    <p>If it rains you don't have to spend a lot of time inside a
    cramped tent. Nearly all campgrounds have a covered area to
    hang out, if not a cafe. Rain will only get you down if you
    let it dictate your activities. I pack a mini-umbrella and a
    long rainjacket, and go about my business of travel.<br>
    <br>

<h4 align="center">Camping Safety </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>European campgrounds are amazingly safe for your
    unattended gear. I routinely left my sleeping bag and pack in
    the tent during the day, often not returning until late at
    night. Many campers do the same, and most consider
    campgrounds safer than hostels. Of course this is not a
    guarantee, so if you don't want to take any chances you can
    check your stuff at the reception, but then you must return
    by closing to retrieve it. </p>
    <p>In my experience of about fifty campgrounds I've found
    them totally safe, except for one instance. Late one night in
    a Prague campground I was awakened by a figure crouching at
    the entrance of my tent. My zipper had broken, and the door
    was open. Surprised, I yelled as loudly and deeply as I
    could, &quot;HEY! HEY! HEY!&quot; and the intruder ran off. A
    few of us campers popped our heads outside, but no one saw
    anything. At the time I thought someone had stumbled into
    camp drunk, and had simply gone to the wrong tent. I felt
    badly about yelling so meanly, but was too tired to think
    about it much. </p>
    <p>The next morning three tents were found to have slashes
    running nearly their entire lengths, a few inches above the
    ground. Two money belts were gone--the third tent was lucky.
    At the rear of the campground we found a hole in the fence
    and a well-beaten path running to it. We then learned the
    campground was having regular trouble from thieves at a
    nearby apartment complex. For the next night a guard was
    hired. </p>
    <p>Most campers agree that if there is going to be thievery
    at European campgrounds, it will be from outsiders as in the
    above instance. The experience and camaraderie of camping
    seem to make people honest--or perhaps everyone realizes we
    are all in the same boat. Nevertheless, I now secure my tent
    zipper with a very small lock, if only to deter mischievous
    children. </p>
    <p>Never leave unattended gear in your tent in developing
    countries. The temptation for desperately poor people is too
    great. In these countries it's probably not safe to camp
    anywhere but established campgrounds, which usually have
    guards on duty. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Lions, Tigers, and Bears </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In North American grizzly country never eat in your tent,
    store food in it, or wear clothes to bed in which you have
    eaten. The smell of tunafish may overpower your unappetizing
    human smell. Food should be stored in a bag hanging from a
    tree limb at least fifteen feet off the ground. You get it up
    there by throwing a weighted cord over a limb, and then
    hoisting it up. </p>
    <p>Park rangers in Africa may tell you as long as you zip up
    the doors and windows of your tent, you won't be attacked by
    lions. While it is true they usually won't attack a zipped-up
    tent, this is not always so. One Welsh wildlife photographer
    who spends several months per year in East Africa says that
    park rangers there minimize or ignore the danger, even right
    after a lion attack. (After all, what's the big deal, really,
    if a few tourists are eaten now and then. Local folks have to
    put up with it all the time.) </p>
    <p>Suffice to say in lion and tiger country stay in
    established camps, and select a site toward the center as
    opposed to off on your own near the watering hole. Note that
    North American black bears and mountain lions, and Central
    American jaguars are extremely shy and pose no real threat to
    campers. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Wild Camping </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Wild camping is camping away from any campground, and
    probably where some regulation says you shouldn't, but
    because you are tired, stranded, or broke, you do anyway. </p>
    <p>When I wild camp, I prefer not to set up a tent. I feel
    safer and more comfortable sleeping in the open, it's less
    bother, and I can hit the road faster in the morning. If you
    do set up a tent when wild camping, wait until dark, or just
    before. Try not to let anyone see you making camp. Keep the
    lowest possible profile. If no one knows you are camped
    somewhere, no one is likely to come calling.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Camping in the Rest of the World </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Besides Europe, camping is also popular with backpackers
    in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Morocco, Israel, Egypt,
    Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia), much of Latin
    America, the U.S. (especially Alaska and Hawaii), and Canada,
    among other places. </p>
    <p>Tents are less used by travelers in the developing world
    as accommodation there is plentiful and cheap. Even while
    trekking in Nepal you can easily find inexpensive hotel-type
    accommodation every night. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Palapas, Hammocks, and Mosquito Netting </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hammocks are useful sleeping mechanisms from central
    Mexico through Central and South America as they provide the
    coolest method of sleeping in very hot and humid conditions.
    Many locals have hammocks permanently hanging inside their
    homes. Furthermore, there are many covered areas to hang
    hammocks-- called <i>palapas</i> or <i>chozas</i>--that
    charge a fraction of a fleabag hotel. (The Fleabag Hotel also
    may have hooks in the walls for hammocks.) </p>
    <p>Palapas usually have no walls and thatched roofs, and are
    the cheapest and coolest backpacker accommodation. Sometimes
    they double as restaurants or community centers. Hammocks are
    also essential for riverboat travel on the Amazon, where
    backpackers and locals hang them on deck for journeys that
    may take up to five days. </p>

        </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div><p>&nbsp;You can always buy hammocks in
    hammock country for $10-$30, and sometimes rent them. If you
    get a large one that is at least nine feet wide you can sleep
    crossways on it, thus less banana-like and more comfortably.
    If you attach both ends of a hammock to a single overhead
    hook, you can also sleep sling-like in it, which some people
    find more comfortable. A hammock with a tight weave is more
    comfortable, although heavier and bulkier than a loose weave.
    </p>
    <p>In the U.S. you can buy for $7 a small &quot;backpacker's
    hammock&quot; which weighs eight ounces and rolls-up
    softball-size. Although not as comfortable as a full-sized
    hammock--or as safe in terms of &quot;roll-out&quot;--it
    packs much smaller. L.L. Bean sells a camping hammock, 4
    lbs., $150, which protects from rain and insects while you
    swing from the trees. I don't know how well it works because
    every swinging backpacker I've met has used a regular hammock
    and mosquito netting.</p>

<h3 align="center">Where and How to Crash for Free </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every backpacker traveler spends at least a night or two
    sleeping free, usually in a train station or airport. Others
    take advantage of every free opportunity. Of course sleeping
    free is not as safe as a locked hotel room or hostel, and the
    following are not recommendations, just the facts. Women must
    be extra smart in the present world. <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Overnight Trains and Buses</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The #1 sorta free place to stay is onboard overnight
    trains or buses. Some Eurrailers chug off every evening for
    another city six or eight hours distant. (&quot;Yeah, I was
    in Paris Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and Milan
    on...&quot;)</p>
    <p>Advantages are obvious. You save on a room, you get to
    your destination early enough to have a big day, find
    accommodation, or locate a shady park for extra snooze time.
    You may meet other backpackers doing the same thing, and team
    up with them for accommodation the next night.</p>
    <p>For bus overnights, avoid headlight glare by choosing the
    side away from oncoming traffic. The front of the bus is the
    most frightening, the middle of the bus has the smoothest
    ride, and the back of the bus is usually the roughest,
    noisiest, and smelliest, although the very last row sometimes
    affords a luxurious multi-seat stretch-out. </p>
    <p>For both trains and buses place your pack under your feet
    or otherwise secure it, and bring ear plugs and your
    low-profile beverage of choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Stations </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Train stations are the #2 free place to stay. In many
    larger European train stations (but not all) there is a
    nightly ritual of travelers bedding down for a few hours.
    Just see where others are crashing, select a safe-looking
    bunch, and crash-out beside them. Ask if they mind, to start
    a conversation. They won't. Everyone sees safety in numbers,
    and with luck you won't be too dangerous-looking. </p>
    <p>First, though, you may want to check your pack in luggage
    storage or a locker, just taking out your sleeping bag, mesh
    clothes bag for a pillow, and pad, if you have one. If you
    can't or don't want to check your pack, you may want to tie
    it to something next to you, and/or to yourself. Otherwise
    use it as a pillow, or at least keep it between you and a
    wall. You don't want it to look like an easy mark. </p>
    <p>Then relax and have a good sleep. I usually pop in foam
    ear plugs. I've always been able to get at least a few hours
    of sleep, but once I slept for ten hours straight! (Travel is
    tiring, you know.)</p>
    <p>Station policies differ regarding freeloaders. Sometimes
    the police come around asking to see onward tickets.
    Sometimes you can buy one and cash it in later. Sometimes
    they ask to see passports. Sometimes they ask you to take a
    seat. Sometimes they come around early in the morning and
    tell everyone to get up and move on. Sometimes they ask you
    to move on, and then <i>they</i> move on. </p>
    <p>Always nod your head and agree, and act as respectful as
    possible. They are just doing their jobs. Whatever the
    station policy, you can rest assured that it is no big deal,
    that it is handled in an orderly and civil manner as long as
    you don't cause trouble, and that they don't have any
    interest in you other than not seeing you.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Beaches </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Crashing on the beach is fairly common among some
    backpackers in Mexico, Greece, the west coast of Turkey,
    Thailand, and the state of Goa in India, among other places.
    Guidebooks such as Let's Go and Lonely Planet even list areas
    where beach crashing is usual, or where it is dangerous. </p>
    <p>The general rules are you shouldn't sleep on the beach
    alone, and that you should ask permission from someone first.
    I've broken the first rule a few times without incident,
    except for being awakened by giggling children at six o'clock
    in the morning. The second rule I've broken most of the time,
    unless you count asking fellow backpackers. (&quot;Yah Yah,
    of course,&quot; or, &quot;Sure, dude, join the party!&quot;)
    As always, you must be careful in a dangerous world.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Public City Parks </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>While I have spent a few nights in public city parks in
    Europe, this is not a smart move, and I <i>strongly</i> do
    not recommend it. Many rip-offs occur in parks, as gangs of
    several thieves sneak up on backpackers and swipe their
    packs, or even rob them at knife point. I've heard about this
    many times. Even several travelers together are not safe, as
    thieves who prey on backpackers are probably drunk and
    looking for a fight. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Unfinished Buildings </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>If it's late and I've just been let off on the edge of
    town, and there across the street is an unfinished building,
    and no one is looking, Voilà! I just found a place to crash.
    <i>This is not safe</i>, and it's the last place I'd want to
    be in an earthquake, but it may be convenient for a few hours
    shuteye. </p>
    <p>If you are so foolish, unlucky, or fortunate to find
    yourself in an unfinished building for a night, do keep out
    of sight, and beware watchdogs. Since you may be considered a
    trespasser, get up extra early if it looks like work may
    resume in the morning. For some reason Greece has an
    astounding number of unfinished houses and buildings where no
    work at all ever seems to be going on. </p>
    <p>Again, I'm not advocating this or any other free
    accommodation. I'm just letting you know alternatives should
    you get stuck, for whatever reason.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Squatting </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>While there is much ongoing squatting in the major cities
    of Europe (pardon the pun), the trick is to find where--you
    may find interesting accommodation for a few weeks or months.
    Better, of course, to do this with a friend, and not to be
    carrying expensive gear. In some European countries squatters
    have certain rights regarding their housing. I doubt foreign
    backpackers have many. </p>
    <p>That friend who toured Europe for ten months on $4000
    squatted in Berlin for three of those months. When he got
    there he asked around in a student cafe, and was directed to
    a known area with many squats. He ended up moving in with
    three female French photographers and having a heck of a good
    time. </p>

Travelers' Tips </h3>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Look for a good lobby in inexpensive hotels. It's
