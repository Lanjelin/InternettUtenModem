<blockquote>
    <p>Two hundred years ago it cost from seven years to a
    lifetime of servitude for average people to make a one-way
    crossing of the Atlantic. Now you can do it for a week of
    waiting tables. Nevertheless, the less you spend on your
    flight, the more you have for actual travel, and air fare is
    still the single greatest expense for most budget travelers. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Finding a great deal may or may not require more effort
    than booking a full-fare economy flight with your
    neighborhood travel agent, but it usually takes knowledge and
    phone work. Note that not every travel agent--even at the
    budget specialists listed below--will be equally competent or
    motivated to find the cheapest or best fare for you. They do
    not all have access to the same information. They may simply
    not know about a great deal on a flight their co-worker in
    the next cubicle has been selling all week. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Also, if price is important to you, always specify you are
    looking for the &quot;lowest possible fare,&quot; as there
    may be specials which do not fall under the categories
    &quot;economy&quot; or &quot;APEX.&quot; <br>

            <strong>EX</strong>cursion. This is the standard
            discount ticket available from airlines and most
            regular travel agents. Depending on the airline,
            these tickets require a seven to thirty day advance
            purchase, a minimum stay of usually seven days, and a
            maximum stay of thirty or sixty days, sometimes
            longer. Round trip is required, and fees are usually
            charged for date changes or cancellation. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Open Jaw</strong></dt>
        <dd>A ticket which allows you to fly into one city, but
            return from another. For example, you might fly into
            London, travel Europe by train, and then return to
            the U.S. from Athens. Open-jaw tickets usually cost
            more than a regular return ticket from one city, but
            convenience may make up for that. Not every travel
            agent or airline sells open-jaw tickets for a
            reasonable price, but some budget agencies specialize
            in them. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Open Return</strong></dt>
        <dd>A round-trip ticket which allows you to make the
            return flight at any time--providing there is
            space--during the period the ticket is valid.</dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>One-Year Ticket</strong></dt>
        <dd>This Cadillac of tickets is generally a full-fare
            that allows you to make changes and cancellations
            without penalty for up to one-year. It should also be
            fully-refundable. While you usually cannot get a
            discounted one-year ticket directly from the airline
            or most mom-and-pop travel agents, they are sometimes
            available from bucket shops.</dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>One-Way Ticket</strong></dt>
        <dd>Usually costs more than half of a round-trip.
            Nevertheless this is often my preferred ticket since
            I like the free feeling of not being committed to a
            particular time and place, and because my travel is
            usually limited by money, not time. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Confirmations</strong></dt>
        <dd>For international flights, but <em>especially</em>
            those originating outside the United States, call the
            airline to confirm your reservation 72 hours before
            the flight <em>regardless</em> of what your ticket
            says. Otherwise your seat may be given to someone's
            cousin on the waiting list.</dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Bucket Shops</strong></dt>
        <dd>Experience tells the airlines that a certain number
            of seats are going to be empty on certain flights, so
            they discount that space--sometimes heavily--to
            travel agencies variously known as bucket shops,
            consolidators, and discounters. These agencies mostly
            serve individuals who are only going to fly cheaply
            or not at all. This maximizes the airlines' revenue
            by forcing customers of regular travel agencies to
            pay non-discounted prices. Note that some regular
            travel agents may be able to get discounted tickets
            from wholesalers. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Wholesalers</strong></dt>
        <dd>A middle-man who handles discounted tickets between
            the airlines and bucket shops. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Newspapers</strong></dt>
        <dd>The best way to find discounted tickets is to check
            the Sunday travel sections of major newspapers, such
            as <em>The New York Times, San Francisco Examiner,
            Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, Houston
            Chronicle,</em> and <em>Miami Herald</em>. (The
            latter three are especially good for finding flights
            to Latin America.) <em>USA Today, The L.A. Weekly</em>,
            and <em>The Village Voice</em> also have
            advertisements by bucket shops. Your library should
            have some of these newspapers. <em>The New York Times</em>
            has ads for dozens of agencies, some listing one-way
            and round trip fares, with others listing
            &quot;half-round-trip&quot; fares to make the prices
            seem lower. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Onward Ticket Requirement</strong></dt>
        <dd>Many countries, such as the U.S., New Zealand,
            Australia, Indonesia, and Thailand, require visitors
            to have in their possession a valid <em>airline</em>
            ticket out of the country when they enter. Bus or
            train tickets are usually not acceptable. Most
            airlines will check that you have this onward ticket
            before they let you board the airplane, as they will
            be responsible for bringing you back should you not
            be admitted. See <a href="05PASS~1.HTM#onward" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/05passports.htm#onward">Chapter
            5 Passports and Visas</a> for more information about
            onward tickets. </dd>

            some countries. </dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Stopovers</strong></dt>
        <dd>Some airlines allow you to disembark when the plane
            stops along the way to somewhere, and then continue
            your journey up to one year later. On some routes on
            some airlines there is no charge for this valuable
            privilege, while others charge 50-$100, or much more.
        </dd>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dd>If you can find an airline with free or cheap
            stopovers you can create a great ticket for not much
            money. On Air India you could stopover in Bangkok on
            your way from L.A. to Delhi, and in Hong Kong or
            Singapore on your way back. (And IcelandAir has for
            thirty years lured backpackers with a free stopover
            in Iceland on their New York to Luxembourg run.) </dd>

            (55x35x25 cm), or 2900 cubic inches (50 liters). You
            may get by with a little more. </dd>

        <dt><strong>Bicycles</strong></dt>
        <dd>Can be shipped on most airlines as long as they are

        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Routing Tags</strong></dt>

<h3 align="center">Charter Flights </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Charter companies lease an airplane for a certain date and
    route, say New York to Paris, and then try to sell the seats.
    Usually they charge a low price and do not require an advance
    purchase. However, if they do not sell enough seats to make
    money, the flight may be canceled at the last minute. Other
    airlines have no obligation to honor your ticket, and it may
    take a few days to get your money back. </p>
    <p>Reputable charter companies hold your money in escrow
    until the flight to ensure you get your money in a reasonable
    time. Some charter companies are well-established and fly
    regularly. These include Council Travel, Martin Air, Lauda,
    and Tower.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Bumping </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Airlines know a certain percentage of passengers are not
    going to show up for their flight, so they regularly slightly
    overbook the flight to make the plane as full as possible.
    Since sometimes there are more passengers at the gate than
    seats, the airlines have to deny boarding to somebody. <em>Civilized</em>
    airlines first ask for volunteers who, out of the goodness of
    their hearts, are willing to give up their current seat for
    one on the next available flight. Since no one responds, they
    up the ante by offering a voucher for a free flight, in
    addition to a seat on the next possible flight. They may also
    offer up to $500 cash. </p>
    <p>Bumping is more likely during high season, busy holidays,
    and on Fridays, Sundays, and Mondays. If you want to get
    bumped, arrive early to get your name at the top of the
    volunteer list, and don't check your bag. While I have not
    been lucky yet, I usually ask at check-in if the plane is
    going to be full, and if it is I hang near the desk just
    before flight time so I can be first to respond. I fully
    expect a stampede, at least of one.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Round-the-World and Circle-Pacific Tickets </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>These are a series of tickets on one or several airlines
    pieced together by a travel agent, offering multiple stops.
    Usually only the first leg must be booked in advance. Travel
    must be completed within one year from departure. Any route
    can be configured, but bucket shops advertise the especially
    good deals, which often utilize carriers such as Garuda
    Indonesia and Air India that allow free or cheap stopovers. </p>
    <p>Following are some low-season examples. Expect to pay
    about $200 more for travel beginning June 1 to August 31, and
    various airport and departure taxes of $7 to $20 per stop.
    Check the Sunday travel sections of the <i>New York Times,
    Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>San Francisco Examiner, London
    Times,</i> etc. for similar deals. </p>

    do not. The following organizations serve customers requiring
    cheap fares, and have access to discounted tickets. To be

    </dl>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Foreign airlines usually sell the bulk of their discounted
    tickets to bucket shops in ethnic neighborhoods which mostly
    serve their own nationality. Thus Egypt Air may sell most of
    its off-price New York-Cairo tickets to an Arab agency in
    Queens. A travel agency in Koreatown in L.A. may have good
    deals on Korea Air to Seoul. Chinatown in San Francisco has a
    dozen competitive travel agencies with specials to all over
    Asia. </p>
    <p>Sometimes these ethnic agencies only advertise in local
    ethnic-language newspapers, and they may not be able to speak
    clear English over the phone, but they are worth considering
    if you happen to be in the neighborhood.<br>
    <br>

    <h4 align="center">Foreign Bucket Shops </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you become a one-way flier like myself, you will
    probably use bucket shops in other countries. Competitive
    bucket shops are found in London, Brussels, Amsterdam,
    Athens, Istanbul, Cairo, Tel Aviv, Delhi, Bombay, Bangkok,
    Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Sydney, and many other
    cities. </p>

    alt="Typical international travel agency" align="left"
    hspace="10" width="256" height="160">Since unscrupulous
    dealers exist, you must be careful about handing over your
    money. Look for one recommended by your guidebook, a chain
    such as STA Travel, or at least an agency which looks like it
    has been around awhile. </p>
    <p>Before giving them money find out exactly what you are
    getting, such as what airline, times, and cancellation and
    date-change fees. Sometimes it takes them a day or two to
    actually get the ticket, and they may want all the money up
    front, but try to limit this to a deposit of twenty percent,
    which is fair. Get a receipt, of course.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3 align="center">Courier Flying </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Courier companies sell very cheap airfares in exchange for
    using your checked luggage allotment for business items such
    as documents and computer parts which need to get somewhere
    fast. Therefore your pack should be small enough to carry on.
    Your job is to show up at the airport on time, meet whoever
    is giving you the ticket, and get on the airplane. You do not
    usually ever handle the checked baggage. </p>
    <p>Courier flights are best if you only have a short amount
    of time, as they schedule the return flight two to thirty
    days after your arrival. Courier companies usually require
    your presence for the return flight, but sometimes you can
    get &quot;no return service required.&quot; Approximate
    sample fares, all round-trip: L.A. to Sydney, $400; L.A. to
    Hong Kong, $450; New York to Paris, $250; New York to Buenos
    Aries, $500. </p>
    <p>Only when courier companies get desperate at the last
    minute do they offer free flights. If they tell you there's a
    flight this evening Chicago to London for $75, you can say,
    &quot;Okay, but I'll only do it for free.&quot; There's a
    good chance they'll agree or come down on the price,
    especially if you've flown with them previously.</p>
    <p>The big negative about flying courier is you have a
    more-limited-than-usual control over your fate. You have to
    allow for this extra middle-man to be at the airport with
    your ticket, and thus naturally things are more likely to go
    wrong than if it's just you and the airline trying to dance.
    He may get stuck in traffic, get horribly sick on some bad
    fondue, or your shipment may be canceled at the last minute,
    and you left without a ticket to anywhere. </p>
    <p>On the other hand some travelers fly courier regularly and
    learn the ins-and-outs of the companies they work with, and
    become favored regulars.<br>
    <br>

        <dt>Some courier booking agents charge a yearly fee of
            $25-$50 to book courier flights for you. Some of the
            companies listed below have twenty-four-hour taped
            programs that detail their requirements for being a
            courier, and the flights and prices they currently
            have available. You have to be lucky and keep calling
            to get a free flight.</dt>
