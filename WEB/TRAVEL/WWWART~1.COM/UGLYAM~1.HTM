<blockquote>
    <p>Many things were on Monsieur Cabot's mind as waited at the
    crosswalk for the light to change. When the last car had
    passed he strode onto the street, in a hurry to get to the
    post office and mail some documents. Lost in thought, he
    nearly collided with a couple who had halted in the middle of
    the crosswalk, and who appeared to be looking around for
    something. They were obviously tourists. Monsieur Cabot
    worked his way around them and entered the post, where about
    a dozen people were waiting. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A few moments later Bob and Bonnie got in line behind
    Monsieur Cabot. They spoke in voices so loud that Monsieur
    and everyone else could not only hear, but could not help but
    hear, their conversation. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Bob: &quot;I'll get in this line in case it moves
    faster.&quot; </p>
    <p>Bonnie: &quot;Good idea. Are you sure you know how to get
    there. We really should be there when it opens, you
    know.&quot; </p>
    <p>Bob: &quot;No problem. It's not far.&quot; </p>
    <p>Bonnie: &quot;Like yesterday?&quot; </p>
    <p>Bob: &quot;Are you bringing that up again? We got there,
    didn't we?&quot; </p>
    <p>Bonnie stepped forward and touched the arm of Monsieur
    Cabot, who had been wishing for muzzles or a shotgun to
    silence the grotesquely noisy couple. </p>
    <p>&quot;Pardon, Monsieur. Parlez vouz anglais? We are trying
    to get to the Loo-ver by the time it opens. Can you tell me
    the fastest way to get there?&quot; </p>
    <p>Monsieur Cabot, turning to her slightly, said
    &quot;Non,&quot; and then turned away. </p>
    <p>Bonnie: &quot;He doesn't speak English.&quot; </p>
    <p>Bob: &quot;Yeah, right.&quot; </p>
    <p>Before Bonnie could answer Monsieur Cabot turned, looked
    her straight in the eye, and said in perfect English,
    &quot;You are a preposterous hippopotamus.&quot; </p>
    <p>While I made up a few of the details of this story, the
    worst of it is true: I was trying to write a postcard in the
    corner, cringing. </p>
    <p>I imagine Bob and Bonnie spent a week in Paris, and had a
    wonderful time seeing the sights and eating in restaurants.
    They may also have been much hornier than usual. But they
    were both perturbed at how reserved and rude the French were.
    They would gladly take their money, but getting them to
    answer a few simple questions was like pulling teeth. Back in
    their Dallas suburb they could ask anybody anything, and
    anybody would smile and appear genuinely happy to help. </p>
    <p>Truly the Dallas suburb and Paris are two very different
    places, and it is absurd for Bob and Bonnie to expect
    Parisians to behave like them, or even to like them. Bob and
    Bonnie do not know to modify their behavior when they visit a
    different culture. Paris is a city of several million, but
    receives about ten million foreign tourists every year, and
    has been such a mecca for centuries. Bob and Bonnie may be
    culminating a lifetime dream with their visit to the City of
    Light, but most Parisians wish they would go away, or at
    least maintain a low, &quot;European&quot; profile. </p>
    <p>Fortunately, most visitors to Paris do maintain a low
    profile, including most Americans. Unfortunately, there are
    more than a few inconsiderate bad apples who give us a
    reputation for being loud and obnoxious. </p>
    <p>In general, Americans <i>are</i> different from Europeans.
    We come from a massive country where we mostly encounter one
    basic culture from one end to the other. Europeans live on a
    continent with several dozen national languages, and many of
    them are multilingual. They are far more adapted to traveling
    in foreign lands, as there are many such foreign lands a few
    hours drive from their homes. </p>
    <p>Another factor is the huge disparity in population
    densities. Europe is five to ten times as densely populated
    as the States, with cities and towns much more compact than
    their American counterparts. Europeans are more likely to
    have to queue for services and to push their way onto a bus
    or subway. Since European land prices are high due to great
    competition, their homes and apartments are usually much
    smaller than American or Australian ones. </p>
    <p>Consequently Europeans have less personal space than
    Americans. When together Europeans stand close to one another
    and talk quietly. Most would never shout across a crowded
    post office: they walk over and say hello to their friend.
    Living in a diverse and crowded continent, they have
    developed a keen sense of respect for their neighbor's
    sensibilities. They instinctively understand it is rude to
    invade another's personal space with unnecessarily loud talk.
    That person may have his own thoughts or conversation to
    pursue. Europeans also put a high value on &quot;minding
    their own business.&quot;</p>
    <p>Most Americans stand further apart than most Europeans
    when conversing, and our voices are often loud enough to
    resound and echo off small post office walls. Although we are
    a smiling, friendly, and open people, our different sense of
    space is more responsible for the Ugly American label than
    any other characteristic. </p>
    <p>Americans, however, should not carry a chip on their
    shoulders, or try to imitate the sometimes icy European
    reserve. Many people genuinely enjoy meeting and talking to
    Americans precisely because we are more natural and less
    reserved than some other cultures. And as an American
    traveler do not lament your lack of worldliness--it is
    perfectly okay to not know everything (sometimes anything),
    and to ask questions. Just don't let yourself become one of
    those sorry travelers who separate themselves from people and
    the world with a &quot;sophistication&quot; that is actually
    arrogance.<br>
