<blockquote>
    <p>Travelers who primarily stay at campgrounds will save
    money--and eat better--by carrying their own source of
    instant fire. With this method many can experience Europe for
    $15 per day, plus transport. You can cook your eggs just the
    way you like, make soups and stews, and call up a hot drink
    at any time at virtually no cost. You can combine your
    efforts with neighbors to create a gourmet meal, or at least
    one that seems so at the time. With the money you save you
    should also be able to occasionally splurge on feasts of
    local cuisine at better restaurants. </p>

    <p>Note that some campgrounds and most hostels have cooking
    facilities available. <br>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Isobutane</strong></dt>
        <dd>Butane and twenty percent propane which is sold in
            light steel canisters. It has replaced straight
            butane since it ignites in outside air temperatures
            down to about fifteen degrees F. It is the most
            convenient and clean-burning fuel for normal
            conditions since you just strike a match and turn on
            the stove. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Isobutane is mainly sold in two incompatible formats:
            canisters manufactured by Camping Gaz-Bluet, a French
            company that dominates the gas stove market, and more
            or less industry standard canisters sold by EPI
            (British), Primus (Swedish), MSR and Coleman
            (American), and Olicamp (Chinese).</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Gaz-Bluet fuel canisters are practically everywhere
            in continental Europe, widely available in outdoor
            shops in the U.S., Canada, Britain, Australia, and
            New Zealand, and somewhat available in sixty-two
            other countries. In France, where the canisters are
            also used for lanterns and heaters, you can cheaply
            buy them in grocery stores.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Industry standard canisters are slightly more
            available than Gaz-Bluet canisters in Britain,
            Australia, and New Zealand. In my experience,
            however, most shops that carry industry standard
            canisters also have Camping-Gaz, while the reverse is
            less true.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Butane</strong></dt>
        <dd>Same characteristics as isobutane, except it won't
            ignite if the outside air temperature falls below
            freezing.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Propane</strong></dt>
        <dd>A gas that must be contained in heavy steel
            canisters, making it suitable only for car and RV
            camping.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>White Gas</strong></dt>
        <dd>Also known as Coleman fuel and Blazo. A hot and
            relatively clean-burning gasoline. Widely available
            in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, and New
            Zealand in outdoor shops and some hardware stores.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Unleaded Gas</strong></dt>
        <dd>Available wherever modern cars run. Additives in fuel
            are noxious. Stoves and pans will require frequent
            cleaning.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Leaded Gas</strong></dt>
        <dd>Produces very noxious fumes, not recommended as a
            fuel. Will clog the jets on stoves quickly.</dd>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><strong>Kerosene</strong></dt>
        <dd>Available worldwide, this is the chief heating and
            lighting fuel used in developing countries. Cheap,
            but often of such a low grade it should first be
            filtered through a cloth. More difficult to light
            than gasoline, especially in cold weather. Usually
            the stove must be &quot;primed&quot;--the burner is
            initially heated with a flame begun from preheating
            paste, gasoline, or paper. Kerosene is also dirtier,
            smellier, and smokier than white gas, and it blackens
            your pots.</dd>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dt><strong>Jet Fuel</strong> and <strong>Stoddard
            Solvent</strong></dt>
        <dd>Similar to kerosene.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Alcohol</strong></dt>
        <dd>Coolest burning fuel with one-half the heat output
            per weight of any of the above. May be difficult to
            find in the 200 proof variety. I don't recommend
            alcohol-only stoves for travel. <br>

        <dd><h3 align="center">Windscreens</h3>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p align="left">Even a slight breeze greatly reduces stove
    efficiency. The windscreens built into stoves are
    insufficient. Make a windscreen from three or four feet of
    aluminum foil by folding it over a few times until you have a
    piece approximately six inches high by twenty-four inches
    long that just or nearly surrounds your stove. Attach a few
    paperclips for later anchoring and rigging. Or make a
    windscreen from a large pie plate. Or spend $10 to $39.95
    (I'm not kidding.) for a pre-made windscreen at your
    outfitter.</p>
    <p align="left">Be aware you don't want to heat up your fuel
    bottle or canister with the windscreen. </p>

        <dd>Gaz-Bluet makes several other stoves compatible with
            CV270 and CV470 cartridges. Beware, however, the
            Gaz-Bluet model 206 stove. It uses an old-style
            cartridge which is punctured by the stove, and
            therefore must remain attached to the stove until
            empty. The 206, while cheap, is inefficient and, in
            my opinion, dangerous.</dd>

            AV gas. Burns very hot and very loudly, like a blow
            torch. It doesn't simmer. (For all practical purposes

            This is the most omni-fuelish stove, and it cleans
            easily. Spare parts and repair kit, $10. Mountain

            change of a jet, kerosene. Burns hot. More compact,
            quieter, and slightly better at simmering than the
            XGK. Cleans easily. Spare parts and repair kit, $10.
            Don't confuse this stove with the MSR Whisperlite,

            hiking the Appalachian Trail hated hunting wood every

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For travel backpacking/camping throughout the developed
    world I recommend a newer model <strong>Camping Gaz-Bluet</strong>
    or <strong>industry standard</strong> <strong>gas</strong>
    stove. I prefer their no-mess convenience and their space and
    gravity advantages. </p>
    <p>When I wake up after a night at the pub what I want to do
    with my stove is flick, turn, and cook or kick back. I never
    want to deal with the pumping, priming, lighting, relighting,
    monitoring, adjusting, fiddling, and cleaning rituals of
    gasoline and kerosene stoves. </p>
    <p>When I need more fuel I'll pick some up at the camp store
    or the next time I pass an outdoor shop.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, gas stoves burn so cleanly they leave nothing
    on the bottom of your pots, unlike sooty gasoline and
    kerosene stoves which also heavily pollute that all-important
    local environment below your nose.</p>
    <p>Overall I would give an edge to Gaz-Bluet fuel canisters
    over the so-called industry standard for worldwide
    availability and lower price. </p>
    <p>The <strong>MSR</strong> <strong>XGK</strong>, as the most
    omni-fuelish stove, is recommended for camping in remote
    areas and developing countries where fuel supply is likely to
    be a problem, or for expeditions that will be boiling lots of
    water or melting snow for drinking.</p>
    <p>While this stove simmers about as well as a Saturn V
    rocket, it is matchless for producing a reliable, hot flame
    from many different fuels. It is also extreme overkill for
    European campgrounds at 6:30 in the morning.<br>

    width="200" height="171">For one or two people a one- to
    two-quart pot should handle all the pasta and soups you can
    eat. (A one-quart pot is just barely adequate.) I use a light
    eight-inch non-stick frypan for much of my cooking. It cleans
    with an easy wipe, which is a big<em> </em>plus after a big
    feed. </p>
    <p>Every camper should have a sierra cup, which is stainless
    steel and has a wire around the rim that quickly cools the
    rim. Sierra cups are great for heating tea and coffee water,
    as well as sauces, vegetables, and soups. You can do a lot of
    cooking with just these three items. I also carry a light
    aluminum plate for use as a lid, and for guests. </p>
