<p align="center"><b>Street Food </b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>If you are going to eat street food in Mexico or other
    developing countries, only select and eat food you see being
    cooked, and cooked well. Don't accept something taken from a
    warming box, since you don't know how long it's been there,
    and germs multiply unbelievably fast in hot, humid climates.
    Watch your food being cooked, and get it well-done even if
    you prefer rare. Make sure the grease isn't rancid, and
    choose a vendor who is proud of his stand and keeps it clean.
    </i></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>I warned a buddy about a hot-dog-type-thing being
    removed from a warming box, but he insisted his stomach was
    really tough. The next day he was unbelievably sick, and he
    remained somewhat under the weather for several months.</i> <b>René
    S., Austin, Texas</b> </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>The Marrakech Express </b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Don't take any night trains in Morocco. In fact, don't
    even go there. The Morocco you're thinking of died in the
    70's, baby.</i> <b>Terry M., Austin, Texas</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><i>*</i></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>The best way to put off Moroccan &quot;guides&quot; is
    to not let them know where you come from, and pretend to
    speak only Russian. Just walk by and say &quot;Nyet!&quot;
    and any other Russian-sounding garbage you can think of.
    Those bastards are amazing linguists, and if they can speak
    your language they will latch onto you and never quit, but
    they don't speak Russian, yet.</i> <b>Anonymous Englishman</b>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">*</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Because Americans tend to be friendlier, more generous,
    less cynical, and perhaps less world-wise than some other
    nationalities, we are prized targets for those who would
    deviously separate us from our money. The sheer volume and
    intensity of Moroccan hustlers present a special problem for
    average friendly Americans, including myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you are approached by &quot;guides,&quot; touts, or
    vendors trying to sell you tours, carpets, etc., you must
    give a firm but polite &quot;no,&quot; and not act the
    slightest bit interested. Do not acknowledge or speak to
    anyone trying to sell you hashish. Do your best to give the
    impression you have been around the world twenty times. If a
    hustler sees an opening or weakness he will wear you down
    with constant harassment. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When you get off the ferry in Tangier you are literally
    swarmed with so-called guides, official and unofficial.
    Initially you may be better off hiring one as your hired
    guide protects you from other hustlers. But don't trust him
    any further than you can throw him. He may be mostly
    trustworthy, but you won't and can't know that. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As you go deeper into Morocco the hustler problem lessens,
    as it does in the off-season. While there are many friendly
    Moroccans with a wonderful sense of hospitality, you must
    learn to separate these good folks from the hustlers. </p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>I<i>n Latin American countries it would be polite to
            keep a low profile with your money, instead of
            flashing it around. Use a money clip for the small
            amount you will be using during the day and keep it
            in your front pocket. When counting money for a
            purchase turn to one side and keep the money low and
            hidden with your hands. This is only good manners.<br>
            <br>
            </i></li>
        <li><i>Everywhere in Latin America is not receptive to
            bargaining. Some places the prices are as marked.
            Bargain when necessary, but only for things you
            really intend to purchase. If he meets your price you
            are expected to buy.<br>
            <br>
            </i></li>
        <li><i>Be sensitive to what you say. For instance,
            &quot;stupid&quot; in the U.S. is a minor insult, but
            in some Latin cultures it is a major offense.<br>
            <br>
            </i></li>
        <li><i>At high elevations like Quito be alert to quicker
            sunburning. Use a strong sunblock, a hat, and long
            sleeves.<br>
            <br>
            </i></li>
        <li><i>If you order drinks, the ice in it might be made
            from the local water everyone warns you not to drink.
            I stick to bottles and cans. Also beware of fruits
            and vegetables as they are grown and washed with the
            same local water. <br>
            <br>

        <li><i>Yogurt may help your digestive (enzyme) system,
            especially if you begin eating it regularly a month
            before going down. <br>
            <br>
            </i></li>
        <li><i>While traveling we are always out of our familiar
            &quot;comfort zone.&quot; Remember, other cultures
            and their way of doing things are not wrong; they are
            only different. This will help you enjoy your trip
            more.</i> </li>

<h4 align="center"><br>
</h4>

<h4 align="center">State of Mind</h4>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>Don't travel the world constantly making snap
            judgments about other cultures. The best way to
            relate to a new world is to keenly observe it, to
            drink it in, to feel it, and to participate in it.
            Having an &quot;attitude&quot; to the world around
            you will mainly cut you off from it.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Don't be too selective in what you want to see or
            experience. Leave yourself open to spontaneity. Often
            the best travel cannot be planned, or even expected.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Travel not always in a hurried, busy, buzzed state,
            but relaxed, open, observant, and rested. Allow
            yourself to go slowly from time to time.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Seek local music. Don't allow your Walkman to satisfy
            all your musical desires with canned stuff from back
            home. Music is everywhere.<br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Talk to everybody. </li>
    </ol>

<h4 align="center">Hard-Traveler Favorite Countries</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>We recommend all travelers to spend time in England,
    Scotland, Wales, and both Irelands. You could travel the
    entire world and these countries might still be your
    favorites. Moreover, language will only be a minor problem
    for Americans!</i></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>There is a big difference between the north and south
    of England. The North is better hitching, and the people are
    friendlier, with more time on their hands. (They are also
    more likely to be on the dole, and willing to entertain
    travelers.) The South is more crowded. Also, while London is
    one of the great cities of the world, it is NOT England.</i> <b>Jan
    and Marcia, California</b> </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">*</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>The two countries I have most heard described as
    &quot;favorites&quot; by hard travelers who have been
    everywhere are: Afghanistan (before the 1979 Soviet
    invasion), due to the incredible hospitality of its people,
    and India, due to its amazing people, and its unparalleled
    cultural and physical landscape.</i> <b>Tony, Yorkshire,
    England</b> (Note: Tony has been traveling the world for
    fifteen years, is one of the greater travelers I've met, and
    is currently teaching English in Japan.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">*</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Everyone is surprised when I tell them my favorite
    country. The people are friendly, and they speak English.
    It's beautiful, with the most unspoiled beaches anywhere.
    It's cheap, and except for one island (Mindanao--there's an
    Islamic revolt), it's safe--The Philippines.</i> <b>Mats,
    Malmo, Sweden</b> </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><br>
</p>

<h4 align="center">Deciding Where to Travel </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Even if you already know where you are going, milk the
    decision for all it's worth. Get yourself a good map or
    globe, and let your eye and mind wander. Assuming you have
    the money and haven't absolutely committed yourself, the
    whole world is open to you. Some countries require more
    effort and fortitude than others, but wherever it is (outside
    of wartorn or otherwise ravaged areas), you can bet there are
    other backpackers there leading the way.</i> <b>Mary O.,
    Arklow, County Wicklow, Ireland</b> </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b><br>
</b></p>

<h4 align="center">Keeping a Notebook </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Give your thoughts, notes, and doodles room to live and
    grow with a good quality notebook. Spiral notebooks fall
    apart during a long trip. You can write what you do, how you
    feel, who you meet, brilliant ideas, etc. On my last journey
    I used an 8.5x11 inch sketch pad with an inch or so cut off
    on two sides to make it smaller. One friend wrote down the
    names and/or a description of every person he shook hands
    with or otherwise met. He says the memories recalled when he
    looks back are incredible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>*</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>I never travel without my diary. One should always have
    something sensational to read on the train. </i><b>Oscar
    Wilde, Ireland</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b><br>
</b></p>

<h4 align="center">Camels </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>It isn't until the end of the second month that you
    really begin to understand the camel. I know this now, but I
    clearly remember after my first two hours of camel riding I
    thought I had it down. Then on the second day I thought I
    pretty much knew what was going on. Then after the first week
    I thought I struck a fair figure on my camel, and that I was
    more or less its master. Now I know it wasn't until a good
    six weeks later that I knew the least bit of anything about
    camels, camel-riding, the desert, desert people, or the sun. </i><b>Turbo
    &quot;Lawrence&quot; Maserati, USA, on Rajasthan, India</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b><br>
</b></p>

<h4 align="center">Dealing With the Police and Other Officialdom </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Be respectful, patient, and firm.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In some countries (including Mexico) where law is based on
    the Napoleonic code, the police may arrest everyone on the
    spot since your guilt is presumed, and you must prove your
    innocence. Therefore if for whatever reason the cops come,
    without unduly attracting attention to yourself, <i>get the
    hell out of there as fast as you can!</i> Don't stick around
    to see what is going on, especially if the locals are
    clearing out all around you. </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center"><br>
</h4>

<h4 align="center">Power Outages </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Electric power goes off on a regular basis in many
    developing countries. Life goes on, however, as restaurants
    and businesses have candles ready, so it can be a nice time
    to have dinner or a few beers.</i> <b>JC B., Kent, England</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b><br>
</b></p>

<h4 align="center">Fire </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In 1989 there was a fire at a backpacker hotel in the
    popular King's Cross section of Sydney. Five travelers were
    killed. Since then regulations in Australia have tightened,
    with sprinkler systems and smoke alarms now installed in all
    hotels. This is not the case in developing countries where
    many hotels are veritable fire traps. You may want to think
    about emergency exits when choosing a room. </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><br>
</p>

<h4 align="center">Eurailpass, Europass, and Flexipass </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Eurailpass gives you unlimited rail travel through
    seventeen European countries for a specific amount of time
    ranging from fifteen days to three months. The countdown
    begins the day of your first train ride. If you are under
    twenty-six you get a break on the price, but it is still a
    reasonable deal without the discount. My only caution is the
    Eurailpass encourages some people to travel too much, too
    far, and too fast. You may not want your #1 European
    impression to be looking out a train window. </p>
    <p>There are other passes which may offer a better value,
    such as the Europass and Flexipass. They both offer a certain
    amount of days of train travel over a set time. An example
    might be five days of travel over one month, or nine days
    over two months. Both cost much less than the Eurailpass.
    Check with Council Travel or other budget specialists for the
    latest information. </p>

    like a busy signal. The problem is you hardly ever know what
    signal means what, where. My philosophy is if you do manage
    to get any combination whatsoever of buzzing, ringing, or
    chirping, hang on for a few minutes and there's at least a
    chance something good will happen. Not always, not even
    usually, but enough where you should give it a minute or two,

<h4 align="center">International Driving Permit</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The International Driving Permit began with the United
    Nations Convention of International Road Traffic of 1949. It
    is now valid in 160 countries, for one year. This permit is
    available from American Automobile Association and other
    automobile club offices. You show up at their office with
    $10, a valid drivers' license, and a passport-sized photo of
    yourself. The permit is written in nine languages so the
    traffic cop who pulls you over can read it.</p>
    <p>An IDP is not necessary to drive in many developed
    countries as long as you have a valid license from your home
    country. This is true even though a German license represents
    that the driver has spent thousands of Deutschemarks on up to
    a year of serious training in the arts and skills of managing
    an automobile, while a Texas license proves you've turned
    sixteen. </p>
    <p>In Japan and many developing countries an International
    Driving Permit is required if you plan to get behind the

<h4 align="center">Carnet de Passage</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The carnet de passage is more than just a passport for
    your car. Because many countries charge high taxes on
    imported automobiles, it would be possible for backpackers to
    drive a car into a high-import-tax country and sell it at a
    great profit. Since governments don't want you doing this,
    they often require a carnet de passage, along with a whole
    list of stamps, visas, and documents to insure the car comes
    back out with you. </p>
    <p>The carnet de passage costs about $400 and requires a
    secured line of credit with a bank equal to the value of the
    vehicle plus whatever the normal import duties for it would
    be. This ranges up to 300% or more of the car's market value
    in some African and Latin American countries. This insures
    the government gets its money if you sell or abandon your car
    within its borders. Check with your local automobile
    association for more information. </p>
    <p>While independently cruising down Africa or South America
    is a great dream for many of us, the significant
    pre-planning, bureaucratic hassles, and financial hardships
    rule it out for most. Besides, local transport--from
    horse-drawn wagons in rural Poland to pick-up truck beds in
    Latin America--is far easier, cheaper, and more interesting. </p>
    <p>In France, however, I caught a ride in a VW van piloted by
    an Australian couple. When they said they had driven across
    Asia from Australia, that they had been traveling for a year
    and a half, and that several months of that time had been
    spent waiting for documents to be approved for the van, I
    thought they were pulling my leg in typical Aussie fashion.
    When they let me out their story became more believable as I
    watched those Australian plates pulling away. </p>
    <p>A Dane I met went across the Sahara and down into Central
    Africa with his father. He said that if anyone was thinking
    about taking an old jalopy across the Sahara into Africa,
    they should think again. Officials now will not let you make
    the trip unless you and your jalopy look capable of making
    it, and back. He said the route was littered with hulks of
    old VW vans, Fiats, Peugeots, etc. which probably never had a
    chance. Over several evenings of several beers I promised to
    put the following tip in this book.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>When making a big trip across a desert, such as the
        Sahara, sheep bladders are the best and usual way to
        store the many gallons of water you will need. The water
        stays unbelievably cool and fresh when hung outside the
        vehicle.</i> <b>Jens Martin P., Glamsbjerg, Denmark </b></p>

<h4 align="center">Buying a Car </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many backpackers buy cars in Australia, New Zealand,
    Canada, and the United States since cars and gas are
    relatively cheap in these countries, and distances are long.
    Australia and New Zealand have companies which specialize in
    selling cars to backpackers, and offer a guaranteed
    &quot;buyback&quot; price. This is of course lower than what
    was paid, but is a reasonable value. </p>
    <p>I attended several auto auctions in New Zealand intending
    to buy a right-fine-old English motorcar and drive it for a
    few months while fixing it up, and then selling it for a
    profit. I still believe this would have been possible, but
    the right Morris Minor or Austin Mini never presented itself.
    It was no great loss, though, as hitchhiking is great in New
    Zealand--I even got a lift from one of their former prime
    ministers. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>While the chance of any backpacker even seeing a killer
    snake outside the zoo or market is nearly zero, there are
    things out there that can hurt you. Every year several
    thousand Americans die abroad. While most of these deaths are
    due to natural causes--you should be aware that reckless
    drivers, motorcycles and mopeds, shoddy airplane maintenance,
    food poisoning, malaria, evil, stupidity, and--once in a
    great while--killer snakes contribute to the toll. </p>
    <p>Snakes kill about thirty thousand people each year, most
    of whom are barefoot farmers in Africa and Asia who work in
    the fields every day. And while the risk of snakebite to
    travel backpackers is extremely small, it is a most

            Fortunately, it isn't common anywhere. Cobras can
            erect themselves up to thirty percent of their
            length, so the king cobra in strike position can

            to 500 mph, depending on the observer. They are also
            highly aggressive, even to the point of charging
            victims if you don't give them enough space. Black
            mambas are said to be so fast and aggressive that
            they can chase down a man on a galloping horse. Of
            course this is an exaggeration--a good rider on a

            the un-aggressive green mamba prefers to get away by
            slithering to the top of the tree, rather than

            grotesquely huge body, with a girth of up to ten
            inches. Although it is slow-moving and
            docile-appearing, its coloring is such that on trails

        <dd>Is probably the world's deadliest snake in terms of

            annually. It is widespread from West Africa, across
            Asia to India and Sri Lanka. It's about two feet
            long, has a vicious disposition, and is fairly
            common--especially in fields--where agricultural
            workers are the usual victims. When aroused this

            (another deadly snake which only exists on a few

            After a bite you may begin bleeding from your eyes,
            gums, tongue, ears, and even skin as your blood
            vessels explode. The tommygoff reaches up to seven

        <dd>Americans have no reason to feel inferior about the

    <p>Again, snakes should be one of the least of your worries.
    I met a herpetologist in Belize who had been actively <i>looking</i>
    for the barba amarillo for six weeks without success. (I saw
    one, and a rare coral snake, but then I was looking too.)
    Nevertheless, here are some precautions to file away in your
    massive, active, and creative brain. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>1.</b> Most bites occur on the hands and below the
        knee. Never put your hands or feet anywhere you cannot
        see. Step on top of a log or rock, and then go over. </p>
        <p><b>2.</b> Use a flashlight when walking trails at
        night. Most snakes are most active at night, but are
        easily spotted with a flashlight. Snakes are also very
        active after heavy rains or flooding. </p>
        <p><b>3.</b> Venomous snake bites are indicated by one or
        two fang marks. Locals may want to take you to a snake
        doctor, but you must get to a medical professional. Snake
        doctors gain their reputation because locals may think
        every snake is poisonous, when most bites are actually
        from non-poisonous species. You need anti-venin and
        scientific care. </p>
        <p><b>4.</b> Stay calm--heart attacks after non-venomous
        bites are not uncommon. Since venom is biologically
        expensive for a snake to produce, there is a good chance
        a venomous snake may not have injected you with a full
        amount of--or any--venom. </p>
        <p><b>5.</b> Tourniquets often lead to needlessly
        amputated limbs. Most professionals advise against them. </p>
        <p><b>6</b>. Infection is also a possibility, so clean
        and disinfect wounds thoroughly. </p>
        <p><b>7.</b> Your chances of being bitten by a poisonous
        snake are probably one-millionth being run over by a bus
        or having a serious moped accident with a fruit stand.</p>

<h3 align="center">Straight Talk on Drugs </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Penalties for drug use are brutal if not inhuman in many
    countries, and in some there is no hope of a fair or speedy
    trial. Recently a young Austin woman was arrested in Mexico
    for trying to take too many Valiums across the border, which
    she had legally purchased in a Mexican pharmacy. After
    spending a year in prison she died the day after she was
    released, apparently due to asthma. </p>
    <p>Two Houston teen-age girls were arrested in Bangladesh for
    trying to smuggle several kilos of heroin. Although they knew
    what they were doing was illegal, they were conned into
    believing they were going to make a quick and easy $10,000
    courier fee. The standard death sentence was commuted to life
    in prison due to their young age. (They were pardoned three
    years into the sentence after extensive diplomacy by an
    American Congressman. Who's that lucky?) </p>
    <p>Twenty years ago two Australians in Malaysia received the
    death penalty for possessing a small quantity of heroin.
    Today being caught smuggling drugs from Thailand results in a
    limited expected lifespan, either by execution or by a harsh
    prison system which requires substantial money each month
    just to keep you alive.</p>
    <p>While Saudi Arabia beheads a dozen or so poor souls for
    drug offenses every year, California sentences
    poorly-educated minority fellows with drug problems to
    twenty-five years without possibility of parole <em>for
    having in their possession</em> a quantity of illegal drugs
    the size of a pea. </p>
    <p>But draconian drug laws don't only apply to the
    underclass. In Oregon a bright honor student will be sitting
    out college and medical school for sending his best buddy a
    sheet of LSD through the mail. </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, there are a number of places around the
    world where drugs are used more or less openly, and I know
    that some travelers do and will partake--<i>so it is to these
    potentially foolish few and young people I'm speaking now</i>.
    </p>
    <p>Often this drug use is <em>not</em> legal, but merely
    tolerated or ignored by the authorities. In some of these
    same places, however, catching a traveler with even a small
    amount of soft drugs is a real feather in someone's cap, as
    well as a financial windfall. It is well-documented the
    police in some countries employ drug dealers to sell to
    travelers, so they can then bust the traveler and extort
    money from him and his family. And they will get it, or he
    will do hard time, because U.S. laws do not apply, and the
    U.S. government will have little or no influence. <i>Midnight
    Express</i> is no joke. </p>
    <p>If you must smoke marijuana while traveling understand--<i>clearly
    understand</i>--that a stoned fellow traveler does not
    necessarily know &quot;the score.&quot; He could be much more
    stupid than either you or he realize. And anyone approaching
    you on the street and anxious to sell you drugs may be in
    league with the authorities for any number of reasons.</p>
    <p>On the other hand (straight talk isn't necessarily simple
    talk), it isn't unusual for outstanding citizens of the world
    (truck drivers, doctors, dairy farmers, former travelers) to
    bring you home to meet the spouse, and while they're throwing
    something on the barbie to pop open a few beers and offer you
    a fresh clipping from the nine-foot plant in the corner of
    the backyard.</p>
    <p>And you won't hear it from this traveler that sitting
    around your campground passing a peace pipe with a German, a
    Dane, and an Arab is some terrible crime. At its best this
    can be a ritual of communication like sharing a bottle of
    tequilla with colorfully-dressed fellows in the high country,
    or English tea service at a bed a breakfast. (And if you
    don't drink tea no one is going to force you to do so, but
    you can always join the conversation and munch a crumpet.)</p>
    <p>But also understand the local stuff may be ten times more
    powerful than that mild Mexican you tried a few times back
    home, with possibly alarming physical and psychological
    effects for the inexperienced. My exit from my first
    Amsterdam coffee shop could only be described as wildly
    paranoid if not psychotic, and certainly not the result of
    too much caffeine. </p>
    <p>If you must eat magic mushrooms while traveling the same
    applies, but be aware the effects are not easily predictable.
    Only use them in a pleasant, private setting with a friend
    after you've read a book or two about the subject. (Mental
    health requires care.) Be appropriately wary of traffic,
    don't climb trees, and don't go swimming way out over the
    horizon. In Bali an Italian backpacker is said to have gone
    for his last swim after breakfasting on a mushroom special. </p>
    <p>Of course the vast majority of travel backpackers never
    use any soft drugs and have the greatest times on the natural
    highs of travel and adventure. They understand that even soft
    drugs can be distracting from the books they need to read,
    the concepts they need to learn, and the people they need to
    connect with.</p>
    <p>But almost no travel backpackers use hard drugs such as
    cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine. These drugs begin taking
    away from your ability to travel and live life the moment you
    use them. Do not even try them one time. The older
    generations are absolutely right about some things.</p>
    <p>Don't be so foolish as to travel with a stash, and never
    cross a border with it. Customs officers are trained to
    detect subtle signs of nervousness. When the officer asks for
    your passport he will let it hang in the air before taking
    it. If you're even slightly nervous that passport will be
    flapping an obvious breeze. Then there will be a discussion
    while he watches your chest heave and your face flush, and
    probably hears your heart pound as you begin a detour to
    hell.<br>
