<h4 align="center">Chapter 12 </h4>

<blockquote>
    <h2 align="center">Items of the Eye<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </h2>
    <p>One day I was resting a few hours in a beautiful Veronese
    castle. The upper walls inside the main courtyard were
    covered with colorful murals from hundreds of years ago.
    Perhaps they depicted various occupants of the fair castle,
    or its court from some particular period, but in the early
    evening light the colors and scenes were fantastically
    beautiful. I felt not so much that I was looking into the
    past, but that I was alive in history. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Well, into this magical place strolls the Human
    Videocamera. For his entire five minutes there he carefully
    videotapes every angle of the courtyard, his eye leaving the
    tiny viewfinder for only brief moments. Then he lowers his
    camera and rejoins his impatient wife, presumably to later
    re-live for friends and family his visit to this entrancing
    place. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Unfortunately for the Human VideoCamera, he was never
    there. He was merely a camera operator--at best a poor
    observer--but certainly not a participant of the time and
    place. When he plays his tape those grainy, cartoonish images
    will be the best he ever saw of that courtyard, and that
    moment in front of the television will be the greatest he
    ever experienced of that beautiful castle. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My advice is if there is an image you want, take it. You
    will appreciate your good photographs when you return home.
    But unless you are a professional or keen hobbyist, take your
    photo and be done with it. Do not pollute your mind with
    constant debate about whether this or that would make a good
    picture. Seeing the world in terms of images is fine for MTV,
    but it's not a good way to experience travel. Wherever you
    are, make sure you really <em>are</em> there, with your own
    eyes, ears, nose and mind. <br>
    <br>

    <h3 align="center">Time and Clock-Time </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Time is our most basic and precious commodity--only a fool
    has enough for boredom. Use your time wisely, but don't waste
    it racing around like a scared jackrabbit. There is a saying
    among travelers that if you spend half an hour at ten
    cathedrals, you have seen nothing; if you spend all day with
    one, you have seen something. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the Western world nearly everyone wears a timepiece on
    their wrists, and nearly every building has a clock in or on
    it. Successful members of our societies run in sync with
    these clocks, and the resulting efficiency has led to a level
    of economic success that allows us a few weeks of vacation
    time each year (five weeks in ultra time-conscious Germany.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/CLOCKT~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/clocktime.gif" alt="Clock tower"
    align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="164" height="183">But
    many societies do not share our sense of time. Their people
    may not wear watches on their wrists, and they may not have
    clocks in or on every public building. They may look at
    shadows to estimate how much light remains in the day, and
    arrange a meeting with, &quot;Yes, Juan, I'll see you <em>after</em>
    tomorrow.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These few or no-clock societies are less mechanized, more
    in tune with nature and the seasons, and may actually have <em>more</em>
    time than our many-clock culture. When a no-clock person
    hears us make an appointment, it might sound to him like,
    &quot;I'll meet you at five seconds after 10:15, and don't be
    late.&quot; Pointing to a clock towering over one of our
    cities, he might ask: &quot;Who is running this place?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My brother tells a story about a tour bus on the big
    island of Hawaii. It makes a quick stop for everyone to
    stretch their legs and admire the view. Two young men from
    the bus wander over to a roadside stand. In a loud Brooklyn
    accent one of them says, &quot;Yeah, gimme a Coke, and, uh,
    (looking at the menu overhead) make that a large order of
    fries. And can you put some ketchup on 'em for me,
    buddy?&quot; The attendant, a native Hawaiian, nods, gets up,
    and disappears into the kitchen. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A few minutes go by, the bus driver has restarted the
    engine, and the New Yorkers are nervously griping about the
    slow service. Finally, not able to take it anymore, one of
    them leaps over the counter and opens the door to the
    kitchen. He then turns and shouts in dismay back to his
    buddy, &quot;He's <em>peeling</em> the freakin'
    potatoes!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Edward T. Hall's book <em>The Dance of Life</em> considers
    the paramount importance of time in cultures. All cultures
    have their own unique concept of time which differs a
    Frenchman from a German, a North American from a Latin
    American, and a Hopi from a Navajo. Hall contends, &quot;that
    to function effectively abroad it is just as necessary to
    learn the language of time as it is to learn the spoken
    language.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hall describes two broad categories of time culture--
    monochronic and polychronic. Monochronic cultures divide time
    into sections, and allot specific activities for each
    section. This schedule generally takes precedence over
    everything else. A person will drop what he is doing--whether
    finished or not--so he can meet another appointment on time.
    Monochronic people usually do one thing at a time with their
    time. They also tend not to mix business with pleasure.
    Northern Europeans, especially Germans and Swiss, and many
    Americans are mostly monochronic. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Polychronic cultures include southern Europeans and Latin
    Americans. These peoples often do many different things at
    the same time. Schedules are not seen as holy writs, but as a
    general guideline how the day may go. Polychronics are very
    people-oriented, with lots of friends and family around them
    most of the time. To them it's not such a big deal if someone
    doesn't show up for an appointment since they probably had
    several other things going on at the same time, anyway. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most tourists do not realize there are other ways of
    conceiving--and living--time. Out of sync with their
    environment, they waste energy and time fighting something
    they do not understand, and cannot change. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The only advice is to recognize the rhythms of life are
    not the same in all cultures. If you really want to get to
    know a people and culture it's best to get in sync with <em>their</em>
    concept of time, and just go with the flow. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Art and Travel </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travel presents the greatest opportunities for viewing
    art. Cities and countries put tremendous effort and money
    into showing off their cultural history through galleries,
    museums, and other displays. After several weeks of touring
    Hungary I distinctly remember walking out of the Magyar
    National Museum in Budapest thinking, &quot;So that's who
    these people are!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Appreciation of art is similar to appreciation of travel.
    If you travel the world glancing at this and that and saying
    &quot;I like it,&quot; or &quot;I don't like it,&quot; you
    aren't going to get much from your travels. It takes time and
    effort to absorb what your senses bring in. If you go into
    travel or art with a cynical, judgmental, or preconceived
    attitude you are not likely to come away much affected. On
    the other hand if your mind is open you might learn
    something, and you will no doubt enjoy yourself more. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1. </strong>Relax your mind. Many of us have a
        tendency to immediately reject the unfamiliar in art,
        travel, food, etc. Have a glass of wine, concentrate on
        your breathing, or otherwise clear your thinking. If I
        look for a few minutes at something I find interesting,
        my mind and senses usually open up to where I can better
        see other things. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Art and travel are both, first and
        foremost, communication. This communication occurs on
        multiple levels--not just the one you are immediately
        aware of. Art from another culture or time may reveal an
        entirely different perceptual world. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>3. </strong>Appreciate what you won't see
        anywhere else. Take your time. Don't be in a rush to see
        or do everything--you can't. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>4</strong>. Art and travel are not necessarily
        about beauty. If you reject everything which is not
        beautiful, you miss the majority of what there is. Art
        and travel are cerebral and emotional, beautiful and
        ugly. </p>

        Binoculars </h3>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Binoculars are perhaps the most underused travel item. In
    my pack they are as important as my camera since they enhance
    my vision <em>now</em>, while a camera often has the opposite
    effect. Binoculars are great for studying distant castles,
    gargoyles on the Cathedral of Amiens, monkeys in trees. I
    always take them when visiting zoos. While hitchhiking I've
    even saved myself considerable toil by reading distant road
    signs. And I cannot imagine visiting any wildlife park
    without a pair. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have loaned my binoculars to dozens of backpackers over
    the years, and when they hand them back a great many say they
    are going to get themselves a pair when they return home. My
    current binocular is the Minolta Pocket 7x21, which weighs
    just ten ounces, easily fits in a shirt pocket, and costs
    $65, including postage, from Focus Camera in New York. The
    following prices are from New York mail order camera shops,
    except for the Tasco, which is found in discount stores.
    Seven or eight power is the maximum you can hold comfortably
    steady. </p>

        <li>Pentax 7x21 UCF Mini, 8 oz., $75. </li>
        <li>Tasco 7x21, 8 oz., $50. Not a bad binocular, and a
            million times better than no binocular.</li>
        <li>Bausch &amp; Lomb Custom 7x26, 12 oz., $200. By far
            the best small binocular I've looked through. Worth
            the extra money if wildlife viewing is of prime
            interest.</li>
        <li>Bausch &amp; Lomb Legacy 7x35 extra-wide-angle, 22
            oz., $90. Twice the size, but what a view.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For comfortable viewing relax your eyes, hands, and arms.
    A practiced birder can effortlessly look through binoculars
    for minutes at a time. Adjust the width so you see one circle
    of vision--<em>not</em> two connected circles like in the
    movies. Make the one-time diopter adjustment according to
    instructions with the binoculars. Then remember to bring them
    along.</p>
