    <p>Traveling by myself or with a girlfriend small tents have
    worked fine. Traveling with a guy for any length of time I
    would want a really big tent, or, preferably, for both of us
    to have our own. For couples on a camping tour a six to seven
    pounder should provide plenty of room. I would just use my
    five-pound two-pole dome since that's what I have and it has
    worked well. I've also successfully used a four-pounder for
    two months with a close companion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For summer camping in Europe just about any two or
    three-pole nylon dome tent will work fine as long as it has a
    fly and you seal the seams. The better quality tents,
    however, are lighter, more durable, and more convenient. </p>

    </center></div><p>For spring and fall camping you should lean
    toward a better quality three-season tent. For winter and
    heavy-weather camping you will want a heavy-duty, four-season
    tent. </p>
    <p>For the tropics a tent must have good ventilation--at
    least two large mesh windows to let air in and keep bugs out.
    Even more mesh is better. In the tropics if your tent doesn't
    have adequate ventilation it will be like trying to sleep in
    a sauna. Hammocks are most used in these areas because they
    are the coolest way to sleep. </p>
    <p>Most backpackers prefer freestanding tents because they
    are easier and faster to set up, and can be moved around.
    Good freestanders can be ready for habitation in two or three
    minutes. </p>
    <p>While solo campers may be tempted to go with a tiny
    bivouac tent to save weight, one fellow who camped beside me
    for a few days was unhappy he couldn't even sit up in his. In
    my view an extra pound or so is a fair tradeoff for the extra
    headroom and space, especially if you plan on more than a few
    nights of camping. You will need a peak height of at least
    thirty-six inches to sit comfortably. </p>
    <p>On the other hand carrying a too-large tent is a real
    drag, especially if you aren't using it all the time. If it's
    raining there is almost always someplace nearby where you can
    hang out. Cafes, bars, and laundry rooms beat huddling in a
    tent any day. When wild camping you can stay dry underneath
    pine trees, even in heavy rains. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3 align="center">How Much to Spend on a Tent </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some name brand tents offer good value, but you don't have
    to spend a lot of money. If your budget is tight a simple two
    or three-pole dome tent from a discount store will keep you
    mostly dry if you seal the seams properly, which is necessary
    for any tent. They cost about $40. </p>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/PUPTENT.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/puptent.jpg" align="left" hspace="10"
    vspace="4" width="200" height="166">Pup tents--which are low
    with poles at either end--can really suck. They take a long
    time to set up, regularly blow down with light puffs of wind,
    and this one looks roomier than it really is. They often
    require thirty or more minutes a day of maintenance, and may
    be associated with a slight drowning risk. </p>
    <p>On the other hand if you're a couple of lads with fifty
    quid between you, you've borrowed the thing from an old
    girlfriend, and you've hitched over to Amsterdam, that's
    cool!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Tent Care </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My tent suffered more wear during a few weeks of use in
    Central America than in five months in Europe. This was due
    to the high humidity and constant wet that enabled mold to
    readily grow. Mold especially attacks the plastic waterproof
    coating on tent floors. Always dry your tent before packing
    it away, or at least at your first opportunity. </p>
    <p>Ground cloths are thick plastic or coated nylon which some
    campers put under their tents to protect the floor. Others
    put it inside the tent. I consider ground cloths unnecessary
    weight and complexity. When my floor gets a hole I patch it
    with rubber cement, nylon tape, or duct tape. This rarely
    happens since coated nylon tent floors are quite strong. </p>
    <p>For the tropics a ground cloth might inhibit mold growth.
    If you do use a ground cloth be certain it doesn't extend
    beyond the tent since that would catch rain and create a
    silly surprise right away. That happens a lot.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Tents and Cooking </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Never cook inside a tent. The combustion can poison your
    atmosphere, consume your oxygen, and send flames up the walls
    of your tent. You could pass out and never wake up. Spilled
    fuel could make you a human torch. Leaking gas could
    concentrate and explode, prematurely ending your tour.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For extra safety I use a frypan with a four-foot handle.
    While tent walls are treated for fire retardancy, it wears
    off, and the fact that they are treated indicates the danger
    is no joke.<br>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Seam sealing</strong></dt>
        <dd>Seams on tents must be sealed with seam sealer ($4)
            to prevent water from seeping through thread holes in
            the fabric. Erect the tent and apply two coats to the
            underside of the fly, and two coats to both sides of
            the floor. Check the walls for areas that need
            sealer. This is better done before<em> </em>the
            storm.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>&nbsp;<strong>Freestanding vs. not freestanding</strong></dt>
        <dd>A freestanding tent is a dome or modified dome
            design. After attaching the poles the tent can be
            picked up and tossed back and forth with your travel
            buddy. This is convenient as it speeds set-up and
            site selection. A not-freestanding tent must be
            staked-out for it to take shape, which can be
            ludicrously time-consuming depending upon the
            terrain, atmospheric conditions, and/or the fitness
            of the traveler.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Fly</strong></dt>
        <dd>A coated nylon tarp which attaches over the main body
            of the tent to block rain. This allows air to
            circulate through the main body, which reduces
            condensation on the inner walls.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Ventilation</strong></dt>
        <dd>Air flow inside a tent must be sufficient to prevent
            condensation on the inner walls. This could easily
            amount to a gallon of water from two heavy breathers.
            In the tropics maximum ventilation is essential.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Storm flaps</strong></dt>
        <dd>All four-season and some three-season tents have
            storm flaps zippered behind mesh windows. They allow
            you to control air flow. A too-breezy tent on a cold
            night is not much warmer than no tent, while a
            less-breezy tent on the same night may give you an
            amazing twenty degrees of comfort.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Vestibule</strong></dt>
        <dd>An area outside the entrance covered by the fly which
            is very useful for storing shoes and gear, and for
            careful cooking in inclement weather. Not all tents
            have one.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>No-see-um netting</strong></dt>
        <dd>Very fine mesh used on all good tents to allow air
            circulation, yet screen out very tiny biting insects
            such as black flies and no-see-ums.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Three-season tent</strong></dt>
        <dd>A tent designed to withstand relatively mild
            conditions. They have fewer poles (for less weight
            and strength) and use more no-see-um netting for
            better ventilation on warm nights. A three-season
            tent may flap incessantly or come apart in high
            winds, and may collapse under too much snow. They are
            lighter, more compact, and cheaper than four-season
            tents. See <a href="18TRAV~1.HTM#grommet" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/18traveltents.htm#grommet">The
            Amazing Floating Grommet Technique</a> for quieting
            three-season tents in high winds.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Four-season tent</strong></dt>
        <dd>Designed for winter/extreme condition use. They are
            warmer, have more fly coverage, more poles, less
            no-see-um netting, and usually two entrances in case
            one becomes blocked by an avalanche or grizzly bear.
            Four-season tents are overkill for most backpacker
            travelers.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Clips vs. sleeves</strong></dt>
        <dd>Many manufacturers slightly expedite set-up by using
            plastic clips to attach the tent body to the poles
            instead of sliding the poles through nylon sleeves
            sewn into the tent body. <br>

    <p>The following are representative of the hundreds of good
    backpacker tents on the market. It's wise to set up a tent
    before you buy. The square-foot measure is more accurate
    since the dimensions for three-pole domes and hoop tents are
    maximums. (<em>COMING SOON</em>: Separate metric file)</p>

            zippered storm flaps to control ventilation. It
            sometimes goes on sale for $80, but is a great value
            at either price. This design is available from many
            outdoor shops under the generic descriptions
            &quot;two-pole modified dome&quot; or &quot;wedge

        <dd>$25, 1 lb. 8 oz. Use a thin (approximately 2 oz. per
            square yard of material) 10'x10' coated nylon tarp
            and <strong>The Amazing Floating </strong><a
            name="grommet"><strong>Grommet</strong></a><strong>
            Technique</strong>. In the field make attachment
            points for overhead branches and staking by pressing
            a rock or other small object (preferably smooth and
            round) against the tarp from the underside and then
            looping the rock and tarp from the outside with 1/8
            inch braided nylon cord. This allows complete
            flexibility of attachment points and is much stronger
            than grommets, which often pull out</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>This technique is also useful for stabilizing and
            quieting any tent buffeted by winds. <strong>Sierra
            Designs Grip Clips </strong>use the same principle
            and work well, but cost $12 for four and take up
            space and weight.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Discount Store two- or three-pole dome</strong></dt>
        <dd>$40-$70, 5-8 lbs. Freestanding, three-season. Poles
            are made of fiberglass, which is strong and flexible,
            but twice as heavy as aluminum. The fly should extend
            at least half-way down the tent walls. Check the
            stitching before leaving the store. An old cheapie
            worked fine on my first tour from Scotland to Greece,
            and was easy to sell for 2000 drachma when it become
            superfluous due to perfect weather.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Bivy sack</strong></dt>
        <dd>18 to 30 oz., $80-$200. Surrounds your sleeping bag
            to keep out weather. Usually made with a coated nylon
            bottom and a breathable GoreTex top. Extra nylon at
            the top allows you to form a cover over your head.
            Bivy sacks are for ultra-ultralight campers. <br>

    <h3 align="center">Zipper Repair 101 </h3>
    <p>A zipper on my tent door failed on my last European tour,
    and I promptly mangled it beyond repair because I didn't know
    how to fix it. I could have saved $45 from having the entire
    zipper replaced, and slept warmer for a few weeks. </p>
    <p>The most likely zipper failure is as the slider wears, it
    will not press the coils together tight enough, which means
    the coils will separate behind the slider as it is pushed
    along. You can probably make a fix by borrowing a pair of
    needle-nose pliers from a native, moving the zip to the start
    position, and then <em>gently</em> squeezing on the wing of
    the zipper a little at a time until it works again. If you
    squeeze too hard you will lock the slider in place and
    permanently disfunctionalize it, which is what I did.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
