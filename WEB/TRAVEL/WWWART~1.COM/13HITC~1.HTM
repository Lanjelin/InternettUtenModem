<h2 align="center">Hitchhiking <br>
<br>
<br>
</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hitchhiking is a risky travel method that should not be
    taken lightly by anyone. Experienced hitchhikers with
    thousands of miles and hundreds of rides behind them--and
    with sharp heads on their shoulders--don't accept rides from
    strangers trivially. You could be killed, injured, robbed,
    and/or raped. </p>
    <p>Around Sydney a serial killer had been preying on
    hitchhiking backpackers for several years, with seven known
    deaths. The victims were Australian, German, and British, all
    between the ages of nineteen and twenty-one. The police fear
    more because when a backpacker disappears no one knows for a
    long time. </p>
    <p>These young people didn't die because they were naive or
    their intuition was faulty. They died because they got into a
    car driven by a murderer who knew what he was doing and
    looked like anyone else. (Someone was convicted for these
    crimes in 1995.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Furthermore, hitchhiking may not get you where you're
    going when you want to get there. You may not have the
    patience to wait long hours or even days for a ride, or walk
    the miles and miles a hitchhiker must accept as part of the
    game. You may not like standing in the rain, in the cold, in
    blazing heat. <em>For these reasons the vast majority of
    travel backpackers rely on public transportation and never
    hitch rides.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Nevertheless many people do hitchhike, every day, all over
    the world. For many people in many places it's more or less a
    daily routine of life. Even I growing up in an Ohio River
    town hitchhiked to high school on a fairly regular basis. I
    had missed the bus, it was too cold to ride my bike, or the
    car wasn't starting--I needed to get a few miles down the
    road and there were all these people driving right by where I
    needed to go. I'd get a ride before too long and ten minutes
    later I'd be dropped off. I didn't think much about it. </p>
    <p>In further out parts of the world where buses don't often
    run and personal transportation is rare, hitchhiking is
    usually a standard method of public transport. In some cases
    signaling systems have evolved to tell drivers how far you're
    going or if you're willing to pay for gas.</p>
    <p>And on summer mornings in Europe it's not unusual to see a
    dozen backpackers waiting at a good spot outside a major
    city. Many of these are not hitching solely to save money
    (although that is almost always a factor), but because they<em>
    </em>love<em> </em>to hitchhike. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I am one of those people. Indeed hitchhiking has been a
    major contributor to my world view that our planet is largely
    composed of good and friendly people. And while I cannot
    advocate hitchhiking for anyone, in some countries the risk
    of violence is small, and the benefits can be great. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this age what hitchhikers see and do and learn may not
    make headlines, but on a personal level their achievements
    are impressive and interesting. Hitchhiking is travel by the
    seat of one's pants. It takes guts and creative thinking.
    Hitchhikers have no mission control to ask advice and no
    alternate switches to switch. Backup systems are limited to
    feet and possibly a tiny umbrella. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For me, hitchhiking is travel at its most basic and
    fascinating. I usually feel I hardly know a country until
    I've stood by one of its roads and waited for someone to give
    me a ride. Hitchhiking is also great sport, replete with a
    roller coaster of emotion. When you get a good ride,
    interesting conversation, or an invitation for tea to meet
    the family, hitchhiking can be pretty darn good. On the other
    hand sometimes it stinks--and you just can't get around that.

    <h4 align="center">Where Hitchers Hitch </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hitchhiking by travel backpackers is relatively common in
    Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Most veteran
    hitchhikers consider the U.S. one of the worst places for
    hitching, except for Alaska and Hawaii where it's excellent.
    I will add that rural Texas is also good--almost without
    exception they think your truck is broke down. </p>
    <p>The north of England, Scotland, and Wales are very good.
    In Poland the first car or horse-drawn cart that can stop
    usually stops, and the hospitality is usually great. </p>
    <p>While hitchhikers raise about as much compassion in Spain
    and France as the average telephone pole, your odds of
    getting a lift are still much better than the average
    telephone pole. (Now those guys...) I must give an extra star
    to France, however, since it's the one country where women
    drivers would regularly pick me up.</p>
    <p>Hitchhikers quickly cover vast distances in Germany once
    they get to service centers on the autobahn. The trick is to
    get there in the first place. (I still haven't figured that
    S.O.B. out.) Hitchhiking in Italy, while exciting, is
    dangerous since about one Italian driver in five is actively
    seeking a meeting with God. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While few Japanese hitchhike in Japan, many westerners do
    because of the high cost of transport. Japanese stop right
    away because they think something must be wrong. New Zealand
    is nearly crawling with German and English hitchhikers, with
    a few Maoris sprinkled in to keep it interesting. Australia
    is good, but the distances are so vast you might end up with
    the same ride for days. Truckers are your best bet there. </p>
    <p>Ireland, of course, is heaven.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Note to Women Hitchhikers </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Women must be aware solo hitchhiking is the least safe of
    all options. Yes, mostly you can get away with it, but the
    odds for trouble skyrocket. A whole new subset of drivers
    will stop for solo women who usually whiz on by a man, a man
    and a woman, or two women. These include ax murderers,
    rapists, robbers, and general sleazeballs. (To be fair, some
    female drivers only stop for female hitchhikers.) </p>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0" width="85%">

            <td align="right" valign="bottom" width="45%"><em>Photo:

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have seen this sleezeball subset while hitching with
    women and sitting out of sight. Cars screech to a halt or
    circle around, leering, toothless drivers checking the scene.
    They zoom on after catching sight of me, their dreams of easy
    sex thwarted. Of course, the greatest threat to hitchhikers
    is the driver who looks like any other, but has evil or
    stupidity at his core. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My Irish friend Maureen had some experience hitchhiking in
    Ireland, where she considered it safe. Traveling on the
    continent for the first time, she didn't want to be
    constrained by &quot;sexist&quot; thinking about hitchhiking,
    so she occasionally thumbed a ride. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>On her last solo ride in Poland she got into a van with a
    group of other hitchhikers, thinking she would be safe with
    them. Gradually the others were dropped off until only she
    was left. The driver turned off the highway down a back road.
    It was getting dark, and she had an uneasy feeling. He pulled
    the van over, nothing around but forest for a long way. He
    began looking at her significantly and motioning to the back
    of the van. She began to panic, thinking how stupid she was
    for being there. She grabbed her pack and began to get out.
    He grabbed her pack and said no, it was okay. He restarted
    the van and they went on without event. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Maureen considers herself lucky, and says she will never
    again hitchhike alone. She wanted to make clear, however,
    that her solo journey around Europe, and especially Poland,
    was one of the best experiences of her life.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Hitchhiking Signs</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is a decades-old controversy among hitchhikers about
    whether signs are a help, a hindrance, or a waste in stopping
    speeding automobiles, and even what type of sign works best.
    I am of the school that advocates signs as powerful tools. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I usually carry a large magic marker and a notebook.
    Sometimes I use the back of a map to make a big sign, or a
    found piece of cardboard. I firmly believe a well-made sign
    may convince some drivers who don't normally stop, to stop.
    They read the destination city, say &quot;BOPO,&quot; and
    they think, &quot;Hey, I'm going to BOPO,&quot; and their
    foot instinctively goes to the brake. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is the theory. Of course their foot usually moves
    back to the accelerator as they regain their senses. Members
    of the lazy camp contend almost no one is going to stop who
    doesn't usually stop, so it just isn't worth the effort to
    make signs. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is true that most rides come from a core of regular
    stoppers, many of whom are former or current hitchhikers.
    There are, however, many drivers who stop occasionally, plus
    those majority of drivers who still need education in the
    pleasures of picking up strangers and taking them places.
    Every one of these rides you reel in is not only good for
    you, but good for all hitchhikers. (Assuming you are half-way
    pleasant to be around, that is.) </p>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/HITCHER.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/hitcher.jpg"
    alt="Author on the road, somewhere." align="right"
    hspace="10" vspace="2" width="240" height="157">Another type
    is the message sign. Instead of a destination, it has a
    message which can be used over and over. Examples are:
    &quot;GOING MY WAY?&quot;, and the classic, &quot;I DON'T
    STINK.&quot; The idea is to create a smile and an
    acknowledgment of your humanity, which, by the way, is a
    challenge at the on-ramp of a superhighway. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong><br>
    </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Making Signs </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Whenever possible I use the big magic marker to make big,
    bold, beautiful signs that are readable from two or three
    seconds drive-time away. A big sign may give the driver a
    crucial extra second to stop. Unfortunately the only paper I
    usually have is my notebook, so most of my signs are not big,
    bold, or beautiful. </p>
    <p>Usually I don't use far-away destinations (like
    &quot;PRAGUE&quot; from Paris), but shoot for a closer
    destination en route. Then if the driver offers to take me
    further, I have that choice. On the other hand if you go for
    the whole shebang, you just might get it. </p>
    <p>There's a lot to think about in sign-making, which is
    okay--you'll have plenty of time for that. </p>
    <p>Another trick is to use the native spelling of a city,
    such as København for Copenhagen, Athina for Athens,
    Twitsville for Paris, etc. Many drivers naturally prefer
    riders who speak their native language. </p>
    <p>A border makes the sign stand out. Look like you have
    somewhere to go, and that you really want a ride. Finally, be
    nice when they don't stop--they probably have good reason.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Road Literature </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>For interesting reading check the lightposts and roadsigns
    where hitchhikers traditionally ply their craft. Scrawled
    there will no doubt be a message or poem to you, the future
    hitcher, from some inspired or desperate soul from time ago.
    Hitchhikers exude inspiration, and there is nothing between
    you and it but time. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sadly, many fade away as sun and weather take their tolls.
    But new ones take their place, and new ones after that, as
    new generations hitchhike down the roads of glory. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>&quot;If you are standing there reading this, God
        has forsaken you, and you are going to die a slow,
        agonizing death from exhaust fumes, hunger, and
        indifference</em>.&quot; <strong>Seen near Oxford,

</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Hitching Etiquette </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>USA-style hitchhiking employs a thumb pointed positively
    into the air or jauntily in the desired direction of travel.
    Yes, this has a beauty and simplicity all its own and, as an
    American, I am proud to stick out my thumb anywhere in the
    world. But mostly I want a ride sooner rather than never, so
    it pays to hitch as the locals do. </p>
    <p>Many places you just casually hold out an open palm or a
    few fingers. In other countries you flap your hand like a
    little bird wing, while in others all you need is eye
    contact. For the most part women hitchhikers need only to
    find some shade, sit down on their packs, and try to work in
    a postcard before a Mercedes screeches to a halt. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is one important worldwide hitchhiking rule, though.
    If you are dropped where there are already one or more
    hitchers, do not be so bold as to think you can take a
    position at the front of the line just because that's where
    you were let out. <em>No way, Jose. </em>Proper hitching
    etiquette insists you take a position twenty yards behind the
    last hitchhiker already there. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course this doesn't necessarily mean you will be last
    to get a ride. If you reel one in by virtue of your pleasant
    smile, superb sign, or huge thumb, it's yours, baby. That guy
    ahead could be badly jinxed for any number of reasons. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Gallant hitchhikers, however--and there are many--inquire
    of their driver if there might also be room for the poor
    sunburnt chap up the road. For some guys on some days it's
    their only freakin' chance! <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Mitfahrzentralen (!?) </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>These are ride-sharing companies, usually run by students
    or young people, found in many of the bigger cities of
    Germany and Austria. Drivers call the mitfahrzentralen saying
    they are leaving on a certain date for a certain destination.
    You pay the mitfahrzentralen about $10, and also the driver
    $10 to $25 for gas, depending on distance. You must pay the
    mitfahrzentralen before they will tell you where to meet the
    driver. However, if you stand on your head and say,
    &quot;Mitfahrzentralen I love you&quot; three times in
    German, there's a slim chance you won't have to pay. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the ride doesn't work out, they refund your money. Find
    their phone numbers by looking up
    &quot;mitfahrzentralen&quot; in the phone book, or a <em>Let's
    Go</em>-type guide book. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Similar companies are called Allostop in France, and are
    available in many cities across Europe. Also check
    noticeboards around hostels, universities, and student cafes
    for rides. These are good ways of traveling cheaply without
    hitchhiking.<br>

<h4 align="center">Hitchhiking Tips </h4>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Mortality</strong> </dt>
        <dd>I believe the most dangerous aspect of hitchhiking is
            being run over. Always be on the alert, watch every
            car carefully, don't stand in the road, never stand
            with your back to the traffic, and be aware some
            motorists most of the time and all motorists some of
            the time have poor vision and/or attention, and may
            pull or swerve off the road onto you. Be ready to
            jump.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Choose</strong> </dt>
        <dd>your take-off spot carefully. The most common
            hitchhiking error is looking for a ride where most of
            the traffic is local or heading somewhere else, when
            something superior is a short distance away.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Inquire at hostels or among locals for tried-and-true
            hitching spots. Consult a detailed map to determine
            traffic patterns. I often find it faster and safer to
            take a bus or train a short distance out of major
            cities.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>The slower the better</strong></dt>
        <dd>Hitch from intersections, gas stations, and roadside
            stops where automobiles stop or slow down. This gives
            the driver a few extra seconds to look over you and
            the traffic situation. It is difficult and dangerous
            to stop a car going more than fifty mph.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Think for the driver</strong> </dt>
        <dd>A competent hitchhiker must think for the driver. You
            are asking him to make a maneuver he doesn't
            regularly make, and the drivers around and behind him
            may not expect.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>No ride is worth risking an accident. All good,
            traditional hitching spots have a safe place for cars
            to pull over.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Legality</strong> </dt>
        <dd>Hitchhiking directly on major highways is usually
            illegal and dangerous. It's better anyway at roadside
            stops, at the beginning (or before the beginning) of
            on-ramps, and on smaller roads.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Standard Procedure</strong> </dt>
        <dd>When a car stops, first ask the driver where he's
            going. Then it's easy to decline the ride if you
            don't like the smell of his breath, or if something
            doesn't feel right.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Suspicious but desperate</strong> </dt>
        <dd>If the driver looks suspicious but you're in such a
            desperate state you get in anyway, make sure the door
            opens from the inside, stay next to the door, and
            never get between two men. (Anywhere between four
            fun-loving Swedish girls, however, is worth the
            risk.)</dd>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Instincts</strong> </dt>
        <dd>A driver with evil intent may indicate something is
            weird before a confrontation begins. <em>Trust your
            instincts and get out</em>. Say you're about to
            throw-up and have been sick all day. Don't encourage
            or tolerate inappropriate behavior.</dd>

        <dd>The best hitchhiking combinations for safety and
            getting rides, in order, are: a man and a woman; two
            women; a lone man; and two men. Three is slow but not
            impossible for short periods.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Travel light</strong> </dt>
        <dd>If you have a lot stack it behind your biggest bag.
            There is usually room, and usually the driver doesn't
            mind the inconvenience, but sometimes he does.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Courtesy </strong></dt>
        <dd>When a car stops don't make the driver wait. But
            before jumping in ask where he's going and take a
            good look at him. Hitchhikers often politely turn
            down rides because they aren't going far enough, or
            for other reasons. You never have to get in.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Seat belts</strong> </dt>
        <dd>Always wear a seat belt and shoulder harness. Put it
            on immediately so there isn't an awkward moment later
            when his driving proficiency becomes apparent. If he
            drives unreasonably, ask to be dropped off.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>

        <dd>Drivers stop for two main reasons: they genuinely

            for interesting conversation.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Reality </strong></dt>
        <dd>Mostly hitchhiking is great fun, with good roads and
            friendly people. Just be aware of, and prepare for,
            the real risks.<br>

Travelers' Tips </h3>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>If you're hitching at an intersection in Greece
        and a driver shakes his head from side to side, that
        means &quot;Yes, hurry up and get in.&quot; An up and
        down nod means no. Not knowing this cost me many hours
        and half-a-dozen rides. I finally got a lift from a
        German/Greek couple in a VW bus who clued me in.</em> <strong>The
        Maniac, State College, Pennsylvania </strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>When hitchhiking across Germany, a good map that
        indicates autobahn service centers and roadside stops is
        invaluable. Have your driver drop you at one of these,
        instead of an exit, since they are by far the best
        hitching spots. Also, the first few letters on German
        license plates indicate the city they're from. Use this
        to your advantage: &quot;Aha, you are from Hamburg! What
        a coincidence! I'm going to Hamburg, too!&quot;</em> <strong>Jason
        Thomas, San Marcos, Texas </strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Always carry a flashlight when hitching or walking
        at night. In rural areas when the moon is not out, man,
        does it get dark! </em><strong>Les Marcott, Waco, Texas </strong></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p align="center">* </p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Summer hitchhiking in the extreme latitudes, north
        or south, is great. It doesn't get dark until midnight
        (and then not very), so you've got the whole day to get
        where you're going, and everyone is in a cheery mood.</em>
