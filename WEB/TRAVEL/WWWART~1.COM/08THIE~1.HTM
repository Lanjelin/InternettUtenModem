<br>
<br>
</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Do not let paranoia about crime invade your mind and spoil
    your travels. The vast majority of visitors to European and
    other countries do not encounter pickpockets or thieves
    regardless of where or how they carry their valuables. In the
    developing country Morocco, which is often considered a bad
    place for rip-offs, only about one in twenty-five visitors is
    a victim of thievery, according to a survey in one British
    magazine. In your travels you are far more likely to have a
    completely opposite experience in which the honesty and
    kindness of most people shines brilliantly. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Nevertheless, the trouble and expense of replacing
    passports, tickets, travelers checks, and gear can wreak
    havoc on your tour. Furthermore, if you make it easy there
    are a few thieves everywhere who will oblige themselves to
    your property. With common sense and an awareness of how
    common thieves operate, you can reduce your risk to the
    minimum.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">State Department Hotline for Travelers </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The United States State Department operates a
    twenty-four-hour hotline with safety and political
    information for every country. Thousands of documents are
    available. Travelers from other countries also use this
    service. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>State Department Overseas Citizens' Emergency Center
        Washington, D.C.<br>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The voice number connects you to a taped voice-mail system
    which allows you to listen to hundreds of topics by punching
    in selections on your phone. The fax-back service sends back
    faxes after you punch in selections via phone. The modem
    number (dialed by your computer) accesses the Consular
    Affairs Bulletin Board. The web service, of course, is the
    most convenient. </p>
    <p>State Department reports include:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Current travel advisories </li>
        <li>U.S. Passport information </li>
        <li>Types of assistance offered by the Citizens' Consular
            Service and the Citizens' Emergency Center </li>
        <li>The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC)
            Electronic Bulletin Board </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>State Department travel advisories are also available from
    America Online, CompuServe, and other Internet services.
    Their information is not as extensive, but adequate. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While some backpackers say the hotline exaggerates
    problems, I consider it the best and only source of
    information about current dangers around the world. It is
    compiled by State Department staff in every country, and
    partially depends on reports from travelers. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The State Department report on Guatemala cites so many
    instances of possible trouble that many travelers would be
    scared-off. In reality there are thousands of travelers in
    Guatemala at any one time, the vast majority of whom have a
    fantastic experience. Read the reports for what they are,
    take them into careful consideration, but also imagine how a
    travel advisory for any American city might appear. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>On the other hand at this writing the report for Somalia
    says, &quot;The State Department strongly advises U.S.
    citizens to avoid travel in Somalia as it is totally
    unsafe.&quot; I would totally abide by that. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another point to keep in mind is that just because other
    travelers say a certain place is perfectly safe, that doesn't
    make it true. It only means <em>they </em>didn't encounter
    problems. I listened to an experienced backpacker swear up
    and down how the dangers of a particular area were highly
    exaggerated or non-existent, when the day before I had spoken
    to three Germans who had been robbed at gunpoint there. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Local authorities and tourist offices cannot always be
    relied upon, either, as they have a vested interest in
    minimizing whatever problems there are. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the State Department report says &quot;There have been
    numerous reports of robberies on the volcanoes around Lake
    Atitlán,&quot; that doesn't mean it's unsafe to go to
    Guatemala, or even Lake Atitlán, but that you should be wary
    around those volcanoes. If I didn't have that information I
    probably would have walked those trails on my own. Knowing
    that information it was easy to go with a group and guide to
    reduce risk. </p>

Pickpockets </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>As you wait in line at the crowded Amsterdam tourist
    office continuously blaring over the loudspeaker is the
    following warning in six languages: &quot;Your attention
    please. Watch your wallets, there are pickpockets
    about!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>That tourist office is tough pickings for any would-be
    pickpocket, since everyone is continuously fidgeting with
    their pockets or purses, and throwing about a great many
    suspicious looks. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Unfortunately, however, I have come across a number of
    pickpockets in my travels. While standing in a train ticket
    line I saw a hand stealthily slip into a purse from behind.
    In another line I saw a pickpocket slither behind a man and
    try to snatch the wallet in his back pocket. I have chased
    hands out of my pockets four times--twice while getting off
    crowded buses (a very vulnerable time); while temporarily
    blinded as I descended into a dark, sleazy club from a bright
    street; and in a market. A friend had her fanny pack unzipped
    and her wallet removed while she was pressed against a wall
    of people in a crowded market. Another backpacker had been
    pickpocketed three times over two months, also in markets.
    &quot;They're good,&quot; he said. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The professional pickpocket in the developed world has a
    more-or-less standard operating procedure. He chooses a
    likely target--someone who obviously has money within easy
    reach. That includes back pockets and purses. If the thief
    cannot get the money cleanly, he or a partner will create a
    distraction by bumping the target, violently colliding with
    the target, or spilling something on the target. The wallet
    is snatched and within one or two seconds it is discreetly
    handed to a partner who quickly walks away. The money and
    valuables are removed and the rest dumped within a few more
    seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Even if you see or feel what is happening, you have no
    evidence. The scoundrel says someone shoved him into you, you
    fell into him, or <em>you</em> were trying to rob <em>him</em>.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These pickpockets look for easy marks. As long as you
    don't dangle your money in a purse, or dangle it in a back
    pocket, or otherwise dangle it on a thread ten feet behind
    you, they will choose an easier target, of which there are
    many. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the developing world you are a juicy target because
    pickpockets know you have ten, a hundred, or a thousand times
    more money than the average local. <em>You are the target</em>.
    There is no getting around that. But if you keep most of your
    money in a hidden money belt against your skin, you'll be
    safe from pickpockets.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Money Belts--Your Best Defense </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Money belt&quot; does not mean the fanny or waist
    pack many tourists wear outside their clothes. If you wear
    one of these in some areas you will immediately see
    &quot;$&quot; signs light up in some eyes. And I'm willing to
    bet when you see a waist pack on a tourist your first thought
    will be something like &quot;Big, fat bag of money!&quot;
    Imagine your thoughts if you were a thieving scoundrel, a
    hungry, jobless person, or a pack of street urchins with no
    one to look after them.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You can probably use a waist pack in Europe without
    incident. Millions of tourists enjoy their convenience, and
    they are safer than pockets and purses. But they are not
    nearly as safe as hidden money belts. Criminals know waist
    packs are &quot;where the money is,&quot; and no waist pack
    is a match for their deft hands and incredibly sharp razors. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Thus the primary achievement of hidden money belts is the
    &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot; principle. It's almost
    a secondary benefit that they are impossible for a thief to
    snatch without your knowledge. </p>

Types of Money Belts </h4>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Waist Type</strong></dt>
        <dd>The most popular. Typically about ten inches long and
            four inches wide with a strap which goes around your
            waist. It has a zipper with one or two compartments,
            weighs about two ounces, and costs about $10. It can
            be worn either tightly against the stomach, or
            dropped loosely into the pants.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Pocket Type</strong></dt>
        <dd>About half the size of the waist type. It hangs
            inside your pants from your belt or belt loop. It has
            one or two zippered compartments, and is easy to whip
            out when needed. This is what I use most of the time.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <div align="center"><center><table border="0" width="85%">
        <tr>
            <td align="right" width="53%"><img

            hspace="4" width="257" height="185"></td>
            <td valign="bottom" width="47%"><em>Photo: My usual
            system. I darkened the loop with a magic marker to
            hide it better.</em></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </center></div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Neck or Shoulder Type</strong></dt>
        <dd>Hangs under your clothes from around your neck or
            shoulder. May take awhile to whip out when needed,
            depending on your clothing. The strap could be
            grabbed, cut, and pulled away. The neck-type is the
            least safe of any hidden money belt, but still much
            safer than wallets and fanny packs.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Leg Type</strong></dt>
        <dd>Straps around your leg just above the ankle. These
            are used by some travelers in bandit areas (this
            doesn't apply to 99.99% of us) since it remains
            hidden if a bandit forces you to drop your pants to
            display your waist money belt. Another trick is to
            place your valuables inside an Ace bandage wrapped
            around your leg.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Belt Type</strong></dt>
        <dd>A real hold-up-your-pants belt with a zippered
            compartment on the inside. It has about twenty-four
            inches of zippered area, about one inch wide. It
            comfortably stores a dozen currency notes. I use this
            as extra insurance. A fabric belt for men is
            available from Campmoor and some travel/outdoor
            stores for $20. A nice leather belt which can be
            trimmed to fit women is available from Magellan's for
            $28. See <a href="23TRAV~1.HTM#catalog" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/23travelinfo.htm#catalog">Useful

    </dl>
    <h4 align="center">What Belongs in the Money Belt </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I use a dual system: a pocket-type money belt together
    with a hold-up-your-pants money belt. I don't load them with
    anything less than crucial so they are as inconspicuous and
    comfortable as possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Into the hold-up-your-pants belt I put about ten $20
    bills; one or two $100 travelers' checks; a trimmed photocopy
    of the first two pages of my passport; and a piece of paper
    with travelers' check numbers, American Express phone
    numbers, flight numbers, airline phone numbers, credit card
    numbers, foreign contacts, and any other vital information. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Into the other money belt I put the rest of my travelers'
    checks; the rest of my U.S. currency (probably not more than
    two hundred dollars); my passport and another trimmed
    photocopy of the first two pages of it; any visas; my Texas
    driver's license; three checks from my U.S. bank account;
    airline or other tickets; and another duplicate list of vital
    information. This is also the best place for your credit and
    ATM cards, but don't bring more cards than you need. Two or
    three should be sufficient. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The duplication is in case you lose one you won't be
    penniless or informationless in the cold. Additionally, I put
    more duplicated material in my pack, including a travelers'
    check or two; about $40 in cash; and another photocopy of
    vital information. Losing some of your stuff is bad, but
    losing everything could be <em>really</em> bad. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">The Wallet </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The money belt should not be used for day-to-day
    activities, but once per day to remove the necessary money
    for that day. You don't want to draw attention to it
    unnecessarily. A wallet or money clip can be used for the
    myriad of daily transactions. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Pickpockets call the back pocket the &quot;sucker
    pocket,&quot; so don't carry your wallet there. I always use
    a front pocket or a jacket inside breast pocket. Other
    travelers keep theirs in a waist pack, but be wary of this in
    some situations. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I recommend sewing or gluing (Magic Stitch, $2, at sewing
    stores or Walmart) Velcro closures (same places) into your
    pockets to prevent their contents from spilling out, or from
    being pilfered. I have been lucky several times when my
    wallet fell from my pocket while sleeping on buses and
    trains. (While I haven't gotten around to doing this myself,
    I <em>know</em> it's a good idea.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Unless you are using your credit card often, don't leave
    it in your wallet--keep it next to your skin in your money
    belt. Usually I just have whatever foreign currency remains
    from my last cashed travelers' check, which is rarely more
    than $100. There may also be a few coins, a bus pass, etc.,
    but nothing of too dear value.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some travelers prefer to keep their bills rolled into a
    money clip which they deposit deep in their front pocket.
    This is the lowest-profile way to carry your daily money.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Shoes</h4>
    <p>In higher crime countries it's worthwhile to put a
    greenback or two under the insole of your shoes. While I've
    never been robbed of everything, I've heard ugly stories from
    people who have, so I can assure you having a little money is
    infinitely better than no money.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Watches and Jewelry </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While traveling in unknown lands never wear expensive
    watches or jewelry, or even watches or jewelry which <em>look</em>
    expensive. There is nothing like a real Cartier, a knock-off
    Rolex, or anything sparkling or gold to make you look like an
    easy mark and occasion a gun to your ear or a knife to your
    throat.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <h2 align="center">Thievery on Trains and Buses </h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The big backpacker scare in Thailand is being offered
    candy and drinks on trains and buses from supposedly friendly
    people. The treats are spiked with powerful drugs which knock
    you out. They then take whatever they want. While this is
    rare, it is doubly nasty because most Thais are wonderfully
    generous and love to offer sweets and things to visitors. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In some countries checking your pack on a train is the
    same as kissing it goodbye. Backpackers always carry their
    packs onto trains, and they usually place them on an overhead
    rack in easy sight. While sleeping it is a good idea to put
    your pack under your feet, or strap or padlock it to yourself
    or something. If you have a sleeping compartment, bring your
    pack in. These precautions are enough to deter most thieves,
    who move on to an easier target. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Unless you keep your pack to the size of a large
    daypack--no more than about 3000 cubic inches--bus drivers
    will sometimes insist your pack be put underneath, or on top
    of, the bus. Both are not so good, but on top is much worse.
    For one, it can get very wet up there. For another, anyone
    can climb up at any time and loot your pack, or toss it into
    a field to retrieve later. Or on a narrow mountain road as
    the bus plunges over a cliff, the pack could fly off without
    you. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When stowed underneath the driver and conductor have a
    higher level of responsibility, but I still make a point of
    checking on it occasionally, if only to let the staff know
    I'm keeping my eyes open. But then maybe they get the idea
    there really <em>is</em> something valuable in it, and they
    become inspired to steal my pack and retire early. But then
    again, just because I might be paranoid, that doesn't mean
    they aren't trying to steal my pack. But then again, didn't
    his eyes light up ever so slightly when I handed him my pack?
    And what about that guy getting off now. Why would anybody
    get off here? Does he have Grand Theft Pack Larceny on his
    mind, also? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's better to just travel superlight and carry on your
    tiny pack, whistling.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Snatch and Run Thieves </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Snatch and run thieves are usually teenagers who grab your
    purse, camera bag, fanny pack, or wallet and run like hell,
    or speed away on a motorbike. Beware motorbikes and teenagers
    prowling behind you. Straps may be cut with a knife or
    scissors. I have never encountered this type of crime, but it
    is prevalent in some large Italian cities where it's almost a
    fashion among some teenagers. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's best not to carry a purse or camera bag on the street
    side of the sidewalk, and you should develop the habit of
    holding both securely. If you do carry a purse, don't have
    money or valuables inside. Carry camera equipment in a small
    nylon tote bag instead of a camera case that shouts to the
    world there is $500 inside. A confident, rapid walking pace
    is also a deterrent. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>But again, don't become paranoid. Since a relaxed walking
    pace is the best way to observe and feel the world, the best
    compromise may be to relax and enjoy while remaining alert to
    your constantly changing surroundings. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In some South American cities, notably Lima, many
    travelers walk with their packs in front to prevent thieves
    from slicing it open from behind, dumping the contents onto
    the street. In a wild melee of people grabbing and running,
    you are left with one slashed pack. One victim said people
    were actually fighting over his stuff, including his shirts. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Street Children </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You should also be aware of the Minos de la Calientes--the
    Children of the Streets. In a few major cities of Latin
    America (especially Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and other parts
    of the developing world, there are thousands of children who
    have no home, no one to care for them, and only live by
    whatever they can beg or steal. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>One ploy of street children is to surround you by
    pretending to sell you something, perhaps shoving a newspaper
    in your face, and then boldly going through your pockets, or
    slicing into your pack and fanny pack. If you shove some
    away, others step in like sharks in a frenzy. When they get
    what they want they scatter in all directions. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another thieving tactic--one I have experienced--is for a
    child or two to &quot;befriend you.&quot; He follows you
    around, carefully watching your every movement, continuously
    asking for money, inquiring about your things, and waiting
    for your wallet to appear. In an unguarded moment, perhaps as
    you are looking into your wallet to give him a few cruzados,
    or to make another transaction with someone else, he grabs
    whatever he can and runs. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course these kids have been dealt an awful hand in
    life, and are just trying to survive. And while you probably
    want to be compassionate with them, I suggest you apply such
    compassion to local aid agencies, if possible. It is just too
    risky to encourage desperate, hungry kids with gifts of
    sweets or money. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The best defense, as always, is to maintain a low profile
    and travel lightly. A hidden money belt is a necessity. In
    high-crime and street-urchin areas do not encourage even one
    child, as others may follow. Locals often treat street
    children like dogs, completely ignoring or threatening them.
    While I don't think many travelers can do that, you must keep
    your own safety in mind.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Other Security Precautions </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every major city has an area that is more dangerous than
    the rest, and a time when this is especially true. An area
    may be safe during the day, but takes on a more sinister
    character after nightfall. Such areas are always well-known
    to locals, so get advice from a hotel or tourist office. Most
    guidebooks also include warnings about red light or seedy
    areas, but things may have changed since the information was
    written.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">Self-Defense </h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A few years ago I attended a self-defense class geared
    mainly for women, and taught by an Israeli Army veteran. As
    the only male student in the class, I was volunteered to
    attack the instructor, who then absurdly flung me around the
    room like a stuffed animal. After three humiliating results I
    concluded the path of good would be best for me. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>He taught techniques the Israelis have developed over the
    past fifty years in their hostile environment. Not karate,
    kung fu, or other stylized systems, but a scientific approach
    to incapacitating an attacker as efficiently as possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>He maintained that many men and women--but especially
    women--do not know how to react when attacked, and have never
    considered what they might do in such a situation. Of course <em>travelers
    are only very rarely physically attacked</em>, but the
    consequences are so traumatic it's worth forethought. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Following are a few points on defensive techniques. Again,
    while the probability of a physical attack on the traveler is
    low, it is better to know something rather than nothing. You
    may want to attend a good self-defense class.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Self-Defense Tips </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>THESE POINTS ONLY RELATE TO A PHYSICAL ATTACK UPON YOUR
    PERSON. If they want your money or belongings, let them have
    it. Even if you are a highly trained Israeli, if your
    attacker is armed with a gun or knife you are very likely to
    lose a fight very badly. (Please note I rarely write
    &quot;very.&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Attackers often test victims
        before assaulting because they are looking for a good
        victim. He may shout or curse at you, and/or bump you. He
        wants you to become rattled, to stop in your tracks, and,
        in effect, turn yourself over to him. Mentally prepare
        yourself now for such a test. You want to look tough,
        confident, and unflustered. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> In a fight for your life you
        cannot be squeamish about inflicting injury. You have
        many tools at your disposal, including fingernails,
        fingers, thumbs, teeth, elbows, and legs. </p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Get a finger in his eye and gouge.
        Get fingers in his mouth, dig in with your nails, and rip
        his cheeks out. The same for nostrils, ears, and balls:
        rip, tear, and gouge. Run when you get the chance. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Don't delude yourself that
        &quot;knowing where to kick a man&quot; is going to save
        you. That is a difficult or impossible blow to deliver in
        a fight. In reality you would need to use your fingers
        and nails to gouge and tear. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> If the attacker has a choke-hold
        around your neck, you must break it within a few seconds.
        Don't grab onto his arms or hands to pull them off.
        Instead, join your hands together at your waist and swing
        them upward to blast his grip off, then come down with a
        blow to his nose or gouge his eyes out. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Fighting back may induce your
        attacker to greater violence, and some women have talked
        their way out of violence. No one can tell you what your
        response should be. You must decide then and there.
        Prepare now to make that decision. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>7.</strong> Many Department of State Travel
        Advisories for various countries state that tourists who
        quietly accede to bandits' demands are usually not
        harmed. Do not argue, but give them whatever they want,
        including your car. The rule is: <em>Do what they say,
        hand it over, and get away.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        </em></p>
    </blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>In the Middle East if you come across a sign
        telling you to keep out of a place or town, keep out! I
        learned this after coming a hair's breadth from being
        stoned to death by a group of Palestinians who thought I
        was Israeli. Since tourist dollars are much desired
        there, there is good reason for any such warnings.</em> <strong>Robin,
        Brownsville, Texas </strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="center">* </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>When booking airline, bus and train tickets try to
        arrive at your destination during daylight hours,
        especially in some large American and developing world
        cities. There can be dangerous people at some of these
        bus stations looking for vulnerability. If you become a
        target, don't show weakness--instead look arrogant and
        confident. Even in times of dire poverty, sometimes money
        spent on a taxi is a great bargain</em>. <strong>Duncan
