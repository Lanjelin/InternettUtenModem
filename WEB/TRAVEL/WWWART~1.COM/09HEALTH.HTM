    <br>
    In North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South
    Korea, Japan, and a few other places your most likely health
    problems are foot blisters, colds, constipation, and
    hangover. In the rest of the world most travelers are likely
    to encounter nothing more than mild diarrhea from unfamiliar
    microbes introduced into the intestines. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Don't let fear of health problems prevent you from
    developing world travel--you might have a heart attack if you
    don't travel! While headline-grabbing diseases such as Ebola,
    Lassa Fever, and plague are terrifying, for all practical
    purposes travelers don't get them. These are diseases of
    grinding poverty and ignorance. For over ten years we in the
    developed world have been calmly living with the deadliest
    and most insidious virus of them all--so try to maintain
    perspective. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>With the sensible precaution of seeking advice from a
    travel clinic your health risks are greatly reduced. Most
    aspects of travelers' health are directly related to
    awareness. You don't want to be as naive as I on my first
    backpacking trip into the developing world. (See <a

The #1 Threat </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>By far the greatest threat to the traveler is being run
    over by a moving vehicle, or from a crash while in a moving
    vehicle. Even for Americans in America there is a one in
    one-hundred chance they will be killed in an automobile
    accident in their lifetime (and many times that for a serious
    accident.)<a href="#notes" name="1"><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore the most important steps for traveler safety are
    obvious--always wearing a seat belt, always looking both ways
    before crossing a street, and standing well-back from the
    curb. Keep this in mind as you read about malaria, cholera,
    and urine fish. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

<h2 align="center">Sources For Current Information </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you are planning a journey to the developing world,
    this chapter will<em> </em>not give you all the information
    you need. That information is not available in any book.
    Epidemics and outbreaks of diseases occur and change much too
    quickly. Constantly updated information is available from: </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><a href="../TPPMSGS/MSGS31.HTM#3197" tppabs="http://www.cdc.gov/travel/travel.html"><strong>Centers
        For Disease Control</strong></a> Atlanta, Georgia (voice

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The CDC webpage is used by travelers from everywhere for
    the latest worldwide disease and health information. You can
    also listen to exhaustive recordings of health information
    over the phone by requesting specific topics via touch tones,
    or use their fax-back service. Many travel clinics receive
    software updates from the CDC, and provide that information
    to customers. <br>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="center">My Travel <a name="clinic">Clinic </a></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most major cities have a private or public travel clinic
    to assist international travelers with preventive measures,
    and to treat diseases they may bring home. After being
    pitifully laid out and hospitalized on my first tour into
    rural Mexico due to sheer stupidity, there was no question
    that before my next journey into the developing world I would
    seek a travel clinic and spend whatever necessary to get
    fully immunized, as well as medically and mentally equipped. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Soon I had the opportunity for a few months in Central
    America, so I made an appointment with the Travel Clinic in
    Austin, Texas. During the initial $45 visit a knowledgeable
    Registered Nurse discussed my case. She also had access to a
    computer file from a private company called Travax, which was
    a compilation of information from the CDC and the State
    Department. It was updated weekly. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I was given forty pages of useful computer printout on
    eight Central American countries. Topics for each country
    were AIDS, cholera, malaria, hepatitis, polio, rabies,
    typhoid, yellow fever, cholera, insect-borne diseases, food
    and water-borne diseases, testing requirements, and a general
    description of each country. Most eye-opening were U.S.
    Department of State travel advisory reports, including
    descriptions of recent criminal activity against travelers,
    warnings about possible drug penalties, assessments of
    medical facilities, and embassy locations and phone numbers. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>On my first visit to the clinic I received a polio booster
    shot in one arm ($25) and a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster
    shot in the other ($15). Both arms were slightly sore at the
    place of injection for two days. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I was given prescriptions for chloroquine, Cipro, and a
    Typhoid oral vaccination. Chloroquine is an anti-parasitic
    drug which usually kills malaria-causing protozoa in the
    blood. It is taken once weekly beginning one or two weeks
    before entering an infected area, and for four weeks after
    leaving an infected area. I got the generic chloroquine for
    about $2.50 per capsule--$1 less than the brand name. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Cipro is a brand of ciprofloxacin antibiotic available
    through prescription. It is effective against travelers'
    diarrhea since it causes fewer side effects than
    broader-ranging antibiotics. Recommended dosage was one 500
    mg tablet twice per day for three days. They cost $20 for six
    tablets, but I got twelve as Cipro has a long shelf-life, and
    I knew from experience how vital an effective antibiotic
    could be. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I was instructed to carry Cipro, Immodium, and a
    thermometer. If I contracted mild diarrhea, which was defined
    as several bowel movements per day while feeling fairly well,
    <em>no treatment</em> was indicated. If the diarrhea was
    severe I was instructed to check my temperature. If it was
    above normal I was to take 500mg of Cipro twice per day for
    three days. If my temperature was normal, I was to take the
    Cipro as above, <em>and</em> to take one Immodium tablet four
    times per day for three days. </p>
    <p>The reason for not taking the Immodium while running a
    fever is that fever may indicate organisms in the bowels
    which are likely to invade the intestinal lining. Since
    Immodium slows intestinal movement (it plugs you up), it
    would allow the bad bacteria a better chance to invade the
    lining and prolong diarrhea. </p>
    <p>I was also told to seek medical help if self-treatment did
    not work, and if there was accompanying high fever, blood, or
    mucus in the stool. </p>
    <p>The Oral Typhoid Vaccine cost $42 and consisted of four
    capsules to be taken with cool water one hour before meals
    every other day. Since this was a live vaccine the capsules
    had to be kept cool. I was given an ice-pack for transporting
    it home. This oral vaccine was said to have fewer side
    effects than the injectable version. </p>
    <p>About ten days later I returned to the Travel Clinic for
    an immunoglobulin (gammaglobulin) injection ($9) in the hip,
    and a yellow fever vaccination ($52) in one arm. The
    immunoglobulin shot contained antibodies to combat Hepatitis
    A, which provides some protection for up to five months. It
    should, however, be taken as close to departure as possible
    to ensure maximum effectiveness. The yellow fever shot is
    effective for ten years. </p>
    <p>After this second visit to the Travel Clinic I had a
    slight fever and chills, and was slightly tired for a few
    days. This was considered a normal reaction. My hip
    definitely ached from the immunoglobulin shot. </p>
    <p>Find a travel clinic in your area by checking the yellow
    and white pages under Travel Clinics, or by calling your
    local public health agency, hospital, or doctor.<br>

</blockquote>

<h2 align="center">Travel Health Insurance </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many companies sell travelers' health insurance for one to
    several dollars per day. Usually you pay the medical costs
    while in the foreign country, but are reimbursed when you
    return. More expensive plans pay for emergency air transport
    home. </p>
    <p>If you already have health insurance check your current
    plan to see if it provides coverage in other countries. There
    is a good chance it does, though it probably won't cover
    emergency air transport back home. </p>
    <p>ISIC (International Student Identity Card) holders get
    coverage with the card. Other plans are available from many
    travel agents, including Council Travel and other
    budget/student specialists. <a
    href="23TRAV~1.HTM#insurance" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/23travelinfo.htm#insurance"><em>Useful Information</em></a>
    lists a dozen companies which offer travel insurance. </p>
    <p>Some European and other advanced countries with national
    health systems treat--at no charge--travelers from other
    countries on a reciprocal basis. The United States, of
    course, is not one of these countries.<br>

<h2 align="center"><a name="maladies">Maladies</a> of Interest to
Travelers </h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>The following is a concise overview of major threats
    facing travelers. I hope it encourages you to seek
    professional medical advice from a travel clinic before
    visiting the developing world.</p>
    <p>Most of this information came from the CDC, my travel
    clinic, the American Medical Association Encyclopedia of
    Medicine, several travelers' health books, and my experience.
    While I have tried to be accurate and informative, please
    note that I am writing outside my fields of expertise (travel
    gear, hitchhiking, beer drinking, women, delusion, and false
    hope), and that I am neither a doctor or nurse.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">A Warning on Self-Diagnosis </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>The books doctors consult to diagnose health problems are
    a thousand times more detailed than the following list of
    symptoms and disease characteristics. Don't try to diagnose
    yourself--see a medical professional. Even in developing
    countries where doctor training may not be extensive (in
    Mexico I was superbly treated by a twenty-two-year-old), they
    will be familiar with local health problems. </p>
    <p>Another point is that treating yourself with too few or
    the wrong antibiotics may be worse than taking nothing. The
    wrong antibiotics could facilitate germ entry into new areas
    of the body, while too few might allow the infection to
    spring back worse than before.<br>

    <dl>
        <dt><font size="3"><strong>Colds </strong></font></dt>
        <dd><font size="3">are common among travelers</font>. One
            friend had five over six months in Europe. He was
            also drinking more alcohol than usual, and not eating
            well. Because there are over two hundred viruses
            associated with colds, those prevalent in Europe or
            China may quickly overwhelm your immune system. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Since colds are transmitted primarily by direct
            contact, incidence is reduced by washing hands,
            especially before eating, and by keeping fingers away
            from the face. Colds get their initial foothold in
            your mucous membranes, so drink plenty of fluids to
            keep them in good shape. </dd>

        <dt><font size="3"><strong>Diphtheria</strong></font></dt>
        <dd>is very rare in developed countries due to widespread
            use of the Td vaccine, but it is still endemic in
            poor, developing countries, and a hazard to
            non-immunized travelers. There is currently a
            diptheria epidemic in the countries of the former
            Soviet Union. </dd>
        <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
        <dd>Diphtheria is an acute bacterial illness which causes
            a sore throat and fever, and can be life-threatening
            when the bacteria release a toxin into the
            bloodstream. About ten percent of victims die from
            it. Prevention is by updating your Td vaccine.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Tetanus</strong></dt>
        <dd>is also called lockjaw. 500,000 cases develop
            annually worldwide, but only about one hundred in the
            U.S. due to widespread immunization with the Td
            vaccine. While a booster is recommended for the
            general population every ten years, the vaccine's
            effectiveness falls off enough that if you get a
            major cut or puncture between years five and ten,
            it's standard practice to get another booster ASAP.
            (Hence I'll get a booster every five years for
            developing world travel.)</dd>

    <dl>
        <dd>Symptoms include stiffness of the jaw, back, and
            stomach muscles, and a contraction of facial muscles.
            Wounds should be thoroughly cleaned and an antiseptic
            applied. Tetanus is serious and sometimes fatal.

        <dt><a name="colon"><strong>Diarrhea</strong></a></dt>
        <dd>is what most travelers to the developing world get
            for a few days. It is generally no great problem, and
            the discomfort usually lessens after a day or two.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Diarrhea is most often due to unfamiliar bacteria
            introduced into your system. Mexicans traveling in
            the U.S. sometimes get Uncle Sam's Revenge. Anxiety
            also causes diarrhea.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>It's best to let normal diarrhea run its course,
            which takes from two to five days. Drink plenty of
            liquids to flush-out your system, and to avoid
            dehydration. Eat no solid foods on the first day. On
            the second day begin eating bland foods such as
            toast, soup, rice, and bananas.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>If you need to plug-up your system for a day so you
            can travel, the over-the-counter drug Immodium works
            safely and well. The active ingredient in Immodium is
            loperamide, which is also used in several other
            medications. Do not use loperamide for extended
            periods as the intestines must be cleansed naturally.
            Loperamide doesn't cure anything. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Many travelers swear by Pepto Bismol tablets for
            soothing the stomach and easing diarrhea. I usually
            have these tablets in my pack, and when traveling
            developing countries, several in my wallet. Pepto
            Bismol turns your stool a dark black.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Dysentery</strong></dt>
        <dd>is a severe infection of the intestines,
            characterized by passage of mucus and blood. It has
            two forms: bacillary and amebic. While both are
            prevalent in many developing countries, they are rare
            in travelers compared to simple diarrhea.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Bacillary dysentery</strong> </dt>
        <dd>is also called <em>shigellosis,</em> after the
            shigella bacteria which cause it. Bacillary means
            &quot;rod shaped,&quot; which describes this
            bacteria. The usual source is from infected food
            handlers failing to wash their hands properly, and
            from flies landing on food after having been
            somewhere nasty.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Symptoms begin one to four days after infection, and
            are characterized by a sudden onslaught of watery
            diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, and
            fever. After several days blood and mucus begin
            passing. It is highly contagious.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Treatment consists of rehydration therapy. Solid food
            should not be eaten for the first day or two.
            Antibiotics may be useful. Most victims begin
            recovering after about a week. Babies, children, and
            old people risk death due to dehydration.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Amebic dysentery</strong> </dt>
        <dd>is also called <em>amebiasis</em>, from the
            single-celled ameba (smallest animal) parasite
            entameba histolytica. Amebic dysentery results from
            swallowing the hystolytica cysts via infected water

        <dt><strong>Cholera </strong></dt>
        <dd>results in severe water loss due to watery diarrhea
            and vomiting. The cholera bacterium produces a toxin
            which increases the passage of fluid in the
            bloodstream to the intestines. Death can result in a
            few hours from rapid fluid loss. Infection is by
            ingesting food or water infected with the bacteria,
            but especially from shellfish. In two hundred years
            cholera has spread from northeast India to most of
            the developing world, including South and Central
            America, and Mexico. Fortunately, the risk of cholera
            to travelers is slight.</dd>

            middle-class city I had visited the previous week.
            Water works employees had failed to chlorinate the
            water, and four hundred people had come down with
            cholera, killing eleven.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Symptoms begin one to five days after infection, and
            include diarrhea and usually vomiting. Treatment
            consists of immediate rehydration therapy to prevent
            dehydration and death. Ninety-nine percent of victims
            recover given adequate rehydration.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Prevention consists of drinking only bottled or
            boiled water, and taking as much care with food as
            possible. A vaccine is available, but is only about
            fifty percent effective for three months. My travel
            clinic did not recommend the vaccine due to its
            ineffectiveness, expense ($45), and the rarity of
            cholera in travelers. Other backpackers have taken
            the vaccine because they were told it might reduce
            symptoms.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Constipation</strong></dt>

            fight over bits of lettuce during her long stay in

            abdominal discomfort, and liver pain (on your right
            side). Urine may darken, and stools may become
            lighter and yellowish. After four to seven days the
            symptoms may become more severe, including diarrhea,
            vomiting, itching, and jaundice. Skin and whites of
            the eyes may turn yellow. Most recover within six

            products.) Type B is found worldwide, but is much
            more prevalent in Asia and Africa. Symptoms, when

            tragedy is increasing as mosquitos become
            insecticide-resistant and forms of malaria become
            drug-resistant.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Malaria is spread by the bite of the Anopheles
            mosquito, which generally feeds dusk through dawn. It
            is caused by four types of a single-celled protozoa:
            vivax, ovale, malariae, and falciparum. These
            parasites attack and explode red blood cells.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Symptoms for the first three types may include the
            classic malarial fever, which is called an
            &quot;ague&quot; (pron. <em>ae gyoo</em>). This

            with millions of parasites being released into the
            bloodstream after bursting out of red blood cells.
            First is a cold stage characterized by severe
            shivering, followed by a high fever stage of up to
            105 degrees. Finally there is intense sweating which
            brings the fever down. The victim may also vomit and
            have a bad headache. The patient is left weak and
            tired, and sleeps.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>These stages may occur cyclically, either every other
            day or every third day, but only after the disease is
            well-established. <em>Malaria can be very difficult
            to diagnose in early stages.</em></dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Falciparum is a more severe type of malaria as all<em>
            </em>red blood cells are attacked. Death may result a
            few hours after symptoms begin. The brain may be
            affected, and liver and kidney failure are common.</dd>

            Falciparum malaria is resistant to chloroquine,

            treatment with your travel clinic before you go, and
            immediately with local medical professionals if you

            Avloclor</em>, and <em>Resochin</em>) should be taken
            weekly beginning at least one week before entering a
            malarial area, and continuing four weeks after
            leaving. (Beginning the regimen two weeks before
            departure is often recommended so there will be time
            to change medication in case of a reaction.) The

            sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (brand name <em>Fansidar</em>)

            and prevent malaria. Fortunately, most travelers who

            vomiting, bleeding from the gums and nose, and severe
            pain in the neck, back, and legs. These may last a
            few days, followed by a remission, and then followed
            by a more severe illness, including increased fever,
            vomiting of blood, and jaundice due to liver
            damage--hence the name yellow fever. Approximately

        <dt><strong>Rabies</strong></dt>
        <dd>is also known as hydrophobia. It is an acute
            (suddenly developing) viral disease of the nervous
            system. Almost invariably fatal if left untreated, it
            is transmitted by animal bites, scratches, or even
            licks on an open cut. There are about 30,000 deaths
            every year from rabies, nearly all in developing
            countries. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Skunks, raccoons, and bats are the major carriers in
            North America. In Central and South America dogs and
            vampire bats are the primary vectors. Rabies is
            fairly common in some areas. Stray dogs are numerous,
            and vampire bats are a threat to those sleeping
            outside without mosquito netting. A vampire bat lands
            near a sleeping mammal, creeps up to it, and delivers
            a painless bite with its razor-sharp teeth. It then
            laps up the blood, which does not coagulate due to
            inhibitors in its tongue. Fortunately, horses and
            cattle are the usual victims, not backpackers. Any
            bat found on the ground is quite possibly suffering
            from rabies. Do not touch it. </dd>

    <dl>
        <dd>Jackals are the primary carriers of rabies in Africa.
            In Southeast Asia and India dogs are the leading
            vectors to humans. Note, however, that any mammal
            bite may transmit rabies. </dd>

    <dl>
        <dd>Ireland, Britain, Norway, Sweden, Japan, Australia,

    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Symptoms of rabies begin from nine days to many
            months after exposure. They include fever,
            hyperactivity, seizures, and often an intense thirst
            that cannot be quenched since liquids produce violent
            and painful spasms in the throat (hence
            &quot;hydrophobia&quot;). The victim will die within
            three to twenty days from onset of symptoms. </dd>

        <dd>Prevention and treatment<em> </em>is through passive
            immunization before the symptoms appear, and ideally
            within two days of exposure. Competent medical advice
            should be immediately sought after a bite in a rabies
            endemic country. (Not the local snake doctor.) Clean
            the wound thoroughly with soap and clean water for at
            least five minutes, but don't stitch it closed. The
            sooner vaccination is begun, the better the
            prognosis. Today's vaccines are not so painful, and
            are no longer given through the stomach. </dd>

    <dl>
        <dd>Symptoms<em> </em>vary from none to serious. The
            first is usually an itchy rash where the parasite has
            burrowed through the skin. Weeks later flu-like
            symptoms may begin, including high fever, chills,
            muscle aches, and diarrhea. The symptoms may go away

            a single-celled parasite. Wilderness backpackers in
            the U.S. must treat all water, even from crystal
            clear, babbling brooks in Yosemite, due to the
            prevalence of this organism.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Giardia cysts (eggs) are spread from the feces of

    areas up to twenty percent of the population are carriers, as
    well as nearly all prostitutes. In Africa AIDS is spread
    primarily through heterosexual sex. The blood supply in
    Africa is likely to be poorly screened, if at all, so you

    their own hypodermic needles for emergencies. </p>
    <p>AIDS is also spreading rapidly in Asia, again primarily
    through heterosexual contact. Since the epidemic became
    widespread there only a few years ago, deaths from the
    disease are still rare. Thailand is the main foci, with a
    significant percentage of its prostitutes infected. In 1996
    over three million cases of HIV infection were estimated in

    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>The botfly is an ordinary-looking fly with unusual
            child-rearing habits. It captures a mosquito in
            flight and lays eggs on it. The mosquito is released,
            and when it subsequently bites a warm-blooded prey
            some of the eggs fall off and are hatched by the heat
            of the skin. These creatures then burrow into the
            skin (my sandal-clad foot) where they feed and grow
            just under the skin. After several months they reach
            maturity, painlessly squeeze out, and fall to the
            ground to continue their life cycle.</dd>

    <dl>
        <dd>Diagnosis<em> </em>is by a mosquito bite that doesn't
            go away. After several weeks it resembles a boil,
            except for a tiny hole in the center. If you look
            closely with a magnifying glass you will see
            something pushing to the surface every so often to
            breathe and expel waste. (Yes, the botfly larvae
            breathes through its butt.) As it feeds it
            occasionally delivers a sharp pain not unlike a hot
            needle stabbing into your flesh. Fortunately this
            lasts only a few seconds at a time.</dd>

        <dd>Treatment is simple, if you know how. You cannot just
            squeeze it out as the beefworm is ringed with
            barbaric barbs which tightly hold to your flesh. And
            since the beefworm produces its own antibiotic to
            prevent infection while it's alive and healthy, you
            don't want to rip it apart as an infection would
            likely develop. The traditional Mayan method is to
            pour tobacco juice into the hole, which kills the
            beefworm in about an hour. You can then easily
            squeeze it out.</dd>

<h2 align="center">How to Avoid <a name="insect">Insect</a> Bites
</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>The best way to avoid malaria and over one-hundred other
    mosquito and insect-borne diseases is to avoid being bitten
    in the first place. Since only some insects are disease
    carriers, you vastly reduce your chance of infection by
    limiting the number of bites. Furthermore, it may take more
    than one bite from a disease-carrying insect to transmit
    disease. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The first line of defense is long sleeves and pants. In
    jungle areas I am much more comfortable wearing loose-fitting
    cotton pants and a long-sleeved cotton shirt. They are plenty
    cool and dramatically reduce every kind of insect bite. Note
    that mosquitoes can slide their proboscises through a knit or
    too-thin shirt. Also light colors such as khaki are less
    attractive to mosquitoes. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The second mosquito defense is <strong>DEET</strong>
    (diethyl-meta-toluamide). This is a powerful (it melts some
    plastic) insect repellent recommended and used world-wide.
    While the FDA is currently investigating possible
    side-effects in children, it has stated the benefits of DEET
    far outweigh these side effects, which are likely to be
    minor. Indeed, not contracting malaria and other insect-borne
    diseases is priceless. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>DEET repellent should be applied following the
    manufacturer's instructions to all exposed skin. Do not apply
    it under clothing. Many travelers also apply DEET to sleeves,
    collars, socks, and cuffs to further discourage bugs. </p>

    consist of a 100% formulation for maximum effectiveness of up
    to eight or ten hours. 3M makes <em>Ultrathon</em>, a 33%

    DEET for a claimed effectiveness of up to twelve hours.
    Ultrathon is also absorbed less through the skin, thus making
    it safer than 100% DEET. The CDC recommends formulations from

<blockquote>
    <p>Mosquito netting is essential for sleeping in the tropics.
    It drapes around your bed or hammock from a hook or line
    strung above it. While many hotels in the tropics lack
    screens, they often have fans which produce enough breeze to
    prevent mosquitoes from landing. Unfortunately, you can count
    on electric power regularly going out. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mosquito netting with too-fine mesh can be stifling. On
    the other hand if the mesh is too coarse black flies and
    no-see-ums can penetrate. Spraying or soaking mosquito
    netting in permethrin dramatically increases effectiveness.
    Store the net in a plastic bag to keep the permethrin
    effective longer. Be certain there are no gaps or holes in
    the netting around you, and that no part of your body rests
    against it, as mosquitoes are seriously bloodthirsty. Make
    sure there are no mosquitoes already inside the netting. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Small mosquito head nets may also be useful. I used one
    while summer camping in Norway, where the mosquitoes were

    <p>Mosquito coils are spiral-shaped candles that repel
    mosquitoes and other bugs with the natural chemical

    screening. Cintronella is another natural repellent adequate
    for backyard use in the States, but it is not effective in
    serious biting insect areas where efficacy is vital. </p>

    <p>You won't believe how fast cuts, blisters, and other
    wounds can become infected in the tropics. Great care must be
    taken to thoroughly clean wounds, and to treat them with an
    antiseptic such as tincture of iodine. Iodine is good because
    it also kills viruses. Keep wounds covered with a clean
    bandage and check them now and then. Double-strength triple
    antibiotic ointments such as Neosporin are also helpful.<br>

<h3 align="center">Rashes</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>To combat itching from stings and plants in the tropics,
    be sure to have antihistamine pills and a tube of 1%
    hydrocortisone anti-itch cream. After two mysterious,
    expanding red rashes appeared on the back of my leg, you can
    bet I'll never again travel in itch country without serious
    anti-itch medication. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I believe I crushed a poisonous millipede between my calf
    and thigh. While I didn't feel anything, a companion noticed
    two small, elongated black spots which looked like burns. I
    should have immediately irrigated them with water and wiped
    them with alcohol to remove as much poison as possible.
    Instead I said &quot;Huh,&quot; and ignored the situation for
    two days. Gradually the poison expanded about three inches
    beyond the initial sites, creating two purple and red, <em>excruciatingly
    </em>(I chose this word over <em>tortourously </em>and <em>agonizingly</em>)

    <p>Plants and stings that cause nasty itching are a
    surprisingly effective and common defense. Take immediate
    action by washing the affected area with water, beer, or
    spit. Run water over it for ten minutes if possible. Then

    small packet of rehydration salts; and 144 condoms. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Additional medical items elsewhere in the pack are small
    folding scissors; one-a-day-type vitamins; duct tape; a small
    piece of Compeed or Moleskin in my wallet; and a four-ounce
    bottle of rubbing alcohol which I use for washing hands when
    soap and water is not convenient. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Before my next trip to the developing world my travel
    clinic will prescribe a combination of anti-malarial pills,
    another antibiotic, and possibly a sterile syringe and
    needle. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Outdoor shops and catalogers sell pre-assembled medical
    kits that range in price from $8 to over $100. They do not
    contain doctor-prescribed antibiotics or medicines. I've
    always assembled my own. See <a
    href="23TRAV~1.HTM#medkit" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/23travelinfo.htm#medkit"><em>Useful Information</em></a>
    for two companies that specialize in medical kits. <br>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you come down with an illness soon after returning from
    the developing world, be certain to inform your doctor of
    that fact. Many tropical diseases are very difficult to
    diagnose, and mimic the flu. You may need to see a tropical
    disease specialist. You may also want stool and blood tests
    to see if anything unusual is lurking about. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h2 align="center">Travelers' Tips </h2>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Make a notecard of your medical history and keep
        it in your wallet. Indicate whether you have any known
        food and drug allergies, and any known health conditions.
        Also your blood type, and any other instructions. Several
        companies, such as Medic-Alert, make bracelets and chains
        which also contain this information.</em> <strong>Aida,
        R.N., Brooklyn, NY </strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Beware of salads, especially lettuce, in
        developing countries with suspect water supplies. The
        simple rule is if you can't wash it, peel it, or boil it,
        don't eat it.</em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Lisa
