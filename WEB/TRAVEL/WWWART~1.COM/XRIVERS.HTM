<blockquote>
    <p>If this river was flowing I would be instantly swept away
    to a stupid death and my lunch would be all wet. Fortunately
    for the moment there is only a slight upriver current since
    I'm crossing at high tide where it runs into the sea. I've
    also just observed several natives cross ahead of me. While
    they assured me it was safe, I wasn't entirely convinced. The
    tide could have reversed at any moment, and what is the
    meaning of &quot;safe&quot; to a villager surrounded by daily
    tragedy in a developing country?</p>
    <p>Never underestimate the power of water. Unfortunately,
    unless you've been in a current it's a good bet you will
    severely underestimate the effect of flowing water on the
    surface area of a body, and overestimate your strength as a
    swimmer. Never cross a river or stream with your pack buckled
    on.</p>
    <p>My brother and I used to canoe the Guadeloupe river in
    Texas. On one of our last runs the river was higher than we
    were accustomed, but since we knew our skills topped-out at
    intermediate jackass, we made several intelligent
    decisions--after debate--to portage a few of the rapids and
    falls that looked beyond our skills. </p>
    <p>It's hard to portage. The canoe and gear weigh seventy
    pounds or more, it's awkward, hard work, and it takes a lot
    of time. The easy, jackass thing to do is to barrel on
    through and hope for the best. (We've all done some of that.)
    While we scouted we observed others testing their fates. Most
    would spill, as we predicted we would, but none were sucked
    into hydraulic currents, as we predicted we might.</p>
    <p>One young couple barreled on through a fork we had
    rejected as much too dangerous for us. They instantly slammed
    into a tree, the young woman in front was thrown head first
    into the same tree, bloodying her nose. Canoe, gear, and
    boyfriend were swept downstream.</p>
    <p>My brother and I were eventually able to assist them, but
    it could have been a disastrous situation. They thought a
    three or four mile per hour current through a closely spaced
    series of obstacles was not a big deal. They had no idea
    whatsoever of the power of flowing water. Not twenty feet
    away was an abandoned canoe wrapped around a tree.</p>
    <p>And it's true, to an inexperienced person it may not have
    looked like much. But from our perspective they had seated
    themselves in a go-cart without seatbelts and rammed
    themselves into a brick wall at full throttle. Everything
    happened so fast they never even had a chance to attempt to
    maneuver. Their entire whitewater experience was limited to
    the hour or so it took to get to this first minor rapid. They
    were naively thinking, like it is so easy and common to do,
    that things would just take care of themselves.</p>
    <p>About this time a lone woman arrived on the scene. She
    scouted, chose the safer route, and expertly negotiated it by
    standing up to somehow better balance her canoe. This was an
    advanced maneuver my brother and I had never seen or heard of
    before. Soon she was out of sight, and for the rest of our
    run we considered her a Goddess with perhaps thousands of
    hours of whitewater experience. We both wanted to be her
    close friend.</p>
    <p>As we approached the take-out point we observed a
    commotion at a low-water bridge just beyond. There were
    several signs warning that everyone must take-out here, and
    that the bridge ahead was extremely dangerous.</p>
    <p>We took-out and went to the bridge, where to our great
    surprise we learned the Goddess had missed or ignored the
    take-out point, had spilled, and her canoe had pinned her
    against the low-water bridge. It was her incredible luck that
    her head had remained just above the water. It had taken five
    or six people struggling with all their might, and not
    without danger to themselves, to free her.</p>

        <dt><strong>Portage</strong></dt>
        <dd>The difficult but necessary act of carrying a canoe
            around a potentially deadly obstacle in the river. If
            one member of the party is significantly stronger
            than the other, place heavier gear near his or her
            end.</dd>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
        <dt><strong>Hydraulic current</strong></dt>
        <dd>When water flows over an obstacle or fall, it
            accelerates and creates a partial flow back towards
            the obstacle or fall. Small ones can be fun to sit in
            or ride on in a canoe, but powerful ones kill as they
            spin you around and around forever. Don't try to
            fight a hydraulic current, but dive down near the
            river bottom and ride the outward current down there.<br>
