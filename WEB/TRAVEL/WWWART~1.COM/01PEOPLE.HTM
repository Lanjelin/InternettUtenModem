<blockquote>
    <p>The great reward of backpacking independently on a low
    budget is the people you meet. Because all roads have not
    been smoothed before you, because your feathers are likely to
    be ruffled when things don't turn out exactly as expected,
    and because you are likely to be left in somewhat of a lurch
    now and then, you are going to have far greater opportunity
    to mix with local people, as well as other backpackers from
    all over the world, than any tour group or first-class
    traveler. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Those travelers who fork over the big bucks for high-class
    or guided travel get absolute peace-of-mind in return. They
    are guaranteed no worries, no hassles, an experience as close
    as possible to being home, without being home. They get an
    hour and fifteen minutes for the guaranteed-to-be-open
    museum, and then a two-hour sightseeing ride that catches all
    the picture-postcard highlights. Then a break for lunch at a
    &quot;recommended&quot; restaurant, where the food is
    reasonable and ordering is easy. And as the next bus pulls in
    they reboard theirs to start the routine again, ending with a
    no-hassle check-in at a pretty good hotel, populated with
    plenty of other tourists, pretty much like themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I don't want to knock that kind of travel, because all
    travel is good for the human spirit. But budget backpacker
    travel is unparalleled for meeting people and experiencing
    worlds on their own intimate terms. There are many travelers
    who have enough money to go pampered-class but choose to
    strap on a backpack and see the world via the
    seat-of-their-pants, because they know it's the best way to
    experience cultures and interact with local people.</p>
    <p>The best travel is not about seeing a list of monuments,
    museums, and landscapes. The best travel is about people, and
    if you travel well it is people that you are going to
    remember most. People that are strange, unique, foreign,
    similar, friendly, nice, hospitable, loving, kind, rude,
    outrageous, and normal. These will be the memories and
    experiences that stay with you forever, that no postcard can
    ever reproduce. </p>

Traveling Alone</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many people are nervous about traveling alone. They have
    the idea that overseas travel is just too daunting to be
    tackled by themselves. For many of us, however, if we don't
    travel alone, we aren't going to travel. It's difficult for
    most people to find a travel partner who is not only
    compatible, but also has the same time, money, and goals.
    Fortunately, most travelers will find themselves constantly
    meeting other solo travelers, many of whom will also be
    looking for companionship, to exchange information, or to
    have a few beers. By no means is traveling alone the same as
    traveling lonely.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course, the solo traveler will likely be alone some or
    much of the time. This can be a good thing, however, since a
    companion might insulate you too much from the local culture
    or other travelers, and the whole point of travel (I think)
    is meeting strange new people. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, there is no better or faster way to learn
    about yourself than by traveling by yourself. Goethe said he
    traveled not for pleasure, but rather to achieve his full
    development as a man by the time he was forty. And one
    venerable Swedish doctor, waxing almost mystical, said he
    didn't feel he was really traveling unless he was doing so
    alone.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Traveling With Someone </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Traveling with someone demands you know yourself <i>and </i>your
    partner. It is often said there would be less divorce if
    couples traveled together for a few months before getting
    married. As with marriage, if you only think of your travel
    partner in terms of honeymoon rather than alliance, you are
    in for a sad shock. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Traveling with someone is an intense experience. Rarely in
    normal life do people spend so much time together, and make
    so many decisions, often based on little information. Picking
    restaurants, taking buses, choosing museums, finding
    accommodation--all can cause great stress among couples. As a
    friend wrote to me, <i>&quot;Finding out you are hopelessly,
    completely, absolutely incompatible in a tent at 8000 feet
    and it's thirty-two degrees outside is not a good
    situation.&quot; </i></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Just because someone is a good friend does not mean he
    would automatically be a good travel partner. Traveling with
    someone with whom goals, money, and even personal habits have
    not been fully discussed can be a relationship-destroyer and
    trip-ruiner. Get everything in the open before you commit
    yourself to <i>a backpacking trip to hell.</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The three basic categories of travel friction are: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <ol>
            <li>One has an hourly itinerary, the other doesn't
                own a watch. </li>
            <li>One prefers first-class, the other prefers the
                back of the bus. </li>
            <li>One's makeup case is heavier than the other's
                backpack. </li>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Do not underestimate profound differences such as these. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you and your travel partner are not quite perfectly
    meshing, try taking turns being the chief decision-maker. The
    first day one chooses the restaurants and museums; the next
    day the other. (Me Chief today, you Chief tomorrow.) Also
    give each other time to explore alone, perhaps meeting for
    dinner, or next week in Paris. </p>
    <p>But always have a standard plan for getting in touch if
    the original rendezvous fails, such as three or twenty-four
    later at the same place.</p>
    <p>You both must understand a good travel relationship
    requires compromise on both sides to achieve a greater whole.
    Whining and nagging is usually the result of one partner
    feeling like he or she is not being treated fairly. Listening<i>
    </i>is the most important--yet most abused--skill between
    people. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">How to Meet People </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Simply by being an independent backpacker traveler you
    will meet many people from all walks of life. As a group
    passenger/tourist you would be lucky to exchange more than a
    few pleasantries with other group passenger/tourists. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course the cardinal rule is you must reach out. This
    can be as simple as smiling, saying &quot;Hello!&quot; and
    taking an interest. Some people will respond, and some won't,
    but if they don't you shouldn't take it personally. We all
    have our humbling moments.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Before you hit the road contact your relatives and friends
    to get addresses where you are traveling. These might be of
    business people, exchange students, or relatives in &quot;the
    old country.&quot; Then write an honest letter and hope for
    an invitation for a few days. They would probably get a
    contact high from you having so much fun. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>One backpacker went to Europe in 1992 with $4000 and
    half-a-dozen addresses. He parlayed that into ten months, and
    paid for only two nights accommodation. He was invited to a
    number of parties, and had one of the best experiences of any
    backpacker I know. Of course he is a gifted traveler and
    communicator, but you probably have some talent, also. </p>

    oversaturated with 60's and 70's American radio hits--but
    don't let that stop you.) If your art is making discordant

Tourists, Travelers, and Local Culture</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travel theorist Stanley Plogg placed the personalities of
    tourists and travelers along a broad scale. On one end are
    people who want their travel experience to be as &quot;like
    home&quot; as possible. They want to take it easy and not be
    faced with stressful situations and decision-making. They
    want everything to &quot;go right.&quot; These are frequently
    (but not always) the people found at posh resorts, or on
    group tours. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>On the other end are those travelers who enjoy new
    situations, dig deeply into local culture, and travel as if
    they were a native of the land. They find lodging where the
    locals sleep, eat where the locals dine, and ride their
    transportation. They may hitch rides to get from place to
    place, not only as a means of saving money, but as a way to
    meet local people. Most of these travelers are backpackers. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These most-adventurous travelers prefer travel
    destinations which are not yet developed for the mass tourist
    trade. They often lament about an area becoming developed and
    losing its charm. They then push out to new, virgin areas,
    and unintentionally begin laying the groundwork for future
    tourist expansion. (Of course, most backpackers fall
    somewhere in the middle of the scale.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As an area develops for the tourist trade relations
    between locals and travelers become more formalized. Locals
    become accustomed to foreigners, now seeing them as either a
    source of income, or as a nuisance. No longer are they
    interesting new friends from far away. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travelers and the travel industry may both benefit and
    harm a local economy and culture. Locals may gain from jobs,
    taxes, and contact with other cultures. But severe
    disruptions also occur. Crime may increase as crooks
    congregate to prey on rich visitors. The tourist area may
    have a dramatic rise in population as villagers from other
    parts of the country flock there to get jobs, which may or
    may not be available. Sanitation and medical facilities may
    become overwhelmed, and housing may become a short commodity,
    with land prices becoming unaffordable for the local
    population. One example: few native Hawaiians now own any
    part of Hawaii.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When tourist culture meets local culture, a clash is
    inevitable. Locals may decide their own products and way of
    life are no longer desirable. In the 1960's there was a
    popular campaign in Europe to donate used clothing to
    &quot;those poor, naked Africans.&quot; It had such appeal
    many kind-hearted souls donated new clothes. Unfortunately,
    the organizers failed to understand Africans had been
    beautifully dressing themselves, as necessary, for thousands
    of years. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Consequently, as Western clothing poured into Africa and
    came to market (which is the natural outcome of such a
    program), prices were driven far below their normal cost.
    Africans eagerly snatched up the bargain Western styles they
    had seen or heard about. Many local clothing makers--pillars
    of the African economy--were driven out of business as their
    hand-made products were now perceived as inferior. Africans
    became more reliant on imports, further weakening their
    economy, further increasing unemployment. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>That said, tourism as an instigator of culture clash is a
    distant second to the ultrapowerful electrons of television.
    Furthermore, both are only going to increase as the Earth
    truly becomes a global village over the next century. And in
    the case of television, with satellites, HDTV, fiber optics,
    and computerization--exponentially increase until world
    culture eventually becomes one gigantic, insipid bowl of
    Campbell's soup. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>So get out while the traveling is still good!</p>

        <h3 align="center">The Art of Gift-Giving </h3>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Gift-giving is an often overlooked aspect of traveling.
    Backpackers in the developing world, and hitchhikers
    everywhere, are likely to meet a number of local people who
    show great kindness by giving you a lift, buying you coffee
    or lunch, or even putting you up for the night. People are
    very appreciative if you can give a little something in
    return. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When I'm hitchhiking I like to offer to buy coffee or
    drinks. Even though I'm a low-budget traveler I have money,
    and I can think of no better way to spend it than on someone
    doing me a good turn. The money doesn't matter; the gesture
    does. But the gift I usually give is a postcard of my
    hometown or state. On my last tour of Europe I gave away
    about fifty postcards featuring various Texas themes. They
    were a big hit. People really like little mementos they can
    show to their children or friends as they say, &quot;Guess
    who I met today?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Other gift ideas are key chains, bookmarks, imprinted
    pens, photographs, and Kennedy half-dollar coins. Always
    available gifts include smiles, fun, laughter, jokes,
    sharing, recognition, and appreciation. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In some cultures gift-giving is serious business. Japanese
    fully expect small but good gifts from invited guests, and
    they will probably give you one as well. Many indigenous
    peoples expect to receive something from visitors they have
    been kind to. Of course, most of the modern world no longer
    expects gifts from travelers. (The Japanese may stomp around
    after you leave, but there won't be any hari kari.)
    Indigenous peoples, however, may be offended if an honored
    guest does not leave a small token of appreciation.
    Gift-giving is as natural for them as the moon rising.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For example, when taking leave of your new Tarahumara
    Indian friends who have invited you into their hut for
    tortillas and a gourdful of homemade corn beer (which will
    later ignite an epic intestinal war, but that's another
    story), it would be greatly appreciated if you could reach
    into your pocket and pull out a small item like a butane
    lighter, a pen, or a postcard. You can then tell your host
    how much you have appreciated his hospitality, and that while
    you don't have much, you would like to leave a little
    something. When he later talks about your visit with friends
    he can pull out the lighter or pen to show. Neighbors may
    come over to see the fantastic scene on a postcard. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Saving Face</h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In many cultures the concept of honor, or saving face, is
    carried to an extreme far beyond what we are accustomed in
    the western world. The most common example affecting the
    traveler is when the traveler asks someone on the street if
    this is the way to &quot;Timbuktu,&quot; and the person
    answers &quot;yes,&quot; even though he has never heard of
    &quot;Timbuktu&quot; and has no idea where it is. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since not knowing the answer would cause him to lose face,
    he perhaps sends the traveler in the wrong direction. In some
    instances when a member of such a society &quot;loses
    face,&quot; the society will shun or lower the status of that
    person. It is not primarily that their egos are so fragile
    they cannot say they don't know, or back down from something,
    but that their culture <i>dictates </i>they do not. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As a practical matter the traveler can ask, &quot;How do I
    get to Timbuktu?&quot; as opposed to, &quot;Is this the way
    to Timbuktu?&quot; Then he or she can confirm the directions
    by asking someone else along the way. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To resolve a disagreement, the traveler should provide a
    step for the local to move back to. This might be done with a
    compliment, or by giving-in on another point. The traveler
    should also strive to be gentle with local people, as our
    sometimes gruff or rude western manners--which we may
    interpret as honesty--can be a harsh affront to face in other
    cultures. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While face is rarely a problem for the traveler, a Chinese
    proverb illustrates its importance: &quot;<i>As a tree lives
    for its bark, a human being lives for his face.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </i></p>
    <h3 align="center">Work</h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some travelers earn their lodging at certain hostels and
    backpacker hotels by volunteering a couple of hours of
    cleaning, painting, fixing, cooking, serving, etc. per day.
    This is also a great way to meet people. If you are under
    twenty-seven you also may be able to get a student work visa
    for six months or a year in some developed countries. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Regardless of &quot;the law&quot; there is work for the
    persistent traveler in high-turnover jobs in bars and
    restaurants, teaching English, and in fields picking. Ask
    everyone you meet for leads. Make sure the hostel managers
    know you are looking for work. Employers sometimes call them
    when they need casual labor. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I've landed two short-term jobs this way: one picking
    apples, the other packing boxes in a video factory. Also
    check noticeboards at hostels and universities. Any kind of
    work gets you settled into a place, and makes you something
    of a temporary citizen. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Work Your Way Around the World </i>by Susan Griffith is
    the bible for finding work overseas. It contains over 400
    pages of concrete information, as well as anecdotes by
    travelers. The Council on International Educational
    Exchange's <i>Work, Study, and Travel Abroad: The Whole World
    Handbook </i>is another good tool for finding work, both paid
    and volunteer. CIEE also publishes <i>Volunteer! The
    Comprehensive Guide to Voluntary Service in the U.S. and
    Abroad</i>. See the <a href="25BIBLIO.HTM" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/25biblio.htm">bibliography</a>
    for details. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Do not make the mistake of dismissing the value of
    volunteer work in other countries. I've met quite a few
    backpackers whose volunteer work--such as building huts in
    Fiji, working on small farms in New Zealand, and directing

    <h4 align="center">Teaching English as a Foreign Language </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The TEFL (pronounced &quot;teffle&quot;) is a certificate
    stating you have been trained to teach English. It originated
    in Britain after WW2. TESOL--Teaching English to Speakers of
    Other Languages, is a newer U.S. professional organization.
    Certification from either is not absolutely necessary, but
    more necessary if you don't have a degree, or want to teach
    in Western Europe where high standards are expected. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Call the language department at your local university to
    find who is giving the course. Courses are often advertised
    in college newspapers. Some programs are long and expensive,
    others are only a few evening sessions and relatively cheap.
    Since most English teaching is just conversation or following
    a workbook as provided by the school, I recommend taking the
    cheapest and shortest program, if not skipping it altogether.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course you should have the desire and ability to teach
    English well as your clients will be paying good money to
    learn from you, and in some cases they will be investing
    their hopes and dreams for a better life in learning English.
    On the other hand much English teaching in Japan is primarily
    <i>entertainment </i>for the after-work public. </p>
    <p>Demand and pay for English teachers is relatively great in
    Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In many cases decent
    clothing, a professional manner, enthusiasm, and <i>a sharp
    briefcase</i> are more important than a certificate. This is
    according to numerous conversations with
    &quot;tefflers,&quot; though finding work is never guaranteed
    anywhere. See the <a href="25BIBLIO.HTM" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/25biblio.htm">bibliography</a> for

    <h3 align="center">Europeans and Americans </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The American in Europe immediately senses Europeans are
    not quite like the folks back home. At their best they are
    among the finest peoples in the world, of course. But at
    their worst Europeans may seem cold, aloof, contemptuous, and
    overly-refined. Some Americans who encounter this develop a
    chip on their shoulders about America and Americans, while
    others try to Europeanize themselves with a sophisticated
    front. Neither is pleasant to see or be around. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Americans should have faith in themselves and their
    culture, and, to a point, be their natural selves. Stuart
    Miller's <i>Understanding Europeans </i>is an interesting
    discourse on the differences between European and American
    personalities and cultures. This American Tocqueville
    destroys many of the illusions Americans and Europeans have
    of each other. Miller maintains Europeans are the way they
    are due to their many centuries of rigid class structure, as
    well as the incredibly violent and hate-filled history of
    Europe. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>He holds that Americans are a most unusual people, and are
    the way we are due to the original Puritan ethic, which held
    that all people were simply friends before God. See the <a

Backpacker Subculture </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since the 1960's advent of cheap air travel budget
    travelers have mushroomed in number. Almost anywhere you go
    you are likely to meet brave travelers from all over the
    world who are more like yourself, more interesting to you,
    than most of your fellow countrymen back home. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Certain places around the world have become a haven for
    backpackers. This is where they come to meet, to talk, to
    drink, to romance other travelers, and to hide. Mostly they
    are there because the beer and accommodation is cheap, and
    the cultural and physical landscapes retain interesting
    flavors.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As you travel you will undoubtedly come across some of
    these places, stay there for awhile, and have a really good
    time with new friends. To you, the place will always be
    special, and the people you met there will stay in your heart
    for a long time. Bon voyage, traveler!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Natural Travelers </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>On my fourth backpacking tour I met a
    twenty-eight-year-old American backpacker from Wisconsin on
    his first trip into Mexico and Central America. In an evening
    of beer and revelry in the Coyocan section of Mexico City I
    learned something very important about travel. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>This long-haired and hippyish backpacker had an
    extraordinary sense of playfulness and fun, evident in his
    voice, manner, and movement. He was completely happy to be
    traveling. He had a profound sense of connectedness with his
    fellows on this small planet, and they immediately sensed it.
    He was not shy about talking the weather with shopkeepers,
    telling funny stories to kids, commenting to attractive
    women. Travel for him was like a dance; his partners were the
    many happy, friendly people of the world, and they were
    attracted to him by his good spirit. He was probably the most
    natural traveler I've met. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A few days after this encounter it hit me that people are
    only going to get out of travel what they put into it. If you
    perceive the world as a friendly, happy, hopeful place, and
    act accordingly, you are likely to have more interesting
    experiences than someone who carefully measures his distance
    from the world, and considers minding his own business a
    meaningful art.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Romantic Relationships</h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I recommend not getting serious with men or women from
    developing countries, as cultural and power differences are
    usually too great. You are likely to be unrealistically seen
    as manna from heaven. Individuals from the developed world,
    however, are fair and plentiful game. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is a simple fact that romance is a conscious or
    unconscious lure for many travelers. What could be more fun
    than meeting a new friend in an exciting place with similar
    interests in travel and exploration? </p>
    <p>Of course great care must be taken in this day of AIDS and
    other diseases. People are not always who they seem, and some
    visual and verbal clues which assist you in determining the
    character of your fellow countryperson may be absent with a
    foreigner. On the other hand Emily Dickinson assessed the
    world best, &quot;Oh the Earth was <i>made</i> for
    lovers.&quot; </p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Travel is not about getting from point A to point
        B. At best that's tourism--at worst
        transportation--across a more or less sterile landscape.
        Real travel is about soaking up the local flavor, getting
        a sense of other people's lives, and their history.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Never overlook the local people. They are always
        proud of their town, their county, their country, and
        their heritage. And every little town has a little
        something somewhere that's interesting, that you can only
        find through the local people. If you recognize them by
        being friendly and saying,&quot;Hello, I'm not from
        around here,&quot; you'll be surprised what you get back
        in return. They'll often bend over backward to help you,
        simply because you're not a typical Joe Blow tourist
        blowing through town. </i><b>Shaun H., Bandera, Texas</b>
