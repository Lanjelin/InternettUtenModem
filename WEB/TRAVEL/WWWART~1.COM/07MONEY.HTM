            one who is content to go as a comparatively poor
            man....it is not money which travel demands so much

            travel all the time.</em><strong> Frank Tatchell,

<blockquote>
    <p>The good news is it doesn't take much money to backpack
    anywhere around the world. I never thought I had enough to
    see Europe in a worthwhile way until one day in a bookstore I
    read that campgrounds abounded all over Europe. Many of these
    were smack in the middle of interesting cities I wanted to
    see, and only cost a few dollars per night. So I calculated
    if I fed myself from supermarkets and pastry shops I could do
    it for practically nothing. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>That first trip in 1990 lasted two and one-half months and
    cost $2300, including airfare to London and the return from
    Athens. I met dozens of people, some of whom I traveled with
    and got to know fairly well. I became a little serious about
    my French, and at one point was able to communicate in a
    foreign language for the first time in my life. I went to
    many of the greatest art and cultural museums in the world. I
    saw the City of Light. I wandered about the Acropolis. And as
    I stood outside Socrates' cell I thought to myself over and
    over, &quot;How can this be?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Good value? No, the greatest value. The next year I went
    on a five-month walking/hitchhiking tour of Europe for $3300,
    again including airfare both ways. I was a smarter traveler
    that time, met more people from all over, got to know them
    better, and had more fun. <img src="IMAGES/PRAGUE.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/prague.jpg"
    alt="I heard four or five of my all-time top twenty concerts within a few blocks of Prague's main square."
    align="left" hspace="6" vspace="5" width="293" height="196"></p>
    <p>I heard concerts by some of the world's greatest musicians
    in some of the world's most fantastic concert halls. I found
    my own piece of the Berlin Wall, and even traveled with a
    former communist party boss whose main course of study in his
    youth was &quot;The History of the Party.&quot; </p>
    <p>I've made six more trips since then, including an
    interesting month in Mexico for less than $400, and three
    months in Central America for $1000. (And I assure you living
    on 5 or $10 per day in Guatemala is rich in many ways.)</p>
    <p>One passing German, who seemed to be making a study,
    believed the average veteran backpacker traveler worldwide
    spends about $25 per day. I would agree. In most of the
    developing world 15 to $25 will get you a cheap hotel, at
    least one restaurant meal, and a few beers at the end of the
    day. Many careful backpackers also get by in Europe, North
    America, and Australia on $25 a day. </p>

    <font size="4"><em><strong>What are exchange rates? </strong></em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As I write a U.S. dollar is worth about five French
    francs, one and one-half German marks, one-hundred ten
    Japanese yen, 1500 Italian lira, and eight Mexican pesos. One
    British pound is worth U.S.$1.60. These rates vary as
    national economies vary. Because you get five francs for one
    dollar does not mean France is one-fifth as expensive as the
    U.S. Since France and the U.S. are both highly-developed
    economies, prices are roughly similar--what costs five francs
    in France costs about one dollar in the U.S. </p>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/CENSTAT.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/censtat.jpg" alt="Prague center"
    align="left" hspace="10" width="134" height="242">As exchange
    rates vary, however, things get dearer or cheaper. In the
    early 1980's the U.S. dollar became overvalued to eight
    francs per dollar. It was a record time for American tourism
    to France as France was &quot;on sale.&quot; But the U.S. was
    too pricey for French tourists, and our exports suffered.
    Gradually the U.S. dollar weakened to a more balanced level. <br>

    currency before I go, or wait until I get there?</strong></em><strong>
    </strong></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many guidebooks advise getting $50 or $100 of foreign
    currency for each country you plan to visit before you
    leaving your home country, so you won't be hassled at the
    airport or train station when you arrive. I have never
    bothered with that, and probably never will. Few backpackers
    do. Foreign currency is expensive when bought in the U.S.,
    and the trouble of buying it in advance almost always
    outweighs the trouble of buying it when you get there, which
    amounts to no trouble whatsoever ninety-five percent of the
    time. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Once in a great while I will buy some currency one country
    in advance if I think I will be arriving at an odd hour, but
    even then when I arrive I usually find I didn't need to, and
    that I got a rip-off rate of exchange where I was. As long as
    you have a few mighty greenbacks in your moneybelt for
    emergencies, you won't ever have much of a problem getting
    money exchanged.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Credit Cards and ATMs </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many travelers now use their credit and debit cards to
    complement or replace the old standby of travelers' checks.
    Most <em>upscale</em> restaurants, hotels, and shops now
    accept credit cards, with Visa far more accepted than
    American Express. Note, however, that most of the hotels,
    hostels, and cafes frequented by budget backpackers do not
    accept credit cards. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Also useful for the budget traveler are the tens of
    thousands of automatic teller machines which are linked
    around the world. My Cirrus system card currently works in
    sixty countries, including 10,000 machines in the U.K., 1000
    in France, 1400 in Austria, 3000 in Turkey, 300 in Israel,
    3600 in Mexico, 1800 in Australia, and 150 in Thailand. Note
    that 150 ATM's in Thailand means they are few and far
    between, especially when you consider the thousands of
    possibilities for cashing travelers' checks there. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Check with your financial institution before you go to
    determine system compatibility, and how much you can withdraw
    per day or week, etc. Note that some international ATMs won't
    accept personal identification numbers of more than four
    digits, so get a shorter PIN from your bank, if necessary.
    Also note that some international keypads have numerals
    only--no letters. Therefore you need to memorize your PIN by
    its numerals. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Besides convenience, the big advantage of using plastic is
    you get your funds converted at the wholesale exchange rate
    (what you see in the newspaper) rather than the retail rate
    (at banks or cambios de change), which is usually from two to
    ten percent not in your favor. Therefore you <em>could</em>
    save up to $10 on a $100 withdrawal as opposed to cashing a
    $100 travelers' check at a cambio de change with a bad rate.
    You will usually save $2 or $3. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Furthermore, with credit cards this exchange is not posted
    for up to a month after you make the transaction. Thus in a
    high-inflation country, or in one whose currency is losing
    ground to the dollar, you benefit by charging. An example is
    Yugoslavia in 1990 when a 500,000 dinar hotel bill ($50 in
    July) would cost you only $25 when posted in August, due to
    100% monthly inflation there.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You should carry at least some travelers' checks in case
    of loss or mishap. The magnetic tape on the back of credit
    and debit cards may wear out, rendering it unusable. And
    while you should be able to get the card replaced overseas, I
    would not want to wait while some Guatemalan or Turkish bank
    goes through their bureaucratic shenanigans. It took a friend
    ten days to get her credit card replaced in Guatemala, and
    also cost her $100 in phone calls. Your bank probably has a
    card-holder to protect that precious magnetic tape. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When making a credit card transaction overseas--but
    especially in developing countries--you should be extra
    careful of fraud. Keep the card in sight while they make the
    print. One trick is to run off several prints on your card,
    and then have you sign both with a carbon. Also be certain
    the card you get back is your own. While this happens rarely,
    it may be more common than in the U.S.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Travelers' Checks </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most countries have a &quot;best&quot; place to exchange
    travelers' checks. Check your guidebook. In enlightened
    countries like Norway you get the wholesale rate at the post
    office. In others banks, railway stations, or even cambios de
    change offer the best rates. American Express offices usually
    offer a decent rate, and a slightly better one for their own
    checks. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In some developing economies the problem with travelers'
    checks is not so much getting a good rate, but getting them
    cashed at all. In such areas it is a good idea to carry the
    brand that is most likely to be familiar to the clerk or
    bank--which is usually American Express. Worldwide offices of
    AMEX are a plus, and may hasten your check replacement.
    CitiBank and Visa traveler's checks are also good. Thomas
    Cook and Barclays' are popular British brands.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Wiring Money </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many people ask about wiring as a means to transfer funds
    while traveling. Wiring is not often used by backpackers due
    to its complexity and expense, but is something to know in an
    emergency. Wiring between advanced countries is not
    difficult, but it's not particularly easy, either. One friend
    who visited me in Texas transferred money from her account in
    Germany to my account here. To make the transaction she had
    to have an account here to transfer it to, the routing number
    of her bank in Germany, and she had to have an authorized
    person named on her account go to her bank and sign for the
    transaction. They wouldn't let her do it over the phone. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Her cost was only $10 for a $1000 transfer, but this
    varies greatly from bank to bank. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another friend called from Guatemala totally broke and
    with most of her gear in hawk. Guatemala Bell policy would
    not allow her to make a collect call to her family in Europe,
    but luckily they would to the U.S. On her own she had been
    struggling for a week with the biggest banks in Guatemala to
    get a transfer from Europe, without success. I called her
    father who finally got the money transferred. </p>
    <p>I also called Western Union in the U.S. to inquire about
    an emergency transfer to Guatemala, if needed. A $200 wire
    transfer cost $25, could be charged to a credit card, and
    would arrive in a few hours. </p>
    <p>One traveler with great experience in India and Sri Lanka
    summed up developing world wire transfers this way:
    &quot;Instantly everyone from the bank president on down
    knows there's a very interesting transfer of hard currency on
    the way, and soon after that several layers of intermediary
    banks and government bureaucracies know about it, and by then
    everyone in town knows about it, and they all <em>need</em>
    to try to sell you something or at least look you in the eye
    before they bring bring out their oh so important stamps of
    approval with a huge flourish.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Black Market Exchanges </h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some second and third world countries have their
    currencies pegged at artificially high exchange rates, or
    they prohibit their citizens from possessing over a certain
    amount of foreign currency. Thus there may be a legitimate
    reason for noninstitutional currency exchanges.
    Unfortunately, many black-marketers who are honest to the
    last penny with their regular local customers may try to
    cheat you, the &quot;rich tourist.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In Budapest I selected a moneychanger with slicked-back
    hair, flashy shoes, and a crisp polyester shirt--indeed the
    perfect shyster stereotype. He offered forints for dollars at
    about twenty percent over the official rate, which I thought
    was reasonable and just. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>While he pressed me to exchange $100 or more, I was
    willing to risk only $20. He counted the forints three or
    four times into my hand, flashing the money fancily. Each
    time he let me count and examine the bills on my own, then
    took them back and did it again. Somehow this shrunk my brain
    to the size of a pea. I fished out my $20 and exchanged it
    for his roll of forints, and then hurriedly walked away to
    avoid the police who were undoubtedly about to spring. Half a
    block later I was shocked to discover I had been hooked for
    $18. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The lesson is if you make a black market exchange, count
    your money and hang on to it. Also make sure the notes are
    not counterfeit, or that they are not a less valuable
    currency from a nearby country.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Baksheesh, Mordida, Payola, Dashing,
    Grease, and Tribute </h3>
    <p>Since traveling necessarily brings you into contact with
    the ever-present bureaucracy of travel, you may now and then
    be extorted for a few dollars by petty officials, usually in
    developing countries where they may be so poorly paid as to
    make it almost a requirement of the job. On the other hand I
    have seen such officials make out like bandits--shaking down
    a boatload of twenty travelers for a two dollar
    &quot;tranportation tax,&quot; each. </p>
    <p>Probably the best policy is never to pay any bribes, out
    of principle. But there may be times when you are tired, in a
    hurry, or desperate, and you need things expedited. Even in
    these cases do not offer money unless you are certain such is
    being hinted. You don't want to corrupt anyone unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <p>If you get in a situation where you think a small payment
    may help you in some way, <em>and</em> it appears the
    official is more-or-less playing for such a bribe, don't use
    a word such as &quot;bribe&quot; or &quot;mordida&quot; to
    describe the transaction. Instead, call it a &quot;tax&quot;
    or &quot;fee.&quot; You don't want to be clumsy in this
    delicate situation--you could end up paying more than you
    need, or waiting weeks for your visa or whatever. </p>
    <p>Indirect talk is the best way to get what you want in
    these situations. &quot;Is there a tax I could pay?&quot;
    &quot;Perhaps if I pay a smaller fee you could still find a
    way?&quot; Etc. </p>
    <p>Usually a few dollars is enough to get the wheels turning.
    If you are asked for more than you are willing to pay, or you
    refuse to pay anything, it's best to remain polite, perhaps
    pretending you don't understand, and act like you are in no
    hurry and are happy to sit and wait. </p>
    <p>During one driving tour of Mexico I was stopped at
    checkpoints by Federales approximately every 200 miles. About
    half the time or less I would be slightly pressed for
    &quot;contributions&quot; or &quot;tolls.&quot; I found it
    extremely helpful to forget most of my Spanish and lower my
    IQ. It's also a good idea to keep your license somewhere
    other than your wallet, and have a few small bills stashed in
    a pocket so you don't have to fish your main money supply.</p>
    <p>Over 2400 miles of driving I made two payments, one for $2
    and another consisting of $5 and two Negro Modellos (one of
    my favorite beers), and that in the dead of the night on a
    desolate road.</p>
    <p>Once in Guatemala I avoided paying a &quot;tax&quot; by
    asking for a receipt. A few minutes later he came back saying
    he had checked again, and I didn't have to pay after all. </p>
    <p>I doubt any of this will work for American backpackers
    trying to get seven-day transit visas across Iran.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Spending Money </h3>
    <p>Some budget travelers may become obsessed with always
    spending as little money as possible. This is especially true
    for those who have the time to travel as long as the money
    holds out. From my experience this is not the best attitude.
    It is worthwhile to splurge on cultural events, some kinds of
    tours, and the occasional good restaurant. The traveler is
    spending plenty of money to get wherever he or she is, but
    sometimes it costs a little more to get the most out of
    there. </p>
    <p>While I usually spend the money for any museums and
    cultural events that interest me, in my early travels I
    overlooked some terrific opportunities. On my first
    backpacking tour of France I never once splurged on a truly
    excellent restaurant meal. I was too caught-up in going as
    far as possible on as little as possible. Now I have to cope
    with the silly fact that while I spent all that time and
    money in France, I completely missed what many consider her
    essence--and it's not<em> </em>fresh baguettes. </p>
    <p>On the other hand spending as little money as possible <em>can</em>
    have a positive affect on your travels. You may find it
    enjoyable to sit in a town square for hours, making
    conversation and observing daily life, as opposed to going to
    a bar and getting drunk. (Which, with discretion, you can
    also do cheaper in the town square.) If you are not spending
    money on tours and admission fees, etc., you should have more
    time to talk to people, play with children, and pet dogs. </p>
    <p>Many backpackers spend more money at the beginning of
    their trip, moderate in the middle, and then taper-off to as
    little as humanly possible as the reality of going home looms
    colossal. </p>
    <p>As an experiment I went without money or food for three
    days in a Greek industrial city, except for water and two
    cucumbers I scrounged. It was a profoundly interesting
    experience (mostly characterized by thoughts of food), but I
    don't care to repeat it soon. </p>

    <h2 align="center"><font size="6">The Art of </font><a
    name="bargaining"><font size="6">Bargaining</font></a></h2>
    <p>One of the oldest and most basic human skills is
    bargaining, but many westerners have completely lost the art.
    </p>
    <p>To bargain successfully the single most important factor
    is the <em>apparent</em> ability to walk away from the deal.
    Everyone knows you are relatively rich and can afford an
    exorbitant price. Therefore you must look convincing when you
    reply to the pick-up truck driver who is asking $10 for a
    ten-mile ride--when the other passengers are paying only a
    few dollars--&quot;No, that's too much, I'll walk.&quot; </p>
    <p>Your bargaining power is severely eroded if you look
    dead-tired, if you have already loaded your pack into the
    back, or if your over-protected-daughter Danish companion is
    pleading with you to accept the price. </p>
    <p>There is absolutely no need to pay $10 for the ride. The
    driver is not going to drive off and leave money behind. That
    would be as foolish for him as you paying the first price he
    asks.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">Bargaining Tips </h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Take your time. You don't have to
        rush into anything, including the back of a truck, taxi,
        or airplane. Make inquiries to find the average price. If
        you can't spare the time to discover the true value and
        quality of something, do you really want it? </p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> You are bargaining from a position
        of strength if, and only if: <strong>a)</strong> You are
        willing to walk away, or <strong>b)</strong> You <em>look</em>
        like you're willing to walk away. </p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Offering a price half what the
        seller originally offers and working up from there is not
        always a good strategy. Some sellers quote items at ten
        times their true value. If you bargain to half or
        three-fourths of that--which many backpackers assume must
        be a reasonable price--you are still paying an outrageous
        mark-up. Such prices are often asked by hawkers who
        approach you on the street with beads or jewelry. They
        are looking for a sucker. </p>
        <p><strong>4</strong>. Unless you absolutely have to,
        don't trade away for unfavorable terms that which you
        think has more value. (For instance, this book.)</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Try not to take advantage of the
        poor Mayan who has been at her stand all day with few or
        no sales. Without knowing it you can easily drive down
        her price to cost or below--which she sadly agrees to
        because she needs the cash to buy food for her family
        that evening. Sometimes the best bargain is full-market
        price.</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Restrain goofy purchases until the
        end of your trip, or mail them home immediately. <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>How Not to Get
        Ripped-Off by Taxi Drivers </strong></font><br>
        <em>Or,<br>
        Hey, didn't we pass that mule twice already? </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Developed-world cities regulate the number of taxis on
    their streets so every driver will be assured a certain
    amount of business. In return every taxi is periodically
    inspected for safety, and must charge the same metered rate:
    about $1.50 or $2 to get in the cab; about $1.50 per mile;
    and &quot;wait time&quot; of about $12-$20 per hour, which
    kicks in when the cab is stationary or moving less than ten
    mph. (This compensates the driver if he gets stuck in
    traffic.) Thus a two or three mile trip costs about $5 in
    rich countries. </p>
    <p>In much of the developing world, however, there is little
    or no regulation of the taxi business. Anyone who has a car
    and a sign can become a taxi driver. It thus becomes
    dog-eat-dog for customers, with a bargaining system evolving
    that favors locals who know the score, and rips-off visitors.
    </p>
    <p>Of course the drivers do not consider it a rip-off. They
    are merely trying to strike a favorable bargain and make a
    living, albeit at your expense. And while this living is
    usually slightly better than an average wage in developing
    countries, it is still not much. In 1993 the drivers of
    Mexico City's ubiquitous green VW Beetles averaged about $25
    per twelve-hour shift, out of which came gas, maintenance,
    and vehicle depreciation. </p>
    <p>The key to successful bargaining is to ask the fare before
    getting in the cab. Once you sit down the driver knows he has
    you, and you're off for a ride. Open the front door or lean
    in the window to get a quote to your destination. If it seems
    too high (and it probably will), immediately say, &quot;No,
    that's too much,&quot; and make an appropriate counter-offer.
    Note that a $10 fare in developing countries is something
    that doesn't happen every day for every driver. Most short
    trips around downtown should probably cost no more than $2 or
    $3. </p>
    <p>Even if you bargain well you will probably not get as good
    a rate as the locals. The driver knows you can afford more,
    so he will set his absolute bottom rate a bit higher. </p>
    <p>If at the end of your cab ride the driver demands a
    ridiculously large payment, know that he is trying to extort
    money from you. Put a fair amount on the seat and get out.<br>

    <h2 align="center"><font size="6">How to Deal With Begging </font></h2>
    <p>The traveler in the developing world is likely to
    encounter some kind of begging almost every day. Dealing with
    it is a difficult issue for many travelers, including myself.
    </p>
    <p>Most developing nations do not have a social welfare
    system to care for the old, the sick, and the infirm. Mexico,
    for example, has an official unemployment rate of only a few
    percent. This is because in Mexico if you don't work, you
    don't eat. Indeed Mexican bus and train stations are swarming
    with children and old people desperate to sell you candy,
    drinks, gum, and so forth. I have returned to the same
    station after several weeks and seen the same people walking
    up and down the aisles, feverishly hawking their gum and
    candy. </p>
    <p>Once I was in a small shop studying a map when an old man
    came up to me and said something so quietly I couldn't quite
    make it out. I looked up briefly and said &quot;Buenos
    dias,&quot; and went back to my map. Then, probably mustering
    all his strength, he pointed to his mouth and said
    &quot;Tortillas!&quot; When I took a good look at him I
    realized he was so old and infirm a gust of wind might have
    blown him over. </p>
    <p>Culture is another aspect of begging. My first encounter
    with this was when I made a generous contribution to a small
    Turkish girl who had been pestering me for several minutes
    for &quot;eine marka.&quot; (As is often the case, she
    thought I was German.) I finally broke down and gave her from
    my pocket what I thought was a small coin. She looked at it
    with astonishment and proclaimed &quot;Fir (five)
    markas!&quot; The word was out and within seconds I was
    surrounded by a dozen very persistent children, and even a
    few mothers, all badgering with outthrust palms for large
    amounts of money. </p>
    <p>While I did not feel threatened by this group, it was a
    completely untenable situation and I had to beat a hasty
    retreat. They may have thought I was intent on redistributing
    some of my wealth, which is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
    Or, more likely, they saw me as an idiot who had bumbled into
    town, and they were simply taking advantage of a lucky
    situation. </p>
    <p>Many travelers feel they are victimized by swarms of
    beggars who see a &quot;rich&quot; Westerner. They feel it is
    not their responsibility to take care of the indigent of a
    foreign country. They may say this is a problem for the local
    government and people, and they have no idea who to give
    money to, anyway. They may also say giving to beggars
    encourages the concept of getting money for not working. </p>
    <p>My own eyes have mostly seen seriously indigent people who
    get most of their donations from local people, but who
    naturally swarm to Westerners when they see one. I don't give
    money to every beggar, not even most. Most of the time I try
    to ignore them. It's easier. But now and then, perhaps a few
    times per week, I do make a small donation to someone who
    particularly tears at my heart, who usually has some kind of
    obvious physical handicap. </p>
    <p>Probably such donations would be better spent at relief
    organizations, but I cannot help but think at least this
    person will have a little more to eat that night. </p>
    <p>Child beggars are another issue. For many developing-world
    children begging money, candy, or pens from travelers is
    prime sport--and one which, from their point of view, nets
    them obscenely generous rewards. If their father has to work
    hard all day to earn a few dollars, and a backpacker has just
    given each of his kids enough money to buy a huge bag of
    candy, something, in the long run, may go wrong. </p>
    <p>I now make my best effort not to give money, candy, or
    pens to children. Instead I usually give them a surprised,
    indignant, or quizzical look, like &quot;Why should I give
    you money?&quot; &quot;Because you are rich!&quot; they
    shout. &quot;I save my money. I don't give it away,&quot; I
    reply.</p>
    <p>They may not like this attitude, and they may throw a few
    stones as you trudge over the hill, but it's about equally
    likely they would have thrown stones anyway, and they will
    probably respect you more for not being a fool with your
    money. </p>
    <p>I do, however, sometimes give small rewards to children
    who perform a service, usually by acting as a guide to
    somewhere (which usually turns out to be pretty darn nearby).
    I select one or two as my &quot;official&quot; guides, and
    let them know right away I am only paying a tiny amount.
    Usually I don't really need their help, but their company is
    pleasant, and they save me the trouble of looking at a map or
    guidebook. And they are earning the money. Payment in local
    currency equivalent to a bottle of Coke is generous for a few
    minutes work.<br>
