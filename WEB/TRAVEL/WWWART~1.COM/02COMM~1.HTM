<h2 align="center">Verbal and Nonverbal Communication<br>
<br>
<br>
</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">H</font>aving learned only a bit of French
    in school, in most of the countries I have traveled there has
    been a language gap between me and the natives. Fortunately
    for travelers and the human race, <i>thought is independent
    of language.</i><sup> </sup><a
    href="02COMM~1.HTM#notes" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/02communication.htm#notes" name="1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    Therefore the shared experience of being human allows us to
    communicate many basic aspects of being human. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Indeed it is not only possible but relatively easy to
    navigate other countries with little or no command of the
    local language. Furthermore, English is the international
    language. Around the world when an Italian meets a Dane they
    usually communicate in English as it is probably the language
    they both speak best. In Asia, with over twenty major
    languages, English is used for business, tourism, air-traffic
    control, etc. English is also the lingua-franca for many
    African countries. Thus we monolingual Americans have
    lucked-out. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Because we Americans come from a huge country where
    English is spoken from one end to the other, we often have
    more fear than other nationalities about not being able to
    communicate. Most countries are far smaller than ours, and
    their people are more comfortable traveling in places where
    they don't speak the native language. They are also more
    adapted to dealing with visitors who don't speak their
    language. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Few travel backpackers in Poland (and there are many)
    speak any Polish; few in Hungary speak the unusual language
    of Hungarian; and in Tanzania not more than one backpacker in
    twenty before arrival knows much more than one word of
    Swahili. (Which would probably be &quot;Jambo,&quot; which
    passes for &quot;hello,&quot; &quot;goodbye,&quot; &quot;good
    day,&quot; and &quot;Yes, I will have some chicken soup,
    thank you.&quot;) So don't let a perceived lack of language
    skills be a barrier to international travel. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">English in Europe</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>English is widely known in much of Europe. Indeed many
    Europeans have at least some facility with many languages.
    The first Belgian truck driver I met spoke no fewer than five
    languages well. (I later discovered this was about average
    for Belgian truck drivers.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>But that doesn't mean you should immediately begin
    babbling in English when you first approach someone. First
    politely ask their pardon, and then humbly ask if they speak
    English, preferably in their language. Since it is likely you
    often won't know more than one or two words of the native
    tongue, you'll get plenty of practice with the
    &quot;humbly&quot; part. As one hilarious German shot back to
    my query, &quot;While <i>you</i> were sitting in the back of
    finger-painting class shooting spitballs, <i>I</i> was
    learning Italian, Spanish, French, and yes, a little
    English!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>We should also be aware that when someone speaks English
    she is not speaking an American language. English is a world
    language we are fortunate to speak. If you comment that she
    has a funny accent, she could rightfully retort it is your
    accent that is funny. You will meet many non-native English
    speakers who have &quot;funny accents,&quot; but also have
    better English vocabularies than many Americans.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <h4><i>How will I know what people are saying to me?</i></h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The absolute, indisputable fact is if you just nod your
    head, smile, and seem agreeable everything will sail along
    just fine about ninety percent of the time. When making
    simple, not-too-important everyday transactions with
    non-English-speaking clerks and waiters--and you just want to
    expedite the matter--you can usually just nod and agree
    pleasantly with whatever they are saying. Most of the time
    you have already effectively communicated what you want just
    by physically being wherever you are. They are probably just
    making a pleasantry, or some finer point like &quot;Where
    would you like to sit?&quot; &quot;I have relatives in
    Chicago!&quot; or, &quot;Will Pepsi be okay?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If their expression changes and it sounds like they are
    asking the same question again, try a shake of the head along
    with a shrug, opening up the hands to simultaneously say
    &quot;no&quot; and &quot;I haven't a clue what you're
    saying.&quot; A competent clerk or waiter will pick the
    appropriate response and carry on from there.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The other technique is to politely ask if they speak
    English. All travelers, including Germans, Italians,
    Japanese, and even French do this. They will say &quot;Yes, a
    little,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; or they will find someone who
    can. Eventually<i> </i>the problem is solved or it just goes
    away. (I offer my presence once again in the USA as proof.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These techniques lead to an occasional surprise, but
    usually on the level of &quot;beef&quot; or
    &quot;chicken.&quot; Most travelers soon learn not to be too
    picky. (As long as it's not liver or monkey brains I'll eat
    it.)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Gorilla English</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Communicating with someone who speaks only a little or an
    unknown amount of English can be tricky. People who say they
    don't speak English may actually know a few or many words.
    Keep your sentences simple, make your pronunciation clear,
    and speak slowly. Experienced travelers do this routinely. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes it is a good idea to give your English a local
    inflection. In Poland I once had to say &quot;Coke&quot; and
    &quot;Coca-cola&quot; ten times before I hit on the right
    sound combination for a baffled young waitress. Asians have
    their own special pronunciation of English that is fun and
    sometimes helpful to mimic. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Try not to use nonstandard American idioms. &quot;Hey
    dude, can you possibly clue me in where the restroom
    is?&quot; will not be easily understood. A simple
    &quot;Toilet?&quot; and a quizzical look will get better
    results. You don't need to go into a big production to
    communicate simple things. Indeed too much verbalizing often
    leads to unnecessary confusion. Again, an incredible amount
    of communication is understood without spoken language. We
    are all human beings, after all. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Language Books and Learn-A-Language Systems </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/LANGDICT.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/langdict.jpg"
    alt="English-Norwegian Norwegian-English dictionary"
    align="right" hspace="6" vspace="2" width="120" height="152">If
    I'm staying in a country for more than about a week, one of
    the first things I do when I arrive is to shop bookstores for
    an English-That Language/That Language-English pocket
    dictionary with, if possible, verb conjugations. They are
    always a popular item, and cost just a few dollars. </p>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/SWAHILI.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/swahili.jpg"
    alt="Berlitz Swahili phraze book." align="left" hspace="8"
    vspace="2" width="120" height="169">Phrase books, such as the
    multi-language Berlitz or Lonely Planet European phrase
    books, are useful, but best if used in conjunction with a
    dictionary. If I could have only one, I would choose a
    dictionary due to its greater flexibility when used with the
    following language sheet system. </p>
    <p>I tried an electronic translator, but keying in the words
    was ponderous, it wasn't nearly as useful as a book, and it
    made me feel extra-ridiculous.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">The Amazing Gregory Communication
Sheet/Dictionary System </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>To begin write on a single 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of paper
    the fifty basic travel words below, with their translations
    and pronunciations in the languages you need, one sheet per
    language. A single sheet places everything you know in that
    language in front of you. This system works best when used
    with a pocket-sized English/That Language--That
    Language/English dictionary. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Try to learn a few new words of the local language every
    day. Write them on your sheet and keep it in a pocket. Pull
    it out when trying to communicate with someone, perhaps
    showing them the word you are trying to pronounce. You may be
    surprised at the generous language lessons you receive. Let
    them write on if they want to. It makes a nice momento, and
    you can always make another if they get carried away.</p>

    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Guatemalan Spanish Language Schools </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>I highly recommend attending Spanish language schools in
    Guatemala. For $75 to $150 per week you get four to seven
    hours per day of one-on-one instruction, <i>and</i> room and
    board with a local family. Living with them you eat mostly
    eggs and beans, and get an authentic feel for Guatemalan
    life. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In two to four weeks you can acquire a working knowledge
    of Spanish, get much more from your future Latin travels, and
    even improve your job prospects back home. It's probably
    better if you don't make reservations in advance, but just
    show up as there are hundreds of schools competitive for your
    business. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><img src="IMAGES/FESTIVAL.JPG" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/festival.jpg"
    alt="High mountain festival" align="right" hspace="0"
    width="287" height="223">Every week you could go to a
    different school in a different city. I know of at least one
    school in a colorful, isolated, highland village. The former
    colonial capital Antigua is a beautiful, fun, and safe place
    to begin. In summer it's loaded with gringos and gringas.
    There you can also get decent private rooms for a few dollars
    per night. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Ecuador and Peru also have inexpensive Spanish language
    schools popular with backpackers. </p>
    <p>The best way to prepare is to study conjugations from a
    verb dictionary. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Politesse </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Politesse is the use of courteous formality to show
    respect and consideration for others. Many of us in the
    States have become quite informal and
    &quot;easy-going&quot;--to the point we may seem overly
    casual and abrupt to foreigners. But in many parts of the
    world the old standards still exist. </p>
    <p>In France, for example, you should pepper your phrases
    with liberal doses of &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
    &quot;Madame,&quot; and &quot;s'il vous plaît.&quot; People
    throughout the world expect to be addressed with respect by a
    stranger.</p>

    <br>
    </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Gestures and Nonverbal Communication </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you want to be polite it's a good idea to tone-down
    your gestures when traveling, since you probably won't know
    all the local customs and mores. In general, don't point your
    hand or foot at anyone, or belch, yawn, or loudly fart,
    unless, of course, you're just obviously joining in. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In Thailand it's rude to expose the sole of your shoe or
    foot to someone, to step over someone, and to touch anyone on
    the head. In India and other places where toilet paper is not
    significant to the culture, touching anyone or handing them
    anything with the left hand will raise more than eyebrows. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Western travelers, on the other hand, may be distressed by
    the tendency of some Arabs in normal conversation to lock
    their unblinking eyes mere inches from yours. As noted by
    American anthropologist Edward T. Hall, this is normal
    conversational distance for Arabs. (Indeed some Arabs believe
    they can determine your reaction to what is being said by
    whether your pupils dilate or contract: if they dilate, you
    like or approve; if they contract, you dislike or
    disapprove.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the 1950's Hall pioneered <i>proxemics</i> and <i>kinesics</i>,
    which are the studies of how people of different cultures use
    nonverbal signals to communicate. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Proxemics</strong> </dt>
            <dd>includes social distances between communicators,
                and the use of time, smell, touch, space, and <em>territoriality</em>
                (untouchable space). </dd>
            <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
            <dt><strong>Kinesics</strong></dt>
            <dd>includes body movement, gestures, facial
                expression, eye contact, posture, and speaking
                volume. </dd>
        </dl>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since most people are unaware of their <i>own</i> cultural
    patterns of nonverbal communication, they are unprepared to
    deal with the patterns of other cultures. This is probably
    the major cause of misunderstanding between cultures as we
    interpret each other as rude, pushy, childlike, cold, etc.,
    usually not for<i> what</i> is said, but <i>how </i>it is
    said, and how we act. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hall's books are required reading for Peace Corps
    volunteers. Several are listed in the bibliography, and all
    are helpful for communicating with a higher level of
    understanding. But just being aware of the nonverbal aspects
    of communication will help. I recommend for travelers to be
    sensitive to the rhythm of ordinary life around them, and to
    try to get themselves in sync with that rhythm. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>This is actually easy as we humans have a natural instinct
    for mimicry. While you don't need to out-Zelig Woody Allen in
    <i>Zelig</i> (in which he takes on the appearance of a
    Chinese after a few weeks in China), for most Americans
    slowing-down and getting with the beat of local life is
    essential for absorbing the richness of a foreign culture. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Sign Language </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Don't be embarrassed to use sign language. It works great,
    gets better with practice, and is an age-old and completely
    normal method of communication. You already know dozens of
    signs. <font color="#800080"><em>(GRAPHIC ARTIST OR

</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Talking With Backpackers </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Backpackers from all over the world can pretty much say
    anything to each other to strike up a conversation. One
    English backpacker opened up to me with about ten lines of
    Shakespeare I couldn't quite catch. (My reply: &quot;Et tu,
    Brutus?&quot;) You don't always <i>have</i> to begin with
    where are you from, how long have you been traveling, how do
    you like it, etc. While everyone is an exception some of the
    time, overall we are an interesting, fun, and good-humored
    bunch. And we all know one of the best sources of information
    is other travelers. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Listen for Good Advice</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you travel on a low budget you will probably get a lot
    of advice from the people you meet. Some of it will be of the
    highest value. Some of it will be pure crap. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Communicating in Small-Scale, Traditional
Societies </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In such societies you will be expected to be an envoy from
    your family. They may ask first and foremost about your
    family, ask to see pictures, ask what they do, etc. I usually
    carry a family photo in my wallet for such occasions. </p>
    <p>With one group I visited it was customary to seek out and
    individually greet each person in descending order from
    eldest to youngest, including children. This took about five
    pleasant minutes for a gathering of about twenty. (I was
    following a German traveler's lead.) While my experience is
    limited, it's probably a good general rule to show respect to
    elders first and foremost.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Understand that you are on their turf. Be polite and
    gracious. Try to be sensitive and not make snap judgments. It
    takes years for anthropologists to get an accurate feel for
    what's going on in any society. As a traveler you really
    can't expect to do much more than observe. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>I recommend taking it easy with the camera. Pulling out a
    camera often changes the dynamics of communication for the
    worse--if not eliminating it entirely. Most tourist
    photography I see is intrusive and a kind of trophy--and it
    really does take away something. While some people don't seem
    to mind, there may be a larger story beneath the surface
    smiles and nods. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many cultures frown upon or prohibit photography. In one
    village near San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas (southern
    Mexico) photographers face a $65 fine, confiscation of film
    and camera, and even a night in jail. The villagers' sincere
    religious beliefs (which are not Catholic) are counter to the
    desires of most tourists. The Tarahumara people of northern
    Mexico endure a great deal of photography from tourists, but
    if you ever talk to these quiet and shy people privately,
    you'll find they really don't like it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you want someone's photograph don't flash your camera
    in their unsuspecting face for a quick snap, be a sneak-thief
    with your telephoto, or throw candy to children. Instead,
    approach your subject with all the human warmth and politesse
    you can muster, register your intent with a motion to your
    camera, and let them know their time and cooperation is a
    small treasure. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If a tip is desired consider the offer with respect, even
    if you ultimately decline. Sending your subject a beautiful
    print may be much appreciated. Approached correctly, many
    people will be happy to pose. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As I wrote this I was thinking of someone I met and didn't
    photograph, a middle-aged woman in fantastic native dress,
    her smile, beauty, and dignity. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Song </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In New Zealand an older Japanese woman got off a tour bus
    and came up to Reg, a tall and wild-haired Maori fellow I was
    hitchhiking with, and began singing what sounded like a
    traditional Japanese song, perhaps of greeting. It was really
    something. Then she bowed and smiled, got back on her bus,
    and waved as she zoomed off. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>That evening we clinked our beer glasses to toast that
    wonderful woman. It was our considered opinion that if you
    have a song to sing, by all means, sing it.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
