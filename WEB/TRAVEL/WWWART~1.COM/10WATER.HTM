<h2 align="center">Water and Water Purification <br>
<br>
<br>
</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most travelers must increase their water intake since they
    are probably expending more energy carrying a pack, walking,
    museum-going, and just being outside. In hot climates the
    need for water doubles or triples. Hikers need a gallon or
    more per day as they sweat and respire water and water vapor
    in large amounts. Note that alcohol and caffeinated drinks
    have a dehydrating effect. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A good indication of semi-dehydration is chapped lips. The
    next time your lips feel chapped drink several glasses of
    water and see what happens. As visible semi-mucous membranes,
    lips are a good indicator of your state of hydration. Thirst
    is not a reliable indicator. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another barometer is the color of your urine. If it's
    always dark you are probably a quart or two low. A rule of
    thumb is to drink enough water to ensure at least two clear,
    healthy pees per day.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Obtaining Safe Water </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In Western Europe, much of Eastern Europe, and other
    developed countries you can drink the water safely from
    public water supplies. In many (but not all) developing
    countries the water supply contains diarrhea-producing
    bacteria. While some hard travelers adjust to impure water
    over weeks or months, most travelers save themselves this
    discomfort by buying most or all of their water. </p>
    <p>Note that ice cubes in developing countries are usually
    not made from purified water, and that they bite even from
    alcoholic drinks.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Buying water</strong></dt>
        <dd>is usually easy. It is sold in convenient one or
            1.5-liter plastic bottles which cost from fifty cents
            to $3, depending on the country. Look for a quality
            label and a safety-sealed cap. Bottled drinks are
            also safe and are routinely drunk by travelers.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Boiling</strong> </dt>
        <dd>makes tea, coffee, and soups safe in developing
            countries. Opinion varies on how much boiling is
            necessary, but a minute or two at full boil should do
            the job.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Iodine</strong></dt>
        <dd>is the preferred chemical treatment for water. It is
            easy and effective in twenty minutes, but iodine
            probably should not be relied on for months at a
            time. It also should not be used by pregnant women
            and people with thyroid conditions. The two most
            popular iodine treatments in the U.S. are <em>Potable
            Aqua</em> and <em>Polar Pure.</em></dd>
    </dl>

            alt="Potable Aqua bottle" align="right" hspace="0"
            width="50" height="109"></strong><strong>Potable Aqua</strong></dt>
        <dd>consists of tiny iodine tablets in a small glass
            bottle. Directions are one or two tablets (depending
            upon temperature, clarity, and giardia control) per
            quart of water. Shake and let dissolve, then loosen
            the cap and shake again to allow the iodized water to
            spread over the threads, killing germs there. It's
            ready for drinking in twenty minutes. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>The water has a slight brownish-orange color, and a
            moderate iodine taste. Potable Aqua also comes with
            ascorbic acid tablets, called P.A. Pure, which
            greatly reduce the iodine taste and the off-color.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Potable Aqua tablets should be left sealed in the
            glass bottle until use, since they have a limited
            effective life after exposure to air.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong><img src="IMAGES/POLARP~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/polarpure.gif"
            alt="Polar Pure iodine water treatment" align="right"
            hspace="0" width="80" height="146"></strong><strong>Polar
            Pure</strong></dt>
        <dd>consists of a four-ounce glass bottle with
            crystallized iodine in the bottom. The bottle is
            filled with several ounces of water. After a few
            minutes (time dependent on water temperature--a small
            thermometer is attached) this bottle is poured into a
            quart-sized water container to be purified. The
            crystals remain in the original glass bottle. While
            Polar Pure is slightly more complicated than Potable
            Aqua, less iodine is used, and it has a longer shelf
            life.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Liquid iodine</strong></dt>
        <dd>from a dropper bottle is an alternate method used by
            some travelers. When faced with suspect water in a
            restaurant they add two or three drops per glass of
            water, stir, and wait a few minutes. This is
            unscientific but seems to work.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Silver</strong> </dt>
        <dd>water disinfectant tablets are expensive at about $20
            for a packet of forty tablets, which purifies forty
            quarts. Silver is an alternative for those who don't
            want to use iodine.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Chlorine</strong> </dt>
        <dd>tablets or liquid are not recommended as a water
            purifier, as chlorine is unstable and not always
            effective. Since it is also associated with a small
            cancer risk, only use chlorine in a pinch.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Filtering</strong></dt>
        <dd>is the high-tech method of making water safe to
            drink. Several different types of filters are
            discussed below. While the majority of travelers buy
            their water and carry iodine tablets or drops for
            emergencies, a special <em>purifying</em> filter may
            make sense for some travelers.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>I recommend purifying filters for travelers who camp
            away from campgrounds--say in Central American
            National Parks, or who will otherwise be in the bush.
            Travelers in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and in the
            former Soviet Union could also benefit from a good
            purifying filter.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dd>Boiling is very inconvenient since it takes a lot of
            time and fuel. While iodine makes water
            bacteriologically safe, it doesn't remove crud or
            improve taste. A good water filter pumps out a great
            tasting quart of water in a few minutes, and gives
            you a real boost compared to forcing yourself to
            drink boiled or iodine-purified (but still cruddy)
            water. In the long run you could also save money by
            filtering instead of buying.<br>

    <h4 align="center">Water Filters and Water Purifiers </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Water filters clean water by passing it through a filter
    of a certain pore size which screens contaminants. These are
    fine for backcountry use in the U.S. and Canada since giardia
    is the main contaminant here. (Giardia screening requires
    only a pore size of two microns.) Developing countries,
    however, may have waterborne viruses, such as hepatitis,
    which are too small to be completely screened by any filter.
    Thus virus control requires boiling, iodine chemical
    treatment, or a purifying filter, such as some of those made
    by PUR. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some PUR water filters/purifiers incorporate an iodine
    matrix into a one-micron filter, which kills viruses and
    bacteria without passing much iodine into the water. Other
    manufacturers are following PUR's lead. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In practice non-purifying filters which screen
    contaminants to 0.2 microns remove most viruses as viruses
    usually attach themselves to bigger things, which are then
    screened. To be completely safe, however, you may want to add
    a little iodine to the water after filtering. While not as
    much iodine is necessary as with unfiltered water, you still
    must wait twenty minutes before drinking.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Using Filters </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Avoid fast clogging by always using the cleanest available
    water. If the water is particularly dirty or silt-laden, let
    it settle in a pot before filtering. I permanently clogged a
    First Need filter on the second quart drawn from a silty
    Washington river. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To clean a clogged filter you must carefully follow
    manufacturer instructions. A grave possibility is
    contaminating yourself with the nasty bacteria trapped inside
    the filter. You must also be careful about contamination from
    the water-source hose. Take care with a ceramic filter as a
    hairline crack will make it 100% ineffective. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4 align="center">Selection Criteria for Water Filters </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you are going to depend on a filter for much of your
    water field cleanability, pump speed, and ease of use are far
    more important than a few ounces of weight. A good filter
    saves you from carrying at least some water, which weighs
    eight pounds per gallon. Note that pump speed lessens the
    more the filter is used. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Filters with a pore size of one micron or less are good.
    Note that smaller pore sizes and smaller filters clog faster.
    Carbon filters trap pesticides and metals, which for my taste
    is a worthwhile feature. Ceramic-only filters like the
    Katadyns do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For short periods of developing world backcountry or
    emergency use, filters such as the PUR Scout and Sweetwater
    with iodine cartridge are good choices.</p>
    <p>If you will be filtering most or all of your water, say in
    East Africa or the Darien Gap, then you will appreciate
    having (and essentially require) an easy-pumping,
    easy-cleaning, full-size filter such as the PUR Explorer. It
    self-cleans with a twist of the handle, and is the easiest
    pumping filter over the long haul. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note again that a water purifier is <em>not</em> a
    requirement for developing-world travel. Most travelers buy
    most of their water and use iodine tablets or drops in a
    pinch.<br>
    <br>
