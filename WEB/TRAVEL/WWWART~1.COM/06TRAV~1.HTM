    <p>This is the biggest hurdle for many would-be-travelers.
    The fact for many of us is if we don't go backpacking alone,
    we aren't going backpacking. You have to be lucky to have a
    travel partner with similar goals, time, and money as
    yourself. Plus, can you realistically expect to have a travel
    partner with whom you want to spend almost twenty-four hours
    per day? Traveling alone will force you to meet other people,
    and will probably expose you much more to the real
    experiences of travel. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you feel you must travel with someone, there is a good
    chance you will meet another person in similar circumstances
    as you travel. I have traveled with dozens of backpackers for
    periods long and short--from a few months to a few weeks, a
    few days, even a few hours. It's fun, and you can go off on
    your own again whenever you want. </p>

    <h4><i><br>
    <br>
    </i>I don't think I'm the backpacker type. </h4>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Most Americans don't think they're the backpacker type,
    but maybe you just aren't sure what the backpacker type is.
    We Americans really don't do much traveling compared to
    Germans, English, French, Italians, Danes, Australians, etc.
    We do two-week vacations here and there, sign up for tours
    and cruises, but as a nation we aren't very adventurous. The
    reason for this, I believe, is that our country is so
    gigantic we aren't much exposed to travel in other lands. In
    Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Denmark, Australia, a great
    many people--teachers, architects, engineers, secretaries,
    mechanics, students--<em>do</em> consider themselves the
    backpacker type, and they travel on their own all over the
    world. They have an intellectual interest in other cultures,
    and it is the greatest fun for them to make their own way
    through other countries. </p>
    <p>The whole point of this book is to expose more people to
    the concept of backpacker travel, and to give them a good
    start on how to do it. Americans especially need to travel
    more. It would do our national outlook a lot of good, and it
    might do you a lot of good. You just might be more the
    backpacker type than you realize. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Is it safe to travel? </h4>
    <p>The last thing I want is for someone to read this book and
    then naively get hurt traveling. There are risks to travel,
    just as there are risks in everything you do. </p>
    <p>Risk is determined by several factors, the first of which
    is where you travel. For example, the average backpacker is
    many times more likely to be pickpocketed in Managua than
    London. Fortunately, &quot;average&quot; backpackers don't
    usually go to Managua. The ones that do keep their money in a
    hidden money belt, and are wary with their wallets and packs.
    Backpackers in Central America are a self-selected group who
    are overall more &quot;world-wise&quot; than average
    backpackers in Europe or Australia. These travelers mostly
    navigate Managua without incident. </p>
    <p>But there are plenty of pickpockets in London, and
    backpackers can get just as run-over by a bus there as in any
    developing world city. Indeed I consider myself at a greater
    serious health risk in left-side driving countries like
    Britain than in proper-side driving countries like
    Nicaragua--it's just too easy to forget. </p>
    <p>The other risk factor is you and how you travel. Your
    risks skyrocket if you don't wear a seat belt, if you don't
    take the proper health precautions, or if you walk alone at
    night in dangerous areas of medieval countries in a
    miniskirt. If you are sensible, like most backpackers, your
    risks are reduced wherever you travel. </p>
    <p>As in everything, you must weigh the benefits against the
    risks.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Is it safe for women to travel alone?</h4>
    <p>The fact is there are a great many women all over the
    world backpacking alone. Of course many join up with other
    women backpackers some time during their journey. Everyone
    knows there's safety in numbers, and it's fun to share
    experiences. Nevertheless, any lone backpacker will spend
    time alone, so she should know how to handle herself.</p>
    <p>Some countries are more threatening to women than others.
    While Italy is a thousand times more hassle than northern
    Europe in terms of pinches, whistles, strange men pounding on
    your hotel door and sweetly asking if they can visit for a
    few minutes--it's probably only slightly more dangerous in
    terms of rape. Most women travelers love Italy and get along
    well. </p>
    <p>Morocco, on the other hand, is three hundred years behind
    even Italy in its treatment of women. Women traveling in
    developing countries must understand their western status
    does not make them immune to the sexual time-warp around
    them. Indeed, in some countries the woman traveler is a
    prized sexual target for local men. Fortunately, this usually
    means nothing more than an uninvited man sitting at your
    table and asking pointed questions while you're trying to
    eat. </p>
    <p>But be aware that rape is sadly common in some parts of
    the world--notably certain macho areas of Latin America.
    While this affects local women far more than western
    travelers, it gives you an idea of the prevailing attitudes.
    Women can travel safer in these areas by wearing clothing
    that hides their curves and covers their skin. They should
    also avoid going out alone at night in seedy areas. And,
    unless it's recommended by your guidebook or there are other
    backpackers there, it may not be the smartest move to stay in
    the absolutely cheapest accomodation.</p>
    <p>Women backpackers say aloofness is one of their best
    defenses. You may want to avoid making eye contact with some
    individuals by wearing dark sunglasses. Good defenses for a
    man who sits at your table and won't take no for answer
    include pretending to read something, saying something to the
    waiter, and slamming your fist down and angrily exclaiming
    for all to hear, &quot;Get out!&quot; </p>
    <p>For every backpacker there could come a time when she
    needs to aggressively defend herself. Usually this takes the
    form of sharp words and a hostile manner as above, but she
    may also need to get physical with her defense, and do it
    effectively by using sharp and surprising force. Every woman
    can do this. See <a href="08THIE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/08thieves.htm">Chapter 8
    Pickpockets, Thieves, and Self-Defense</a> for more
    information. </p>
    <p>My own estimate is there are more women than men travel
    backpackers. And I have not seen any statistics saying travel
    is more dangerous for women than men. Indeed I think it's
    probable that women are able to avoid trouble better than men
    due to greater reliance on instinct and brainpower. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>I'm such a weenie, shouldn't I go with a tour group my
    first time?</h4>
    <p>First of all, quit thinking negatively about yourself. You
    simply have the natural fear everyone has before their first
    trip. Now, for all you old campaigners who are unsure of your
    ability to get by in an unfamiliar situation; for those who
    have just a short amount of time; and for you people who
    really are weenies--following is a step-by-step plan for two
    weeks in Europe that will give you a thousand times more
    satisfaction than being canned into a speeding bus tour, with
    all the nonsense that involves. </p>

        backpacker guidebook such as <em>Let's Go </em>or<em>
        Berkeley Guides</em>, then select a city to begin your
        adventure. London, Edinburg, and Dublin are fantastic
        capital cities that speak English, and are easy to

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>4</strong>. Select a hotel in Paris that your
        guidebook indicates has an English speaking desk, and
        then make a reservation with them for four nights. This
        reservation is optional if you are traveling outside the
        busy summer season, as you could wait to book a room in
        Paris until you arrive there by train. There is a tourist
        office in, or very near, the main train station in every
        major city in Europe. You just wait in line and an
        English speaking clerk will find a room for you. Do try
        to arrive earlier in the day rather than later, though. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>5</strong>. Select a hotel in Amsterdam, or

        you walk to the train station, get in line, and buy a
        ticket to Paris. In Paris you buy a ticket to Amsterdam.
        In Amsterdam you buy a ticket back to London, where you
        could have a reservation back at your old familiar hotel.
        (Incidentally, returning to a city you may see it quite
        differently. Travelers often talk about this phenomena.) </p>

<blockquote>
    <h4>Won't I look funny dining alone?</h4>
    <p>Depends on how you eat. Lone diners are far more common in
    Europe than the States, but you will probably meet dining
    companions at some point. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>But who do I talk to when I'm alone? </h4>
    <p>To yourself, of course! Write letters and keep a journal.
    Think about what you've seen. Read a book. Study the
    language. Observe people. Play with children. Make friends.
    Hit on German backpacker gals/guys. If you're an American you
    may already be world class when it comes to talking to
    strangers. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>But I don't speak their language. </h4>
    <p>Fortunately you do speak the most international language
    there has ever been. Indeed, many backpackers from all over
    the world mostly speak English while traveling. Of course not
    everyone speaks English--and in some places hardly anyone
    does--but you can still get along. You know what a hotel
    looks like. You know what food looks like. You know what
    airports and train stations and taxis look like. You can
    always make sounds like a train, hold your arms like wings
    and swoosh like a plane, point to your mouth or just go to
    McDonald's. </p>
    <p>Europe is easy for monolingual Americans. China, on the
    other hand, is difficult for independent travelers who don't
    speak Chinese. You can stare at the characters in your
    guidebook and on a neon sign for half an hour, and still not
    know if you're looking at a hotel or a laundry. Until you go
    inside and make your hands into a pillow--and they try to
    press your shirt. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>What if something unexpected happens?</h4>
    <p>When something unplanned happens--which must be expected
    and even desired in backpacker travel--you are the one to
    deal with it and reap the benefits. Being thrown into new,
    accidental situations is what backpacker travel is all about,
    and one reason why it is so much more interesting than group
    travel.</p>
    <p>When the chicken train inexplicably flies by leaving you
    and twenty others with tickets to turn in, you can either
    sulk or begin thinking about alternative transport like
    everyone else. Something will come up, there will be a way
    around your predicament. The fellow you've been chatting with
    may say, &quot;Hey gringo, my brother has a truck. You want
    to ride?&quot; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Don't people in other countries all hate Americans?</h4>
    <p>Bite your tongue! An amazing number of people have uncles,
    brothers, sisters, or cousins in the States; have themselves
    visited or worked here; or have seen and heard about us
    through movies, books, and pop culture. If they have a
    problem with the U.S. Government or foreign policy, they
    usually separate this from individual Americans. Of course,
    if you are rude, obnoxious, or loud you may not be well
    received.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>What if I get sick or injured? </h4>
    <p>You could also crack your head in the bathtub tomorrow.
    But take good health recommendations, and before venturing
    into the developing world seek professional advice and
    immunizations from a travel clinic. In Western Europe and
    other developed countries medical care is excellent, and in
    the developing world you should be able to afford the best
    doctor in town. Some travel insurance policies include
    emergency transport back to the States. See <a

    </p>
    <h4>I wish I had traveled when I was younger, but I'm so old
    now I don't think I'll fit in.</h4>
    <p>Ridiculous. There are many backpackers over 30, 40, 50,
    and 60, and I even met an 81-year-old American lady on her
    first hosteling tour of Europe. She got discounts. So see
    your doctor, strap on a backpack, and see some of the world
    before... <br>

    </em>How will I know which bus to get on?</h4>
    <p>True, it's not always easy to get on the right bus. Nor is
    it always easy to get off the bus. But hey, at least you are
    on a bus, heading somewhere, presumably.</p>
    <p>The basis for this fear, like most others, is fear of the
    unknown. The mind invents all kinds of rationales and worries
    to accommodate fear of the unkown. You conquer it by getting
    on your bus or train or airplane and seeing what happens. You
    can read all you want about the unknown, make all kinds of
    plans, but eventually you have to march into it. Every
    journey is a series of steps taken one at a time. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>But how will I know when to get off the bus?</h4>
    <p>Also not always easy. Fortunately, bus drivers all over
    the world have the uncanny ability to know where you want off
    if you ask them. If possible sit near the front, perhaps at
    some point reminding the driver of your destination. Ask
    someone near you if this is your stop. You can point to a
    map, or just say &quot;Plaza de Armas?&quot; quizzically and
    with a smile. They will understand and either shake their
    heads or say &quot;Si!&quot; and shoo you off. When you reach
    your stop it's not unusual for three or four people around
    you to let you know at the same time. The good people of the
    world really do look out for you. <br>

    <h4>What will I have after spending all this money on travel?</h4>
    <p>Good travel is a matchless educational experience. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>How will I know what all the funny money is worth?</h4>
    <p>You'll figure it out. It probably won't take more than one
    or two transactions. It's no big whoop.<br>
