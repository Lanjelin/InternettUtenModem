<h2 align="center">Walking and Backpacks </h2>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>It is a great art to saunter. The swiftest
            traveler is he that goes afoot. Most of the luxuries,
            and many of the so-called comforts, of life are not
            only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to
            the elevation of mankind.</em> <strong>Henry David
            Thoreau, USA</strong><em><strong><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            </strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My favorite method of travel is not by train, bus, or hang
    glider, but by placing one foot in front of the other in an
    easy manner. With comfortable shoes, a light pack, and an
    interesting environment, this is a matchless pleasure. My
    eyes have the time to focus on anything or anyone, my ears to
    discern the many sounds, and my nose to smell what's cooking.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Walking takes you where the people are. Shopkeepers behind
    their counters. Children playing games or looking at you
    slyly. Weddings being wed. Happy people. Sad people.
    Brow-raising outbursts of emotion. Walking is travel on a
    human scale, where you see the slight upturn at the corner of
    a mouth, and have time to nod and smile back. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When you take your time people notice and
    respond--sometimes with a nod or a smile, and sometimes with
    a &quot;How do you do,&quot; &quot;Nice weather,&quot; or a
    Life's Story. Many times I've walked through villages with
    half-a-dozen children parading around me.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>When your pack is light and efficient you feel happy and
    free. If you are on your way somewhere, perhaps to a hostel
    or a train station, and you spy a pleasant café you would
    like to enjoy for awhile--no problem! Or perhaps you would
    like to venture into a shop, watch old men play chess in a
    park, take a scenic route. Whatever you want to do, you can
    do. This is traveling at its best. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>When your pack is heavy and cumbersome you are never a
    happy traveler. All-consumed with the singular desire to get
    you and your burden wherever you're going, you will not see
    or experience more than the ground in front of you. </p>
    <p>Indeed as your shoulders ache from the cutting weight and
    the sweat pours over your face you will more resemble a
    godforsaken soul in a chain gang than a happy-go-lucky
    traveler. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>But even this is not the worst-case scenario. Many
    travelers pack and accumulate so much their effective range
    is limited to about a hundred yards--and this only with
    bursts of superhuman effort. They sit waiting for time to
    pass and transport to arrive. </p>
    <p>Perhaps someday as you skip through some faraway train
    station you'll come across one of these forlorn and weary
    travelers, and hear his or her version of the Heavy Packer's
    Refrain, which goes something like this: &quot;I've got so
    much junk I'm always sitting around guarding it while
    everyone else is off having fun...&quot; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h2 align="center">Backpacks </h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>For most budget travelers a backpack is the ultimate tool
    for carrying gear. A good backpack, well packed and lightly
    loaded, allows the traveler to traverse the world with her
    hands free and her head high. Women especially benefit from
    backpacks since much of the load is efficiently transferred
    away from the upper body to much stronger hips. </p>
    <p>Conversely, duffel bags and suitcases inefficiently
    transfer 100% of the load to the upper body, which is tiring
    for everyone. Travelers who forego a backpack for a suitcase
    will end up riding expensive taxis and forfeiting a great
    deal of time and pleasure.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h3 align="center">What Size Pack</h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The most useful idea this chapter can communicate is that
    you don't need a big, bulky backpack, because you probably
    don't need a lot of clothing or gear. Experienced travelers
    not only get by with less, they travel better and more
    comfortably with less. A light and efficient pack is freedom
    and flexibility for the traveler. </p>
    <p>Although most travelers are aware of the &quot;travel
    light&quot; philosophy before they leave, few actually
    practice it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's difficult for the inexperienced to realize how little
    you actually need when traveling, and how important having a
    light pack is. The tendency is to think the things you use in
    ordinary life are necessary. After eight tours the barest
    minimum of gear is not only what I want, but what I need.
    Except for a few emergency items, I can't be burdened for
    months with anything that isn't useful almost every day. I
    know if a special need arises, I can always use lightweight
    money or duct tape to fix the problem. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>My advice for most non-camping travel backpackers is to
    use a large daypack, rucksack, or small internal frame pack
    of 1800-3500 cubic inches (30-60 liters), which can easily
    contain two changes of clothes, a rainjacket, a pair of
    sandals, a few toiletries, camera and film, a few other
    items, and even a down sleeping bag, if desired. This is
    especially true for travelers who plan to always stay in
    hotels or hostels, who don't need gear associated with
    &quot;roughing it,&quot; and who are going to be on the move
    a lot. </p>
    <p>Of course if you plan on staying in one place for extended
    periods--meaning several weeks or longer--then you can use a
    larger pack and bring more without much hassle.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">One Last Italic Try</h4>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>Do not make the mistake of bringing too much, and then
    vowing when you return never to overpack again.</em> As a
    budget traveler you will be walking and carrying your pack
    much more than you realize--indeed for many Americans walking
    more than ever before. To a greater or lesser extent, the
    size, weight, and efficiency of your pack will determine how
    you travel, where you travel, and who you meet. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center">Types of Backpacks </h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>The three broad categories of backpacks are
    external-frame, internal-frame, and frameless. Internal-frame
    packs described here include travel packs and top-loaders.
    Frameless packs are comprised of rucksacks and daypacks.
    While duffel bags are technically not backpacks, they are
    often flung over the shoulder and used by many backpackers
    with great success.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">External-Frame Backpacks </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The main advantage of externals is they transfer nearly
    100% of the load to the hipbelt. Most externals also have an
    aluminum extender bar which allows a great deal of
    load--typically sleeping bag, tent, and/or pad--to be lashed
    above the pack, which in normal walking mode brings it almost
    directly over your center of gravity. This is the lightest
    place to carry a load--note the many peoples who balance
    baskets and vessels on their heads. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These are outstanding features for hiking on trails,
    across deserts, or on any relatively good path. However, for
    going over, under, around or through obstacles--such as
    embarking a crowded bus or train, battling lines at American
    Express, or anything in the urban jungle--an external is <em>not</em>
    the ideal load-carrying machine. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A large externally-framed pack with its ominous metal bars
    always strikes a measure of fear into pedestrians and
    shopkeepers. People instinctively dislike this hard and
    dangerous thing careening toward them. They will pull their
    children closer, shake their heads, and whisper as you go by.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course if an external is what you have this doesn't
    mean you can't take it traveling--I did on my first
    backpacking trip. It's just that external packs are further
    from the ideal than other choices. </p>

<h4 align="center"><br>
<br>
Internal-Frame Backpacks </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The internal frame pack was born about thirty years ago
    when some enterprising soul fastened two aluminum stays
    inside a rucksack. This transferred more of the load away
    from the shoulders and onto the hips. Today, as one examines
    the walls of a good outdoor shop, the internal frame industry
    is testament to free-enterprise. Dozens of pack makers
    compete for market share with technology, value, fashion, and
    hype. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The vast majority of travel backpackers use internals.
    This is due to their more streamlined profile and their
    absence of a large and frightening external metal frame which
    might knock out some innocent's teeth. Internals are
    blessedly easier to maneuver onto buses and trains, and in
    the everyday urban environment. Walk into a china shop with
    an external and you will feel like an 800-pound gorilla. With
    an internal you're merely the hunchback of Notre Dame.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Travel Packs </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travel packs are built specifically for travel. They are
    made of heavy duty nylon, have a zip-open main body for easy
    access, and have several external pockets for frequently used
    items. Most have a &quot;hideaway&quot; suspension, where the
    hipbelt and shoulder straps can be tucked away behind a thin
    nylon panel. They also have a handle and/or shoulder strap
    for carrying as a suitcase. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Since these packs have less sophisticated suspension
    systems they don't carry a load as well as their internal
    cousins. Because they open via a zip-open panel they must be
    larger than a regular top-loading internal to contain the
    same amount of gear. (Top-loaders are the most efficient at
    packing gear into the smallest possible space, since you can
    stuff and stuff a top-loader, and then stuff it some more.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some travel packs have a zip-off daypack which attaches to
    the front of the main pack. While these are popular, I prefer
    to use a simple, lightweight daypack which I keep inside my
    main pack. For my taste zip-off day packs make the main pack
    too bulky and heavy since they place the load too far from my
    center of gravity. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Travel packs are very popular with American backpackers
    due to their suitcase-like convenience, and because they are
    usually priced less than a same-size top-loader. Many
    American backpackers say they really like their travel packs,
    and the good ones seem to work out well.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Top-Loading Packs </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The main reason I prefer top-loading, internal-frame packs
    over travel packs is their design enables you to pack your
    gear into the smallest possible package. This makes it easier
    to walk onto buses and trains, to sit down in cafes, and to
    browse through shops. Also, since they are better than travel
    packs at distributing load to the hipbelt, they weigh less
    heavily on the shoulders. In short, these packs deliver the
    maximum in walking freedom. The majority of European
    backpackers use top-loading internal-frame packs. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Top-loading packs have a hood with a pocket or two which
    clamps over the top of the pack. Here is where you put items
    you use often, such as toilet bag, camera, map, guidebook,
    etc. Some of these packs also have a bottom sleeping bag
    compartment with zippered access. In addition to your
    sleeping bag, there is also room here for items you might
    want in a hurry, such as a rainjacket, sandals, etc.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Rucksacks and Daypacks </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Rucksacks (which are similar to internal frame packs but
    don't have an internal frame) and daypacks (student book
    packs) are also great for traveling if you can go
    ultra-light. With these packs all the load falls on the
    shoulders, but this isn't a problem if you keep the load to
    twelve pounds or less. Everyone will say how smart you are
    for traveling so light. </p>
    <p>I carry a very light (seven-ounce) nylon daypack from
    Wal-Mart in my regular backpack. I use this to hold a jacket,
    camera, food, etc., for exploring during the day. This is a
    convenient and common practice among backpackers. Do not
    start off your travels, however, with your backpack and your
    daypack full of gear. It's much better to have both hands
    free.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Duffel Bags </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The only time I used a duffel instead of a backpack was on
    a month-long hitchhiking tour from Anchorage to Seattle. It
    was inexpensive, made of nylon, and had five zippered
    compartments. It was light and convenient to use, although I
    was fortunate the hitching was excellent. (In Toke, Alaska I
    had to wait only four hours--the average wait at that
    junction is two days.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Walking for long periods with a duffel slung over my
    shoulder caused problems with my neckbone, and also severely
    handicapped my grizzly-detection capability on one side.
    Nevertheless, it was much easier to carry and sling around
    than a standard suitcase. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>If a duffel is all you can afford, it will work fine. In
    fact, small duffels are the bag of choice for many British
    hitchhikers inside their own country. They connote a certain
    professionalism to motorists. I would not hesitate one second
    to travel if a duffel was all I had. I would, however, be
    doubly certain my load was as light as possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You can get nylon duffel bags with several zippered
    compartments from discount stores for $15-$30. These are much
    lighter and more efficient than Army-style heavy duty canvas
    duffels, which will drive you crazy with their inconvenience
    and huge size.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Suitcases </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm afraid you're not really travel backpacking if you use
    a suitcase, but you still may buy up to a dozen (12) copies
    of this book for gifts, with my compliments.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center"><a name="pppp">Proper</a> Preflight Pack
Preparation </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Every backpack salesperson has heard complaints about
    packs being torn or broken by baggage handlers. Usually this
    is less the fault of the handlers and more the fault of
    Improper Preflight Pack Preparation. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Backpacks have numerous dangling appendages, such as
    shoulder straps and hipbelts, which have innate propensity to
    catch on mechanized roller-type machines and be chewed to
    bits. External frame packs are vulnerable to their frames
    becoming overstressed by funloving baggage handlers. A few
    simple precautions will reduce your chance of arriving in
    London or Bangkok with half a hipbelt, or minus one
    shoulderstrap. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1</strong>. Preferred method is to have your
        pack small enough to carry on. Airlines generally allow
        one carry-on article with total dimensions of forty-five
        inches (height + length + width). A 3000 cubic inch pack
        will just meet these requirements. You may be able to get
        by with a little more. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong><img src="IMAGES/PACKWRAP.GIF" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/packwrap.gif"
        alt="Pack ready to fly." align="right" hspace="0"
        width="107" height="213"></strong><strong>2</strong>. If
        your pack is too large to carry on remove, tuck away, or
        tie-up all straps, belts, and appendages. Do not leave
        anything dangling which can get caught in mechanical
        devices. I put a raincover over the back of the pack
        (covering the shoulder straps and hipbelt) and then
        tightly wrap the pack with twenty feet of cord. I have
        done this for a dozen flights and never had a problem. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Lock, tie-up, or conceal all

        <p><strong>4.</strong> The cargo area may be
        unpressurized and very cold. Cheap shampoo and other

    <blockquote>

            difference in comfort. While wearing the pack have a

            Made of several layers of foam to pad hips and hold
            the load. <em>Web</em> hipbelts found on some
            rucksacks and daypacks only hold the pack close to

        <dd>Back portion of the hipbelt which fits into the small

            feature.</dd>

        <dd>Attach from either side of the hipbelt to the side of

            they pull the load into the small of the back and
            hipbelt; otherwise the load inefficiently

        <dt><strong>Shoulder straps</strong></dt>
        <dd>&quot;Anatomically curved&quot; shoulder straps on
            better packs are a good feature, as they curve around
            the neck. Adjusting the straps lower on the pack
            increases pack stability and load on the shoulders. A
            higher adjustment takes weight off the shoulders and
            reduces pack stability. Salespeople will probably
            adjust them for maximum pack stability, which is
            necessary for mountain climbing and skiing, but not
            so important for travel. I always adjust mine high so
            there is little or no weight on my shoulders.</dd>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Load lifters</strong></dt>
        <dd>Straps running from shoulder straps to top of pack.

            upper back.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Compression straps</strong></dt>
        <dd>Wrap around the sides of the pack. When cinched they

        <dt><strong>Sternum strap</strong></dt>

            Increases stability of the pack, and may slightly
            improve load transfer. I rarely used mine, so I sold
            it to a Mayan shopkeeper for one quetzal (about
            twenty cents.)</dd>

        <dd>5 oz., $15-$20. Essential piece of nylon to cover the

            backpack will leak through seams and zippers. Also
            useful for wrapping a pack before checking it on an
            airplane. A plastic garbage bag substitutes for many
            backpackers. My packcover has proved a worthwhile
            investment.<br>

            loading. Twin aluminum stays with foam sheet. Two
            side pockets and two front pockets. Beefy main zip.
            Biggest-selling Kelty pack. Simple, convenient,
            no-nonsense design is excellent for ultralight,
            non-tent-carrying travelers. I might lop off the side
            pockets to make it more streamlined. <em>(Click image

            aluminum stays with padded back. Two side pockets and
            two front pockets. Made of heavy duty Cordura nylon.
            Has a handle for carrying as luggage. Hide-away
            suspension panel. This is a good, mid-sized travel
            pack similar to those used by many American
            backpackers.</dd>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>REI EveningStar</strong></dt>
        <dd>4 lbs., $140. 3500 cu.in., two panel-loading
            compartments. Twin aluminum stays. A good pack for
            travelers with a lot of gear, such as a tent,
            sleeping bag, stove, juggling pins, etc. I used this
            pack for a few months in Central America, but
            sometimes it had to go on top of the bus, where it
            was looted once. I don't recommend attaching an
            add-on pocket as it will flop around and considerably
            increase bulk.</dd>

        <dd>2.2 pounds, $125. 2400 cubic inches. No aluminum
            stays or framesheet. A top loader with one top hood
            pocket. No sleeping bag compartment. This is a
            typical pack for many ultralight European
            backpackers. Despite its small size you can stuff a
            surprising amount into it. I highly recommend this
            type of small, light, simple, sturdy, and inexpensive
            backpack for hostel-hopping and other ultralight,
            non-camping travel. Your retailer should have a
            similar pack.</dd>

            with a top hood pocket and a bottom sleeping bag
            compartment. Should straps and hipbelt are sized

            side pockets, and a zip-off day pack. It's huge. This
            pack is for helicoptering into the Congo to set up
            base camp, or for Schwarzenegger-types who want to
            show off.</dd>
