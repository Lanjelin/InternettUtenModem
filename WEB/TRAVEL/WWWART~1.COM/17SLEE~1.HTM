</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sleeping bags are great for keeping warm in airports and
    stations, on overnight trains and buses, and for crashing on
    a new friend's floor. They are also useful for insulating
    yourself from El Cheapo Hotel bedding. A good sleeping bag
    adds more flexibility for the traveler than any other item in
    the pack. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course not all backpackers need a sleeping bag. If you
    expect to be in a hotel, hostel, or warm train every night
    you probably don't. If you are hostel-hopping out of a
    daypack (2000 cubic inches or so) you may not have room.
    Nevertheless, most backpackers have some kind of sleeping
    bag. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>With my travel style I almost always want a light but warm
    sleeping bag. I use a twenty-degree down mummy with a
    standard nylon cover. It gives me tons of flexibility for its
    weight and volume, which amounts to less than 2.5 pounds and
    an easy-stuffing 7x14 inches. And for only $140. Some bags
    are even lighter and smaller. Following is everything I know
    about sleeping bags, which was learned in the course of
    buying the wrong bag before my second travel adventure, and
    this suitable one before my fourth. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note there is no perfect sleeping bag for all seasons,
    conditions, or uses. Every bag involves trade-offs between
    weight, stuff-size, comfort, warmth, weather resistance, and
    cost. Fortunately the technology has advanced to an admirable
    state, and with fierce competition (over two dozen American
    brands alone) quality and value are the rule rather than the
    exception. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">The Mummy and the Semi-Rectangular </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>For travel the two sleeping bag designs to consider are
    the two which are the most weight and stuff-size efficient:
    the mummy style and the semi-rectangular style. <img
    src="IMAGES/MANINBAG.GIF" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/images/maninbag.gif" alt="Author hot hot hot!"
    align="right" hspace="7" vspace="3" width="300" height="97"></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The mummy is the most efficient in retaining body heat
    since it incorporates a hood which, when fully battened-down,
    leaves only a small circle of your face exposed to the cold.
    On warmer nights the hood need not be used. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The roomier semi-rectangular lacks a hood but has a
    drawstring closure which can be cinched over your shoulders.
    (A mummy will do this also.) Some semi-rectangular bags have
    zippers extending across the foot section allowing the bag to
    open into a comforter, which is a very useful feature. A
    semi-rectangular will weigh at least five ounces more than a
    mummy for a given temperature rating, and substantial
    headgear will also be required to stay warm at that rating. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Choosing the Right Size Sleeping Bag </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>The roominess of a bag depends upon your and its
    dimensions across the chest, hips, and feet. A spacious bag
    will not be as warm as a slightly tighter bag because the
    bigger bag has more inside air for the body to heat. If the
    bag is too tight, however, the insulation will become
    compressed, forming cold spots where your precious heat will
    escape. Furthermore, if the bag is too tight you will be less
    comfortable putting on additional layers of clothing should
    the conditions become extreme for your bag's temperature
    rating. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sleeping bags usually come in two or three sizes. The
    point is if you are 5'5&quot; and carrying a 6-footer's bag
    you have extra weight, volume, and expense to deal with. It
    also means you won't be quite as warm as with a better
    fitting bag due to the extra air space your body has to heat.
    Shorter folks with long bags should tuck the extra length
    under their feet. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The only way to properly size a bag is to get in four or
    five different ones. Outdoor shops allow and expect this. For
    me, roominess across the shoulders is a paramount
    consideration since I don't like being too constricted. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong>Temperature Ratings </strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Manufacturers give their bags temperature ratings to
    reflect the low temperature someone can expect to maintain <em>homeostasis</em>,
    which is a more or less constant, comfortable body
    temperature. These numbers are somewhat accurate given three
    conditions which have little to do with the world you and I
    inhabit. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>First, the testing for these ratings is done in rooms
    where the air remains still. And we all know what an effect
    wind has on relative temperature (wind chill). In other
    words, if you are sleeping in the open in a twenty-degree
    nylon-shelled bag on a twenty degree night with a five mile
    per hour wind, you will absolutely freeze your butt off since
    nylon is not windproof. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Second, when testing the manufacturers use abundant
    insulation underneath the bag--equivalent to a full-length
    Standard Thermarest, which is 1.5 inches thick and provides
    more insulation than most travelers carry. Thus if you use a
    3/8 inch closed cell foam pad you will definitely feel cold
    at extreme conditions. (<a href="17SLEE~1.HTM#pads" tppabs="http://www.artoftravel.com/17sleepingbags.htm#pads">Sleeping
    pads</a> are discussed at the end of this chapter.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The final factor is your individual metabolism. In the
    same bag some folks sleep comfortably while others feel cold.
    This variation ranges up to fifteen degrees F. Since I sleep
    on the cold side I would tend to choose a slightly warmer bag
    for a given condition, which for safety and comfort's sake is
    a good idea regardless of metabolism. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note that if you are hungry or dehydrated your ability to
    withstand cold (or, more correctly, manufacture heat) will be
    adversely affected. A hot drink and warm stew work wonders on
    a cold night. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Sleeping Bag Materials </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inner shells are usually made of fine nylon or polyester,
    although Kelty makes some bags with a cotton/polyester inner
    liner. Cotton/polyester has less of a sticky or clammy feel
    against bare skin at warmer temperatures, but it holds water
    and increases weight slightly. Most good bags have nylon or
    polyester inner liners which work fine. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Outer shells are made of nylon, ripstop nylon, polyester,
    GoreTex, Dryloft, Versatec, or other proprietary microfibers
    designed to provide some degree of water and wind resistance.
    Nylon is the standard outer shell. It is light, strong, and
    the most breathable. No regular nylon, however, is better
    than mediocre for wind and water resistance. Ripstop nylon is
    stronger, more tear resistant, and also more wind and water
    resistant. Polyester is more resistant than nylon to
    degradation from UV radiation, and usually comes in
    microfiber formulations which are more wind and water
    resistant. Dryloft is a version of GoreTex specifically
    designed for sleeping-bag outer shells. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>GoreTex and Dryloft sleeping bags are not
    waterproof--water easily leaks into the many seams. They are
    good at resisting moisture such as heavy dew, heavy
    breathing, and spilled beer. Moreover, in real world
    conditions GoreTex and Dryloft sleeping bags are much warmer
    than conventionally-shelled ones because they are windproof.
    This can be important if you expect to be sleeping in the
    open, or even in a breezy three-season tent. GoreTex and
    Dryloft add about two ounces to the weight, and are only used
    in top-of-the-line bags that cost $300 or more. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Insulation Choices </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sleeping bag insulations produce loft between the inner
    and outer shells. Inside this loft the tiny fibers of the
    insulation (down or synthetic) create &quot;dead&quot; air
    space. This dead air space is what keeps the warm air warm,
    and the cold air out. </p>
    <p>In the early 1990's four new synthetic insulations became
    widely available: Lite Loft, Microloft, Primaloft, and
    Polarguard HV. The two down insulations, available for
    millions of years, are grades: good quality 550 fill power
    and great quality 700 fill power. </p>
    <p>The new synthetics are a vast improvement over the old
    Hollofil, Quallofil, and Polarguard. A good twenty-degree
    mummy with these new fills weighs about three pounds,
    compared to about four pounds for the old fills. A comparable
    down bag weighs about 2.5 pounds. </p>
    <p>A three-pound, twenty-degree Lite Loft, Microloft, or
    Primaloft bag will stuff to about 8&quot;x15&quot;, or 750
    cubic inches. A similar down bag will stuff to
    7&quot;x14&quot;, or 500 cubic inches. The down bag thus
    saves 6&quot;x6&quot;x6&quot; of pack volume! </p>
    <p>The North Face twenty-degree Cat's Meow Polarguard HV also
    weighs three pounds, but its supplied stuff sack is a large
    10&quot;x17&quot;, or about 1300 cubic inches. This is a
    durable bag, but much too large for my recommended style of
    travel. </p>
    <p>The allure of synthetics is they maintain ninety percent
    of their insulating power when soaked with water. They simply
    don't retain much water, and dry quickly. Conversely, down
    loses ninety percent of its loft and warmth if soaked, and
    takes a very long time to dry. </p>
    <p>Therefore it follows that wet down could lead to
    hypothermia and death at one extreme, and at minimum
    discomfort and aggravation. While I took a down bag through
    the tropics several times without problems, it was far from
    the ideal insulator since down absorbs moisture from humid
    air. On the other hand I didn't need much, if any,
    insulation, and found it easy to dry the slight dampness
    under occasional hotel room fans. The real danger comes in
    cold and rainy climates where everyone must be careful to
    keep down dry. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Hence synthetics are best for the tropics, cold and very
    damp areas such as southeastern Alaska and the Pacific
    Northwest, and for river-running. </p>
    <p>Nevertheless down remains the most popular insulation
    among travel backpackers. It is still twenty percent lighter
    than the best synthetics, stuffs thirty percent smaller,
    feels luxurious, and is at least three times more durable.
    Furthermore, most travelers are able to keep their down
    sleeping bags dry all the time. My nylon-shelled down bag has
    been damp a few times, but I've never had a major problem. </p>
    <p>A good stuff sack is important, but note that stuff sacks
    with &quot;dust flaps&quot; are only water resistant, not
    waterproof. If you are traveling on or around water, lining
    your stuff sack with a plastic bag and sealing it should
    eliminate most risk. A well-sealed tent or bivy sack will
    keep rain from above away, although you should be careful not
    to pitch it in a low area where water could gather
    underneath. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">How Much to Spend on a Sleeping Bag </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>In many hostels many backpackers leave their sleeping bags
    on their beds all day. I often do. And when I do, I'm glad my
    bag is not a $500 GoreTex superbag. And when my pack is
    thrown on top of a bus and I don't see it again for a day,
    I'm also glad my bag isn't so valuable. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 align="center">Sleeping Bag Care and Maintenance </h4>

<blockquote>
    <p>Never dry-clean any sleeping bag. The risk is too great
    that a destructive solvent will be used, even if they say
    they won't. Solvents and fumes may be retained in the
    insulation, producing skin irritation or an allergic
    reaction. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Don't put your sleeping bag in a top-loading, agitator
    washing machine. The agitator could damage it, internally if
    not externally. Instead, use a front-loading, heavy duty
    laundromat machine that is usually dubbed
    &quot;superwasher&quot; or &quot;doublewasher.&quot; These
    machines spin very fast, but they don't use an agitator. Use
    the warm setting and add a little gentle, easy-rinsing soap
    such as Woolite or Down Suds. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To dry, set the dryer temperature on low or medium and
    throw it in. High temperatures could be harmful. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Don't overwash your sleeping bag. Try spotwashing for
    soiled areas. I wash my bag after several months of use. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Don't store any sleeping bag in its stuff sack longer than
    necessary. This quashes the loft of any bag. Soon after
    reaching a campsite, hostel, or hotel, I remove my bag and
    fluff it with a few shakes. For home storage put it in a
    large cotton bag, which is supplied with most good bags.<br>
    <br>

        <dd>$140, 2 lbs. 4 oz. Mummy. 550 fill down with nylon
            inner and outer lining. Stuff sack: 7x14&quot;. Cut
            wide at the shoulders (32&quot;), but of average,
            slightly-constricting mummy-width from the knees on
            down. Not a great bag, but a good bag that has served
            well on my last four trips. My personal rating for my
            bag is about +30° F. <em>(Pictured above.)</em></dd>

            allowing the bag to be opened into a comforter. A

<h2 align="center">Sleeping <a name="pads">Pads </a></h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>The primary purpose of a sleeping pad isn't comfort, but
    to insulate yourself from Mother Earth so she doesn't suck
    all the heat out of you via conduction. When nighttime
    temperatures fall into the 50's and lower, you need a
    sleeping pad to overcome this powerful, heat-robbing effect.
    Of course only camping travelers need a sleeping pad. </p>

    <p>For general spring, summer, and fall travel two products
    stand out: Cascade Designs' Therm-A-Rest Staytek Lite and the
    GVG Pack-Mat Lite. These are open-cell foam pads with
    waterproof covers. You open the valve at one corner and
    within a minute or two they magically self-inflate. They have
    double the insulating power and are thicker and more
    comfortable than most closed-cell foam pads. You can blow in
    a few breaths to make it firmer and significantly increase
    insulating power, or let out air to make it softer. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Their best feature, however, is that they roll-up small
    enough to fit inside your pack. Thicker and heavier models
    are available, but are unnecessary for spring, summer, and
    fall travel. For camping in winter conditions you can use a
    self-inflatable in conjunction with a full-length, 1/2 or 5/8
    inch closed cell foam pad. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Regular closed-cell foam pads are lighter and cheaper
    (about $10 and 12 oz.), but they consume two to four times as
    much volume, requiring that they be lashed to the outside of
    the pack. After getting on and off a few crowded buses and
    subways, you'll be happy to have spent the extra money on a
    compact, self-inflating pad. <br>

<h3 align="center">Sleeping Pad Repair</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>If you cannot find a leak by sight or sound, fill the pad
    with air, close the valve, roll-up half the pad and put
    pressure there with your knees. Then pour a little water on
    the remaining portion to check for air bubbles. Repeat on the
    rest of the pad until the leak is found. Otherwise you'll
    need a tub. Repair with nylon tape or rubber cement. <br>

        <dt><strong>Therm-A-Rest Ultra Lite II 3/4</strong></dt>
        <dd>$47, 14 oz. 47x20x1&quot; (that's one inch thick).
            Rolled size: 5x11&quot;. Short length leaves the feet
            without insulation, but most users place clothes or
            their pack under their feet, if necessary. I have
            happily used the previous &quot;Ultralite 3/4&quot;

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Therm-A-Rest Staytek Long</strong></dt>
        <dd>$62, 40 oz. 72x20x1.5&quot;. Rolled size: 5x21&quot;
            (It can also be rolled to about 8x11&quot;.) This
            thicker, full-length pad will go a long way toward
            keeping you warm while winter camping.</dd>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>GVG Pack-Mat 3/4 Lite</strong></dt>
        <dd>$55, 13 oz. 47x20x0.8&quot;. Rolled size: 4x11&quot;.
            Made with a non-slip polyurethane cover. This
            French-made pad is the lightest and smallest-packing
            self-inflator. Popular in Europe, but hard to find in
            the States. </dd>

        <dt><strong>GVG Pack-Mat Long</strong></dt>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Generic closed cell foam pad</strong></dt>
        <dd>From 6 to $16, from 8 to 14 oz., various sizes. Range
            in thickness from 1/4&quot; to 5/8&quot;. They are
            light and cheap, but not compact--all must be
            fastened to the outside of your pack. If money is
            tight, take heart that many camping travel
            backpackers use closed-cell pads and get around fine.
            For summer travel try cutting a thin 1/4 or 3/8 inch
            pad to just what you need.</dd>

Barriers</strong></font><font color="#000000"><br>
</font><font color="#000000" size="4"><em>Or,<br>
What to do in face of bone-freezing cold and howling Jupitian
wind<br>
<br>
<br>
</em></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000000">If for some reason you must spend a
    night at a temperature far below your sleeping bag's rating,
    a vapor barrier could save your life. First, put on all your
    clothes, <em>but you must have good quality wicking fabrics
    next to your skin</em>. Then get inside the large garbage bag
    you have been carrying for emergencies, and wriggle inside
    your sleeping bag in an area as wind-protected as possible.
    Pull the garbage bag tightly across your chest or neck so
    little air can escape. Your head, of course, must always
    remain outside the garbage bag. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">This system dramatically reduces
    evaporative heat loss because your body adjusts to the high
    humidity micro-climate inside the plastic bag. The wicking
    action of your clothes prevents your skin from becoming damp
    and cold. However, <em>if the layer next to your skin is
    cotton, water will not wick away and you may freeze to death
    from your own perspiration.</em> </font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000">You can also line the inside of your
    sleeping bag with an aluminum space blanket, or put bread
    bags over your feet. I used the space blanket/sleeping bag
    combination with success in late fall Germany and
    Czechoslovakia when both overnight temperatures and my
    synthetic loft simultaneously plummeted. Some mountaineers
    routinely employ vapor barriers since they add twenty to
    thirty degrees of protection for almost no weight. <br>
