<FONT SIZE="+3">D</FONT>egas couldn't go to the circus and just enjoy the performers.<BR> He had to
sketch them during the performance and then rush back<BR>to the studio to transfer what he had seen--and recorded--to canvas. This work is unusual as it shows  two horses performing
but is unusual in another aspect.<BR>The artist failed to get the riders' feet connected to  the backs of the horses; the<BR>riders seem to float in the air like puppets on a string.
