<FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>t is not widely known that Whistler first painted his mother wearing a blue gown in a blue room. When she was allowed to see the finished painting she was not happy. "I hate it!" she screamed. "I hate <B><I>blue!</B></I> Please destroy it!" Well, Whistler did not destroy it; he made a second version, 
<I>Arrangement in Gray and Black</I>, that is now in Mus&#233;e d'Orsay, Paris. 
Whereabouts of the blue version is unknown.
