<FONT SIZE="+3">M</FONT>asterpieces do not just happen; they are more often the product of trial and error and this picture helps prove the point. It is an early version of Marcel Duchamp's famous painting, <I>Nude Descending a Staircase</I>, that shocked the art world when it was shown at the infamous Armory show in New York in 1913. In this version, probably from  1908-09, the figures still look like real people. You can see the final version today at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
