<FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>n 1938 the curator of a blockbuster show for a major 

museum asked to borrow the romantic <I>Girl on a Swing</I> by Jean Honoré Fragonard (1732-1806)

from London'sWallace Collection; the request was denied. Under terms of its bequeath, the Wallace Collection cannot make loans. So the curator commissioned a notorious forger to make 

a copy of  <I>Girl</I>  for use in his show--and <I>this</I> is that forgery. Following the show, the 

picture was purchased by Herman Goering who presented it to Adolph Hitler. Its present

whereabouts is unknown.  <B><A HREF="BIGSWING.HTM" tppabs="http://www.erols.com/browndk/bigswing.htm"> (Detail)</A></B><P>
