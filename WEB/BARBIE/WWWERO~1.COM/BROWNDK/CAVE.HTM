<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>here are several startling aspects to this annonymous and recently discovered picture.  First, the artist was a woman! <i>And</I> a wife. <i>And</i> a mother.  And skirts were short in 11,000 B.C. But most startling of all is the medium she is using: crayon. Can this be true? Or is the whole thing just another art hoax?<P>
