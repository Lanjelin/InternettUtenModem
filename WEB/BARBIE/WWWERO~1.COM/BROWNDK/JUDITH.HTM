<B>Judith and Holofernes</B><BR>Artemisia Gentileschi
<BR>(1597?-after 1651)
<P>
<blockquote>

<FONT SIZE="+3">P</FONT>reviously in <B><I>The Barbie Chronicles</I></B>, this painting was attributed to 
Caravaggio but a 
knowledgeable and sharp-eyed visitor to the site suggested it was more 
likely by Artemisia
Gentilleschi who made a career painting the Judith saga. A contemporary 
of another
highly regarded woman artist of the 17th century,  Dutch painter Judith 
Leyster (1609-1660),
Artemisia was an admirer of Caravaggio's chiaroscuro style. Comparison 
of brush strokes
confirmed that this painting is by Artemisia and not by Caravaggio. The 
original erroneous 
attribution is regretted. <P>
A favorite subject of artists for nearly 400 
years, the Biblical story of Judith equals that of  Salome for gore but 
there is one major difference: Judith is a good guy.<BR> With her  servant, 
she attempts to persuade the lecherous  enemy general,<BR> Holofernes, to 
spare her village from death and destruction. When all else fails and 
with the help of  ample portions of viands and vino, the women separate 
Holoferenes'  head from his body at the neck.  <B><A HREF="BIGJUDIT.HTM" tppabs="http://www.erols.com/browndk/bigjudit.htm"> (Detail)</A></B><P>
