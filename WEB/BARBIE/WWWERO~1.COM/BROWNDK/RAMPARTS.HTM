<FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>t is not clear from an examination of this picture what "Liberty" is leading. Or who. Extensive x-ray studies were inconclusive. A similar picture by Delacroix in the Louvre, Paris, may have been the inspiration for this picture although there are several discrepancies: the flags are different--one French, the other American. And while Delacroix's "Liberty" is bare-headed, "Liberty" in this picture wears a steel helmet which places the picture in the mid-20th century. But the military style camoflague uniform suggests an even later date. As the picture is neither signed nor dated and its provenance totally unknown, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions. <B><A HREF="BIGRAMP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.erols.com/browndk/bigramp.htm">(Detail)</A></B><P>
