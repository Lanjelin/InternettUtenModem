<B>Dean Brown </B> 
has been making Barbie pictures since 1981 when a daughter gave
him a Barbie
for his birthday and suggested that the doll might make a good
model. Fifteen
years and some 300 pictures later, his work has been exhibited at
the Tartt
Gallery in Washington, D. C., in group shows at The Kitchen in
New York City,
at Guild Hall, East Hampton, NY, and at galleries in
California
and
Washington State.<P>Three pictures from his art history
portfolio,
"A
Capricious Chronicle of Western Art," are included in "FOREVER
BARBIE The
Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll" by M. G. Lord and
published by William
Morrow, New York, in 1994.<P>

Brown's conventional photography--he
calls it
"straight"--has appeared in numerous magazines, text books and
television
commercials since 1970. Extensive travels have taken him to many
of the
world's major art museums and provided inspiration for many of
the Barbie art
history pictures.<P>

Father of four children and grandfather of six,
Dean Brown
lives with his wife of nearly fifty years, the former Mary Ella
Lamb, in
Bethesda, Maryland.<P>
