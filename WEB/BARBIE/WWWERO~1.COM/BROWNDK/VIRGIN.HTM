<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>his is very early Titian. Althought it isn't dated, it is clear that the greatest of 
the Venetian Renaissance artists was not more than ten when he did this Assumption,
assuming it is an Assumption. (Could it be an Ascenscion?) But the soft, luxuriant 
drapery
 folds that mark his mature work are not yet present. Nor is the vibrant "Titian red" 
<BR>that later became his personal trademark.
