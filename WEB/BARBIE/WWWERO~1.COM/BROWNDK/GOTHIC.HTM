<FONT SIZE="+3">W</FONT>hile still a teenager, Grant Wood painted this picture of
his parents as stern disciplinarians. His art teacher was impressed
and thought it deserved a fancy title. Many years later
Wood returned to the subject and gave it a 
new title. <I>American Gothic</I>, an icon of American art,
can be seen at the Art Institute of Chicago.
