<B>The Two Majas</B><BR>
Francisco de Goya <BR>(1746 - 1828)<P>

<FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>t is undisputed that Goya, as crazy as he was, was also a great artist. He was not, however, as can be seen in the picture on the left, a premier fashion designer. One can only wonder 
why he titled the picture "Maja Clothed" when the clothes are so ugly. <P>
Perhaps the reason for the Maja Clothed was Goya's embarrassment:
The model was unaware the artist was portraying her nude. When she discovered the great 
deception, Goya hurriedly hid the nude version and quickly produced the 
clothed version. When she finally saw the nude version, the model
was pleased and paid top peso for both pictures. Both pictures can be seen today in the Prado, Madrid.<P>
