<FONT SIZE="+3">A</FONT>  very rich and very distinguished doll collector had long admired the

triple portrait of "The Wyndham Sisters" by John Singer Sargent in New

York's Metropolitan museum of Art. Wouldn't it be wonderful, she

thought, if Sargent would do a portrait like that of my dolls?

Arrangements were made and Sargent made this portrait for the collector.

And then she awoke.
