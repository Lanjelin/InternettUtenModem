<FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>f ever there was a compulsive artist it was Degas.<BR>He found a subject he liked and he did it over and over, again and again. A woman bathing
was just one of his compulsions. Ballet dancers, washer women, horses and circus performers were his almost exclusive subjects throughout his long career. An occasional portrait apparently broke the monotony.
