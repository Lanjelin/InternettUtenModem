<FONT SIZE="+3">I</FONT>t may be apophyracal, but there is a story that Jim Dine's sister
gave him a robe for his birthday. One day she put her Barbie doll in the pocket--and 
Jim said, "There's a picture!" And he painted his first robe picture.
The next year she gave him a necktie--and that was the first necktie picture
he painted. The next year, she gave him a hammer--and that was the beginning of his 
tool series. It is hoped that Jim was generous in sharing  profits
he created from his sister's generosity.
