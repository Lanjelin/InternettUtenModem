&Eacute;douard Manet<BR>(1832 - 1883)<P><blockquote><blockquote>


<FONT SIZE="+3">S</FONT>ome say this is really Olympia standing up. In her underwear.
But she remains a kept woman, symbolized by Manet
and later by Emile Zola in his novel of the same name to represent 
the poor young women of  19th century France who came to Paris for fame
and fortune--or at least for someone to provide food, clothing and shelter.
It is not a pretty story.
