<FONT SIZE="+3">H</FONT>ere we see a very early self-portrait by photographer Cindy 
Sherman--except it is not a self-portrait. It is a photograph made by
Cindy Sherman of Cindy Sherman posing as a 1940s pin-up model, an
early 
work because the "model" is nude; the artist/photographer had not yet
obtained the extensive costume wardrobe that later allowed her to
pose 
herself as B-movie-star, housewife, killer, pregnant woman or
historical 
and mythological figures.
