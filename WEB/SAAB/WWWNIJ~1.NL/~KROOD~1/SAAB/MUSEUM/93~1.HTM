vspace=5 hspace=10>Only three years 
after the first comprehensive model change, it was time 
to improve the two-stroke Saab yet again. The Saab 93 was presented on 
December 1, 1955 as the 1956 model. And it was an extensively redesigned 
Saab; a new threecylinder 748 cc engine developing 33 bhp - smaller swept 
volume than the <A href="92~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/92.html">Saab 
92</a> but more power. The engine 
was arranged conventionally lengthwise as distinct from the transcersely-mounted 
engine in the <A href="92~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/92.html">Saab 
92</a>. Coil springs replaced the torsion bars, 
the front suspension was radically modified and a 12 volt electrical system was 
fitted. The gearbox was also completely new, but still with only three 
speeds and a steering column change. Tubeless tyres were standard and a 
standard and several new colours were introduced. All in all, the Saab 93 
was a completely new car and the numerous engineering modifications were 
underscored by a change in the carss styling. Sixten Sason had designed a 
new front section for the Saab 93, although the divided windscreen was 
still retained for two more years. In April 1957, Saab buyers were 
offered and automatic clutch called Saxomat as an optional extra.<br>
With the Saab 93, the Saab motor company now had a car that was eminently 
suitable for export. It was at this time that the first cars were sold in 
the United States, Spain, Portugal and many other faraway countries.
