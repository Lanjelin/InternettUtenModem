During the first 20 years of its 
car-making history, Saab produced only small cars. A larger model - the 
<A href="99~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/99.html">Saab 
99</a> - did not emerge until 1967, 
but it then became the platform for further development work towards 
exclusive sporty cars. It all started with the Saab 99 EMS, and continued 
with the 99 Turbo and the Saab 900.<br>
Thoughts of a new, even larger Saab first began to stir back in 1974. In 
the shadow of the energy crisis, a roomier and more energy-efficient Saab 
began to emerge - the Saab 9000.<br>
The Saab 9000 was launched in  May 1984, after 10 million kilometres of 
road testing under all conditions. Along the same lines as on the Saab 
99, the first cars were well disguised in the bodies of their 
predecessors - the early 9000s were hidden under the bodyshell of the 
900. The Saab 9000 Turbo 16 in the museum is the first production car and 
its chassis number is 1001. The normally aspirated, fuel injection Saab 
9000I was unveiled about one year later. Yet another variant- the 
four-door Saab 9000 CD with a conventional boot - was launched in the 
winter of 1988.
