Robert J. Sinclair, President of Saab-Scania of America, was the 
initiator of the Saab 900 Turbo 16 Convertible unveiled in 1983. But the 
Saab Design Department, headed by Bj&ouml;rn Envall, had already started 
sketching an open-top Saab 900. It was felt that the demand for it was in 
the air.<br>
The Saab 900 Turbo 16 Convertible was first shown as a design study at 
the International Motor Show in Frankfurt in the autumn of 1983, 
pricipally to gauge the interest of the motoring public. The prototype 
car had been built by the American Sunroof Company (ASC) to Saabs 
drawings.<br>
The prototype aroused enormous interest - particularly among dealers 
around the world. In April 1984, a decision was made to take the car into 
production at the Saab-Valmet plant in Uusikaupunkki, Finland. Production 
started during spring 1986.<br>
The Saab 900 Turbo 16 Convertible is an open car, manufactured under 
perfectly standard production conditions and subjected to the same 
rigorous quality inspection as other Saab cars. Saab-Valmets experience 
of special cars (such as the Saab 900 CD - a lengthened version of the 
Saab 900 Turbo) and their flexible production resources are perfect for 
the Convertible. The special parts for the top are produced by the 
American Sunroof Company. The Saab 900 Turbo 16 Convertible includes 
about 300 special parts that differ from those of the corresponding 
two-door Saab 900 Turbo 16 Sedan.
