Only two years after production of the <A 
href="99~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/99.html">Saab 99</a> 
started, work was begun on a new project - X14. It might not have been 
quite as exciting as the X designation suggested, but it did have a 
revolutionary effect on the approach to motoring in many quarters. 
Essentially, it was a hatchback - a cross between a comfortable family 
saloon and an out-and-out station wagon - called the Combi 
Coup&eacute;.<br>
The Saab 99 Combi Coup&eacute; entered the market just after the New 
Year in 1974. Shortly before, Saab had wondered wether the Combi 
Coup&eacute; hatchback concept might not be a good idea for the <A 
href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 96</a> as 
well.<br>
The Saab Design Centre, under the leadership of Bj&ouml;rn Envall, 
produced sketches for the 1974 Saab 98, on the floorplan of a <A 
href="95~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/95.html">Saab 
95</a>. 
The prototype was manufactured by the Italian Coggiola. But the Saab 
management did not think the Saab 98 was worth developing. Apart from 
that, there was already the <A 
href="95~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/95.html">Saab 95</a> as 
a practical family car of a size just below that of the <A 
href="99_COM~2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/99_combicoupe.html">Saab 99 
Combi Coup&eacute;</a>.<br>
The experimental Saab 98 was painted in one of the 1974 new colours, 
Sienna brown, and had the same model years new front grille of plastic. A 
neat, driveable tin box of which only one exists.
