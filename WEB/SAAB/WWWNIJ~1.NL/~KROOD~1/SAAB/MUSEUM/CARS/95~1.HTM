After ten years as a motor manufacturer, Saab broadened its product range 
in 1959 by introducing the Saab 95 station wagon. It was unveiled to the 
public in May, but production did not get underway until late in the 
autumn.<br>
The first Saab 95s were a curious mixture of components - they had the 
still unannounced model 96s 841 cc engine and a four-speed gearbox, while 
the rear-hinged doors and facia came from the <A

93</a>. 
Saab 95s manufactured in the first years did not have a spoiler at the rear of the 
roof as laster cars did. The spoiler directed a flow of air down the rear 
window to keep it free from dirt sucked in behind by the cars slipstream. 
Incidentally, a transitional model at the end of the 1960s had 
front-hinged doors  but no spoiler. Production was highly flexible - the 
parts left over at the end of a production year were used as thought the 
best.<br>
The Saab 95 was an extremely versatile station wagon. Its loadcarrying 
capacity was an impressive 500 kg and the load could varried in a number 
of ways. Inside the luggage compartment was a foldaway bench seat for two 
facing backwards.<br>
Accordingly, the Saab 95 was a 7-seater, 5-seater or 2-seater, depending 
on the needs.<br>
Over the years, the Saab 95 underwent the same changes as the <A 
href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 
96</a>. So the latter has front seats from the <A 
href="99~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/99.html">Saab 
99</a> as the model years new feature. <P>
