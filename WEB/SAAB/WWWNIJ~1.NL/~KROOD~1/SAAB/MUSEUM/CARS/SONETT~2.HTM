vspace=5 hspace=10>By the winter of 
1966 the <A 
href="MFI13~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/MFI13.html">MFI 
13</a>/ Saab 97 project had made such 
progress that the new sports car could be put on show earlier than expected - and 
on its home ground in Stockholm, not in New York as originally planned. 
The show car was a pre-production unit and it had to come no closer to 
full-scale production even when the Saab Sonett II made its international 
debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1966.<br>
The basic shape of the <A 
href="MFI13~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/MFI13.html">MFI 
13</a> was very much in evidence, only 
the front had been slightly lengthened and given a somewhat more agressive look. 
The entire front part of the car tilted up to provide access service and 
maintenance - a more easily repairable car would be difficult to 
find.<br>
The engine was taken from <A 
href="MONTEC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/montecarlo.html">the 
Monte Carlo model</a> and 
developed 60 bhp, partly due to three carburettors. Production at the ASJ (railway 
equipment) workshops in Arlov started late in 1966. Altogether, only 28 
Saab Sonett II cars were made that year - three pre-production cars and 
25 production models which were also practically hand-built.<br>
Not very many more twostroke Saab Sonetts were made, because when the 
Saab 96 was fitted with the V4 engine, the Sonett II was also modified to 
accomodate the more potent power unit. The result was a larger bulge in 
the bonnet which, while telling all and sundry that this was a <A 
href="SONETT~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/Sonett.html">Saab 
Sonett</a> with the new engine, rather spoilt the lines of the car.
