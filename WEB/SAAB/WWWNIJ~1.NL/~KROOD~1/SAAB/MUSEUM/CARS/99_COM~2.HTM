vspace=5 hspace=10>In 1977, Saab 
ushered in a new epoch in the automotive world. 
After broad-based testing with a hundred 1977 cars (three-door with EMS 
equipment, serial numbers 900-999) lasting for six months, a production 
version of the Saab 99 Turbo was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show on 
September 13, 1977. The show car had a special white pearl finish and can 
now be seen in the Saab museum.<br>
The background to the development of the turbocharged engine was the 
demand for more power from a two-litre, four-cylinder engine, without 
increasing its fuel consumption. Saab solved the problem by fitting the 
engine with a light-weight turbocharger that does not run under ordinary 
motoring conditions - that is to say for about 85 per cent of the time. 
On flooring the accelerator, the turbocharger cuts in and delivers a 
hefty power boost.<br>
Saabs first-generation turbocharged engine produced 145 bhp and gave the 
car a top speed of nearly 200 km/h. Acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h took 
8.9 seconds.<br>
Of almost more importance is the overtaking acceleration provided by the 
Turbo engine. The Saab 99 Combi Coup&eacute; Turbo accelerates from 60 to 
100 
km/h in only nine seconds, the kind of performance that makes for safer 
overtaking.
