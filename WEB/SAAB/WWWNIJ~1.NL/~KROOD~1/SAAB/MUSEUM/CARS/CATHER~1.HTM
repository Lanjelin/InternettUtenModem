vspace=5 hspace=10>Catherina, the 
sports car prototype, began as a private project in the 
early 1960s. Saabs stylist at that time, Sixten Sason, who worked on a 
freelance basis, drew up sketches of a small sports coup&eacute; for 
himself. A model is preserved in the Saab museum. At about this time, 
plans for a new Saab sports car after the first Sonett in 1956 began to 
take shape. Sixten Sason was commissioned to adapt his car to possible 
full-scale production and, in January 1963, work started on it in 
earnest. In May of the same year, assembly of the prototype was begun at 
the ASJ (railway equipment) wokrshops in Katrineholm (hence the 
Catherina).<br>
On April 2, 196, the prototype was shown for the first time in 
Link&ouml;ping Sports Centre. It had a number of futuristic features such 
as the removable Targa top, while other Sason refinements were left out 
in its adaptation for production. One of the things Sixten Sason wanted 
was roofmounted headlamps to give longer range on dipped beams. 
Incidentally, some of the Catherinas lines are incorporated in the <A

99</a> which was also on Sixten Sasons drwaing board at this time.<br>
However, test driving showed that quite a lot of development work still 
remained to be done on Catherina before she could be put into 
production.<br>
Meanwhile, a competitor had appeared on the horizon - Bj&ouml;rn 
Karlstr&ouml;ms and Bj&ouml;rn Andreassons <A

comparison of 
the cars turned out in favour of the <A 
href="MFI13~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/MFI13.html">MFI 13</a>. It 
subsequently formed 
the basis of the <A 
href="SONETT~2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/SonettII.html">Saab 
Sonett II</a> and Catherina was relegated to the museum for good. <P>
