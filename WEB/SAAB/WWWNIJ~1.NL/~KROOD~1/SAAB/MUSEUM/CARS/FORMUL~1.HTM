Formula Junior was an international class for single-seat racing cars in 
1959. It was conceived as a training ground for young drivers who in 
addition would also be able to build their own cars. The rules stated 
that the engine had to come from a standard car and furthermore that no 
exotic valve arrangements were permitted.<br>
As might have been expected, not all that many home-built Formula Junior 
cars had any real chance of winning races. It was not long before the 
established racing car manufacturers  - Lola, Cooper, Lotus, Elva, 
Stanguellini, Osca - dominated the winners stand.<br>
In 1960 some enthusiast at Saabs combined testing and competition 
department decided to have a go at Formula Junior, even though Saabs 
standard engine was way below the cylinder displacement limit of 1100 cc. 
they constructed an advanced monocoque car in contrast to the space frame 
designs of their competitors. The three-cylinder two-stroke was installed 
horizontally in front of the gearbox and the Saab Formula Junior 
naturally had front-wheel drive. Engine output was now in the region of 
86 bhp but 70 per cent of the weight was over the front wheels and the 
car was wildly understeered. On the straights it left the other cars 
behind ant it could brake later than they were able to. All the same, its 
performance was not fully competitive and after a couple of seasons the 
Saab Formula Junior was discontinued. Two cars were built. They were 
piloted by G&ouml;sta Karlsson, Carl-Magnus Skogh and Erik Carlsson.
