<P>
Full scale production of the Saab 92 was begun in December 1949. So the 
first cars offered to the public were 1950 models and 700 of them were 
made in all. The 1951 model was identical to the 1950 model except that 
the instruments were of VDO manufacture. A total of 1246 Saab cars were 
manufactured in 1950, all of them green. Production gradually increased 
to more than 2000 units a year and the target of 8000 cars in four years 
was exceeded by 1000. The magic figure of 8000 came about because 
Philipsons, the main distributor for Saab at the start, had guaranteed to 
sell that quantity - and had also paid a hefty sum in advance.<br>

In spite of the fact that in early years the Saab 92 had a number of 
peculiarities - no boot lid, for example; luggage had to be loaded via 
the rear seat - the car sold easily. It was stable and robust, used a 
minimum of fuel and displayed excellent roadholding on the poorly 
maintained roads of that time. Also worth noting is how Swedish the Saab 
was. Only 17 per cent of the price of a Saab 92 was accounted for the 
imported components or materials.
