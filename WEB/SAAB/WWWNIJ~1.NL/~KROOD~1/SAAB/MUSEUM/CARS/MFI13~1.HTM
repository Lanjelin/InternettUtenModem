Karlstr&ouml;m, draughtsman, stylist and designer, was full of 
ideas about manufacturing cars in Sweden in the 1950s. he succeeded in 
getting a manufacturer enthusiastic about sports car project based on 
standard Saab components. The manufacturer was Malm&ouml; Flygindustri, 
MFI, and the code name was MFI 13 (which was impossible to use for an 
aircraft - pilots are too supertitious).<br>
Work on the MFI 13 began in 1964 with the knowledge and approval of Saab. 
There was some hope that a development grant for manufacture in southern 
Norrland county might be forthcoming, and when Heinels coachbuilding 
works in Malm&ouml; produced the first body of sheet steel, great care 
was taken to ensure that the panels could be used as moulds for future 
production of plastic bodies.<br>
But the Norrland grant did not materialise and Saab stepped into the 
picture. The MFI turned out to be a better car than Sixten Sasons 
<A

was therefore the car Saab chose as 
the <A 
href="SONETT~2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/SonettII.html">Sonett 
II</a>. The MFI 13 was renamed the Saab 97 and the car was ready for production within 
six months.<br>
It was altogether the same as the prototype, but its basic lines are 
retained to a surprising degree. The only prototype had a tuned engine 
with three carburettors and an exhaust whose noise defies desciption. It 
is reasonable fast with a top speed of 150 km/h and quite lively - from 
rest to 100 km/h in 13.7 seconds, which was as good or better than the 
competition at that time could manage.
