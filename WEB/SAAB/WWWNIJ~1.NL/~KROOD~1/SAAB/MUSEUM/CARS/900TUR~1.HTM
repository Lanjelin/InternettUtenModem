<P>
The early spring of 1980 was a busy time for Saab folk at all levels. 
Scarcely had the sounds of the send-off party for the last model 96 died 
away in Uusikaupunkki before the APC system was launched in February. APC 
stands for <EM>A</EM>utomatic <EM>P</EM>erformance <EM>C</EM>ontrol, which 
means that the engine 
automatically adapts itself to different grades of petrol by raising or 
lowering the turbo boost pressure.<br>

Barely a month later came the next new Saab development; the Saab 900 
Turbo Sedan. A four-door car with a regular boot as distinct from the 
Combi Coup&eacute;'s more practical hatchback. The saloon version was 
Saabs way of meeting the demand for elegant continental versions of the 
900 Turbo model which had up to then only been obtainable with the 
practical hatchback body.<br>
The Saab 900 Turbo Sedan made its debut at the international Geneva Motor 
Show and the show car had a unique reddish-gold metallic finish. The 
saloon version of the 900 was further proof of the ability of a 
specialised motor manufacturer to adapt to fluctuations in demand quickly 
- and at minimum cost.
