vspace=5 hspace=10>At the same 
time as Saabs engineers felt ready to get started on a new 
model series, stricter collision safety requirements were announced by 
the U.S. authorities. Cars were required to be driven into a barrier at 
30 mph (about 50 km/h) carrying two passengers and luggage, without more 
than one-fourth of the windscreen surround sustaining damage. Saab could 
have passed this test by modifying the 
<A href="99~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/99.html">Saab 
99</a>, but there was at the same 
time a need for renewal without fancy trimmings. The answer was the Saab 
900, half of it newly designed and half of the best from the <A

99</a>. 
The basic body of Combi Coupe hatchback type is 12 cm longer than the 
corresponding <A

99</a>, the wheelbase 5 cm longer. Its roadholding 
was improved by redesigning a number of chassis components. Also new as 
compared with the 99 was the facia. And under the right-handed grille on 
top of the bonnet was a worldexclusive automotive innovation; a 
ventilation air filter for the interior that traps dust, pollen and even 
certain bacteria - good news for all those who suffer from allergies.<br>
Right from the outset, the Saab 900 was offered with a comprehensive 
range of engine alternatives - from the carburettor engine developing 100 
bhp to the Turbo unit with 145 bhp. The Saab 900 in the museum us a GLE 
version for the U.S. market with an injection engine. Its chassis serial 
number is 00017. It was long used as a general purpose delivery vehicle 
in the Trollh&auml;ttan factory area before being pensioned off, dolled 
up and put on show in the museum.
