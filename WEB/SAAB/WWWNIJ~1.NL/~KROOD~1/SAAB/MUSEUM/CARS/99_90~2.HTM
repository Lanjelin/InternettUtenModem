turbocharged Saab 99 models were manufactured in 1980, 
but the basic model was retained right up to 1984. However, the Saab 99s 
successor, the Saab 90, came at the same time as the introduction of the

9000</a>.<br>
By then - in May 1984 - about 590000 cars with the Saab 99 model 
designation had been manufactured and, since its launch in 1967, 
practically every important point except the styling had been modified. 
Even the last model year incorporated a number of improvements, such as a 
breakerless ignition system, a different steering wheel angle and lower 
seats. The cherry-red Saab 99 in the Saab museum collection was the last 
one to be manufactured.<br>
The Saab 90 was manufactured up to and including the 1987 model. The very 
last car produced is now in the Saab museum.
