<P>
The Saab 92B was presented in December 1952. It had so many new features 
that Saab felt an extra letter in the model designation was more than 
justified. Most of all, the new model had a boot lid, so the boot was at 
least accesible from outside the car. It also had a larger rear window, 
and since the fuel tank filler cap had previously been located cenrtally 
at the rear, it had to be moved to the left-hand rear wing. The seats 
were padded with foam rubber and the front seat backrests were shaped to 
give better lateral support. The rear seat was easily removable to make 
room for extra luggage, far from least, the Saab 92B was available in a 
range of colours.<br>

In only two more years, in 1954, it was time for even more changes. The 
engine was modified with a new carburettor and ignition coil, which 
raised its power output to 28 bhp. Furthermore, the carburettor featured 
preheating to prevent icing in very cold weather. Externally, the 1954 
Saab was decorated with chromium trim on the wings. The paintwork was now 
synthetic. A sunroof was also offered as an optional extra.
