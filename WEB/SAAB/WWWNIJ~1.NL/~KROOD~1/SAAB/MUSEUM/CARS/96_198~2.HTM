vspace=5 hspace=10>An epoch came 
to an end in January 1980 when the very last Saab 96 was 
assembled at Saab-Valmet in Uusukaupunkki, Finland. It was then 20 years 
since the model was first introduced and 30 years since the first Saab of 
all - the <A 
href="92~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/92.html">92</a> 
model - rolled out of the works. The last 300 
<A href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 96</a>s were 
given an aquamarine metallic finish 
and equipped with elegant pluche upholstery and spoked light alloy wheels.<br>
The last <A href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 96</a> of 
all was driven the whole way from Uusikaupunkki to 
the museum in Trollh&auml;ttan by Erik Carlsson. The figures 730607 stand 
for 
the number of base model Saabs- the <A 
href="92~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/92.html">92</a>, <A 
href="93~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/93.html">93</a>, <A 
href="95~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/95.html">95</a> 
and <A 
href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">96</a> - 
manufactured. If 
only the 96s are counted then the figure will be 547000. The best single 
year for the Saab 96/95 was 1965 when more than 40000 cars were manufactured.
