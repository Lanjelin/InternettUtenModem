Concealing the 
transistion from a three-cylinder 
two-stroke to a four-cylinder four-stroke engine in the <A 
href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 96</a> posed no 
problems whatsoever. There was plenty of space under the bonnet of the restyled 
<A href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 
96</a>. A more difficult problem was road testing the <A 
href="99~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/99.html">Saab 99</a> without it 
being prematurely revealed. In 1966, it was no longer enough to just test 
components and systems in ordinary 96s. A complete chassis with engine 
and everything for the new car had to be driven on the open roads.<br>
Saabs solution to the problem of secrecy was to build the Toad - a <A 
href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 
96</a> body widened by 20 cm and mounted on a <A 
href="99~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/99.html">Saab 99</a> floor 
pan. Numerous Swedish motorists have encountered this car without noticing anything 
remarkable about it. To be on the safe side, the Toad was driven mostly 
at night, but it still proved impossible to keep it secret for any length 
of time. Unwisely, a similar Saab followed behind the Toad while it was 
on test. Similar - well, it was an ordinary 96 model of the same colour 
and the difference was noticed by the newspaper Expressen. Seen side by 
side, the two cars are obviously not the same. What Expressen didnt know 
was that there were as many as four Toads. And that the new car, the <A 
href="99~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/99.html">Saab 
99</a>, would be ready for its official unveiling within only two years. The 
Toad in the museum is the only one left.
