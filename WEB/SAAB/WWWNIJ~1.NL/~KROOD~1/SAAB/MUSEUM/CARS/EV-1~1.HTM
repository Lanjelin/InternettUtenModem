vspace=5 hspace=10>Less than a year 
after the launch of 
the <A href="../9000~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/9000.html">Saab 
9000</a>, Saabs small but efficient design department in Trollh&auml;ttan 
had something else to show: the Saab 900 Turbo 16 EV-1, a 2+2 seater 
sports coup&eacute; based on the 
<A 
href="900TUR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/900turbo.html">Saab 
900 Turbo</a>. It was built so that 
Saab could test interesting future components and study them in detail - 
not as a prototype for subsequent production. Despite that, the EV-1 
(Experimental Vehicle No. 1) is unique as a future design study in that 
is fully functional and roadworthy. One of the characteristic features of 
the Saab EV-1 is its futuristic styling - the work of Bj&ouml;rn Envall. 
The upper part is entirely of glass and mounted in the roof are a number 
of solar cells. These produce electric power for a fan which 
automatically ventilates the passenger compartment when the car is parked 
in the sun - thereby doing away with the greenhouse effect. Further, the 
headlamps are of a new, high-efficiency type which illuminate the road 
better in spite of their small dimensions.<br>
The front and rear parts of the body are of aramid fibre reinforced 
plastic which has the ability to absorb impact and then resume its 
original shape. They are extremely light. Side collision protection of 
glass and carbon fibre fitted inside the doors meets the most stringent 
safety regulations. The rear window is kept from misting up by invisible 
electric wires, which also melt away ice in the winter. The seats are of 
injection moulded plastic with electrical operation of the fore-and-aft 
adjustment, height and tilt (the front seats also feature electrically 
operated adjustment of seat angle and side supports). They are only half 
the weight of conventional seats.<br>
The 16-valve Turbo engine has been tuned to deliver 285 bhp and its 
maximum speed is 270 km/h. Acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h takes 5.9 
seconds, 0 to 400 metres 13.9 seconds. This performance - fully 
comparable with that of the most extreme sports cars - is obtained with 
components taken directly from the <A 
href="900~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/900.html">Saab 900</a>. 
The chassis unit with front wheel suspension and rear axle are 
<A href="900TUR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/900turbo.html">Saab 900 
Turbo</a> components which have been modified accordingly.
