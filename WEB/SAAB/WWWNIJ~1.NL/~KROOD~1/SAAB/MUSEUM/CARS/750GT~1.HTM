Saab launched the first production sports model - the Saab 750 
Granturismo - in the spring of 1958 at the motor show in New York. It was 
also in the United States that more than 500 of 600 cars manufactured 
were sold up to 1960.<br>
The Saab 750 Granturismo differed from its more mundane stable-mates by 
two chromium strips along the body side and by extra lamps fitted as 
standard. But there was little else on the outside to boast of the verve 
of this car. The three-cylinder, two stroke power unit under the bonnet 
was tuned to boost its output from 38 bhp to 50 bhp. But and additional 
tuning kit was available for the 750 GT to coax a further 7 bhp from the 
engine.
