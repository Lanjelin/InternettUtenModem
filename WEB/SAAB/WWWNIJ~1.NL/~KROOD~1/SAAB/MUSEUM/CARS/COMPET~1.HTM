Even before full-scale production started early in December 1949, Saab 
cars had been driven in minor rallies in Western Sweden. In January the 
following year, only one month after the production got underway, two 
Saabs with chassis numbers 7 and 8 started in the Monte Carlo Rally. The 
drivers were Greta Molander/ Margaretha von Essen and K G Svedberg/ Rolf 
Meldde. They finished 55th and 69th respectively. Furthermore, Greta 
Molander won 2nd place in the ladies class.<br>
Saabs period as a world-beating rally car began in the early 1960s when 
Erik Carlsson left the rest of Europes elite rally teams standing. Erik 
won the British RAC rally 1960, 1961 and 1963.<br>

The Saab Museums red Monte car is a replica of Eriks winning car from 
1963. He was presented on his 50th birthday. The three-cylinder engine is 
tuned to develop about 75 bhp, nearly 100 bhp per litre swept volume and 
more than twice the power of the 1950 rally car. The rally equipment was 
extremely comprehensive and well thought out - the Saab works team was a 
pioneer on that point and also as regards service along the rally route.
