Saab 99 Turbo made its debut before it was pressed into 
service as a rally car. In point of fact, the competition department was 
first to start experimenting with turbocharging but they had to desist so 
that word could not get out about what was being done to the production 
cars. However, Saabs new rally car was officially announced on January 
16, 1978. The 145 bhp of the standard car had been increased to 240 bhp 
although it was not maximum power but the engines amazing torque 
characteristics (369 Nm at 3500 rpm) that made it so easy to drive - for 
rally drivers.<br>
The first year was an experimental period, but a year after the car first 
appeared on the rally scene, Stig Blomqvist won the Swedish Rally with a 
99 Turbo. But the Saab 99 was too much of a standard car to measure fully 
up to the specialised rally cars of that time, and when the rules were 
subsequently changed so that the specially constructed group B cars (only 
200 units need be built for officially approval) could compete, Saab felt 
that developments were heading in the wrong direction and decided to pull 
out of rallying.<br>
1980 was Saabs last year of official participation in rallying with a 
works competition department. Sights were set on the European 
Championship in which Stig Blomqvist finished sixth with a Saab 99 Turbo. 
This car was the most sophisticated rally car Saab had ever built - 
elegant and with meticulous attention to detail through and through. Just 
note the holes made in the bumper brackets for lightness and the safety 
tank installation with pumps and fuel lines in the boot. The Dymo label 
on the instrument panel is a message from the mechanics to Stig, wishing 
him good luck and success.
