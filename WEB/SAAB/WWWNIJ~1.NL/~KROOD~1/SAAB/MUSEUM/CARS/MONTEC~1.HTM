The competition 
career of the first, 1956 vintage Saab Sonett ended even 
before the car was taken into production, since the competition rules 
were changed to allow standard cars to be tuned. A standard car which was 
a little livelier in its basic trim stood a better chance in competition 
events. And thats the path that Saab took.<br>
The <A href="750GT~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/750GT.html">Saab 750 
Granturismo</a> - a tuned <A 
href="../93~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/93.html">Saab 
93</a> - was launched in 
1958. The car featured a sports steering wheel, rev counter, speed pilot, 
provisions compartment, extra lamps and improved front seats -with head 
restraint on the co-drivers side. But the car had no back seat in the 
true sense. The bench with foam rubber padding fitted instead certainly 
made no claims on comfort.<br>
The <A href="750GT~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/750GT.html">Saab 750 GT</a> 
had the same body as the <A 
href="96~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.nijenrode.nl/~kroodsma/saab/museum/cars/96.html">Saab 96</a> when it was 
launched in 1960. But it was still powered by the old engine, although now driving 
through a 4-speed gearbox.<br>
The Saab Sport was launched in 1962. With three carburettors instead of 
one, the 841 cc engine was uprated to 52 bhp. It was separately 
lubricated with oil from a separate tank, and the Sport used  ordinary 
petrol (without oil admixture).<br>
In 1965, the engine output was boosted to 55 bhp. One year later, the 
model was re-christened the MonteCarlo 850, as an accolade to Erik 
Carlssons victories in this rally classic.<br>
The MonteCarlo was taken out of production in 1968. During the previous 
year, it had been known as the MonteCarlo V4, and was powered by a 
standard V4 engine. But all of the attractive GT equipment remained even 
on the very last model.
