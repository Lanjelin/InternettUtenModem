     <P>MITSUBISHI LANCER WITH TOMMI MAKINEN WINS RALLY OF PORTUGAL
                   VICTORY FOR GUSTAVO TRELLES IN Group N</P>

   <P>  Team Mitsubishi Ralliart driver Tommi Makinen gave the Lancer its
     first major success of the season with a crushing victory on the
     Rally of Portugal and now leads the 1997 World Rally
     Championship.
     The final leg of the punishing, 1,679-kilometre rally took
     competitors deep into the barren, treeless hills east of Arganil,
     to some of the most testing - and most feared - stages in the
     world. Drivers faced two laps over dauntingly quick and often
     savagely rough roads that are bordered by towering drops. It is a
     true test of man and machine and the Portuguese troop into the
     hills in their thousands to savour the spectacle. Indeed, the
     rally is so popular that wildly enthusiastic fans often drive
     into the stages the night before, lighting fires and camping
     overnight to be sure of a good viewing point in the morning. With
     Arganil behind them, the survivors still faced three more tough
     stages on winding roads through thick forests before the
     ceremonial finish, within sight of the Atlantic Ocean, in the
     holiday resort of Figueira da Foz.</P>

    <P> The event was made tougher still by hot, sunny weather, which
     tested tyres to the limit, but also made visibility difficult in
     the forests, as each car trailed a long plume of dust.
</P>
   <P>  A scintillating display from Makinen and fellow-Finn Seppo
     Harjanne had broken the back of the opposition during the second
     leg, when they set quickest times on every stage. With many of
     his greatest rivals out of the way, Makinen could afford to ease
     off over the final nine stages to clinch the most comfortable win
     on a World Rally Championship this season. The Michelin-shod
     Lancer ran perfectly over some of the roughest stages in Europe
     to give him his first win in Portugal and a useful, four-point
     lead in the World Championship. Speed and reliability had told on
     an event that few of his rivals completed unscathed.</P>

   <P>  "Today it was not so difficult. I was just concentrating on
     coming to the end. It is nice to win and to lead the
     championship, but there is still a long way to go and the rallies
     ahead will be tough The car has been fantastic," said a delighted
     Makinen.</P>

    <P> "This was a historic win: our first this year and our first in
     Portugal. It shows we are back in the frame after a little bad
     luck on the first few rallies. Tommi drove really well,
     particularly in the second leg and he richly deserved his
     victory," commented Phil Short, the Team Manager of Team
     Mitsubishi Ralliart.</P>

   <P>  Mitsubishi also dominated the Group N production category. The
     battle for victory between Uruguayan Gustavo Trelles and youthful
     Austrian Manfred Stohl became one of the highlights of the rally,
     victory finally going to the vastly experienced Trelles (who won
     the Group N world title last year in a Mitsubishi Lancer) by just
     10 seconds after three days and some 400 kilometres of flat-out
     driving. Neither man could afford to ease off for a moment - and
     both had absolute confidence that their rugged, showroom-class
     Lancers would be equal to the strain. Amazingly, Trelles set
     fastest time overall, against powerful Group A and heavily
     modified World Rally Cars, on the final stage!</P>

    <P> "I am very happy, because this was an absolutely incredible race
     with Manfred. It was particularly satisfying, because I was
     fastest overall on the final stage," declared Trelles.</P>

    <P> The result proved that Mitsubishi Motors engineering is equal to
     the toughest challenges in motorsport. A superb victory has
     boosted Team Mitsubishi Ralliart's confidence as it prepares for
     its next event.
