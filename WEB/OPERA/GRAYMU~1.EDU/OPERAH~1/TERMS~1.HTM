<P><A NAME="A"><FONT SIZE=+1><B>apron</B></A> - the forward part of the stage between the
curtain and the orchestra pit</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/ARIAAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/aria.aiff">aria</A></B> - a song for
solo voice with instrumental accompaniment. Arias appear in cantatas, oratorios,
and operas beginning in the 17trh century. Usually they emphasize musical
expression more than the text. The text is often reflective, rather than
descriptive of action. Arias are usually not strophic and they provide
lyric interludes that temporarily pull the listener away from the action
of the story.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>ballad opera</B> - a form of 18th century English
operatic entertainment that consisted of spoken dialogue and musical numbers
from popular music sources such as ballads, folk songs, and songs from
other plays. The first example was <I><U>The Beggar's Opera</U></I> (1728)
by John Gay, with music arranged by J. Pepusch. It was a satire of the
Italian opera seria popular in London at the time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>baritone</B> - a male voice with a range between that
of the low bass voice and the high tenor. The usual span is between G and
e'. Baritone parts may require either expressive, lyricial singing or they
may be more heroic, as in the title role of Verdi's <I>Rigoletto.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>baroque</B> - the period in music history that spans
from approximately 1600 to 1750. This period saw the birth of opera through
the efforts of the Florentine Camerata and the works of Monteverdi.The
best known late baroque operas are those of G.F. Handel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>bass</B> - the lowest male voice, frequently subdivided
in several categories (see following entries). The range is between E and
c'. This example is Mussorgsky's <I>Boris Godunov</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/BBAIFF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/bb.aiff">basso buffo</A></B> - a category
of bass voice that specializes in comic roles, frequently seen in the operas
of Mozart and Rossini. Dr. Bartolo in Rossini's <I>The Barber of Seville</I>
is a famous example. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><A HREF="SOUNDS/BCAIFF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/bc.aiff">basso cantante</A></B> - a
type of bass voice that demonstrates a melodic, singing quality rather
than a comic or tragic one. An example is King Philip in Verdi's <I>Don
Carlos</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/BPAIFF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/bp.aiff">basso profundo</A></B> -
the most serious of the bass voices. Sarastro in Mozart's <I>The Magic
Flute</I> is an example. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><A HREF="SOUNDS/BELAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/bel.aiff">bel canto</A></B> - &quot;beautiful
song,&quot; the traditional art of Italian singing which emphasizes elegant
phrasing, beautiful tone and brilliant technique; bel canto flourished
in the early to mid-19th century, in the works of Rossini, Bellini and
Donizetti.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>blocking</B> - the moving of people around the stage
by the stage director to set up the patterns that will be followed during
the performance of the opera</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CABAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/cab.aiff">cabaletta</A></B> - a brisk
aria in Italian opera, generally following a more solemn, thoughtful one;
the cabaletta frequently refers to a contradictory or complimentary state
of mind, and may even lead towards impassioned action from the character
on stage. The term itself comes from the Italian&quot;cavallo&quot; which
means horse: the accompaniment of the cabaletta frequently resembles the
animal's galloping gait.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CADAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/cad.aiff">cadenza</A></B> - a musical
flourish, frequently made upon the spot by the performer, which occurs
when an aria or a section of an aria seems to be coming to its close (its
cadence spot); until the time of Verdi, cadenzas were expected to be improvised
by the singer or the performer and were seldom notated precisely by the
composer. The long passage between soprano and flute in the mad scene of
<I>Lucia di Lammermoor</I> is an improvised double cadenza for those performers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CAMAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/cam.aiff">Camerata</A></B> - a gathering
of writers and musician who, in the late 16th century, regularly met to
discuss art and experiment with form. In the years prior to 1580, the gathering
assembled at the residence of Giovanni de Bardi, and after 1592, at the
home of Jacopo Corsi. Vincenzo Galileo, the astronomer's father, was among
them. Their deliberations led directly to the rise of opera as a combination
of music, drama and stage spectacle. Jacopo Peri, a musician at the Medici
court and a member of the Camerata, was the composer of <I>Dafne</I> (1597),
considered to be the first opera.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CANTAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/cant.aiff">cantabile</A></B> - an
expression (another one taken from &quot;cantare&quot;) which asks the
performer to sing or play in a sweetly singing manner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>cantata</B> - a musical form, generally for chorus
and soloists, based on a primarily narrative text; the most famous cantatas
are those written by Bach, all of which take scriptural texts as their
starting points--some are even for solo voice and instrument.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>cantilena</B> - a lyrical melody line, obviously meant
to be sung or played &quot;cantabile.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CANZAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/canz.aiff">canzone</A></B> - a short,
lyrical operatic song; the term itself may have originated in Provence
and could have referred to arias which have no narrative quality at all,
but simply reflect the singer's state of mind. Cherubino's &quot;Voi che
sapete&quot; in Mozart's <I>The Marriage of Figaro</I> is called a canzone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CANZAA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/canza.aiff">canzonetta</A></B> - literally,
a little &quot;canzone;&quot; Mozart used the words &quot;canzone&quot;
and &quot;canzonetta&quot; frequently to differentiate between the more
serious (and longer) arias and the shorter (and more conversational) solo
work in his operas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CAVAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/cav.aiff">cavatina</A></B> - a short,
simple solo song, occasionally instrumental rather than vocal, that was
popular in 18th century Italian opera.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>classical</B> - the period in music which comes after
the baroque period and before the romantic; the dates are roughly 1756
(which is the birth of Mozart) to 1830 (three years after the death of
Beethoven). Although the period is not as long as the baroque period, it
represents the greatest standardization in orchestral form and sonority;
even composers who lived beyond 1830 continued to use the standard &quot;classical&quot;
orchestra of pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets and bassoons, four horns,
two trumpets, three trombones, strings and timpani.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>coda</B> - the last musical thoughts in a composition;
instrict formal terms, a piece might contain exposition (which sets forth
the principal themes of the work), development (which uses that material
in new and varied fashions), recapitulation (where the principal material
is restated almost verbatim), cadenza (for a last minute vocal improvisation,
sometimes based on the early materials in the work), and coda (where one
last little idea is put forward by the composer).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/COLAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/col.aiff">coloratura</A></B> - a type
of soprano, generally, but also the description of singing which pertains
to great feats of agility--fast singing, high singing, trills, embellishments
and so forth. Some coloratura sopranos during this century have been Lily
Pons, Roberta Peters, Joan Sutherland and Beverly Sills. This example of
coloratura is Marguerite's &quot;Jewel Song&quot; from Gounod's <I>Faust</I>.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><A HREF="SOUNDS/COMDAA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/comda.aiff">commedia dell'arte</A></B>
- a style of dramatic presentation popular in Italy from the 16th century
on; the commedia characters were highly stylized and the plots frequently
revolved around disguises, mistaken identities and misunderstandings. The
principal commedia characters are Pierrot, Harlequin and Colombine. Operatic
spoofs of the commedia characters can be found in Leoncavallo's <I>Pagliacci</I>
and Strauss' <I>Ariadne auf Naxos</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/COMPAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/comp.aiff">comprimario</A></B> - a
singer who takes the secondary character roles in an opera, from the Italian
which means &quot;next to the first&quot;; confidantes, maids, servants,
messengers and medical personnel generally fit under the heading of comprimario
roles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/CONAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/con.aiff">continuo</A></B> - the small
group of instruments that accompanies the recitatives in baroque music;
as a general rule, the continuo group comprises cello and harpsichord or
organ, although in some of the larger works of Monteverdi (<I><U>Orfeo</U></I>,
<U><I>The Coronation of Poppea</I> </U>) the continuo group can comprise
a dozen or more instruments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>contralto</B> - the lowest female voice; the term
itself comes from two Italian words which signify against (&quot;contra&quot;)
the high (&quot;alto&quot;) voice. In baroque operas, the contralto generally
represented a certain character type on stage: either comic (a sort of
female basso buffo), or spooky and other worldly, or just plain matronly.
Marian Anderson and Maureen Forrester have been legendary contraltos in
the concert and operatic world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>counterpoint</B> - the putting together of two or
more independent musical lines; when the same musical tune is repeated
several times, in different vocal ranges, the result can be a fugue or
a round.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>countertenor</B> - a high male voice, generally singing
within the female contralto or mezzo soprano range; popular in the baroque
period, the countertenor frequently portrayed young, virile men or innocent,
blushing adolescents--the voices were generally quite powerful, and not
considered effeminate. This vocal range is sometimes referred to as &quot;male
alto.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/DEUAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/deu.aiff">Deus ex machina</A></B>
- literally, &quot;god out of a machine,&quot; a literary or staging device
which refers to some last-minute salvation of a tricky situation by a god
or goddess who has been watching the entire plot unfold from afar. In the
baroque period, elaborate scenery was devised whereby a particular god
(more often than not Amor, the god of love) would descend from above the
stage in a little cloud or carriage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>director/producer</B> - depending upon the locale
of the producing company, the person who creates the staging for a play
or an opera; in America this person is called the director, or the stage
director, as opposed to the conductor who leads the orchestra. Throughout
Europe, this person is known as the producer while the orchestra conductor
is frequently called the director!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#28" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/comda.div">diva</A></B> - a female
opera star of great rank or pretension; the original Italian word means
&quot;goddess.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/DRAAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/dra.aiff">dramma giocoso</A></B> -
an opera which combines serious elements, enacted by aristocratic personnages,
with comic relief, played out and commented upon by earthier peasant stock.
The most famous example of dramma giocoso is Mozart's <I>Don Giovanni</I>,
although the composer himself never actually called it such--only Lorenzo
da Ponte, the librettist, did.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>duet</B> - a musical composition for two performers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>embellishment</B> - the addition of extra notes to
an already established melody line; in the days of Handel, and again in
the flourishing of 19th century Italian bel canto, the process of embellishing
a vocal line whenever it is repeated was the standard practice. Some composers,
like Bach and Mozart, wrote out their own embellishments--others trusted
the instrumentalists and singers to add their own.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>entr'acte</B> - a musical composition played between
acts or between scenes within an act of an opera.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#29" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/comda.ent">entr&eacute;e</A></B> -
a musical composition, used mainly in the French baroque period by its
greatest practitioners, Rameau and Lully, which has a martial, aggressive
quality; the entr&eacute;e generally was played to introduce an important
character or group of characters. In some French baroque works, such as
Rameau's <I><U>Les Indes galantes </U></I>, each act was called an entr&eacute;e.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>falsetto</B> - the technique of singing whereby the
tone produced has a light, &quot;head voice&quot; quality; this use of
a &quot;false&quot; voice, which is what the term really means, enables
a bass or a baritone to imitate a female voice, for example.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#30" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/comda.fio">fioratura</A></B> - understandably
confused with coloratura but meaning almost the same thing; taken from
&quot;fior&quot; which means &quot;flower&quot; in Italian, fioratura refers
to the actual flowery, embellished vocal line within an aria. All coloratura
sopranos have to sing fioratura at some point or another, but there is
no such thing as a fioratura soprano.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>grand opera</B> - opera which is sung from start to
finish, as opposed to opera which may have spoken dialogue; grand opera
frequently treats serious, dramatic subjects and, in French opera of the
19th century, was generally epic in scale with a full scale ballet inserted
in the middle of the work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="H"> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/HAUAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/hau.aiff">hauptstimme</A></A></B> - literally,
&quot;the high voice,&quot; this refers to the principal musical material
of a work, not to a singer. In the operas of Schoenberg or Berg, early
20th century German composers, the main melodies are marked with an &quot;H&quot;
to indicate that the composers considered those the principal tunes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/HELAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/hel.aiff">heldentenor</A></B> - a
type of tenor voice which hearkens back to the golden age of Wagnerian
singing; the typical heldentenor has an unusually brilliant top register
(high notes) combined with a muscular lower voice, almost like a baritone,
and is capable of long passages which require great vocal stamina. Tristan
and Siegfried are great heldentenor roles. One of the great heldentenors
of the century was Lauritz Melchior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/IMBAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/imb.aiff">imbroglio</A></B> - operatic
scene in which diversity of rhythm and melody create chaos and confusion;
the original meaning of the Italian word was &quot;intrigue.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/INTAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/int.aiff">intermezzo</A></B> - a short
musical entertainment, which in its earliest manifestation might be played
between the acts of a longer, more serious operatic work; the intermezzo
was almost always of light hearted character, and never involved more than
three or four singers. One well known operatic intermezzo is <I>La serva
padrona</I> (The Maid Becomes the Mistress) of Giovanni Pergolesi (1733)
which was sung between the first and second acts of a much larger, and
quite forgotten, work <I>Il prigioner superb</I> (The Model Prisoner).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>legato</B> - a smooth and gliding style of singing
or playing; the opposite of Iegato is marcato (in a marked, punchy style)
or even staccato (in an even shorter, more aggressive style).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/LEIAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/lei.aiff">leitmotiv</A></B> - a short
musical passage, sometimes no more than three or four notes, which instantly
calls to mind a character or situation in a musical drama; although Wagner
may not have invented the device, he is certainly the best known user of
it. This example is the glance motive from Wagner's <I>Tristan und Isolde</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>libretto</B> - the text of an opera; the literal translation
is &quot;little book,&quot; which reminds us that in a Broadway show the
texts of the songs are called the &quot;lyrics&quot; while the spoken text
of the rest of the play is called the &quot;book.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/LIEAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/lie.aiff">lied</A></B> - a German
song; the pronunciation is &quot;leed&quot; and the plural is lieder (pronounced
&quot;leader&quot;). In some pre-Wagnerian German operas, the songs that
the characters sing are called &quot;lieder&quot; as opposed to &quot;aria&quot;
which would be the Italian determination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/MAEAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/mae.aiff">maestro</A></B> - a title
of courtesy, given, especially in Italy, to conductors, composers and directors;
translation (from the Italian), &quot;Master.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>marking</B> - the practice used by many singers to
save their voices in rehearsals; singers will sing in what seems to be
a mere whisper, or transpose the vocal lines so that they don't have to
sing extremely high or low notes. This is done as a vocal protection--singing
too strenuously, or without getting the voice properly warmed up can lead
to vocal strain and severe throat problems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>masque</B> - a staged performance in which music,
poetry, song and dance are blended; although the word is French, and pronounced
&quot;mask,&quot; the form is more frequently associated with English works
which appeared in the time of Queen Elizabeth I.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/MEZVAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/mezv.aiff">mezza voce</A></B> - literally,
&quot;medium voice,&quot; literally; when singing mezza voce, the singer
reduces the volume so as to intensify the emotion. When marking, singers
use a kind of mezza voce, but not for dramatic purposes; in performance,
it should be intentional.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#31" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/mevs.aiff">mezzo soprano</A></B> -
the female voice range which lies between the soprano, which is the highest,
and the contralto; the tone of a mezzo soprano can either be voluptuous
(in the case of Delilah or Carmen) or it can be thinner and more agile
(which might describe Rosina in <I>The Barber of Seville</I>).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A NAME="O"><A HREF="SOUNDS/OBAIFF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/ob.aiff">opera buffa</A></A></B> - a style
of opera which revolves almost entirely around comedy; perhaps an outgrowth
of the Italian intermezzo, the opera buffa as a form was popular in the
baroque days as well as in Italy of the early 19th century. Its counterpart
is opera seria, which implies opera almost entirely about lofty ideals
or with tragic consequences.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/OCAIFF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/oc.aiff">op&eacute;ra comique</A></B>
- a misleading term, French in origin, which would seem to describe opera
that was funny; in fact, op&eacute;ra comique describes opera in which
there is some spoken dialogue as opposed to grand opera in which there
is none. As a matter of fact, both Gounod's <I>Faust</I> and Bizet's <I>Carmen</I>
were originally conceived with spoken dialogue and are, thus, op&eacute;ras
comiques even though their subject matter would seem to make them &quot;grand&quot;
operas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>operetta</B> - light, frothy musical entertainments
which generally do not pertain to terrifically important subject material;
spoken dialogue, dancing, practical jokes and mistaken identities seem
to be the trademark of the operetta form, most popular in late 19th century
Vienna or France, under the hands of the Strauss family or Offenbach. <I>Die
Fledermaus</I>, <I>The Merry Widow</I>, <I>La P&eacute;richole</I> and
Noel Coward's <I>Bitter Sweet</I> are all operettas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>opus</B> - a single work or composition, from the
Latin; the plural form of &quot;opus&quot; is &quot;opera&quot; and it
was that term that the Camerata (see above) adopted since their new stage
presentations combined the musical work, the dramatic work and the staging
work--thus making &quot;works.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>oratorio</B> - a musical composition (generally not
staged) for chorus, orchestra and soloists, whose text is generally religious,
serious or philosophical in nature; a long version of a cantata. It was
to oratorio that Handel turned when the English public turned sour on his
staged operas, although the story line and characterization of the oratorios
are often totally operatic. <I>Messiah</I> and <I>Israel in Egypt</I> are
oratorios; <I>Julius Caesar</I> and <I>Rinaldo</I> are not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>orchestra</B> - the group of musicians which accompany
a staged presentation; in early operas (from 1600 to about 1750) the orchestra
might consist of a few strings, pairs of oboes, bassoons, flutes, trumpets
and continuo (see above). The orchestra grew from the time of Mozart through
Beethoven, Berlioz, Wagner, Verdi, Puccini and Richard Strauss so that
nowadays an opera orchestra can easily consist of 90 to 100 players. In
America the first floor of a theatre is called the orchestra, whereas in
England that area is called the stalls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>ornamentation</B> - the extra notes, like appogiaturas,
scales, trills or cadenzas that can enhance a melodic line when it has
to be repeated. Ornamentation and embellishment are probably interchangeable
terms. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>overture</B> - the instrumental introduction to a musical
drama or oratorio; frequently the overture will incorporate musical themes
that will later be heard in the course of the opera. In <I>Don Giovanni</I>,
the ominous theme of the Stone Guest (from the Act II) is heard as a premonition
at the beginning of the overture, thus setting an emotional tone as well
as providing musical structure to the entire work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/PARAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/par.aiff">parlando</A></B> - literally,
&quot;speaking&quot;; this Italian term directs the singer to imitate speech
in singing. The &quot;patter songs&quot; of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas
frequently employ a great deal of parlando singing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>pitch</B> - the location of a sound on a scale ranging
from high to low.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>polyphony</B> - literally, &quot;many voices&quot;;
the mixing together of several melodic lines in a pleasant fashion. Counterpoint
is certainly an element which creates polyphony.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/PORAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/por.aiff">portamento</A></B> - the
smooth movement in singing or playing a stringed instrument from one note
to the next; a portamento can only be achieved in legato singing or playing,
and is frequently compared to &quot;glissando,&quot; which literally means
sliding from one note to the next.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>prelude</B> - the instrumental introduction to an
individual act within a musical drama, whether opera or operetta; some
composers use the words overture, prelude and entr'acte interchangeably.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/PRIAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/pri.aiff">prima donna</A></B> - the
female star of an opera cast; in Verdi's time it was considered a matter
of course to differentiate the roles in terms of their dramatic and vocal
importance, such as &quot;Prima Donna,&quot; &quot;Seconda Donna,&quot;
&quot;Terza Donna&quot; and the like. It did not until recently come to
describe the personality of the singer, rather than the importance of her
role in the opera.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>prompter</B> - a member of the musical staff of many
large opera houses; the prompter sits in a small box practically invisible
to the audience, under the apron of the stage, and gives singers and choristers
the vocal cues seconds before they are required to sing them. In many international
houses, where singers perform without benefit of long musical rehearsal
periods, a prompter can be invaluable as a memory aide for a jet lagged
singer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>proscenium</B> - a misunderstood term; most performers,
even designers, refer to the proscenium when they actually mean the proscenium
arch. The proscenium, to be technically exact, is that part of the stage
between the curtain and the orchestra pit--and the architectural arch which
encloses the curtain is called the proscenium arch. Even so, proscenium
is used in a larger, more general sense, in the meaning of a stage constructed
with a curtain, as opposed to a thrust stage where the stage has no formal
enclosure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/PROAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/pro.aiff">prova</A></B> - rehearsal,
from the Italian word for &quot;test&quot;; often in Italy, one hears of
a &quot;prova generale,&quot;which means the final dress rehearsal. In
Germany, a rehearsal is called &quot;probe&quot; (PROE beh); in German
houses, one frequently hears of a sitzprobe (a rehearsal with orchestra
where the singers sing seated on chairs at the front of the stage instead
of moving about) or wandelprobe (where the singers actually go through
the motions of their acting while the orchestra plays the music) or generalprobe
(which is, in essence, the last dress rehearsal).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="R"> <B>raked stage</B></A> - a stage which slants upward away
from the view of the audience; in the earliest opera houses, the stage
was so slanted so that the audience member sitting in the back of the theatre
could have an easy view of someone standing at the back of the stage. Many
opera houses in Europe today have stages that are permanently sloped like
this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>range</B> - the division of the human voice, according
to six basic types: soprano, mezzo soprano, contralto, tenor, baritone
and bass.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/RECAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/rec.aiff">recitativo</A></B> - a musical
form within an opera which, by imitating rapid speech, advances the plot;this
is not the same as parlando, which is a style of singing, but rather a
formal device which links together the arias and choruses. Those forms
generally express states of mind while the recitative describes a course
of action. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><A HREF="SOUNDS/RECAAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/reca.aiff">recitativo accompagnato</A></B>
- is accompanied by the full orchestra. The introduction to Donna Anna's
&quot;Or sai chi l'onore&quot; in <I>Don Giovanni</I> is an example of
the&quot;accompagnato&quot; style, where the orchestral sonorities are
capable of varying the mood of the narration more than the simple harpsichord
accompaniment could.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/RECSAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/recs.aiff">recitativo secco</A></B>
- is accompanied by the continuo instruments. Numerous passages abound
in the operas of Mozart and Rossini of the &quot;secco&quot; style.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><A HREF="SOUNDS/RITAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/rit.aiff"> ritornello</B></A> - the instrumental prelude to an individual
song within a cantata, concerto or aria; in baroque Italian operas, the
ritornello (which comes from Italian meaning &quot;a little return trip&quot;)
could be heard not only at the beginning and the end of the aria, but as
a dividing mark between stanzas.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Romantic</B> - the period of music between 1830 and the turn of
the 20th century; composers of romantic music frequently found inspiration
in other than musical ideas, such as nature, painting,birdcalls, rainstorms.
Beethoven was probably the first romantic opera composer, although the
most famous are Wagner and Verdi.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/SINGAI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/sing.aiff">singspiel</A></B> - early German musical
drama, which employed spoken dialogue along with musical numbers; Mozart's
<I>The Abduction from the Seraglio</I> and <I>The Magic Flute</I> are both
examples of this genre, so are Weber's Der Freischutz and Beethoven's <I>Fidelio</I>.
The singspiel is very similar to English ballad opera or French op&eacute;ra
comique.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>soprano</B> - the highest range of the female voice; the soprano
voice ranges from lyric (a light, graceful quality) to dramatic (obviously
fuller and heavier in tone).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/SVAIFF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/sv.aiff">sotto voce</A></B> - a musical direction
which asks the performer to sing, or play &quot;under the voice,&quot;
or in a subdued manner. Singing sotto voce can be compared to declaiming
in a stage whisper and can be very effective in a large theatre.</FONT></P>

<P> <FONT SIZE=+1><B>soubrette</B> - a lightweight soprano voice or type of soprano role,
frequently found in comic operas or operettas; the soubrette usually possesses
a flirtatious demeanor and street wise manner, as in the case of Adele
in<I> Die Fledermaus</I>, or is a particularly fetching country innocent,
like Adina in<I>The Elixir of Love</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>spinto</B> - a kind of voice which is &quot;pushed&quot; towards
another, from the Italian &quot;spingere&quot; (to push); thus a &quot;lirico
spinto&quot; soprano is a Iyric voice that has some qualities of the heavier
dramatic range. Frequently, sopranos who have essentially light voices
will take on the role of, say, Mimi in <I>La Boh&egrave;me</I> (to portray
her youthfulness and frailty) and push their voices to ride over the orchestra,
thus developing a &quot;spinto&quot; sound. Licia Albanese, the great Italian
soprano, would be a prime example of this type of soprano.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/SPRAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/spr.aiff">sprechstimme</A></B> - literally, &quot;speak
voice&quot;; a kind of vocal instruction, found often in the operas of
Schoenberg and Berg, where the singer half speaks and half sings a note.
The declamation sounds like speaking, but there is a duration of pitch
which makes it seem almost like singing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/MAEAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/mae.aiff">staccato</A></B> - a type of singing or
playing that is characterized by short, clipped, rapid articulation; the
opposite of staccato is legato.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>stage right/stage left</B> - the division of the stage from the
performer's point of view; thus, when a singer goes stage right, he moves
to his right but to the audience's left.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>supernumerary</B> - a performer who appears in a non-singing role;
a &quot;super&quot; might have a solo walk on to deliver a message, or
might be included as part of a large processional, for example. In the
old days, supers were often referred to as &quot;spear carriers.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>tempo</B> - the speed of a musical passage or composition; the tempo
may range from very slow (&quot;largo&quot; in Italian, &quot;langsam&quot;
in German) to extremely fast (&quot;presto&quot; in Italian, &quot;schnell&quot;
in German).</FONT></P>

<P> <FONT SIZE=+1><B>tenor</B> - the highest natural male voice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/TESAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/tes.aiff">tessitura</A></B> - the average range
of a vocal part in an opera; for example, the tessitura of Lucia di Lammermoor
is quite high, that of Santuzza in <I>Cavalleria rusticana</I> (although
it is still a soprano role) is low enough that the role could be sung by
a mezzo soprano.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B>trill </B>- two adjacent notes rapidly and repeatedly alternated.</FONT></P>

<P> <FONT SIZE=+1><B>twelve tone</B> - a system of composition that was put forth in
the early part of this century by<B><U> </U></B>Arnold Schoenberg, whereby
(in very simple terms), each note of the chromatic scale should be used
as part of a melody before any other note gets repeated. Many composers
have used this system, which is also called &quot;serialism,&quot; but
the best known operas in this style are Berg's <I>Wozzeck </I>and <I>Lulu</I>,
Schoenberg's <I>Erwartung</I> and Roger Sessions's <I>Montezuma</I>.</FONT></P>

<P> <FONT SIZE=+1><B>upstage/downstage</B> - the position on stage farthest or nearest
the audience; because of the raked stage which was so prevalent in early
opera houses, the farther &quot;back&quot; a singer went on the stage,
the &quot;higher&quot; he seemed to become in stature--thus the distinction
of being &quot;up&quot;-stage. When a singer is directed to move downstage
left, he goes toward the audience and towards his left side; to the audience,
he seems to be coming forward and moving to the audience's right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/VERAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/ver.aiff">verismo</A></B> - literally, &quot;truth&quot;;
a style of theatre made popular in the latter part of the 19th century
in which ordinary events and characters participate in melodramatic situations.Bizet's
<I>Carmen</I> was considered an early and powerful example of verismo,
and so are most of the operas of Puccini and Mascagni.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/VIBAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/vib.aiff">vibrato</A></B> - the slightly wavering
quality that a singer has in his voice while sustaining a tone; if the
vibrato becomes terribly pronounced, it is pejoratively called a wobble.
Some singers will drain their voice of any vibrato for a particularly haunting
effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> <B><A HREF="SOUNDS/ZARAIF~1.HTM" tppabs="http://gray.music.rhodes.edu/operahtmls/Sounds/zar.aiff">zarzuela</A></B>--a Spanish popular musical
presentation which blends dialogue and music in skits and dramas ranging
from one to three acts that deal satirically with aspects of daily life.
The derivation of the name is intriguing: early zarzuelas were performed
in the Palacio de la Zarzuela in Madrid, so named because it was surrounded
by a field of brambles (&quot;zarza&quot; being Spanish for bramble).</FONT></P>
