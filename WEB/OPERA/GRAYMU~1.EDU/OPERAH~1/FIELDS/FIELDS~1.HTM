<H2>The Commissioning of the Opera</H2>
<P>
Our celebratory season will close with a world premiere production of a one-act opera called <i>Different Fields</I>.  This work is the result of a collaboration between the Metropolitan Opera Guild's education arm and Opera Memphis. It is the third in the MOG's New Opera for New Audiences commissioning program, following <I>Romulus Hunt</I> by Carly Simon and <I>The Amazing Adventure of Alvin Allegretto</I>.  The works runs February 8 to 13 at Manhattan's New Victory Theater. Built in 1900 as the Republic by Oscar Hammerstein, the New Victory was recently restored and designated as a home to not-for-profit performing arts groups for young people. In April <I>Different Fields</I> moves to Opera Memphis, where it runs as a part of the company's 40th anniversary season. Additional performances are scheduled as part of the Tennessee Bicentennial celebration in Nashville, May 24 and 25. Different Fields has received generous support from the Tennessee Arts Commission and Tennessee 200.</P>

<H2>The Plot</H2>
<I>Different Fields </I>  explores the moral obligations and psychological pressures placed upon America'a athletic heroes. Reid is a former pro-football player with the Cincinnati Bengals and a Grammy award winning song-writer, who has written hit songs for popular performers including Bonnie Raitt and Wynnona Judd.<P>
The story of Reid's new opera is about Aaron James, a star wide receiver in the pros and a friend to a fatherless teenages named Casey. Unfortunately, James is an inveterate gambler and is blackmailed into throwing a game in order to pay off his gambling debts. A scandal threatens and the owner of the team offers to cover it up. Eventually, James decides to redeem himself by admitting his wrongdoing and leaving the game. Central to the story is James's song "Bright November Morning". 
<CENTER><H3>Bright November Morning</H3></CENTER>
<I>With a dream behind my should and some sunshine in my arms<BR>
I pretend that I was playin' in the big game of the season<BR>
And I'd throw a pass at heaven that would fly beyond the clouds<P>
Then I'd hear my Grandpa callin' me and he'd say it's time for supper<BR>
And I'd make one more final touchdown for the fans inside my head.<BR>
On a bright November morning.<P>
But time has passed and I've lost that boy I used to be<Br>
The years have passed and I can't find my way back home.<P></I>
