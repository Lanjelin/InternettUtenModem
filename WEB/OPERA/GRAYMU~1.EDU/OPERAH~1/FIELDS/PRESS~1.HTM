<h4>Music Review by Anthony Tommasini, February 10, 1996</H4>
"<I>Different Fields</I> is effective and often touching."<BR>
"The story is gritty and honestly rendered."
"The orchestrations by Michael Ching--rich, percussive, prone to swelling crescendo. . ."
<H3>Newsweek</H3>
<H4>Katrine Ames, February 19, 1996</H4>
". . .it works, largely because Reid and Sarah Schlesinger, whose libretto is strong and smart, understand and don't underestimate their young audience."<BR>
"With wafts of Copland and various doyens of the musical theater, . . .it's rich in melody and atmosphere."
<H3>Chicago Tribune</H3>
<H4>Arts and Entertainment by Jack Hurst, February 18, 1996</H4>
"The Reid opera deals with a reality that seems especially timely in today's era of multi-millionaire sports heroes: the dark side of fame."
<H3>CBS Sunday Morning</H3>
<H4>Eugenia Zuckerman, February 18, 1996</H4>
"Mike Reid's first opera, <I>Different Fields</I>, is really very lyrical and very strong and beautiful. It is full of wonderful melodies and it has a very powerful message that lingers long after you leave the theatre."
<H3>ABC Good Morning America, February 11, 1996</H3>
"<I>Different Fields</I> is warm, sweet, caring--a perfect reflection of its composer, who understands the mind-set of today's sports hero." (Dick Shapp, host)
<H3>The Nashville Banner</H3>
<H4>Lisa A. DuBois, February 8, 1996</H4>
"Musically, <I>Different Fields</I> follows classic operatic conventions with duets recitatives and arias. However, Reid also inserts moments, such as Aaron's introspective 'Bright November Morning' solo, where wafts of country and folk music drift into the songs."<BR>
"Reid writes with a depth and ambiguous tension that comes from personal experience."
