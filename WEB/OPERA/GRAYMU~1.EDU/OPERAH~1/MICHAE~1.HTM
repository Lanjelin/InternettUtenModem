<h2><center>Message from Michael Ching, Director</center></h2>

I hope you'll join us for our 1996-97 season. We think this is one of the most --if not the> most--exciting line-ups in the history of Opera Memphis. In fact, I can't think of a better season for new subscribers because this season has everything.<P>

We open with Kallen Esperian singing the role of Violetta in <I>La Traviata</I>.  Kallen always gives us an unforgettable performance. She also sells out the house! Actually, the only way to be sure of getting a choice seat to hear Kallen at an Opera Memphis performance is to buy a season subscription.<P>
We are also bringing Massenet's <I>Werther</I>  to Opera Memphis for the first time ever. If you haven't already been introduced to the beauty and passion of French opera, you're in for a real treat.</P>
And here's something you don't see often--2 operas for the price of 1!  Puccini's <I>Gianni Schicchi</I>  will be followed by the world premiere of my sequel, <I>Buoso's Ghost</I> .  I believe both performances will leave you humming and laughing.<P>

For Mozart lovers, we have a special treat--our brand new production of <I>The Magic Flute</I>  And remember, Mozart--like Kallen--is usually a sell-out in Memphis. Last year even the mother-of-the-bride couldn't have gotten a ticket to <I>The Marriage of Figaro</I>!  So, don't take a chance on hearing, "Sorry, we're sold out." Subscribe now and reserve your seat to hear Esperian, Massenet, Puccini, Ching (yes!), and Mozart.<P>
