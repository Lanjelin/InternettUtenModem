<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>National Center for the Development of American Opera</H2>

<P>Tennessee is arguably the greatest musical center in the United States.
Since 1992, with support from its National Center for the Development of
American Opera, Opera Memphis has been actively involved in commissioning,
workshopping and producing new works from Tennessee creators. In addition
to productions in Memphis and Nashville, these works have been seen in
New York, New Orleans, Cincinnati, South Carolina, and North Carolina.</P>

<P>The center is most interested in telling America's stories unsing America's
musical vernaculars. Last season, Mike Reid and Sarah Schlesinger's new
football opera DIFFERENT FIELDS was featured by all of the major television
networks. Articles and reviews appeared in VARIETY, THE NEW YORK TIMES,
THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE, and the LOS ANGELES TIMES. DIFFERENT FIELDS will be
performed again this season by our partner, the Metropolitan Opera Guild.</P>

<P>This season, the ARtists-in-Residence program will tour Sid Selvidge's
opera, RIVERSONGS. Commissioned and premiered in 1995, this tale of the
flood of 1927 is sure to be a hit with local audiences. The opera is also
developing a new work, FEATHERTOP, by Emanuel Serra. FEATHERTOP is based
on the Hawthorne short story. </P>

<P>Opera Memphis is grateful to a native Memphia who has generously supported
the activities of the National Center. Memphians should be very proud of
the National Center's contribution to our country's Opera/Musical Theater
field.</P>

<P>For further information on the National Center, plase contact <B>Michael
Ching</B> at (901) 678-2706.</P>
