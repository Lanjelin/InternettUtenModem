<CENTER><H2>Puccini's triptych, <CITE>Il trittico</CITE></H2>

While in Paris, Puccini was extremely impressed by the one-act performance that he 
attended.  This was the moment that his brilliant idea blossomed.  His intentions 
were to create a series of three, one-act operas each in a different style with different 
characters all to be performed on the same evening.  This was his way of changing 
the focus from drama's content to the form in which the drama was presented.  <CITE>Il trittico</CITE>
  premiered at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York on December 14, 1918, under 
the conducting of Moranzoni.  Puccini's triptych consists of <CITE>Il tabarro, Suor Angelica, </CITE>
and <CITE>Gianni Schicchi</CITE>
.<P>
<CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>
 is set in Paris in the 1900's on a barge that is tied to land on the Seine.  Michele 
is the owner of the barge and Giorgetta is his wife.  Luigi, a stevedore, finds his 
way to win over Giorgetta's heart and they proclaim their love for each other.  The 
lighting of a match is a sign from Giorgetta to Luigi that means it is safe for him 
to return to her on the barge.  When Michele notices something strange going on with 
his wife, he questions her and keeps a close watch on her.  One night, Michele strikes 
a match to light his pipe and Luigi mistakes this for Giorgetta's signal.  He appears 
on the deck, running into Michele who strangles Luigi to death for getting involved 
with his wife.  Giorgetta hears the madness and as she approaches the scene, Michele 
throws the dead body at her feet and presses her face into it as a punishment to her. 
 <P>
Their are two distinct styles of music present in <CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>.  The first half is devoted to the musical description of the atmosphere, which quickly 
changes when the drama begins with a style that is extremely effective.  The second 
half of the drama is exciting and has no letdowns, which makes up for the rather 
dull action in part one.  <CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>
  makes a thrilling opening to the <CITE>Il trittico</CITE>
 and is said to be a great piece of<CITE>verismo</CITE>
 theater.<P>
The second one-act to this performance is <CITE>Suor Angelica</CITE>
.  This takes place in a convent at the end of the 17th century.  It is a story of 
a nun, Angelica, who was sent to the convent by her family as a punishment for some 
unknown crime or sin.  One random day, her aunt comes to visit her and brings news 
of the family, which Angelica has been wishing for.  However, little did she know that the 
news brought to her would soon lead to her own death.  Angelica learns that her only 
son, whom she has seen only once, has died since she was sent away.  Once Angelica 
signs a document that her aunt puts in front of her, she is abandoned to deal with this 
grief all on her own.  She can only feel the need to be with her son in heaven, which 
leads to her creating and drinking of a poison.  A feeling of remorse suddenly comes 
over her as she quickly prays to Virgin Mary.  However, it is too late, as Angelica 
is approached by a group of angels pushing her son towards her.  <P>
<CITE>Suor Angelica's</CITE>
 opening scene offers a sharp contrast to the violent end of <CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>
.  The music styles in this one fit the action quite well and is the same throughout. 
 The best audience for <CITE>Suor Angelica</CITE>
 can probably be found among religious communities.  Puccini was not a religious man 
himself, but it is believed that this has particular meaning to him since his early 
training had been in a church.  <P>
<CITE>Gianni Schicchi,</CITE>
 the last of the three, makes a very pleasant ending for <CITE>Il trittico</CITE>.  This well-known piece is set in 1299 in Florence at the house of Buoso Donati, 
a wealthy landowner.  After Buoso's death, all the relatives are concerned with what 
they will inherit, and madly search for the will.  As it turns out, Buoso left everything to the Monks and this infuriates his family.  As a desperate solution for their greed, 
they call Gianni Schicchi, whom they know will have an answer to their problem.  
After hearing the wishes of the family, Schicchi contacts a notary and acts as Buoso 
to dictate a new will.  In doing this, he has the opportunity to leave whatever he wants 
to whomever he wants.  Schicchi undoubtedly takes advantage of this and leaves everything 
Buoso has to himself, which angers the family even more but they are under oath and can not complain.  <CITE>Gianni Schicchi</CITE>
 is a fast moving piece with rapid changes of dramatic mood.  However, it is a bright 
and entertaining piece, which provides relief after the violent <CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>
 and sentimental mood of <CITE>Suor Angelica</CITE>.  <P>
<CITE>Il trittico</CITE>
 was born during a time of crisis, when the world was drastically changing.  This 
performance did not win much acceptance by most of the audiences.  <CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>
 and <CITE>Suor Angelica</CITE>
 were considered complete downfalls, but the success of <CITE>Gianni Schicchi</CITE>
 made up for what the other two lacked.  <CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>
 is criticized for lacking sympathy for all characters and <CITE>Suor Angelica</CITE>
 is shot down because of its all-female cast and the lack of music variation.  <CITE>Gianni Schicchi</CITE>
 could only be praised by all audiences, but was most accepted in Vienna.  Giannotto 
Bastianello, a Florentine critic, considered <CITE>Il tabarro</CITE>
 to be "a failure with patches of genius."  As for <CITE>Suor Angelica</CITE>
, he states that it is "a dream that does honor to Puccini and the librettist Forzano 
especially for the novelty of its intentions if not for the taste and musical quality 
of the result."  <CITE>Gianni Schicchi</CITE>
 gives the impression of "being the last and loftiest result in the history of Italian 
opera buffa."  The three little one-act operas that make up <CITE>Il trittico</CITE>
 supposedly represent a sense of crisis during Puccini's later life.  <P>
