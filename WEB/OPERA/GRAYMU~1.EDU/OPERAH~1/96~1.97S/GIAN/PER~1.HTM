<CENTER><H2>Buoso's Ghost: Recent Performances</H2>
<H3>by <A HREF="mailto:towsd@rhodes.edu">Shaun Townsend</A></H3></CENTER>
<B>Buoso's Ghost had what Michael Ching called it's "mini-premiere" in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at the Byham Theater on February 16, 1996.  There was an article written about the opera in the city's Tribune-Review  by Candy Williams. <P>

In the article, Ching is quoted as saying, "I kind of feel like I'm collaborating with this guy named Puccini, which is pretty scary."  Ching also says he feels that this is a way to introduce people to opera who have not been associated with it before.   "This is a way to reach across that bridge.  It's new but it's not new.  I certainly wouldn't want to be know for writing sequels, but it serves a purpose."<P>
  
Of the performance in Pittsburgh, Ching explained that it gave him the opportunity to see the work on stage before staging the complete production that will be performed with Gianni Schicchi at the Orpheum Theater in Memphis on Saturday, January 25 and on Tuesday, January 28, 1997. <P></B>
