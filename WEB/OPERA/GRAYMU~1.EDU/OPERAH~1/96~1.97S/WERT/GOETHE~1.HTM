<BR>
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who loved from August 28, 1749, to March 22, 1978,  was 
known to the world for his great literary works.  Born in Frankfurt am Main to a 
well-to-do middle-class family, Goethe was educated by his father who withdrew from 
public service in order to make sure that Goethe got a proper education.  <BR>
<BR>
When Goethe was sixteen-years-old, he began his studies in Leipzig.  There he wrote 
his earliest poems and plays.  Under the influence of Johann Gottfried von Herder, 
Goethe learned of Shakespeare in 1770.  In 1771, Goethe received a licentiate in 
law at Strasbourg.  For the next four years, he practiced law with his father.  During this 
time period, Goethe came to literary fame.  In 1775, he was brought to the ducal 
court of Karl Augustus in Saxe-Weimar, where Goethe held many high positions and 
spent almost all of the remainder of his life.  <BR>
<BR>
From 1786-1788, Goethe traveled in Italy where he recognized that he was an artist 
and decided to devote the rest of his life to writing.  After returning to Weimar, 
he was alienated from the court society.  Goethe married the young Christiane Vulpius 
in 1806 to legitimize their son born in 1789, even though many of his friends disagreed 
with the relationship.<BR>
<BR>
When Goethe withdrew from public life, he produced his best literary and scientific 
achievements (1794-1805).  He worked until his death at the age of 82.<BR>
