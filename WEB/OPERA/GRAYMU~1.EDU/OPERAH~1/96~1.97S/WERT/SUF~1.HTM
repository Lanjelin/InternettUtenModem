" 'Human nature,' I contained, 'has its bounds: it can endure joy, sorrow, pain, up to a certain degree, and it perishes as soon as that degree is exceeded.  In this case it is then not a question of whether a man is weak or strong, but whether he can outlast the measure of his suffering- be it spiritual or physical; and I find it just as strange to say that the man who takes his life is a coward, as it would be improper to call a man cowardly who dies of a malignant fever' " (Goethe 64).<BR>

These prophetic words issued from Goethe's troubled creation grasp the entire theme 
of <CITE>The Sufferings of Young Werther.  </CITE>
This novelette was written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1774, and it narrates 
a brief period in the life of young Werther.  Goethe wrote a unique type of novel 
for his time.  It encompasses all the classic aspects of German Romanticism, such 
as a deep understanding of nature, cathartic emotions, and the innocence and power of love. 
 The novelette was considered a great innovation because of its deep emotional subject. 
 The public saw this as enlightening because, until Goethe, no author had ventured 
into the psychological understandings of human beings.  Goethe's work is highly charged 
with emotional fervor that captivates the reader, and takes them on journey into 
the mind of the young, tormented Werther.<P>
In order to captivate his readers Goethe had to create a distinctive way in which 
to convey the sentiments of Werther.  Ultimately, Goethe chose to present his story 
in the first person.  Not only was the story written in the first person, but it 
was projected through the diary entries of young Werther.  This style helps to demonstrate 
the exact thinking and emotions of Werther concerning his love, Charlotte.  The diary 
entries are written with much detail and care, as though they were dictated by Werther 
himself.  One begins to wonder how Goethe was able to transmit such a realistic point 
of view.  It is almost as if he is recounting a story close to his own heart.  <P>
<CITE>The Sufferings of Young Werther </CITE>
recount the story of Werther undying love for Charlotte, the eldest daughter of a 
local town bailiff.  As the story opens, Werther is simply recounting his profound 
interest and love of nature in his diary.  Werther is a classic romantic.  As the 
days progress Werther is introduced to Charlotte and instantly falls in love with her.  He 
describes their first meeting with vivid detail and deep emotional ties.  The introduction 
of Werther to Charlotte occurs when Wilhelm, Charlotte's father, asks him to escort her to a local party.  Werther happily obliges his friend, and does not think to 
much of this.  The evening that the two spend together is filled with wonderful times. 
 Werther gives much detail about how he loved watching Charlotte move on the dance 
floor.  And there is equal detail when he expresses his disappointment upon hearing of 
her engagement to Albert.  The evening ends with Werther escorting Charlotte home 
with the promise of seeing her soon.<P>
The next few months are filled with encounters between Charlotte and Werther.  He 
continues to express his desire to be with her.  Werther feels as if Charlotte were 
his life; he must be with her.  The relationship between the two does not seem to 
bother Albert, Charlotte's new husband, according to Werther.  He writes extensively of how 
Albert is cordial and overly friendly to him.  Most likely, Albert is displaying 
a facade in order to make his wife happy because, according to Werther, he was deeply 
in love with Charlotte as well.  <P>
As the months continue to go by, Werther becomes more and more distraught over his 
relationship with Charlotte.  He feels that he can no longer live without her love. 
 Werther wants more than just a mere friendship, but he realizes her marriage to 
Albert is final.  The writings in his diary reveal a deeply troubled, confused, and sad young 
man.  Thoughts of suicide begin to plague his mind.  In the writings, he calls out 
to Charlotte claiming that  he can no longer live, and he feels death would be a 
happy slumber.  It is at this point in the novel that Goethe, himself, interrupts the novel 
with an <CITE>Editor to the Reader.  </CITE>
This is intended to describe the distraught mental state of Werther by the time December 
comes.  Goethe explains that Werther has now subjected himself to a deep depression, 
and is highly contemplating suicide.<P>
It is at Christmas that Werther decides to take his life.  The ironic point to this 
story is the fact that he borrows the gun from Albert, Charlotte's husband.  Werther 
makes it a point to write Charlotte a letter explaining his actions.  He believes 
that he can no longer live without the prospect of her love.  It is late December when 
Werther sends his servant to fetch Albert's gun.  It is at this point that Charlotte 
begins to realize the plot of Werther, but she is too late.  Early one morning Werther 
utters the words, "They are loaded- The clock strikes twelve! So be it, then!- Lotte! 
Lotte! farewell! farewell!", and shoots himself through the head.  His servant finds 
him with a weak pulse and calls for the doctors.  It is at this point that Charlotte 
runs to his side and falls in faint.  Werther dies at twelve noon that same day and 
is buried in a place previously chosen by himself.  <P>
The story of young Werther is one that is full of deep emotional intrigue and heartache. 
 It is a story that has the ability to touch every heart.  The relationship between 
Charlotte and Werther is full of unattainable love and personal anguish.  Goethe's ability to portray this scenario is to be envied by all.  He must have, at one point 
in his life, felt these same feelings of love.  The novelette is love story full 
all who have ever loved or want to love.</FONT><STRONG><P>
