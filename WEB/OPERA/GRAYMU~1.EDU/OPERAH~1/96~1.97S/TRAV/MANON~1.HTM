<H2>A Comparison of Manon and Violetta</H2>
<H3>by Chad Cross</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
Verdi's <CITE>La Traviata, </CITE> and Puccini's <CITE>Manon Lescaut </CITE> both tell a tale of enduring love.  The protagonists in both operas go through strikingly familiar dramas, and both spend their dying moments proclaiming their eternal love. The first main similarity we notice between these two characters is their beauty, and the recognition of that beauty by all the other characters.  Violetta is first shown at a luxurious party dancing and singing, and being loved and admired by all 
the guests.  Manon is also admired for her beauty, and also lives in the lap of luxury.<P>
Increasingly, both Alfredo, who loves Violetta, and Des Grieux, who loves Manon fall instantly in love with with these two beauties.  We see the the two men have familiar scenes where the both speak of their new found love.  After realizing their own love for these men, both Violetta and Manon are seen giving up their respective lifestyles. Violetta agrees to leave her happy-go-lucky life she was leaving to live a secluded 
life in the country with Alfredo, and Manon agrees to leave the wealth and luxury her elderly admirer Geronte provides, and flee to Paris with Des Grieux.  <P>
Along these same lines, both Violetta and Manon are seemingly pulled away from their lovers for a time.  Violetta is convinced by Alfredo's father to leave him for Alfredo's sake, and she does this out of pure love for Alfredo.  Manon also leaves Des Grieux for a while, but it is her own affinity for wealth and luxury that causes her departure. However, both Manon and Violetta are extremely unhappy away from their true loves. 
Des Grieux and Alfredo are also cast into despair, as their life is shattered by the loss of their love.  Violetta and Manon are so captivating and magnificent that once in love with them, a man cannot live without them.<P>
Verdi and Puccini were obviously romantics. We see the two heroines running back to their true loves, as if it were fate's will.  Violetta becomes so distraught without her Alfredo, that she becomes physically ill, convinced that only Alfredo can ease her pain, and, of course, in the last act, he rushes back to her.  Manon, in a similar situation, is forced to leave the country, and Des Grieux is barely able to go with her, but he makes it safely into her arms.<P>
After our two couples are back together, we think all is well.  Violetta will soon be well with Alfredo back, and Des Grieux and Manon will live a happy life together in America. However, this is not the case.  In two heart breaking scenes, we see both Violetta and Manon die professing their never ending love for Alfredo and Des Grieux.<P>
These two operas are wonderful works.  For the romantic at heart, they are a must see.  Highlighted by beautiful arias, and excellent music, the tale they tell of love is unforgettable. <BR>
