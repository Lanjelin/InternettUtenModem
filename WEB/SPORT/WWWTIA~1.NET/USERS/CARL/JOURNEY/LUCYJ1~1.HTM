If you want to see the world but can't afford it or can't find someone to go,
you should try going with an overland group.  There are several companies that 
offer such trips....a few names would be Encounter Overland, Guerba (who 
specialises mostly in Africa), Encounter, or Exodus.  All of the companies 
offer trips to various parts of the world, mostly no frills.  There's another 
company called Trek America that does camping trips in the U.S. (and maybe 
Canada?) too.<P>

I signed up for a trip last year with Encounter Overland that drove from 
Kathmandu to Bombay on an overland truck.  I went by myself and met up with 15 
other people....we camped the whole way and made our own meals for the most 
part (eating out about 1/3 of the time).  Having said that, the trip was a lot 
of hard work - you were up at the crack of dawn, or earlier on some days, and 
every day was jam-packed with driving and/or excursions.  Nevertheless, we had 
an absolute blast.  Everyone in the group was good-spirited and game for 
anything.  We saw/did everything imaginable between Kathmandu and Bombay!  
....I've kept in touch with about 1/2 of them through writing or meeting up 
with them in other travels.  Three of us are even thinking of doing another 
trip next year to someplace else.<P>

I would highly recommend Encounter Overland - their truck/equipment was in good 
condition, the trip leader was very capable (he explained their vigorous 
requirements for leaders), and they provide unfailing backup in the event that 
it's needed.  Encounter Overland is also low-end in price because you do all 
the work.  The high-end of the companies I'm familiar with would be Guerba.  
For starters, they usually send a cook along, although 2 of you are helpers 
each night.  Believe me, having a cook around is a BIG plus....but there are 
lots of other things to weigh about each company if you are thinking of doing 
it.<P>

Anyway, if anyone is interested in finding out more about these trips you 
should be able to get a brochure from travel agencies around here (it's 
possible most of these companies are based in Britain but they should have 
offices here too).  If you don't mind waiting, there's a company in London 
called Trailfinders.  They act as agents for all of these companies as well as 
book airfares pretty cheaply.  You can write or call...most of the agents I 
spoke to had done trips themselves so they were well informed if you wanted to 
ask questions....expensive phone call from here tho....<P>
