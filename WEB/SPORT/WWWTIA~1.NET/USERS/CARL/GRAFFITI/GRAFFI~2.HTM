<b>I turned 16 while in Austria with my parents and older sister. The year was 1962.  We rode a train to near the summit of a mountain called "The Yungfrau".  My sister and I rented skis. I had never skied before. As I stood there,wobbly-legged...my sister shoved me from behind.  I did'nt know how to stop....   Downhill from me was a glacial crevass perhaps 20 feet across and 200 feet deep.   Wind whipping at me....I threw myself to the hard-packed snow.....skidding.....clawing at the ice.....my body finnally came to a stop with one leg hanging into the abyss.  I am 50 years old now. And that day on the Yungfrau was my first and LAST foray into skiing...!</b><br>

<b>I was skiing my first time at Mulitpor on Mt. Hood.  It was very icy.  Needless to say I had fallen my fair share of times, and so I was tense and leaning backwards which was making me fall all the more, and it also made me go faster!  Suddenly, I found myself out of control, bookin it down this hill with my poles flailing.  This man appeared on the slope from out of nowhere...too terrified to turn, and too tense to do it even if I remembered how, I barreled towards him and slid over the the top of his skis!  Still barreling faster, towards the bottom, disgruntled skiiers got out of my ways as I tucked and prayed.  Amazingly, I made it to the bottom of the slope, came to a complete stop and just stood there dazed.  And then, glutton for punishment, I got right back on the lift and did it again!  As you can tell, Im still alive, but I am much safer to others if I am rollerblading! </b><br>

<b>When I was a teenager I used to go out into the California desert near Barstow to shoot my guns. One day I was out there in the trackless desert wastes firiing my British Enfield Mark4 .303 at a large boulder.  I had fired off about a hundred rounds....and then some guy came running up from a slight depression in the ground just behind the boulder. Unknown to me...he had gone looking for a place to relieve himself and was squatting behind the boulder..pants down..when I began firing.  None of my bullets struck him...thank God.

<b>Hey everyone.  I use to be terrified of high places.  I wouldn't even climb a ladder.   I use to get teased all the time about it.  And then one day, I was hit with a ton of inspiration.  I saw a movie titled "Drop Zone".  I thought to myself, "If I can do that I can do any thing.  So I called up Eloy (Skydive Arizona) and made a reservation.  I was  very scared but I had something to prove.  I went up to 13,000 feet, got strapped to my instructor, and went out the door for my first Tandum.  I fell, I lived, I loved it!  I have  only jumped 5 times since but that has been due to lack of money.  Hey, If I could bottle  up the feeling you get when you go out the door of that plane, I would sell it and be the richest man in the world!  If you haven't fell, you have not lived!

<b>On September 15, 1996 my Mom and I had our first tandem skydive.  We waited for 2 or 3 hours for the weather to clear up and finally a hole in the clouds was spotted.  We ran to our plane with my father white as a ghost watching us go up and up into the sky.    We finally reached the 12,500' where we would jump.  Mom and her jumpmaster went first I watched in excitement as she disappeared below.  Now it was my turn.  I sat in the edge of the door with my legs wrapped around the plane and 1,2,3 we were gone.    All was blissful for 2 seconds then we were falling through a giant hail storm at 120mph.  All I could think about was I HATE THIS!  Finally when my jumpmster Kevin felt it was safe he pulled the rip cord.  All was fine then.  The view was spectacular and I couldn't believe how quiet and peaceful it was up there.  All in all the jump was fun except for the hail storm.  For anyone who hasn't fallen through a hail storm-DON'T.  My face was red, blotchy and swollen for 3 days not to mention that it was extremely painful.  I would say that even through all of the pain it was worth it though.  We are even planning on jumping again in the spring when there isn't a cloud in sight. </b><br>

Went to a wonderful place in Xenia, Ohio called ,at the time, The Greene County Sport Parachute Club.  Great guys all.  I guess my lack of response to his READY? while sitting in the door was a positive sign to my particular jumpmaster as he just looked at me and smiled that big "you-know-what" eatin' grin and said GO!..

<b>My father was a paratrooper in the service, and has always talked about his experiences jumping out of airlplanes, so naturally, I've always wanted to try it. Well it took 33 years, but I finally did it. On August 29, 1996 I made my first jump tandem, and will never be the same. Due to lack of time and funds, I have yet to make a second jump. My plans are get my Level A this Spring, when the weather clears. I can not tell you what a wonderful experience it is, seems to be taking over my whole thought process lately!!! Unfortunatly, I am not getting alot of support from my family, they all think I have lost my mind. Well, if you have ever had the desire to skydive I say go for it.
