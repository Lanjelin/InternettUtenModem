<H3>Third jump - Friday, September 29, 1995</H3>
<P>
Level 3 is a good jump because there isn't much of anything you have to do 
besides staying stable.  The JMs wait for you to get in your arch, and then 
slowly let go of you if you are stable enough.  If you become unstable they 
reattach until you stabilize, and then let go again.  Your assignment is to 
pick a point on the horizon and to keep facing that point.  If you begin to 
turn, you stop the turn and then pick a new point to face.
<P>
Initially, I felt confident about this jump, because I had done well with 
my level 2 jump.  This jump seemed simpler and easier than the level 2, so I 
thought that I'd be OK with it.  When I got to the jump school, it seemed 
somewhat deserted.  Corinne was there in manifest and told me that she'd have 
to check about whether I'd be jumping but that it looked pretty good.  It was 
about 50 degrees on the ground -- cool enough that I had a jacket on to keep 
comfortable.
<P>
When I got into the hangar, Dino, the head JM, was there along with 
Hanne.  As I approached he stared at me, almost a glare really, and said, "I 
hope you like f---ing cold."  He seemed annoyed, almost angry, that we were 
making the jump in this temperature.  This put me on edge almost immediately.  
Hanne came out and she mentioned that we'd be jumping from the Cessna.  I had 
thought that might be the case when I saw that there was no one else there.  I 
didn't know what the Cessna would be like, and with Dino's attitude I was 
getting more tense by the minute.
<P>
Hanne took me to the Cessna demo to drill me on the Cessna exit.  Instead 
of taking position in the door, you climb out on a small wing strut, holding on 
with your hands, and leap backwards.  I was confused about it, and took a few 
tries to get it right.  I didn't like the change, in that it was more for me to 
remember.  I also didn't like the Cessna.  I bumped my head on the wing, and 
just didn't think that I'd have a good exit.  I knew for sure that it wouldn't 
be as easy as leaping out the door of the Otter.
<P>
We did final preparation for the jump, and Hanne had me assemble my own 
equipment.  I did a terrible job and felt clumsy and stupid.  Hanne kept 
correcting things and seemed annoyed with me.  She let me wear my own gloves 
for the jump, since it was so cold out.  Dino was being overbearing and making 
me feel intimidated and nervous.  Before we even left the ground I was feeling 
down about the jump.
<P>
We all packed into the Cessna and it took off.  Dino was starting to relax 
a little and even pointed some scenery out while we were in the air, but I was 
completely tensed up and relaxation was nearly impossible.  I didn't know what 
the Cessna would be like, or the cold at 13,500 feet, or what Dino would be 
like as a JM.  Finally the plane was at 13,500 feet and Dino opened the door.  
A blast of cold air came into the plane.  He looked around for a little while 
as we changed position, getting ready for the jump.  This jump probably tied 
the first for nervousness at the door of the plane.  Dino put on a full crash 
helmet and told me to climb out on the wing after him.  The wind was strong, 
but not as bad as I thought it would be.  I put my right hand out to hold on, 
and my right foot on the little step.  He motioned for me to come all the way 
out, and I crossed my left foot over my right and put my left hand out to hold 
on.  I shifted a bit and arched, trailing my right foot in the air as 
instructed.  I was thinking, "at least I've done this part right!"
<P>
I did a quick hotel check, went up, down, and back I went, into the air.  
The position was radically different from the Otter, which threw me off.  It 
was cold, which stiffened me up a little.  I was very tense, which stiffened me 
up a lot.  As a result, my third jump was just like my first.  I couldn't arch, 
couldn't get control of my body, and was unstable.  My first COA lasted a long 
time, and I blew off my practice ripcord touch, just whacking my waist a 
little.  I didn't think it would be noticed -- but it was.  The second circle 
of awareness, like the first, had lots of "relax" signals, which just made me 
more unstable.  The JMs had to hold on to me the entire time, and even then I 
buffeted in the wind.  They gave up trying to correct me at around 9,000 feet, 
which I was very frustrated about.  I kept looking at them, waiting to get a 
signal on my arch, and got none.  Freefall is less than a minute, so every 
second counts for practice, and giving up on me like that made for a lot less 
practice.  I resolved in the air to complain about that.
<P>
At 5,500 feet I gave the signal, and popped my chute at 4,500 feet.  The 
sun had been warming things up, so at this altitude, with my gloves on, the 
cold wasn't really too bad.  I knew for sure that I would be repeating level 3, 
but I decided to at least try to enjoy the canopy ride.  I flew around for 
quite a while, doing more daring sharp turns, before my radio finally came on.  
The radio man guided me in well, but for some reason I panicked and began to 
flare at about 25 feet.  The radio man was watching and yelled "TOO EARLY!" 
into the radio, which was fortunate and probably saved me a serious injury.  I 
backed off on the flare, putting the toggles most of the way back up, and 
re-flared at about 10 feet.  I banged the ground pretty hard.  My ankles and 
knees tingled and hurt.  I didn't want them to know that I had screwed up my 
landing, so I guffed it and walked back to the hangar without complaining about 
it.  The radio man mentioned that if I did something like that again the more 
proper course would be to leave the toggles down at my shoulders and then pull 
them as hard as I could instead of bringing them back up.  He said that 
bringing them all the way back up would tend to make a harder landing, and in 
fact if I was low enough, it might bang me into the ground hard enough to do 
serious injury.  I felt a little scared about the landing, and walked back for 
my debriefing.
<P>
When I dropped my gear, much to my horror, I didn't have the ripcord.  I 
remembered holding on to it, and felt that I must've dropped it on the field.  
Dino asked me to go find it with an ominous tone.  I searched for it, didn't 
find it, and was turning red.  The radio man came to my rescue because he 
remembered exactly where I had landed.  Sure enough, the ripcord was right 
there on the ground.  I hadn't let it go in the air.
<P>
Dino did the debriefing.  He mostly restated the obvious, that I was 
dearched and unstable, and didn't really listen to my explanations for why it 
happened.  He nailed me for the failed practice touch, which I almost laughed 
about.  I admitted that I had purposely been lazy about it and resolved to do 
the touch correctly every time after that.  The comment I remember most from 
him was something like, "Oh, yeah.  You'll have to do this one again.  Yes, 
definitely," as he wrote "repeat level 3" in my logbook.   I would say that 
Dino has not mastered the teaching skill of encouragement.  I left for work 
feeling pretty down, and in a lot of pain.  My legs hurt all the way from my 
hips down, and walking was even a little difficult.  I was hoping that this 
would get better quickly; I had a jump scheduled for the next day.
