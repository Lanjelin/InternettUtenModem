Yes I was petrified.  I had done a tandem before and knew a little more   
what to expect but it still didn't prepare me.  What will help,
especially on the AFF jumps, is if you drill the dive from the point of   
taking your position in the door.  Drill it so it becomes automatic then   
when you are in the plane it will become automatic - you won't have to
think and your body will take over.  I was scared, everyone was, you just  
learn how to deal with it.  My first jump I was the last group out of the  
plane on a second pass over the airport.  So the plane flew around for 10  
minutes with just me and my jumpmasters.  I sat about as far from the
door as you could get.  About every minute my primary JM asked "Are you   
ready to skydive?", of course I'd answer yes.  Then my mind would race -   
This is dumb, I can just say go down, I don't have to do this etc etc
etc..  Then when I heard "Take your position in the door" it was
automatic.  I just did what I had practiced on the ground and didn't even  
think about what was "out there" beyond the door.  Because no matter what  
you think it is, it probably won't be anything you expect.<P>

Everyone has dealt with and deals with the fear.  You can petrify
yourself, freeze your mind.  The biggest piece of advice I can give you   
is - relax.  Relax your mind and body.  Once you're out in the air you
will relax because your body and mind realize you are committed and it
isn't the falling sensation most people think it is.  Deal with 1 thing   
at a time.  First getting out the door, then get stable, then COA,
prcp's, COA, 5-5, look reach pull, check, 1 1000, 2 1000, 3 1000, check   
chute (good shape, no spin and quiet), toggles down, control ability
check and then check for the airport.  The second piece of advice is HAVE  
FUN!!!  That is why we do this right?  Everyone deals with fear, many one  
each and every dive they just learn how to control it, control their
mind.  It is all a mind game - it is what we think will happen, or expect  
which may never happen.  You have to learn to deal with what happens as   
it happens and not worry about what could, or should.  It sounds like a   
lot to deal with.  I started july 4 1996 and have over 70 dives now so I   
know very well what you went through and will go through.  If others have  
dealt with it, and I have dealt with it, you can deal with it.  It takes   
different things for different people.  Everyone has their "sticking
points".  Each dive you will remember more, your awareness will grow,
your coordination will grow, your confidence will grow.  I was scared on   
all my AFF dives and many of the dives I did right after AFF. I was so
scared until probably my level 4 AFF.  It was on this dive I had the most  
fun and knew that this was a sport I loved.  Each dive I got a little
less scared or learned to deal with it better.  No sense wasting energy   
on something that may not happen.  You don't dread driving because you
learned to deal with things as they happen when you're behind the wheel. 
Same in skydiving, just deal with what happens.<P>

I know what it was and is like to be scared.  You'll reap great rewards
facing that fear and overcoming it.  I think thats what is truly amazing
about this sport.<P>
