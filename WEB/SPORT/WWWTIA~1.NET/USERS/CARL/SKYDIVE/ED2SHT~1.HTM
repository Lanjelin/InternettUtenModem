<H3>Second jump - Saturday, September 16, 1995</H3>
<P>
Between the first jump and this jump I had watched some other jumpers' 
level 2 videos.  In the level 2 jump, you have to do turns and forward 
movement.  I wasn't confident about my arch, but decided to try my best 
anyway.  As it turns out, this was my best jump.  I got to the airport a few 
minutes late, and found Carl there.  He had a level 4 jump (1 JM) scheduled for 
the same time, so we hoped to be on the same plane.  At first, Carl was 
scheduled to jump out of the Cessna and was nervously pacing about, dreading 
it.  They changed their minds about that and put him aboard the Otter, so we 
were indeed going on the same plane.  We geared up around the same time.  My 
training for this jump was much shorter, a little arch practice, an explanation 
and then some practice on how to do turns and forward movement using the round 
table, and the usual rapid-fire quizzing on things.  This time I was jumping 
with Hanne and JJ, which I was excited about, since I liked Hanne a lot as my 
ground instructor.  I got on the plane before Carl, because he was doing a 
higher level jump.  Being next to Hanne in the plane was fun, though it was a 
bit distracting, especially when she checked my gear (hubba-hubba :-).
<P>
At 13,500 feet Carl started taking his position, and I gave him a thumbs 
up, which he reciprocated.  He took his position with a grave expression on his 
face, making me realize how much more difficult jumping out was for him than it 
was for me.  He lined up at the door with his JM, quickly went through the exit 
procedure, and he was out!  I was next to jump, but they circled the plane for 
a few minutes to let Carl get far enough away to avoid any possible collision.  
I lined up in the door, and with almost no hesitation I jumped out.
<P>
This time, I had no sensory deprivation and was ready to arch the moment I 
left the door.  I arched as best I could and did my first circle of awareness 
so early that the JMs were still steadying themselves and couldn't look at me.  
It was then that I realized this was going to be a better jump.  I repeated the 
COA and got a "legs out" signal from Hanne.  I adjusted my legs -- and got a 
thumbs up!  This was a great moment for me, the best moment I've had in 
skydiving.  I had the arch!  I looked over at JJ, and got another thumbs up.  I 
had it right!  I did my practice ripcord touches, and did my second COA, and 
got two thumbs up!  Here I was, still above 10,000 feet, and was all set with 
the arching!  I decided to start my maneuvers.  I pushed down my right arm to 
do a right turn, and actually turned!  It worked so well that I was a little 
nervous about my left turn back, and did a weak left turn.  I stablized from 
the turns, thinking "wow!" and straightened my legs for the forward movement.  
The wind seemed to increase a bit, but I couldn't tell that I was moving 
forward.  Still, I was doing what I'd been told, so I figured it was OK.  At 
this point it was about 7,000 feet, so I wanted to get back in the arch 
position and enjoy the last few seconds of freefall.
<P>
When I tried to unlock my knees and get back to an arch, somehow I went 
too far and my knees buckled.  I immediately went unstable, and started bucking 
severely.  Both JMs had to grab on to me with both hands and hold tightly to 
keep me under control.  I panicked a little and my legs went back and forth, 
but after a few seconds I got back into a stable arch.  When I pulled my 
ripcord, there was vacuum on my back and the chute didn't deploy.  For a split 
second I was confused at not feeling the pull, and then remembered "oh yeah -- 
the check!"  I tipped my head back and immediately felt the pull of the 
expanding chute.  This time, I concentrated on holding on to the rip cord.
<P>
My chute deployed without a problem, and I unzipped a little to stow the 
ripcord.  The radio crackled on and the radioman complained that I had stowed 
my ripcord before getting my toggles, but I ignored him and proceeded with the 
canopy check.  I unpacked the steering toggles but felt that my head didn't fit 
well between the risers.  I looked up again to check my canopy, and realized 
that I had line twist!  The risers were twisted two or three times and the 
chute wasn't fully deployed.  I remembered my training, and grabbed the risers, 
pulling them apart and kicking to untwist.  Sure enough, the line twist came 
out immediately and I reached for the steering toggles again.  I pulled hard to 
flare, then let the toggles all the way up and did agressive left and right 
turns.  The chute responded aggressively, flying me around in circles instead 
of the gentle turns I had performed in my first jump.  The radio man gave me 
more direction this time, not allowing me to play around as much in the air, 
but it was still a nice ride.
<P>
There wasn't much wind at all that day, so when I came in for my landing I 
had a lot of horizontal speed.  When I hit the ground I tumbled forward and my 
head touched the ground, but not hard enough to really hurt.  I got up quickly 
and collapsed my chute, packing it up for the walk into the hangar.  I felt 
strongly that I would clear for level 3, since the only thing I'd done wrong 
was that short arch buckling at 7,000 feet.
<P>
In the debriefing, JJ focused on that arch buckle, asking for an 
explanation.  I told him that I'd just overcompensated coming out of the 
forward movement and panicked a little, but felt that I had reformed my arch 
well, even mentioning the vacuum on my back.  He wrote up the jump in my log 
book and cleared me for level 3.  I was wildly ecstatic, feeling like I finally 
had it right.  Later, Carl and I went out for dinner and a beer, which I needed 
to help calm me down from the extreme high.  The memory of this jump alone was 
worth all the time, money, and everything else.
