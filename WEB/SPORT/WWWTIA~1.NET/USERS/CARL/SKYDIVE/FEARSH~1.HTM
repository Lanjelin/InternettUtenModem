<H3>MY FEELINGS ON FEAR</H3>

I believe fear was designed as nature's way to force people to acknowledge and 
respect danger.  That was all well and good centuries ago, maybe even just one 
century ago.  However, in today's world, it often gets in the way.  It produces 
reactions that simply are not how we should react.  For example, have you ever 
been in a car accident?  What reaction did fear produce in you?  Let me see if 
I can guess.  Either, you froze, you braced yourself for impact, you slammed 
the brakes to the floor, you spun the steering wheel as far as it could go, you 
covered you face with your arms or hands, or a combination of any of those.  Is 
that the best thing you could have done in the situation?  If you froze, that's 
bad.  You did nothing to avoid or lessen the impact.  The same applies to 
bracing yourself or covering your face.  If you slammed the breaks to the 
floor, that's bad.  Pumping the breaks would have slowed you much faster.  If 
you spun the wheel all the way, that's bad.  You probably went into a spin or 
at least a skid.  If you slammed the breaks and spun the wheel, you definitely 
went into a spin.  Wouldn't it have made much more sense to have turned the 
wheel a little, or pumped the breaks or a compromise between the two?  Could 
you have avoided or lessened the impact?  My point is this, as long as you 
acknowledge and respect danger, you should eliminate fear from your life.  It 
does more harm than good.  If you do not have fear in your life, you will find 
yourself enjoying life much more.  You will also find that you go further, and 
do more, which will make you enjoy life even more.  That will make you go 
further and do more.  It's a vicious, but good, cycle.  This does not only 
apply to things such as skydiving.  This affects your whole life.  Throughout 
your homelife and your career, you will be in situations where fear can really 
slow or stop your progress.  Why let it?  Why not decide you aren't going to 
allow fear to run your life?  All you need to do is make a conscious decision.  
As long as you acknowledge and respect danger, there is no need for fear.<P>

I always thought skydiving would be fun, but I was also always scared to death 
of heights.  So, I never pursued skydiving.  I just thought it was something I 
was not capable of doing.  However, after I had decided to eliminate fear from 
my life, I realized that skydiving was now possible.  So, after returning to 
Mass, after a tour of duty in Alabama (Air Force, and no I didn't fly a plane), 
I decided it was time to confront my biggest fear.<P>

As the plane was taking off for my first skydive, I was nervous.  The higher we 
got, the more nervous I got.  Then they opened the door.  I could see people 
leaving the plane.  Every time someone jumped, I could feel the plane adjust to 
its new weight.  I got real nervous.  Then, I saw the view from the door.  I 
could see the threshold a few feet below my head (I was bent over), and the 
ground over two and a half miles below.  That is absolutely the most terrifying 
scene I have ever witnessed.  My body froze.  However, as soon as my body froze 
I remembered my decision not to allow fear in my life.  My brain shut down the 
fear and I walked to the door.  I got into position and jumped without any 
hesitation.  That was the greatest moment in my life to date.  Nothing will 
ever compare to overcoming that fear.<P>

If you are interested in how people have overcome fear, I have included a
couple of <A HREF="OVERCO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.tiac.net/users/carl/skydive/overcome.shtml">pages about overcoming fear.</A><P>

While I respect that everyone's psyches are different, it is important to
know that most skydivers do not overcome or eliminate fear as you would
leave people to believe.  After extensive sessions with fellow jumpers, I
think it is more appropriate to say that we stop letting fear dictate our
decisions and learn to enjoy it.  The jumps you will remember are the scary
ones (For me:  watching a canopy open below me with visions of wrap in my
head, AAD early fire on a student rig and two open canopies, night jump,
etc.)  A number of my friends were seriously hurt in a plane crash in VA
this weekend.  I am terrified to jump.  That fear is there.  And just as
the decision to jump again after each of my other harrowing experiences led
to an incredible, exhilirating jump, so will this.<P>

We still know fear but it is a companion that reminds us we are alive not a
snake whose bite paralyzes us.  My first jumpmaster said,"I won't take
anybody up whose not a little scared, because those are the ones who are
crazy, cocky or stupid, and those are the ones that end up dead."  Even
jumpers with 1000's still know fear; the ones who forget it do things like
bail out to video a jump with no gear on (true story).<P>

Hank,<P>

I am sorry to hear about your friends in VA.<P>

I will modify my site to more clearly indicate that my pages about fear
describe my own feelings, not those of all skydivers.  I am curious though,
what led you to believe I was trying to speak for all skydivers?  I
specifically titled that section "My Feelings On Fear".  I don't understand
where you got that idea.<P>

I guess I did not describe what I meant by "acknowledge and respect danger"
well enough.  I don't think you understand what I mean.  I strongly believe
that someone who does not fear skydiving and does not acknowledge or
respect the danger involved will end up dead.  That is the person who will
dive without a rig!  However, I believe that someone who acknowledges and
respects the danger in skydiving has a much better chance of surviving
without injury than someone who fears the danger.  Fear tends cause
instinctive responses.  Eventually any person will come across a situation
that requires something other than instinct.  If they fear the danger, they
will most likely get hurt or killed.  Just as someone who fears the danger,
the person who acknowledges and respects fear works on safety procedures
before and during the jump.  However, they do not panic or rely on instinct
when faced with a situation for which they didn't prepare.  Instead, they
are still calm and able to think it through.<P>

I think it's disappointing that humans still feel the need for fear.  I
include myself in that statement!  Everyone everywhere feels the pull of
fear.  However, I believe we do not need fear to survive.  I believe fear
no longer produces the responses that will save our lives in a dangerous
situation.  Today there are too many situations where instinct will produce
a counterproductive action.  I believe it is far more important for us to
acknowledge and respect danger, by constantly working on and improving our
safety procedures, and remaining calm and coherent during dangerous
situations.<P>

In an attempt to clarify my stance on fear, and the fact that I am not
trying to speak for all skydivers, I would like to include your original
email and this reply on my web site.  Do you have any objections?<P>

Thanks,<BR>

One more thing I forgot to mention in my reply.  On one of my jumps, I
suffered slider lock, and my chute didn't open.  However, even though I
wasn't scared, I acted properly.  As my chute finally opened, I watched the
guy video taping my dive continue to fall.  His chute didn't open until he
was 700 feet from the ground.  As you can imagine, that was pretty scary. 
I thought I was going to watch him hit!  However, that is not my most
memorable dive.  My most memorable dive was a sunset solo that went
perfectly smoothly.  The exit was good, the view was awesome, the maneuvers
went smoothly, the chute ride was calm, the landing was soft.  Nothing went
wrong, nothing scary happened.  However, it was beautiful and peaceful. 
That is what I consider memorable.<P>
