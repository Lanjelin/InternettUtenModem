I am currently an A-licensed skydiver with 36 jumps, and my two jumps 
were tandems.  All but two of my jumps have been made at Skydive Arizona 
in Eloy, Arizona, including my tandems.  That first one was an 
incredibly spontaneous event.  Although I had always wanted to jump, I 
had feared that I would never get the oppurtunity because my mother used 
to jump in the early seventies with her, then, fiance.  Unfortunately 
her fiance, Rick, was killed in a skydiving accident two weeks before 
their wedding in 1974.  She had always sworn to me that I'd never get 
the chance.  Well, to make a longs tory even longer, I wanted to see 
where Rick had died on my first trip to Arizona in 1995 (he had died at 
a one-time dropzone near Eloy).  While at the site of his death, we 
found out that there was a dropzone in Eloy and I begged my mother to 
take me there so that I could see the sport in action.  As we pulled 
into the dropzone, I had my head out the window and saw about 22 people 
just falling out of the sky under canopy.  From that sight on I knew I 
had to jump!  My mom had been telling me all the way that I wasn't going 
to do it, but after seeing my excitement and talking to a tandem master 
about how safe it was compared to jumps in the 1970's, she let me go for 
it.  I had the greatest jumpmaster ever, and soon after arriving there I 
was suited up and on the plane, embarking on the most amazing event of 
my life.  As we exited the plane from about 14,000 feet above the earth, 
I felt so incredible.  Adrenaline was pumping through me like never 
before.  It was also the sunset load for that day and the view of the 
sun setting behind the mountains in the distance of the Arizona desert
is one that I will never forget.  As we fell back to Earth I knew that 
I was never going to be the same. Even though I have made several more 
jumps since then, that first tandem is the only one that I remember with 
such vivid detail.  Although this entry is long, it still doesn't fully 
explain all that I have to say about my first tandem.<P>
