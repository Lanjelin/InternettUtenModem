<DT>Hotel check<dd>The JM tells you to climb out.  You get in position next to the door (or stand on a little platform outside the plane if you're using the Cessna).  Then you say: CHECK IN [checking with the JM inside the plane], CHECK OUT [checking with the JM outside the plane], PROP [looking forward], OUT [rock toward the door], IN [rock toward the inside of the plane], ARCH [jump out and arch your body].
<DT>COA<dd>Circle of awareness.  Check the horizon.  Check your altimeter.  Check in with your secondary (left) JM.  Check in with your primary (right) JM.
<DT>PRCT<dd>Practice rip cord touch.  Let's the JM know that you know where your rip cord is.
<DT>AA<dd>Altitude awareness.
<DT>5-5<dd>Hand signal that indicates you are aware that you are at 5,500'.
<DT>CC<dd>Canopy (parachute) control.  How well you 'fly' your parachute.

<H3><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A>:</H3>

Let me explain how this section is arranged.  After your JM debriefs you (after 
each jump) he will write a summary of the jump in your jump log.  Below, I have 
written two paragraphs for each of my jumps.  The first paragraph (the one in 
CAPS) is what the instructor wrote down in my log.  Anything in that paragraph 
in square brackets '[ ]' was added my me.  The second paragraph (the <STRONG>bold</STRONG> one) 
is my description of the jump.  I indicated what my thoughts were during the 
jump by typing them within quotes.<P>

HOTEL CHECK AND EXIT GOOD.  1ST COA RESPONDED TO PELVIS DOWN [HAND SIGNAL].  
PRCT'S GOOD.  2ND COA GOOD.  AA GOOD.  GOOD 5-5 AND PULL.  GREAT JOB!  YAHOO - 
CLEARED TO II.<P>
<STRONG>My first jump was simply amazing.  As I approached the door to the plane, I 
was scared.  I have always been afraid of heights.  The view from the door is 
the most frightening thing I have ever seen.  However, I had decided that I was 
going to do this.  So, as I got in position, I forced my mind to ignore the 
fear.  In the video, you can't even see me hesitate.  I got into position, ran 
through the hotel check, and jumped.  What I was thinking at the time is in 
quotes:  "Gee, this is loud."  A second passed.  "My God, I'm not in the plane 
anymore."  You have to understand, almost everyone who dives, experiences 
'sensory overload' for the first few seconds of the first jump.  I was no 
exception.  However, once I realized I was falling, I was fine.  Also, there 
was no sensation of falling.  In fact, it felt like floating on a strong wind.  
Another second passed.  "Ok...  Horizon," I looked at the horizon.  
"Altimeter," I looked at my altimeter.  "Secondary," I looked at the guy 
hanging onto my left side and he yelled "good".  "Primary," I looked at the guy 
on my right, and he gave my the 'arch more' sign.  "I'm arching as much as I 
can!"  I pushed my arms a little higher.  My primary JM gave me the thumbs up 
sign.  "Ok, time for the practice rip cord touches."  "Look," I looked toward 
the rip cord.  I could not see my rip cord, but I knew where it was.  "Touch," 
I touched my rip cord.  "Recover," I restored my arch position.  I did that two 
more times.  Then, "horizon," I looked at the horizon.  "Altimeter," I looked 
at the altimeter.  "Secondary," I looked at my secondary JM and he yelled 
"good".  "Primary," I looked at my primary JM and he gave me the thumbs up 
sign.  "Good, that's over with."  I looked at my altimeter.  "Wow, I'm still 
above 12,000 feet!  Hey, there's the cameraman."  Seeing the cameraman really 
relaxed me.  I'm not sure why.  "Why are my hands clenched?"  I let my hands go 
loose.  I waved at the cameraman.  "This is great!  It feels like I'm 
floating!  This is awesome!"  For the next 40 seconds or so, I just enjoyed the 
fall, and looked at my altimeter every few seconds.  It was incredible.  I 
can't even begin to tell you what it was like.  Then, at 5,500 feet, I gave the 
JMs the 5-5 sign.  Then at 4,500 feet, "look", I looked toward the rip cord.  
"Reach," I grabbed the rip cord.  "Pull," I pulled the rip cord.  "Check," I 
twisted my body just a little as I checked the rip cord.  (That gets rid of the 
vacuum above your back.)  "One, one thousand, two, one thousand, three, one 
thousand.  Parachute looks good. ... That was really easy!"  I released the 
steering toggles and went through the control check.  A right turn, a left 
turn, full brakes, everything was working fine.  I could hear the radio.  The 
guy on the radio said, "all right, good job.  Can you see the airport?  It's 
almost right below you."  I looked down, and saw the runway and field.  I 
floated around for quite a while, just enjoying the scenery.  It was 
beautiful.  Then, came the landing.  As I approached, the instructor on the 
radio told me when to turn and when to stop turning.  Then, about three seconds 
before I hit the ground, he said "flare, flare, flare."  I flared.  That means 
I pulled on the brakes.  I landed very softly.  I was not prepared for the 
forward momentum, so I ended up on my knees.  However, it really was a gentle 
landing.  Before I went to Pepperell, I had been under the impression that the 
landing would be harder.</STRONG><P><P>

GOOD EXIT AND COA, GOOD PRCT'S AND COA.  LEFT TURN ARMS TOO FAR FORWARD.  RIGHT 
TURN GOOD.  GOOD FORWARD.  LEGS UP TOO FAR AFTER FORWARD.  GREAT RESPONSE TO 
LEGS OUT SIGN.  GOOD 5-5 AND PULL.  GOOD CC AND LANDING.  ON TO III.<P>
<STRONG>I was a little nervous on the plane ride up, but once I stepped up to the 
door, I was fine.  I ran through the hotel check and jumped without any problem 
at all.  The first COA went fine.  I couldn't see the rip cord during the 
PRCTs, but I hit it every time.  Then the second COA went fine.  So, I looked 
to my left and dropped my left shoulder and turned left.  I stopped the turn.  
Then I looked at my altimeter.  We were still plenty high enough, so I looked 
to the right.  I dropped my right shoulder and turned right.  I looked at my 
altimeter.  We were still high enough, so I extended my legs and traveled 
forward for a little while.  When I stopped the forward movement, one of my JMs 
gave me the legs out sign.  I readjusted my legs.  Then, it was time to give 
the 5-5 sign and then pull.  Everything went fine.  I was really excited and 
really wanted to jump again.</STRONG><P><P>

GOOD EXIT.  GOOD COA.  GOOD PRCT'S.  GOOD COA.  OK HOVER, BUT NO ALTITUDE 
AWARENESS.  REMINDED BY JM.  PULL AT 4,000' WITH TWO HANDS.  GOOD CC AND 
LANDING.  TRY AGAIN WITH ALTITUDE AWARENESS AND PULL CORRECTED.<P>
<STRONG>The hotel check, exit, COAs, and PRCTs went fine.  After my second COA, the 
JMs let go.  As soon as they did, I went into a left spin.  I corrected it, but 
it took a great deal of effort.  I was concentrating so hard on trying to 
figure out what was wrong with my body position that I forgot to watch the 
altimeter.  Then, one of my JMs put his hand in front of my face and pointed at 
my altimeter.  I was at 4,000 feet!  I was supposed to pull at 4,500!  As soon 
as I realized that I was capable of forgetting something so important, I 
panicked.  I reach for the rip cord with both my hands.  That caused my body to 
angle sharply downwards.  So, the parachute kind of snapped me up when it 
opened.  It didn't really hurt, it was just unpleasant.  The rest of the jump 
went fine.  My landing was the softest I have had to date.</STRONG><P>
<H5><A NAME="Jump4">Jump 4 - 13,500'</A></H5>
CLIMB OUT AND EXIT WERE OK.  COA ALL OK.  PRCT'S GOOD.  COA RELAX.  RELEASE AT 
10,500'.  BAD TENDENCY TO TURN LEFT, BUT OTHERWISE OK.  NEEDS TO BRING ARMS IN, 
AND LEGS OUT.  5-5 OK.  PULLED AT 4,500'.  CLEARED, LEVEL IV.<P>
<STRONG>This jump was much better than my third jump.  I went into a left turn every 
time I looked down at my altimeter.  However, besides that, I was able to hold 
a good heading and I had great altitude awareness (I won't ever forget that 
again).  The landing was ok.</STRONG><P><P>
<H4><A NAME="Level4">Level IV - One jumpmaster</A></H4>
<H5><A NAME="Jump5">Jump 5 - 13,500'</A></H5>
CLIMB OUT AND EXIT GOOD.  COA THUMBS UP.  1 PRCT GOOD.  RELEASED.  LEFT HAND 
TURN OK, NEEDS TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE.  WENT INTO SLOW RIGHT HAND TURN WHILE 
LOOKING AT ALTIMETER.  TRIED RIGHT HAND TURN AND HAD PROBLEMS STOPPING.  
RELAXING WILL TAKE CARE OF BUILT IN TURN.  WORK ON RELAXING AND TURNS.  JM 
REDOCKED, IT WAS TOO LOW FOR FURTHER MANEUVERS.  GOOD AA.  GOOD 5-5 AND PULL.  
REPEAT LEVEL IV.  RELAX AND YOU WILL DO FINE!  YAHOO!!!<P>
<STRONG>Every time I looked at my altimeter, I turned right.  Besides that, the jump 
was ok.  I tried to get too fancy on the landing.  I ended up flaring way too 
late.  I fell down on my face and skidded across the grass a couple of feet.  I 
was ok, but I'll remember not to do that again.</STRONG><P>
<H5><A NAME="Jump6">Jump 6 - 12,500'</A></H5>
GOOD EXIT AND COA.  GOOD PRCT.  GOOD RESPONSE TO LEGS OUT SIGN.  RELEASE, THEN 
LEGS ARE BACK UP AND OFFSET.  DRIFTS RIGHT.  NO TURNS.  GOOD ALTITUDE 
AWARENESS, 5-5, AND PULL.  LETS TRY AGAIN.<P>
<STRONG>This time, I had so much torque on my body, I didn't even try to meet the 
objectives of the lesson.  I just concentrated on keeping my body stable.  I 
corrected for the torque, and fell straight.  Afterwards, my JM told me that my 
problem was that my legs weren't in the right position.  She gave me an 
exercise to do on the ground that was supposed to teach my legs the correct 
position.  It really helped.</STRONG><P>
<H5><A NAME="Jump7">Jump 7 - 13,500'</A></H5>
GOOD EXIT.  ONE LEGS OUT [SIGN], COA, RELEASE, 90 DEGREES RT [RIGHT] TURN, 
BEGAN TO BUFFET; 90 DEGREES LEFT AND SOME SEPARATION [BETWEEN ME AND THE JM], 
STILL ROCKING, 45 DEGREES RT [RIGHT TURN], FWD [FORWARD MOTION] NOT DOCKED HEAD 
ON, BUT OK, THEN RELAXED.  BUFFET STOPPED, VERY STABLE, GOOD HEADING.  [I HAD 
FINALLY FIGURED OUT THE BALANCE POINT, IT FELT GREAT!]  GOOD AA, 5-5.  PULLED 
4,500'.  OK LEVEL V.  RELAX MORE FROM THE START!<P>
<STRONG>[I fell straight!  I only turned when I wanted to!  I was rocking back and 
forth a little, but besides that I was doing great.  Then, near the end of the 
freefall, I figured out the balance point.  From then on, I was rock solid.  No 
rocking at all.]</STRONG><P><P>

WHAT ELSE [NEEDS TO BE SAID] NICE SKYDIVE, FUN [MY JM REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING 
MY DIVE] ------- 360, 360, FORWARD, GO TO 6 NICE WAVE 4,500' [AT THIS LEVEL YOU 
"WAVE OFF" AT 4,500', INSTEAD OF THE OLD 5-5 SIGN AT 5,500'] PULL 4,000' [AT 
THIS LEVEL YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO PULL AT 4,500']<P>
<STRONG>This was an incredible dive!  Everything I did was crisp and smooth.  The 
jumpmaster let go of me right after we left the plane and moved around in front 
of me.  Then I did a 360 in each direction.  After doing the turns, I realized 
that I hadn't thought about what I needed to do to turn and to stop the turn.  
My body just knew what to do.  Then, I moved forward toward my instructor (that 
was planned, he had purposely moved away from me).  I was really moving fast as 
I approached him, but when it came time to stop, I stopped.  I had just decided 
to stop when I noticed that my body had automatically responded to my decision 
and had gone into a perfect arch position to stop the forward movement.  It was 
incredible.  I no longer had to think at all about what to do, I just had to 
think that I wanted to do something and it happened.  After the forward 
movement, I was on "free-time".  I could do whatever I wanted to do.  So, I did 
some turns and spins.  For example, I'd start a fast left turn, then after 
turning 90 degrees, I'd crank my body even harder and go into a really fast 
spin.  Then, when I had spun 360 degrees (so I was facing the JM again), I'd 
stop the spin.  The crispness of my movements and the stability of my body was 
simply incredible.  The seven jumps I did before this one now seemed boring and 
uneventful in comparison.  WHAT A DIVE!!!</STRONG><P><P>
<H4><A NAME="Level6">Level VI</A></H4>
<H5><A NAME="Jump9">Jump 9 - 11,500</A></H5>
SOLO EXIT, NICE.  SLOW TURN (RT [RIGHT]).  BACKLOOP (SLT [SLIGHTLY] ON SIDE).  
TRACKING FLIPPED OVER (BEND AT WAIST), RECOVERED, STABLE, NICE WAVE AND LOOK, 
PULL 3500'.  (DON'T BE SO DRASTIC ON TRACK, MORE DELTA WITH ARMS).  GO ON TO 
LEVEL VII.<P>
<STRONG>I enjoyed this dive.  It was the first time I jumped without anyone holding 
on.  We took the Cessna up to 11,500', but could not go any higher because of 
heavy cloud cover.  When it was time, I climbed out onto the step, hanging onto 
the strut.  I then had to wait there until we could see a hole in the lower 
cloud bank.  That was interesting.  However, I am pleased to note that I have 
gotten over my fear of heights (at least when I'm wearing a parachute).  I 
wasn't scared at all, even though I was standing on a 14"x4" (approximately, I 
didn't measure it) step in a 70-80 MPH wind, over 2 miles above the ground.  
Then once the JM thought he saw an opening we could jump through, I jumped.  He 
left the plane right after me.  It took me a few seconds to get my body 
positioned so I wasn't turning.  But, once I did, I was falling straight and 
steady.  Then, I watched the JM do a back roll.  That looked really cool.  I 
tried a backroll.  I got it right, I was just a little tilted to the side.  
Then I stabled out nicely.  I discovered that we weren't going to hit the hole 
in the clouds.  We were actually going to fall through a cloud!  Up to this 
point, I had never had anything to compare my speed to.  So, I had never really 
experienced the speed.  However, I got to watch the cloud approach very 
quickly, then, suddenly all I could see was white, then a few seconds later, 
everything was clear.  It was really cool.  Then, I found the airport and 
turned toward it.  Once I was facing the airport, I tried to do a head-down 
track.  That's when you straighten your legs, and bring your hands back toward 
your waist.  That position causes your body to tip down sharply.  In that 
position, you fall much faster, but you also 'track' quickly across the sky.  
When I tried it, I did it too quickly, and tried to do too much.  So, when my 
body tipped down, it was really, really fast, and the pressure caused my waist 
to bend a little.  Once my waist bent, I rolled over on my back.  That all 
happened in less than a second.  Now, I was falling, facing the sky.  But, I 
remembered the training, and flipped myself over without any problem at all.  I 
actually rather enjoyed it.  It's nice to know that even when I am completely 
upside down, I can still return to the proper face-down arch position.  
Unfortunately, I was already at about 6,300', so I didn't have time for any 
more maneuvers (during the course, you can't do maneuvers below 6,000').  So, I 
just enjoyed falling for a little while.  Then, I waved off at around 5,000'.  
I had told my JM that I wanted to wave-off early because I wanted to spend a 
few seconds trying to adjust my body into a position that would allow me to see 
my rip cord.  I managed to de-arch just enough to see the rip cord.  I lowered 
my left shoulder just a little too far, causing my body go into a slow left 
turn.  However, it was a very slow turn, and I was still in control.  So, I 
ignored it.  I pulled the rip cord.  The slow turn caused a half twist in the 
lines, but it spun itself out before I had time to deal with it.  The canopy 
ride was nice.  Then, I managed to land really close to the target.  I think I 
was within 15' of it.  All in all, it was a great jump.  I really, really 
enjoyed it.  People talk about going to New England to see the fall foliage.  I 
say, you should see it from 13,500 feet!  On a clear day, you can see all the 
way from Pepperell (on the N.H. border) to Cape Cod.  The fall colors are 
extremely impressive and beautiful in that view!</STRONG><P><P>

GOOD ATTEMPT AT DIVING EXIT - BUT ARCH HARDER + PUT HEELS ON YOUR BUTT, GOOD 
BACKLOOP - GOOD TURNS - GOOD TRACK - REMEMBER TO LOOK UP AT THE HORIZON WHEN 
YOU GO INTO TRACK + PRACTICE ROLLING SHOULDERS FWD, GOOD WAVE OFF + PULL, GOOD 
CC, BUT YOU FLARED TOO HIGH, OFF INSTRUCTION + RADIO.<P>
<STRONG>This was a great jump.  We took the Cessna up to 12,500.  Then, I climbed out 
facing the tail of the plane.  Once I checked to make sure my JM was ready, I 
said, "Ready...Set...Go!" and jumped.  When I jumped, I aimed toward the tail, 
but at a 45 degree down-angle.  I ended up doing a full flip.  Then, I 
stabilized, and did a backroll.  After I stabilized again, I did a 360 to the 
right, and a 360 to the left.  I was getting close to 8,000', so didn't try 
another backloop.  I then tried tracking.  This time, it went well.  I had a 
little head to toe buffeting, but nothing serious.  Then, I stopped and went 
into "neutral".  I wanted to feel the deep angle track one more time, so I 
allowed myself to tip forward, then returned back to neutral.  I waved off at 
4,000' and pulled at 3,500'.  I passed the level, so I'm no longer an AFF 
student.</STRONG><P><P><P>
