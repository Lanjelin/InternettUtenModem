This is ripped from the Spanish newspaper Marca of Dec 7th
and shows how good the Spanish journalists read a press-
release. :-) It's the IFK squad for the match against
Barcelona (for those of you who wonder...)

Well, 11 out of 16 isn't that bad as the names are a little
bit exotic to most Spanish. These reporters also called the IFK 
coach Roger Gustafsson by the name of Magnus Gustafsson at least 
20 times in the paper.

Another gem from the most idiotic columnist in Sweden, Mats
Olsson of Expressen:
He thinks that IFK should buy the talented striker Jörgen
Pettersson from Malmö FF, lend him to Malmö for the 1995
season and then sell him to Ajax (from whom he turned down
an offer last weekend!) and make a nice profit, because that's
how the bank-managers did business in the 1980's.
Well, we all know how those deals ended don't we...
(Expressen Dec 13th 1994)

Another favourite of mine is Lasse Sandlin of Aftonbladet.
On Nov 3rd (the day after the victory in Istanbul) he wrote:
- 'Sorry IFK, It's not enough'
(We all know what happened, don't we?)
On Dec 30th, the same columnist wrote:
- 'IFK wont make it to the quarter-finals of Champions League'
For your information Lasse,
<h2>WE ARE ALREADY THERE!!!</h2>

The Swedish FA has done it again. On May 24th, the final of
Champions League is to be played. The FA then decides that
the Swedish cup-final is to be played on May 25th. What if
IFK makes it to both finals??? Should we leave a w.o. in one
of the finals or what is the idea??? Nice job Lagrell!   :-)

In the Port Vale fanzine there is a letter that I thought should be 
shared with you`all.

In Europe English teams are only allowed three foreigners, including Irish, 
Scottish & Welsh. This is a point worthy of discussion, but for now lets 
assume this is fair.
	However all the european teams play 11 foreigners, this is surely 
not very fair!!!

(Trying to explain why most English teams went out of the cups early!)
