<H4>The norwegian coastline, from the swedish border in southeast to Kirkenes
by the Russian border far to the northeast, provides scuba divers with
more than 2500 kilometers of possible dive-sites. The underwater-world
varies tremendously along the coast, as do the weather. Because of the
weather conditions, as well as (locally extreme) season variations, the
submarine life show great <A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS14.HTM#1495" tppabs="http://www.asterisk.no/~emil/">variability
of species</A> well suited for such environments. The water temperature
in the fjords may get below freezing during the winter, while the west
coast show less variance caused by the (warm) Golf Stream which pass here
on its way to the arctic. This part of the coastline therefore rarely freeze.
</H4>

<H4>The norwegian seawater exhibits fairly high amounts of dissolved salts,
thus favoring the growth of large kelpwoods, which may be several meters
high in certain areas at the west coast. The best &quot;forests&quot; can
be observed between Bergen and Lofoten. Beneath the sea surface visibilities
usually vary between 10 and 50 meters and the conditions for submarine
photographing are mostly excellent. The inner part of some fjords (e.g.
the Oslofjord and other areas affected by heavy industry) are rather polluted
however, and you may get disappointed if you enter the sea in such areas
with high expectations. </H4>

<P><IMG SRC="GRAFIKK/STEINBIT.JPG" tppabs="http://web.sol.no/sportweb/scuba/grafikk/steinbit.jpg" HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=300 ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<H4>In open waters, Cod, Coalfish, Flounder, Cat-fish, are examples of
common citizens to observe. The cartoon shows a &quot;Steinbit&quot;, an
ugly-looking fish which however is extremely well tasting. This page on
&quot;<A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS14.HTM#1496" tppabs="http://www.tjener.uninett.no/~karlsoy/fisk/fisk.htm">Fisk</A>&quot;
(fish) is a good starting page if you want more information about the different
fishes you might observe in Norway (written in norwegian). </H4>

<H4>Also, Crabs and Lobsters are common south of Trondheim (mid-Norway).
Towards the northernmost parts of Norway (Lofoten, Troms and Finnmark),
Lobsters are rare, but instead their monster-like, enormous relative called
&quot;Russerkrabbe&quot; has during the last decades been added to our
fauna from the east. If you'll like to have a look at them, try <A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS14.HTM#1409" tppabs="http://www.tbt.no/cv/krabbe.htm">this</A>

<H4><IMG SRC="GRAFIKK/WHALE3.JPG" tppabs="http://web.sol.no/sportweb/scuba/grafikk/whale3.jpg" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=200 ALIGN=LEFT>If you
spot the correct place, an unforgetable dive among seals may be experienced.
Although not very common, lucky divers may also be accompanied by whales
during their expeditions.<BR>
</H4>

<H4>Wreck diving is also very popular in Norway, because of the large amount
of shipwrecks along the partly rough coast. <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="RULES.HTM" tppabs="http://web.sol.no/sportweb/scuba/rules.htm">Follow
the rules, however!</A></FONT> You will not be very popular if you take
away lots of stuff from wrecks. Use your eyes or camera instead. Local
dive-centers or shops are usually capable of guiding foreign divers to
nice wreck localities, or to provide guests with maps of registered wrecks.
A large amount of wrecks, however, have never been discovered so far...

<H4>Drift diving is another popular happening among scuba divers who visit
areas which experience large sea level fluctuations due to the tide water
or even rivers. One of the most famous places is &quot;<A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS14.HTM#1498" tppabs="http://home.everyday.no/rune.dahl/saltstraumen.html">Saltstraumen</A>&quot;
close to Bod&oslash; (the malstroem referred to by Jules Verne). Note that
due to the nature of strong underwater currents, this activity should always
be performed in company with experienced divers who have detailed informations
about local conditions.</H4>

<H4><BR>
Because of the relatively cold water which we experience in Norway, you
must use a dry (preferentially) or a semi-dry suit during the winter season
wherever you go. If you wear a dry suit with warm clothes under, even -2
<SUP>o</SUP>C is pretty comfortable! Be sure that your inflator can work
under such (freezing) conditions. In general, dry or semi-dry suits are
recommended if temperatures are below 10 - 15 <SUP>o</SUP>C, which in practice
comprises the whole year north of Bergen. During the summer in southern
Norway however, water temperature rises to ca. 18-22 <SUP>o</SUP>C and
wet suits (5-7mm) are sufficient. Dry suits may actually feel unconfortable
in these areas during the summer (June - August). You may also dive in
a thinner suit in the summer, but I bet you won't get a pleasant dive.</H4>
