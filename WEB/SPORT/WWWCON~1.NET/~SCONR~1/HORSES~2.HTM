<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Archaeological
evidence in the Iberian Peninsula, modern day Spain and Portugal, indicates
that the origin of the Lusitano horse dates back to at least 25,000 BC
in the form of its primitive ancestor, the Sorraia breed. Cave paintings
in the Iberian Peninsula dated from the 30,000 B.C. depict portraits of
horses and activities related to a horse culture. Furthermore, there have
been findings of small tools made of bone which were used to make rope
from the hair of horses. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Sorraia is
believed to have developed from crosses between the Tarpan and the Przewalski
horses. Looking further into the evolution of the horse, we find that the
most ancient ancestor of the horse was a small, herbivorous mammal of the
genus Hyracotherium (or Eohippus) from the Eocene Epoch, having four-toed
front feet and three-toed hind feet. This ancient horse existed fifty million
years ago in an area that is now the western United States. Eohippus eventually
became modified into what we know as the horse. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>These horses then
migrated from America through the land bridge connecting Alaska and Siberia
and entered Asia where they established themselves and latter disseminated
to Europe and Africa. However, when the Spaniards arrived to the Americas,
the horse had been extinct in the continent for about 8000 years. The Sorraia
remained isolated for several millennia in the southern part of Iberia
in the Alentejo and Andalusian regions of modern Portugal and Spain. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Noted Portuguese
historian, Mr. Ruy d'Andrade suggested that by the Neolithic period (4000
BC) the native tribes of the area may have used horses in war. Around 3000
BC, Iberians tribes from North Africa invaded the peninsula, which would
be latter named after them. They were soon to be followed by the Phoenicians
and Celts, who were largely responsible for a two way exchange of horses
which brought into the Iberian peninsula, an influx of oriental breeds
from Libya, Egypt and Syria. By the time of the first expeditions of the
Greeks, in 800 BC, the Celts and Iberians formed an alliance known as the
Celtiberians. According to Lady Sylvia Loch &quot; It was the horses of
the Celtiberians that were to become famous throughout the civilized world.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>From this period
onward, we find many references to the Iberian or Celtiberians horses and
riders of the peninsula by Greek and Roman chroniclers. Homer refers to
them in the Iliad around 1,100 BC and the celebrated Greek cavalry officer
Xenophon had nothing but praise for the gifted Iberian horses and horsemen..&quot;.
Xenophon in one of his books written about 370 BC admiringly describes
the equestrian war techniques of Iberian mercenaries who were influential
in the victory of Sparta against Athens in the Peloponnesian wars. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>This type of warfare
consisted of individual horse charges with fast starts, stops and pirouettes
followed by retreats and renewed attacks. A form of riding that was been
made possible by the use of incredible agile horses, curb bits and stirrups.
Further invasions by the Carthaginians and Romans, recognized the superiority
of the Iberian horses and horsemanship to the point that the Romans adopted
the Iberian equestrian style of warfare and set up stud farms in the conquered
Iberian territories. Horses from these stud farms were then used by the
Roman cavalry to accomplish the expansion of their Empire. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Mr. Arsinio Raposo
Cordeiro writes that: &quot;the perfect bond between Iberian man and horse
may have provided the original inspiration behind the legend of the Centaurs,
a hybrid man-horse creature deemed to spring from the valleys of the Tagus
River. At the time, it was also believed that the mares of this region
were sired by the wind, which accounted for the amazing speed with which
they endowed their progeny&quot;. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In 711 AD, the
Muslims initiated the invasion of the Iberian peninsula, at the time being
ruled by the Visigoths, and in varied degrees the Muslims occupied the
peninsula until the end of the fifteenth century. A lot has been written
about the influence of the Arabian horse on the Iberian stock during the
years of occupation. The fact is that although politically this was an
Arabian invasion, ethnically the invaders were Moors. The leader of this
initial invasion was a Moslem Berber named Tariq ibn Ziyad who led 12,000
Saracens (largely Berbers from Algiers and Morocco) across the Strait of
Gibraltar into Spain. These people brought some of their native Berber
horses with them on the expedition. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Although it is
not exactly clear of how many of the invaders had brought horses with them,
one can speculate that because of the difficulties in transportation the
number of horses was limited and that most of the Cavalry men procured
their horses from the outstanding existing Iberian stock of the south of
the Iberian peninsula. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Lady Sylvia Loch
states. &quot; it is now almost conclusively established that the Barb
(or Berber) horse also developed as a breed from primitive Sorraia stock
which gradually migrated from Spain and Portugal into North Africa in prehistoric
times. Contrary to popular opinion, therefore, the Iberian horse was the
likely forefather to the Barb and not vice versa. It would be more accurate
to say that at the time of the Moorish conquest, Barb blood was reintroduced
to the Iberian Peninsula.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Regardless of the
exact influence of one breed over another, it is evident that the exchange
of blood was mutually beneficial and that it produced many similarities
between the two breeds, to the point that the modern Barb resembles the
Iberian stock and the criollo horses of South America. During the almost
eight hundred years in which Spain and Portugal were in constant war with
the Moors, horse and horsemanship had become finely attuned to the war
exercises. This superb war horse was the one that the conquistadors introduced
and dispersed throughout the together with the a la gineta style of riding,
which influenced the horse cultures of the Gauchos, Charros and Llaneros.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>By the XVII century
the Iberian war horse, or Jennet as it was beginning to be called, had
become important not only in the battlefield but also in the great riding
academies founded in France, Germany, Italy and Austria. In Portugal, almost
100 years before the famous Italian author Francesco Grisone, the King
Dom Duarte wrote a classic book, &quot;Livro da Ensynanca de ben Cavalgar
a Toda Sela&quot; in 1435. The Portuguese traditional interest in horsemanship
seems to have always preceded their Spanish neighbors in its progressive
sophistication, creating an equestrian tradition that has lasted intact
to this day. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>When not at war,
Bullfighting on horseback and High School public displays were the main
entertainment for the dedicated Portuguese landed gentry. Today, the annual
Fair of Golegc still combines, in the most spectacular way, the aspects
of traditional Gineta riding and classical European High School riding
in the display of the most exemplary Baroque horse, the Lusitano. In modern
Portugal, the performance of the horse in the bullring is perhaps one of
the most important factor in the breeding selection process of the Lusitanos
and this factor has sustained the preservation of the characteristics of
the classical Iberian war horse, so esteemed in the world across the ages.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In a description
by .Sylvia Loch, she states: &quot; To look at, they are noble rather than
pretty with aristocracy written all over their fine, slightly hawked, long
faces. They develop a powerful neck and shoulder which makes them look
extremely majestic in front. The quarters are not large, but the loins
are wide and strong and the hocks long and wiry giving them the power to
bounce forcefully forwards with masterful impulsion. Deep flexion is obtained
from the developed second thigh and the longer than usual cannons and pasterns.
The same characteristics that are essential for the bullfights, also make
the Lusitano extremely efficient for other sport activities, or as a working
or pleasure riding horse. </FONT></FONT></P>
