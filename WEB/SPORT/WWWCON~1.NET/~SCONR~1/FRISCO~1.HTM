<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sol Y Sombra, sun
and shadows - s&iacute;, that would be their name - but wait, we're ahead
of our story. In 1962 Nancy Slayton (Q.E.P.D.) saw an ad in an old TOROS
magazine regarding the desire to start a bullfight club in the San Francisco
area. She contacted the lady, Catherine Sutherland, who had run the ad
and helped her organize the pe&ntilde;a.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Thirty interested
people became the founding members and three of those 30 are still active
in Sol y Sombra today - plus an ever-changing roster of enthusiastic aficionados.
The first meetings were held in Mexican restaurants in the bay area, then
an almost-permanent room was secured in the Marines Memorial Club -- moving
from that to members' homes and then back full circle to restaurants again
today.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Many of the meetings
were educational with guest speakers on various aspects of the corrida;
history, music, capework, current matadors' standings, etc. And members
were encouraged to participate in meetings with other clubs, especially
the NATC, the National Association of Taurine Clubs, which held an annual
Congreso in Mexico in the early years and later in Spain and France. Sol
y Sombra was represented at two of the International Congresos de Taurom&aacute;quia,
in Sevilla, 1966, and Lisb&oacute;a, 1972.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The San Francisco
Club hosted several of the NATC affairs, the most recent being the one
held in Zacatecas, Mexico, in 1987.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>There was other
local acticity when on Sundays one could often find members practicing
capework in Golden State Park under the direction of the pe&ntilde;a's
resident matador (retired) Guillermo Navarro. Today we carpool down to
Escalon in the San Joaquin valley, to Campo Bravo, a 1500-seat arena on
the ranch of Frank Borba, whose son, Dennis, is a full-blown matador de
toros. Here Sol y Sombra aficionados can see the branding of calves, a
tienta or best of all, a real live Portuguese corrida - right in their
own back yard.</FONT></FONT></P>
