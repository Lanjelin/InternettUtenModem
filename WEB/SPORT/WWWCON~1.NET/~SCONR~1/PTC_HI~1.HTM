<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Pe&ntilde;a Taurina
de Colorado had its beginnings in March, 1960. Founded by Ann Ohrel, now
of Arizona. Meetings were held for several years in an old Denver mansion
that was converted into meeting rooms for various ethnic clubs and groups.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The first club
trip to the El Paso/Juarez border was a bust, a dust bust; the corrida
was canceled due to one of the area's worst dust storms.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the late 60's,
our club co-hosted with El Paso a NATC convention held in Juarez. Our club
also participated in the AMAT (Asso. Mexicana de Aficionados Taurinos)
in Juarez, 1971, by several members attending, buying a bull and donating
a trophy for best banderillas.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The club was famous
for years for its &quot;cascarones&quot;, confetti-filled decorated egg
shells. I've been told by many aficionados that they still have some of
those eggs saved from past conventions.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>We are 12 hours
by car from the border and try to get down there for most major holidays.
One year Cordob&eacute;z was on the cartel for a Saturday night corrida.
We left Denver Friday after work, drove all night, arrived Saturday morning.
Shopping, dinner, corrida, party, party, return to hotel just in time to
pack and head back to Denver, no sleep (except the driver - he had the
good sense to retire early).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Members of our
club have held office in NATC from President, Vice-President, Regional
Vice-President and Secretary. NATC once had an award for the club with
the most members attending a convention. Pe&ntilde;a Taurina de Colorado
won the award the first year, a large color photo of a matador and bull
by Vincent Kehoe and won again a few years later. This award is no longer
given.</FONT></FONT></P>
