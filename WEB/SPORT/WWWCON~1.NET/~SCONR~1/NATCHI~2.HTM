<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The birth of NATC
was detailed in a 1987 article written by Don Edmundo deAnda, first elected
President of the NATC: &quot;During my tenure as President of Barrera Taurina
(May, 1962 - May, 1963), the El Paso club reached a very important decision.
It was decided that our organization would initiate direct communication
with other taurine clubs in our country with the idea of organizing a national
association. About the same time, we received a letter from taurine writer
and President of Club Taurino of New York, Vincent J-R Kehoe, suggesting
formation of a national organization. We sent back a telegram offering
to host the organizational convention in El Paso, Texas, inviting Mr. Kehoe
to preside over that meeting; he accepted. We contacted all known clubs,
and the response was a positive one. A date was set for an initial meeting
to which presidents or representatives of different clubs would attend
and lay plans for a first official convention at which the first president
of our new national organization would be elected.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;And so it
came to pass...at the first official convention in 1963 the name was selected
- National Association of Taurine Clubs, USA. The meeting was celebrated
by having a taurine festival in which four beautiful, brave becerros of
pure San Mateo blood were fought and killed by Barrera Taurina Aficionados
practicos and invited practicos from two clubs of Cd. Juarez. And, it just
so happened that the writer of this article was elected the first official
President of NATC, USA.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Those of us who
were present at that 1962 Barrera Taurina meeting when Mr. Kehoe's letter
was read and the decision made that our club would offer to host the organizational
convention, remember a roomful of very excited taurinos. It was electrifying
to envision a national organization, particularly an active one in which
the taurinos actually would come together for activities, rather than just
be conducted through correspondence, as seemed to be the suggestion of
Mr. Kehoe. Really firing us up that night were Jim Kirby with his organizational
ideas and Don Edmundo deAnda with his concept of making taurine festivals
an important part of the conventions that would be held.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Barrera Taurina
was pleased that Mr. Kehoe favored our idea of an organizational convention
and that he was willing to come to El Paso to chair it. He was the only
representative of any club east of the Mississippi to attend, however,
so it was not too surprising that he did not have the support needed to
be elected our first president. Still, he is given credit for being the
founder of NATC, since he was the first person to contact other clubs about
forming a national associaiton. He even went so far as to have a tiny 8-page
booklet printed listing purposes of the national organization and a roster
of the twenty-one known U.S. taurine clubs in 1962. All of this was expanded
considerably to form the Charter of NATC, USA.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Nine clubs were
officially represented at the 1962 organizational meeting:</FONT></FONT></P>

<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Barrera Taurina,El
Paso, Texas</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Orange County Aficionados,
Garden Grove, California had several representatives present, but no official
delegate, therefore, no vote.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The organizational
meeting was held August 17-19, 1962, at the Del Camino Motor Hotel in El
Paso, Texas, with a full schedule of events beginning with a cocktail party
at 8:00 p.m. on Friday night and closing with parties on Sunday night hosted
by two Juarez clubs. A very stirring keynote address was made by Mr. David
Prieto (&quot;El Viejo&quot;) of Barrera Taurina in which he invoked the
blessings and support of the Patroness of The Fiesta, La Virgen de la Macarena,
&quot;Let not your zeal be destroyed. Let it be encouraged and go forward...and
may her guidance of this small acorn a big oak tree make.&quot; Mayor of
the City of El Paso, the Honorable Ralph Seitsinger, attended the opening
session. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A great deal was
accomplished at the organizational meeting. A charter was drawn up; membership
dues were established; and a governmental plan was developed. An Executive
Board was set up for 1962-1963:</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Edmundo de Anda
(El Paso), Chairman </FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Charles Carolus
(Dallas), 1st Vice Chairman </FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Vincent J-R Kehoe
(New York), 2nd Vice Chairman, and</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Board members
Ann Ohrel (Denver), John Vincent (San Diego), O.P. Houston (Austin); Arthur
Frank (Houston); and Raul Castillo (Corpus Christi)</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Appointments made
by Chairman deAnda were:</FONT></FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Vincent J-R Kehoe,
Chairman of Press Relations</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Charles Carolus,
Chairman of Membership, and</FONT></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>O.P. Houston,
Chairman of Taurine Relations</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was decided
that the first official convention would be held in 1963, again hosted
by Barrera Taurina, at El Paso, Texas. Chairman of the Convention would
be Edmundo deAnda and Chairman of Convention Activities would be Jim Kirby.
Each member club would be allowed one official delegate to the 1963 NATC
convention and a letter of authorization from the club's president would
accompany each delegate. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The &quot;Gran
Festival Taurino&quot; presented at the organizational convention was certainly
a highlight, as Don Edmundo deAnda mentioned. Don Edmundo was president
of Barrera Taurina at the time of the organizational convention and he,
also, was the key figure in setting up the taurine festival. The U.S. practicos
taking part were all from Barrera Taurina - Edmundo deAnda, Mike deAnda,
and Hector &quot;El Pipo&quot; Barragan. Max Sanchez of Juarez was their
trainer and was extremely helpful throughout the festival. Unfortunately,
the names of the Mexican practicos who participated have been forgotten.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Other colorful
memories of the organizational convention: Los Churumbeles de Espana, the
musical group internationally famous for their hit recording of &quot;Lisboa
Antigua&quot;, entertained at our welcoming party and surprised us by wearing
real matadors' chaquetillas to perform. Matadors for the formal corrida
on Sunday were Enrique Vera (Sp.), Juan Silveti, and Antonio del Olivar
with bulls of Corlome and they performed in the downtown Juarez bullring,
Plaza Alberto Balderas. Antonio del Olivar and Matador-to-be Jose &quot;Pepe&quot;
Lopez-Hurtado attened our welcoming party. A pool-side Mexican buffet was
served Saturday morning; the taurine festival and a charreada were held
that afternoon; and a bar-b-que dinner and baile ranchero that night closed
out the Saturday activities. Sunday began with the sorteo at Plaza A. Balderas,
followed by a wonderful pre-corrida party at Bar Sevilla in El Paso hosted
by Jose Maria Roldan, known as &quot;Pepito de Sevilla&quot;, owner of
the bar. &quot;Pepito&quot;, his lovely wife Julie, and their tiny daughter
Pastora provided entertainment, dancing in native Spanish costumes. Everyone
had so much fun it was hard to tear away in time for the corrida. Following
the formal corrida, fiestas were held at two Juarez taurine clubs, winding
up the organizational convention. Best of all, lasting taurine friendships
were made, not only across our nation, but also reaching across the border
to Mexico. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The first annual
convention of NATC was held in El Paso, Texas, August 16-18, 1963, hosted
by Barrera Taurina of which Charlcie Joan Clements (now Zavala) was president.
Edmundo deAnda was presiding chairman of the convention, and he also became
Jim Kirby's co-chairman for planning the convention.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Most important
at this meeting was the restructuring of NATC officer titles, and it was
voted to accept eight more clubs, making a total of sixteen NATC charter
member clubs. The titles of Chairman and Vice Chairman were changed to
President and Vice President. It was decided that five officers would comprise
the Board of Directors (later changed to Executive Committee). </FONT></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Finances were discussed,
and NATC dues were set at $10 per club annually. Jim Kirby advised the
delegates Barrera Taurina had lost over $200 presenting the taurine festival
for the 1963 convention and suggested NATC should organize its own festival
hereafter. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The festival taurino
presented in 1963 by Barrera Taurina was billed as an &quot;international
competition&quot; between U.S. and Mexican practicos. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The program looked
like this: </FONT></FONT></P>

Ramon Tirado, Jaime Bravo, and Emilio Rodriguez with bulls of Campo Alegre.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>All other activities
were almost exactly the same as held in 1962. San Diego was the 1964 convention
site. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the first thirty
years of its organization, NATC has held conventions in three U.S. cities

Cd. Juarez, Nogales, Tijuana, Ense&ntilde;ada, San Miguel de Allende, San
Luis Potos&iacute;, Tlaxcala, and Zacatecas. Two have been held in France
