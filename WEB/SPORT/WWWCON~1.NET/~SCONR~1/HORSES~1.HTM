Valera-Lema, Ph.D.</A></FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Riding a horse
as an aid in jumping, roping, or bullfighting is probably related to the
hunting or chasing of animals practiced by ancient Europeans and Asians
who used the horse for this purpose. Thousands of years later, the Plains
Indians of North America also made use of the horse in the buffalo hunts.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>However, the art
of bullfighting on horseback, as currently practiced in Portugal, where
it is called <B>toureio equestre</B> and in Spain and Mexico, where it
is called <B>rejoneo</B>, has a more direct and recent origin in the Iberian
Peninsula, since it developed from the war exercises of the middle ages.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>As it is well known,
the Muslims occupied parts of Portugal and Spain, the Iberian peninsula,
for over seven centuries, from 711 AD. until 1492. During this time the
Iberians were involved in a constant struggle to overthrow the invaders
from their land. Horses were the principal war implement and both horses
and riders were specifically trained for the martial arts. Out of the war
exercises evolved the intricate movements and maneuvers that gave origin
to an equestrian science which would eventually influence the creation
of several European riding academies in the Renaissance. The modern Spanish
Riding School of Vienna and the Portuguese School of Equestrian Art are
relics of those academies.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Since the origins
of the fighting bull are also in the Iberian Peninsula, the Iberians had
since Carthaginian times recreated themselves by running bulls from horses
in open fields, before lancing them. When the two activities, running of
the bulls, and equestrian war exercise were combined within the confines
of an enclosed spaces, the equestrian bullfight was born.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Bullfighting bulls
in confinement will not run away, but instead will defend themselves and
charge the riders. Therefore when facing brave bulls, the cavaliers had
to perform intricate maneuvers on their finely tuned war horses in order
to avoid being gored by the bulls. When the wars against the Moors ended,
and the conquest of America was completed, the cavalrymen were left idle
for war. The martial training became more a leisure and competitive activity,
and then in the XVII and XVIII centuries, a feast increasingly joyful and
polished.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Celebrations of
great importance such as the coronation of a king , a royal birth or wedding
were opportunities to conduct a bullfight. As the Iberian cultural influence
expanded to the Americas, so did equestrian bullfighting and it is said
that the festivities associated with the founding of Mexico City and Lima,
included bullfights in which Hernan Cortes in Mexico and Francisco Pizarro
in Peru were enthusiastic participants.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Rejoneo in Spain
had a period of splendor during the reigns of Felipe III (1598-1621) ,
who built the plaza mayor and Felipe IV(1621-1665)) who converted it in
the center of gaiety and social events of his court and thus the center
of bullfighting on horse back. In Portugal, there are a many written records
dating back to the XIII century, which mention the participation of Kings
and other noblemen in equestrian bullfights.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A Portuguese nobleman
of the XVIII century, Dom Pedro Alcantara y Meneses, fourth Marquis of
Marialva, Master of the Horse to the royal court, emerged as one of the
most influential horsemen of post renaissance Europe. His influence in
laying down the modern day rules of Portuguese equestrian bullfighting
was so great, that this type of bullfighting is also referred as the Art
of Marialva.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Rejoneo remained
identical in both Portugal and Spain as a nobleman's activity until the
end of the XVII century, when Carlos II (1665-1700) of Spain died childless.
The throne then passed to a grandson of Louis IV, Felipe V (1700-1748)
and in this manner, the Bourbon dynasty entered Spain with their French
influence and their dislike for bullfighting. In the mid 1700's, the Bourbons,
decreed the prohibition of bullfighting , and most noblemen complied with
the royal order, but the common people disdained it.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The disappearance
of bullfighting on horse back could have signified the end of bullfighting
in Spain, if the masses had not taken ownership to transform it into bullfighting
on foot, giving it new life. War which had fomented the equestrian bullfights
also gave origin to an auxiliary body of pages, horse trainers and horse
grooms who assisted the cavalier and were in the shadow of the horse. When
the horseman left the ring, the foot assistant emerged with great importance
and has remained so until now.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Spanish rejoneo
was then relegated to the cattle ranch work and did not emerge again as
a spectator's spectacle until the 1920's. In Portugal on the other hands,
and to cite the distinguished Spanish horseman and rejoneador, Don Alvaro
Domecq y Diez, &quot;Portuguese equestrian bullfighting was fine tuned
and embellished to reach its actual level of specialty.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Modern
Equestrian Bullfighting in Portugal</FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In her book, <B>Cavaliers
of Portugal</B>, Huldine Beamish writes: &quot;the mentioning of the word
bullfighting would probably elicit some negative reactions from an English
speaking readership, however when preceded by the word Portuguese, it conjures
images of one of the most exquisite forms of equestrian display, which
would interest anyone involved with horses, but specially those of us interested
in the Iberian horse.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The mounted bullfight
begins with a regal display of cavaliers dressed in XVII century outfits
and mounted on equally magnificently harnessed stallions. After a complex
exhibitions of haute icole, which demonstrates the superb training of the
horse, a single cavalier remains in the ring to face the bull alone.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In Portugal, the
objective of the bullfight is not to kill the bull but rather to demonstrate
the training and schooling of the horse. The bullfight consist of placing
a series of long and short darts on the muscular part of the bull, just
behind the neck. The darts irritate the bull and make it more aggressive.
The performance is relatively short, ten minutes or so, in which an average
of six darts are placed, but it must be performed under strict &quot;codes
of honor.&quot; The bull should be given the advantage when charging, that
is, it must initiate the charge before the cavalier makes his move. In
addition, the approach and encounter of bull and cavalier must be face
to face to the last possible moment, in which the horse, to escape the
impact of the bull must literally wrap itself around the bull in some fascinating
displays of agility.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The placing of
darts is usually done one by one, however, it is not uncommon for the cavalier
to tie the reigns, hold a banderilla in each hand, and with the aids of
his legs and seat, maneuver his horse for the placing of a pair of banderillas.
During the intervals of placing darts, the cavaliers allows his horse to
be closely chased by the bulls and then demonstrates in an elegant and
relaxed manner, a variety of movements of dressage.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Portuguese bullfighting
take place in relatively small rings, requiring that the horse posses a
perfect and precise training to avoid the charge of the bull. Therefore,
the success in evading the impact of the bull depends more in skilled movements
than in running speed. To cite Sr. Alvaro Domecq D. again &quot;in Portugal
everything seems to have concentrated around the development of a precise
and perfect training . The labor of bullfighting seems to be given by an
equestrian master solely for the display of his horse. bullfighting on
horse back seen in this setting, has become a marvelous game, a delectable
one,..... pure art&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The
Horses of the Equestrian Bullfights</FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Traditionally the
Portuguese bullfighting is mounted on a pure bred Lusitano stallion. On
occasions, they will ride mares or cross-bred horses. In fact, the breeding
selection process of the Lusitano horse is essentially based on its ability
for the bullfight. In Spain the preference for stallions is not as marked
and the use of pure bred Andalusian horse is not predominant. I would venture
to say that at least eighty percent of the horses currently being used
for rejoneo in Spain are either pure bred Lusitano or crosses of Andalusians,
Arabs and Thoroughbreds. I recently saw an Appaloosa being used for rejoneo
in Spain, but I do not recall seeing the use of a gelding of any breed
in either Spain or Portugal.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In an exquisite
book about equestrian bullfights entitled &quot;<B>O Toureio Equestre em
Portugal</B>,&quot; Mr. Fernando Sommer d'Andrade summarizes the characteristics
of a good bullfighting horse by stating: &quot;the horse for the bullfights
must be patient, docile, courageous, suffering and not impressionable.
It must also have the ability to concentrate , be energetic, agile, sensitive,
fast and obedient, and possess personality. These are the contradictions
that make it difficult to find good bullfighting horses.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In closing what
I would like to emphasize the importance of the partnership between horse
and rider in rejoneo , where in essence there is a symbiosis, from which
depends both the life of horse and rider. Something that Sylvia Loch so
eloquently describes as: &quot;a symbol of complex dependence, one upon
the other. The centaur-man and horse joined together in a way in which
no other equestrian sport can demonstrate. Something deeply primeval within
us is touched when we see such perfect empathy between a man and his horse&quot;.
