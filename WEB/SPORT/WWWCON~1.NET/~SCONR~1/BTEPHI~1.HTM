<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the year 1598,
Spanish explorer Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate crossed the Rio Grande river
for the very first time somewhere near what is now the patio of La Hacienda
Cafe in El Paso, Texas. Exactly 360 years later, in 1958, another historic
event took place at this location - Barrera Taurina was organized and received
its name.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Barrera Taurina
evolved from a need for communication between bullfight aficionados. Founded
by Al Lopez (designer of the club's emblem) and Charlcie Joan Clements
(now Charlcie Joan Zavala), the club was attended by 50 aficionados at
the organizational meeting Aug. 15, 1958, and 37 became Charter Members.
Since then, an average of 50 to 60 paid members have been on the roster.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The club's first
social was a cocktail party honoring American novillero Rocky Moody and
he was named our first Honorary Member.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our first challenge
to participate in a taurine festival came in November, 1958, when our club
sent Tony Purcell as our pr&aacute;ctico to appear alongside 4 aficionado
pr&aacute;cticos from the Club Taurino Juan Saldana Miranda of Juarez.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>We presented our
first festival New Year's Day, 1959, in Plaza Alberto Balderas, Cd. Juarez,
Chih., Mexico. Matadors for that event were Hector &quot;El Pipo&quot;
Barragan, Jim Ward, Marshall Hill, and Marc Barrosse. Our banderilleros
were Henry Castillo and Ted Branham, and our banderilleras were Helen Carriere,
Dolores Sweezey, Helena Vasquez, and Charlcie Clements (Zavala). Picadores
were Ruben Avelar, Don Sweezey, and Carl Roybal. The Juarez club was there
&quot;in force&quot; to see &quot;gringo blood on the sand&quot;, but they
went away respecting our bravery (none of us except Barrosse had ever fought
live animals before) and the smooth organization of the festival; we have
been fast friends with the Juarez club ever since, participating in many
events, even traveling to ferias in the interior of Mexico, together.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Barrera Taurina
has always been dedicated to promoting better understanding of the art
of taurom&aacute;quia, therefore, educational programs have always been
a major activity of the club--not only for our meetings, but, also, before
civic, military, and social organizations. In the early days, we all had
authentic Spanish costumes made and wore them when we presented programs
or rode horseback in the Sun Carnival parade in the manner the Spaniards
do at their ferias. Even our parties, which were often big, glitzy taurine
awards dinner/dances, were bi-cultural events with taurinos from both sides
of the border being invited. In the days when two bullrings were operating
every Sunday through the formal season and a complete novillada season
following it, there were lots of reasons to celebrate and plan fiestas.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1962, Barrera
Taurina hosted the organizational meeting of the NATC (National Association
of Taurine Clubs). J.R. Vincent Kehoe of New York, chaired the event, but
Don Edmundo deAnda of Barrera Taurina was elected our first national president.
Barrera Taurina again hosted the next year, and six times after that, making
a total of eight NATC conventions hosted by Barrera Taurina during NATC's
first thirty years. Our club has always been a strong supporter of NATC.
Four El Pasoans have served as NATC presidents:</FONT></FONT></P>

its first award, the O.P. Houston Award, and Barrera Taurina was voted
the first recipient. During NATC's first 30 years, other El Pasoan's who
received the O.P. Houston Award were: </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The only El Pasoan
to receive the coveted George B. Smith Arts &amp; Letter Medal, begun in
1968, was taurine artist Cesar &quot;Silver&quot; Contreras, 1991; but
two El Pasoans have earned the Nancy Slayton Award (for outstanding service
to NATC) since its inception in 1984:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our club has presented
so many taurine festivales, we lost count, but most often they have been
in conjunction with NATC conventions. Some very fine aficionado practicos
have emerged from Barrera Taurina, the best-known being: Hector &quot;El
Pipo&quot; Barragan, Martin &quot;Sonny&quot; Galaviz, Mike de Anda, Cesar
&quot;Silver&quot; Contreras, and David Canales.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>During one period,
Barrera Taurina won acclaim in El Paso for its fine educational tours to
the bullfights. It was a very popular attraction for tourists.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1973, the first
bullfight museum in the USA was developed by Bill Adams, Raul &quot;Bomba&quot;
Gonzalez, and Manolo Pe&ntilde;a, with the help from all our members and
donations from NATC member clubs. Unfortunatly, it burned in 1988. What
little was salvaged from the fire is now at the Escuela Taurina de Juarez.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In spite of the
competition taurom&aacute;quia has suffered in recent years from television;
ever-increasing sports events of all varieties; multitudinous concerts
and other spectacularly-staged public events - not to mention bomb threats
and other detriments presented by animal rights activists - Barrera Taurina
continues to meet monthly and interest in La Fiesta Brava seems to be growing.
We are proud to be active in the preservation of this artistic/almost spiritual
aspect of Spanish culture.</FONT></FONT></P>
