<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>It has always seemed appropriate to me that the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, in their monograph Geografia Espanola del Toro de Lidia, uses the valleys of the major rivers of Spain to structure their study by geographical area. In it the ganaderías are pinpointed along the courses of the Duero, the Ebro, the Tagus, the Jucar, the Gaudiana, the Guadalquivir and others. Any sally into how the earliest ganaderías came about leads one into the valleys of Spanish rivers such as the Ebro, the Henares, the Jarama, the Yeltes and the Guadalquivir. It is tempting to think of the bulls roaming wild in the unenclosed pastures in the river valleys and gradually being gathered together into ranches as the fiesta de toros developed and the secrets of genetics emerged from Mendel and Darwin so that the descendants of these early animals are still grazing in the same pastures as did their abuelos and abuelas dozens of times removed. Such a thought is probably too fanciful to be close to the truth, of course, but it seems clear that the emergence of what have come to be known as the "castas o razas fundacionales" emerged in distinct geographical areas. 

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Bulls had been supplied for fiestas by specific individuals for at least a century before these founding breeds started to be mentioned in the second half of the eighteenth century. Filiberto Mira summarises these in his El Toro Bravo, Hierros y Encastes.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>"...All the authorities I have consulted are in agreement in acknowledging the existence of the Royal Herd - possibly the root of the foundational Jijona breed - in Aranjuez even before 1606. 

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Also from the 17th century come the names of the ranchers Juan de Vargas, of Alcalá de Henares; of Antonio Valencia, of Zamora; of Francisco Meneses, of Talavera de la Reina; of Rodrigo Cárdenas, of Salamanca; of Gaspar Valdés, of one Fabiana whose family name is unknown; of Antonio Madrid, of Consuegra; of the Duke of Béjar; of Luis de Rincón; of Jacinto María Calvo; of Franciso Reoli. And in this century the name Jijón which was to achieve so much renown and is the only one which was to survive into the next century."

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>For those who wish to read of the very early ranches Luis Uriarte’s book, El toro de lidia Español, ensayo de revision historica de las ganaderias en su origen, goes into far greater detail than any other easily accessible work. He mentions names which sometimes crop up in discussions of the bulls of today: Santacara, Guendulain, Carriquiri, Jijón. These are but names, of course, and of little or no significance to the bulls we see today. 

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The second half of the eighteenth century is probably the epoch in which bull breeding as we understand it came into its own and knowledge of  which is necessary if we are to fully understand the modern manada brava of Spain. As Alberto Vera Areva has it in his Historial de las Ganaderias Bravas,

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>"The second half of the eighteenth century signals a notable milestone in the annals of the breeding and improvement of the fighting bull. Given that, with undeniable enthusiasm and the employment of rational method on the part of the breeders, the innate bravery and external 
characteristics of the bull were put on the right track through selective methods which wrought a transformation of ample and meritorious proportions on the fundamental element of the fiesta." 
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Apparently this selective breeding process was taking place in sufficiently discrete areas for several breeds of animals to emerge. And each of these breeds had its own distinctive characteristics. They are defined and explained in every book on the fighting bull worthy of the 
name and they provide the starting blocks from which to accelerate into a study of the ranches which exist today; they are also my reason for writing this essay. I intend to translate the account given in the 1993 Yearbook of the Asociación Nacional de Ganaderías de Lidia. Their treatise is one of the most detailed of the half dozen or so in my possession and the one which mentions numbers of nineteenth century ganaderos whose names are still fairly common currency today. Before commencing, there are some points to be made about semantics. 

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The notion that blood has anything to do with the characteristics of animals is, of course, a false one. Characteristics are transmitted from generation to generation through the genes. It would be more accurate, therefore, to discuss the breeding of cattle in terms of genes rather than of blood. The idea of blood being the material in which characteristics are passed is so common in writings and discussion of bull breeds that blood has become a metaphor for genetic material. I will, therefore, use the convention of referring to blood and bloodlines just as other writers do. Specific meaning for the words casta and raza, especially the former, are difficult - perhaps impossible - to find. It seems to be fairly widely accepted that they may be used synonymously to mean "breed". Thus, one might find either word used in Spanish to indicate a breed or bloodline. For example, the foundational breeds that I am about to write about are sometimes called the castas o razas fundacionales. At another level the word casta is sometimes used to indicate a particular genetic pathway leading from the foundational breeds to the modern ones. Thus one might read of the Casta Saltillo or the Casta Parlade and translate the phrases into the Saltillo bloodline and the Parlade bloodline or the Saltillo breed and the Parlade breed. But the words are also used in the sense of breeding as used in the word thoroughbred with reference to horses or pedigreed with reference to dogs. It is also possible to read of a bull having casta in the sense of courage or temperament, either in a positive or a negative sense. It seems to me that the best ways of dealing with this problem are for the translator to interpret what the author of the original means or to 
leave the word in Spanish and let the reader work out its meaning from the context in which he or she finds it. Another difficult area is that of hair colour. Often a single word serves to describe a highly multicoloured bull in Spanish and when one wishes to translate it into English one almost has to write a book to do so. Aldinegro, for instance, means mixed red white and grey or chestnut or grey which has black hair over the lower half of the body for its entire length as long as it is not berrendo (which means having white patches over more than a quarter of the body area mixed with another colour). And, of course, when discussing bull breeds the colour of their bodies is no unimportant matter. Perhaps someone will find time to write a glossary of all the possible skin colours of fighting bulls.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>With these points in mind we may proceed into the treatise mentioned above.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>"The fighting bulls of today originated from five breeds: Jijona, Cabrera, Vazquena, Vistahermoso and Navarra, although the last mentioned is not counted as one of the founding breeds. I do not know why that is, or why the same could be said of the ganadería of Raso de Portillo which, given its age, was given pride of place in all the royal fiestas.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Jijona Caste.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>This breed was very famous until the middle of last century, when it started to decline and lose the favour of the public as new ganaderías formed with other castes captured the attention  of the aficionados. Taking this into account their respective proprietors started to cross them with cattle of different caste, leaving such a limited number of ganaderías in which Jijón blood remained - and in them very adulterated indeed - that the fingers of one hand suffice to count them. In such ranches a throw-back occurs from time to time and an animal is born with some of the characteristic features and the body colour of the jijónes.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The historians say that in La Mancha, and more specifically in the valleys and rougher mountains of the so-called Mountains of Toledo, herds of cattle pastured in a savage state and that in the early years of the seventeenth century don Juan Sánchez Jijón Salcedo translated groups of them to Villarrubia de los Ojos, where he lived. Through careful selection he contrived to make a ganaderia of fighting bulls which in due course won great renown.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>These Jijóna bulls acquired their greatest splendour in the times of Miguel and José Jijón.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>They were bulls of great size, with well developed heads (horns), rough hooves and fine hair. Their principal characteristic was their fiery red skin colour which led to all bulls of that colour being called Jijónes.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Cabrera Caste

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not known when it was formed and from where these powerful animals first came, although theories exist that it was from the countryside around Talavera where great herds of cattle of great corpulence, predominantly of red hair colouration and with partridge eyes, were bred.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Cabrera bulls were of great height, long, greyhound-looking and, therefore, of great weight; their hair was silken and fine. They had well-developed horns; they were very strong, agile during the lidia and very brave.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The hair colour of the Cabrera cattle was dark, black, red and white pied, red with partridge eyes, grey or grey with white spots.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The founder of the ranch was don Luis Antonio Cabrera in Utrera (Sevilla) in the 1730’s, and it is very possible that his animals were descended from those from some of the ranches, or, to put it better, herds of cattle, which the Religious Communities created with their tithes, whose origin, as we have already said, is unknown.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>His daughter, Bárbara, inherited from Sr Cabrera in 1768, She was married to her second cousin, D José Rafael Cabrera Angulo and it was under their direction that the ranch achieved great renown. Don José Rafael died in 1832 and the ranch passed to his third wife, Da  María Soledad Núñez del Prado y Ayllon Lara from whom it was inherited by her sister, Da Jerónima, in 1835. 

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1852 Da Jerónima sold the ranch in two lots. One went to D. Ramón Romero Balmasada and the other to D. Juan Miura, who had already, the year before, acquired a significant number of cows and bulls from Da Jerónima.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>It is in the herd of Miura that this "Cabreraña" caste is conserved with most purity today, and although various crosses have been effected it may be assumed that they have not taken place with every cow, but rather with isolated groups of females. This supposition is based on the fact that across the years greyhound-like bulls with long and flexible necks like no others and of great height from hoof to withers have continued to predominate in the herd; these are the characteristics of the primitive Cabreras recorded in the chronicles.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The crosses just mentioned were realised in 1854 with two bulls from D José Arias de Saavedra (of the Vistahermosa caste) in 1879 with a bull of the Duke of Veragua (Vazqueña caste) and in the same year another bull from D. Manuel de Val (Navarrese caste) which had in its turn been 
descended from the cattle of the Tudelan rancher Pérez Laborda, and, in 1918 another seed bull of Sra Marquesa de Tamarón (Vistahermosa).

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Vistahermosa Caste

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is the caste which has given the greatest and best results and from which almost all the fighting bulls in existence to-day are descended in distinct bloodlines such as Santa Coloma, Saltillo, Murube and Parladé, all growing from the same branch but morphologically distinct in themselves; it is a thing which has not happened with any other caste.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>These Vistahermosa bulls in the beginning distinguished themselves with the excellent results they gave in all three stages of the lidia. They are fine of conformity, have good and well-proportioned horns; - the heads of some emerge slightly small -have small hooves; they are very brave, swift of movement and of great nobility.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The caste was founded by Don Pedro Luis de Ulloa y Calis, count of Vistahermosa, who bought some cattle from some rich farm workers called Rivas from the Sevillian village of Dos Hermanas in 1772. Don Pedro never saw the results, for which he had placed great hopes, because he died in 1776, and it was his successor, his son don Benito de Ulloa y Halcón de Cala, who in reality, after some years of painstaking selection, managed to place the ranch at the head of all of the ranchers 
of the epoch. His brother Don Pedro Luis, third count of Vistahermosa, succeeded him in 1800, and he was in turn succeeded by his sister Da Luisa in 1821. The following year she sold this most famous ranch in five parts or lots: one to Fernando Freire, son of Manuel Freire García and of Dolores Zembrano who, on acquiring the Vistahermosa lot was already proprietor of another ganadería of vazquez origin inherited from his grandfather Fernando Freire; another to Joaquín Giráldez; to Antonio Malgarejo Montes de Oca; to Salvador Varea and, finally, to Juan Domínguez Ortiz, known as "Barbero de Utrero" (from whom inherited his son-in-law, José Arias de Saavedra).
<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The origins of the cattle of los señores Rivas is not known. The most common hair colour in the cattle is black, black with a brown back streak, grey, red, chorreado (a bull with darker stripes of its own body colour running vertically down its sides) and peach.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Vázquez Caste

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The founder of this caste was don Gregorio Vázquez, inhabitant of Utrera (Sevilla), with cattle of unknown ancestry. Years later he incorporated cattle from Cabrera, which added size and weight, and from Juan Becker, formed with cows of Cabrera and seed bulls of El Raso de Portillo (q.v.), which were not exactly renowned for their nobility, but for their sentido.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>On his death, which occurred in 1780, his son, Vicente José, took charge of the cattle and he saw that his ganadería lacked the principal qualities necessary in the fighting bull: bravery and nobility.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In those days there was another recently founded ganadería which combined all the qualities lacking from his, but here he stumbled at the great inconvenience that these excellent cattle belonged to the count of Vistahermosa who didn’t want to sell a single one of them. He did not alter his position in the face of requests, friendly approaches or even the fabulous amount of money he was offered for each cow. Sr Vázquez was not disheartened by this problem, and as a result of his having great resources, as much of an economic nature as of other kinds, decided to lease the paying of the tithes owed by herdsmen and farmers to the diocese of Seville in return for gaining access to he cattle he desired. To avoid possible fraud, in the receipt of other cattle than those desired, he took all class of precaution, taking mayorales and cattle experts to the place where the payments with cattle were to be made.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>It served the count of Vistahermosa naught that he desired to pay in nothing but males. He had to give in to the petition of the lessee of the tithes and hand over females as well.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Once the one-year-old cows and bulls were in the power of Sr Vázquez, he had to wait till they reached an age suitable for testing them. With all of the cattle - males and females - the selection was extreme and only those of superior quality were allowed to pass.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>He was fortunate and the cattle of count bore the desired fruit. He came to be, with Cabrera and Vistahermosa, one of the trio of breeders who captured the attention of the public.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The skin colours and appearance of the cattle are varied owing to the number of bloodlines employed in their formation. There are broad bulls, of very good-looking conformation although somewhat rough of the skin because it is thick, short in the leg and very well horned. The hair, as we have already said, is varied in colour. There are bulls which are black, white and red combined; pied red and black; red; black-eyed; chestnut; grey; black; peach; those of distinct head colour and dirty white. The hair colour was generalised into thirteen different types when the Duke of Veragua was the proprietor of the ranch.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>On the death of D. Vicente José Vázquez in 1830, his will divided the herd into five parts: one to D. Antonio Mera, who already possessed another lot which he had acquired from Sr Vázquez in 1826; D. Francisco Taviel de Andrade; D. José María Benjumea; D. Francisco Ziguri and D. Fernando Freire, who acquired the most numerous part in the name of King Fernando V11, who transferred the ganadería from Utrera, where it grazed, to Aranjuez.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>D. Manuel Gaviria took charge of the ganadería, by royal decree, in 1831, and effected a cross with six seed-bulls from his own ganadería and four of D Julian de Fuentes, of the same jijón origin. The Duke of Veragua, an enemy of crosses, made an agreement with Mínguez, the mayoral, and when the first offspring of the cross started to be born they were all marked with a distinct earmark so that when he took over the herd he was able to easily eliminate those which were not of pure Vázquez caste by their different earmark.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Fernando V11 died in 1833 and the ganadería passed to the Queen Regent, Da. María Cristina De Borbón, who ceded the royal herd to the dukes of Osuna and Veragua, the latter becoming sole proprietor in 1849.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Navarrese Caste

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Knowledge of the ancestry of these cattle, which enjoyed great and well-merited prestige in the last century, is lost in the mists of time. They could be the descendants of the primitive BOS BRACHYCEROS given their similar morphology and perhaps on passing across the Pyrenees they became established in Guipuzcoa and Navarra. They descended later to the pastures bathed by the rivers Alhama, Aragón, Arga, Cidacos, Egea and, principally, those of the Ebro, the farms of which were around Arguedas, Buñuel, Caparroso, Corella, Cortes, Fustiñana, Funes, Peralta, Lodosa, Tafalla, Tudela, Villafranca and Alfaro, where they bred and reproduced.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Many branches sprouted from the roots of this legendary caste, but few of them acquired any fame.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1670 the figure of D. Joaquín Antonio Beaumont Ezcurra y Mesia, Marqués of Santaclara appeared. In time he became proprietor of a ranch of fighting bulls by caring for and selecting from the fabulous prime material which he owned. In time he established the trunk from which the most prestigious navarrese herds branched forth. 

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>There is evidence that bulls of the Marqués were fought in Pamplona in 1690 and in 1701, from his chaplain, Juan Escudero Valero, who transferred the ganadería to Martin de Virto, an inhabitant of Corella. In the early 1700s Isabel de Virto y Luna came to be proprietrix of the cattle. Years afterwards, in 1755, her son Antonio inherited the herd. He sold the animals in 1774 to Francisco Javier Guendulaín, inhabitant of Tudela; to Antonio Lizaso of Tudela; to Joaquín Zalduendo, of Caparroso and, finally, to Felipe Pérez Laborda, also of Tudela. It is from these ganadería that the main navarrese ranches sprung.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Of all the navarrese ranches none ever equaled that of the banker Nazario Carriquiri, whose bulls derived as much popularity as those from the most renowned castillian and andalucian ganaderías. This ganadería was acquired by Carriquiri in 1850 and he ceded it to his relation the 
count of Espoz y Mina, who had been his partner since 1868, in 1883. D. Nazario covered a restricted number of cows with two seed-bulls of Picavea de Lesaca seeking what they had never had: size. The cross did not bear fruit because what was gained in size was lost in courage and 
the entire crop of animals for the cross was eliminated.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>For many years those bulls were the terror of the toreros, as much those on foot as those on horseback. It was something like what occurs with the bulls of Miura today. Given their small size they led those who saw them for the first time to think that due to their small stature they lacked what they in fact had to excess- great strength. They treated the picadors to extremely dangerous falls and often jumped the barrera, not as a symptom of cowardice, but in pursuit of toreros.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The fame of these "rusty bullets", as these small, agile, resistant, red bulls - hard as rocks; spicy as the green peppers of the region; indomitable of courage and with great difficulties to overcome - came to be known in the area, given their temperament and that they never merely knocked the torero over but always caught and wounded, was such that they eventually eclipsed the rest of the navarrese ganaderías and it came to pass as a general rule that all of the navarrese ganaderías were descended from that of Carriquiri.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>An idea of the antiquity of these animals is given by the fact that Juan Gutiérrez Altamirano, a cousin of Hernán Cortés, took cows and seed-bulls of the navarrese caste to Mexico in 1552 to found a ganadería of brave cattle, that which gave rise to the Atenco ranch of today - the 
name of the farm to which they were taken.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Also, in the XVI century, missionary fathers took brave animals to Ecuador, to guard their fields, the security of which had been entrusted to fearsome dogs of which the Indians had no fear. The Indians invaded the fields and carried off the fruit. It occurred to the monks to replace the guard dogs with brave cows and bulls of which the Indians were ignorant and for whom the new danger proved insurmountable. The missionaries had the idea of enclosing their fields with a double fence 
of quadrilateral plan with narrow corners which were difficult to pass through. They aimed to ensure that the animals would not be seen but hidden away. One animal was placed in each callejón ready to attack the least noise or movement that it detected. It was enough to render the 
fields invulnerable.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The archetype of this race is: small head; short and inward-pointing horns of a caramel colour; large and bulging eyes; a short, wide neck; a small body of very fine lines; a small almond-shaped rump; a long tail with a brush of thick locks of dense hair; abundant hair on the face and neck, including on the shoulder-blades but short fine hair elsewhere; aldinegro , dark red, red, chestnut, peach, and in a few cases, black in colour.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Today there exists a very reduced number of cows of this famous caste. I can verify this fact, having seen them spread all through the provinces of Navarra, Rioja and Aragón and, very few, in Tarragona and Castellón. It is sad to see them with their proud, insolent gaze, as if they knew of the splendour and prestige enjoyed by their forebears in earlier times.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Raso de Portillo [sometimes called Castellanos or de la Tierra]

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The origins of this very ancient herd are unknown, as are the names of its original owners, or whether it was a single ganadería or several which grazed in the region known as "El Raso de Portillo". Thus it is impossible to give a name or names to one or all of the herds which 
existed in this area in that period when salty and marshy pastures existed there, as they did in other marshy zones , and which, by decree of the regency of General Serrano, in 1870, was partly drained. The said region is located in the municipal areas of Boecillo, Aldeamayor de San Martín and la Pedraja de Portillo in the province of Valladolid, at the feet of the Castle of Portillo in which D. Alvaro de Luna was imprisoned.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Given the little or almost nil information about the origins of this ranch or ranches, and for the characteristics of those for which we have information, it could be that these bulls had their origins in the navarrese caste, perhaps crossed with cows from the area - salamancan or from the banks of the Jarama. It is reported that their size was not great, rather, they were middle-sized, and that their hair colour was generally black with a brown back-stripe, chestnut or grey. They were very light and brave, as was the bull of navarrese origin.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The first owner of whom records exist is Alonzo Sanz, born in la Pedraja in 1715 from whom his children Gregoria and Victoriano inherited. Gregoria was married to Toribio Valdés. The ganadería passed, in 1863, to Pablo Valdés Sanz, son of Toribio and Gregoria, from whom D. Trifino Gamazo y Calvo acquired, in 1880, a good part of the finca and the entire ganadería, from which cattle had already been sold to [Joaquín] Mazpule in 1840 and [Julían] Presencio in 1841.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Cattle from the Heirs of the Count of Espoz y Mina were added to the ganadería in 1908 and in 1926, from Juan Cobaleda, one of the last lots of cattle sold by him which were descended from D. Nazario Carriquiri.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>D. Trifino Gamazo y Calvo died in 1919. D. Germán Gamazo y García de los Ríos and his brothers inherited, until the death, in 1948, of the gentleman mentioned. Today the ranch is the property of the grandchildren of the first, Sres Gamazo y Manglano Hermanos, sons of D José María who have proceeded to complement the old cattle with others of Parladé and Santa Coloma origin.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Of the antiquity of this ganadería, which went on grazing in the same pastures since the fifteenth century, there can be no shadow of doubt, given that it had the privilege of opening the plaza in all the royal fiestas. In the said XV century, they were fought in Granada in fiestas which developed to replace jousting as afición for the bulls emerged. At around the same time the popular tradition started of the miraculous event of San Pedro Regalado with a bull of "El Raso de Portillo". This saint was born in Valladolid in 1390 and died in the convent of la Aguilera in 1456. He spent his life between the convents of Santa María del Abrojo, on the banks of the river Duero, a few kilometres from Valladolid and even fewer from "El Raso de Portillo". and the aforementioned la Aguilera in the province of Burgos, rising to become the Superior of each.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>San Pedro Regalado and another friar had left the convent of Abrojo to La Aguilera. They walked along the road chatting amiably until they heard voices and the noise of horses. They were both terrified to see a bull coming towards them. It was wild with fury and blood spurted from a 
variety of huge wounds, it having escaped from Valladolid where it had been being fought with lances. Harassed by its pursuers it was heading for its querencia, El Raso de Portillo. It is recounted that, the terrorized companion of San Pedro Regalado hid behind the Saint who, pleading heavenwards, presented his crosier to the bull telling it to stop. The bull submitted and kneeled before the Saint, remaining quiet while San Pedro stroked it and cured its deep wounds. He blessed it and ordered it to depart and return to the ranch without attacking or causing the least danger to anyone. San Pedro has been the Patron Saint of Toreros since 1953."

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The source I have used, the Yearbook of the Asociación Nacional de Ganaderías de Lidia, which I chose because of its comprehensive summary of the material under discussion, does not mention three castes dealt with by Alberto Vera, Areva in his Historial de las Ganaderias Bravas. This may be because they are more modern than those discussed above and therefore are not thought appropiriate to a discussion of the foundational castes. For the sake ocf completeness, I include Areva information on them here.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Gallardo"

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>This caste owes its formation - in the middle of the XV111 century - to a cross of andalucian cows with navarrese bulls, the founder being the priest of Rota, don Marcelino Barnaldo de Quirós.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The ranch passed in due course to the brothers Gallardo, of the Puerto de Santa Maria, who improved it notably until the point that it was in its day one of the most renowned ganaderías in the Andalucian region.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>What remains of the characteristics of these animals, manifested in bulls of regular size and excellent trapio; are bravery and power, and conservation of many of their faculties until the end of their lidia. Ordinarily they are of black colour or are pied black or pied chestnut.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>During the last years of the XV111 century, dona Maria Antonia Espinoza, of Arcos de la Frontera, founded a ganadería with cattle from the province of Salamanca, whose products, known as "those of Espinoza" achieved a merited credit. Later the bulls were given the name of 
"Zapata" after new owners of the ganadería. In their hands it achieved a great cartel. 

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The most outstanding features of this caste, today virtually extinguished, were their corpulence and force, their chestnut, snowflaked and pale red colour.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A new type of toro emerged in 1910 from a cross of cows from the duke of Veragua (Vázquez caste) and a bull of Santa Coloma (Vistahermosa caste) made by don José Vega in his ranches in El Escorial. Years later, the ganadería being in the hands of don Franciso and don Victorio Villar, 
the cattle started to be distinguished for their special and fixed characteristics which prompt us to call the caste Vega Villar in memory of the first founder of the herd and those who followed him with their scrupulous selection procedure.

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The most particular characteristics of this modern and accredited caste are, among others, the following: bulls short and low at the withers; small-boned, brave, smooth and noble and distinguishable for their coat colour which is commonly black or pied black and white. Within those there emerge numerous bulls with white areas of various sizes on their underbellies; with white areas at their fronts; with white feet; and with white tails".
