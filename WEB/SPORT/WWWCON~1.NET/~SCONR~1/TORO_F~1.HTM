<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>1. What is alt.culture.bullfight
and how was it formed ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>alt.culture.bullfight
is a Usenet newsgroup on the Internet which serves as a forum for both
aficionados and casually interested people to discuss, understand and appreciate
the cultural phenomenon of the bullfight in its different forms all over
the world, including Spain, Portugal, France, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador,
Venezuela and Bolivia, in any language.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The name of the
newsgroup was a compromise between the proposer and the Usenet administrators
after they rejected all proposals containing the word &quot;toros&quot;
on the grounds that it was a foreign language word.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>It was decided
not to moderate the group at the time of its formation on 25 February 1995
because a) news would have been delayed and b) moderation of postings is
in itself is a form of censorship.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>It should be the
general policy not to respond to &quot;flame-bait&quot; from non-aficionados
and non-interested parties. Irrelevant postings known as &quot;spam&quot;
should also be ignored. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>2. What is the
difference between a corrida and a novillada ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In a corrida the
bulls are aged at least four years old (toros) whereas in a novillada the
bulls are only aged at least three years old (novillos). The term bullfight
can be applied to either a corrida or a novillada.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>3. What is a torero
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>This is a generic
term and can refer to anyone taking part in the bullfight. It should not
be confused with &quot;toreador&quot; which does not exist in modern bullfighting,
being popularised by Bizet in his opera &quot;Carmen&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>4. What is the
difference between a matador and a novillero ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Matadors have taken
the alternativa, a ceremony in which they are proposed and seconded by
two other matadors and thereby graduate from novillero tomatador. A novillero
can only fight novillos whereas a matador can fight both toros or novillos
but because of his standing, usually only fights novillos in a festival.
Matadors are sometimes referred to as &quot;espadas&quot; (swords) or &quot;diestros&quot;
(experts).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>5. What is a festival
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A festival is a
bullfight in which the matador or novillero do not wear the traditional
&quot;suit of lights&quot; (traje de luces) but traje corto, a suit similar
to that worn in the countryside by the bull ranchers. In a festival, it
is customary for the tips of the bulls' horns to be taken off so they are
&quot;desenpuntados&quot;. A bull with horns intact is &quot;en punto&quot;.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>6. What is afeitado
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>This literally
means &quot;shaved&quot;. It refers to an illegal practice whereby the
bull breeder is bribed to take off the tip of the bull's horns and then
files them back to a point. As the bull uses its horns in a way a cat does
its whiskers to measure distance, in theory this means it should always
fall short when trying to catch the torero. It should be pointed out however
that there have been many serious gorings involving bulls which have been
shaved. Manolete, one of the all-time greats, was supposedly killed by
a such a bull.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>7. What is a tercio
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>There are three
tercios (thirds) to both novilladas and corridas. The first tercio involves
the caping of the bull by the matador or novillero and the act of the picador;
the second tercio is the act of banderillas and the final tercio consists
of the faena and the death of the bull.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>8. What is a picador
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>In the first tercio,
the picador uses a pica (also known as a vara) which is a lance with a
steel point (puya) from on horseback to weaken the bull's neck muscles
so that its head is lowered for the kill. Picadors are not used in some
novilladas which are referred to as &quot;novilladas sin picadores&quot;
(novilladas without picadors). These are usually for novilleros who have
just started out.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>9. What is a banderillero
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A banderillero
is a torero who works in the team (cuadrilla) of a matador or novillero
and in the second tercio places the banderillas (barbed sticks), into the
bulls back. After charging the picador's horse, a bull can be tired and
the banderillas are supposed to enliven it for the final part of the bullfight.
Some matadors and novilleros place their own banderillas. If a bull refuses
to charge the picador, banderillas negras (black banderillas) may be used
which are longer and heavier with bigger barbs. It is considered shameful
to the bull breeder if these have to be used but they are rarely called
upon nowadays.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>10. What is the
difference between a capote and a muleta ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A capote is a big
work cape, magenta on the outside and yellow (sometimes blue) on the inside.
It is used by all the toreros but in the final tercio the matador or novillero
will change it for the muleta, made from red flannel on a wooden stick,
which he will use for the faena.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>11. What is a faena
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A faena is all
the work done with a muleta by a matador or novillero in the final and
most important tercio of the bullfight. A matador has ten minutes from
the start of the tercio in which to kill the bull. If, after this time
it is still alive, the President will order an aviso (warning) to be sounded.
A second aviso is sounded after a further three minutes and a third and
final aviso after a further two minutes. After three avisos steers are
let into the ring to take the bull out alive and it is regarded as a great
disgrace to a matador's reputation.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>12. What is a brindis
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Before commencing
the faena, the matador or novillero will doff his montera (hat) to the
president of the bullring (an official appointed by law to supervise the
bullfight) and ask permission to kill the bull. He may then offer a brindis
(salute) and dedicate the death of the bull to someone in the audience,
another torero or the whole audience itself. If the brindis is to one person,
he will give them his montera for the duration of the faena, sometimes
throwing it over his shoulder. If it is to the whole crowd he will lay
his montera down in the centre of the ring or throw it over his shoulder
for luck. If it lands upside down in the sand it is considered unlucky.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>13. How is the
bull killed ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>At the end of the
faena the matador or novillero will attempt to place a sword (estoque)
between the shoulder blades of the bull which is meant tosever the aorta.
This thrust is known as an estocada. If this fails to bring the bull down,
he will use another sword with a crosspiece near its end (descabello) to
sever the bull's spinal cord with a thrust just behind the back of its
head. As soon as the bull is down, a banderillero will jab a small knife
(puntilla) into this area as a coup de grace.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>14. What is an
indulto ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>If a bull has shown
exceptional bravery and the crowd petition the president of the bullring
before it is killed, he will grant an indulto (pardon) and spare the bull's
life. The kill is then simulated using a banderilla or an empty hand. The
bull will usually then become a semental (stud bull).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>15. What happens
to the bull once it is dead ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A team of mules
or horses drag the carcase out of the ring to butchers waiting outside
and it is sold as meat. Sometimes a brave performance by a bull will result
in the crowd petitioning the president after it has been killed for it
to be given a vuelta (lap) of the ring. The bull's carcase is then dragged
around the ring by a team of horses or mules to the applause of the crowd
and it is a great honour for the bull's breeder.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>16. What are trofeos
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Trofeos (trophies)
are awarded to the matador or novillero following an outstanding performance.
In order of precedence they are as follows. With the consent of the crowd,
he might take a lap around the ring (vuelta). If the majority of the crowd
petition the President, usually by way of waving white hankerchiefs (panuelos),
he has to award one ear (una oreja). If the crowd petitions and the President
himself considers that the performance has been outstanding, he may award
two ears (dos orejas). If the president considers the performance to have
been exceptional, he will award two ears and a tail (dos orejas y rabo)
also known as &quot;los maximos trofeos&quot;. The trofeos are cut from
the dead bull and presented to the matador or novillero who then takes
one or more vuelta of the ring. If he has cut at least two ears in the
whole bullfight, he is entitled to be carried out of the ring on the shoulders
of the crowd (salida en hombros).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>17. What is a cartel
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A cartel is a poster
advertising a bullfight but also refers to the collection of matadors or
novilleros who will appear. Normally there are three matadors or novilleros
who will fight two bulls each. The most senior will appear at the top of
the list and will fight the first and third bulls. The second-most senior
appears second and fights the second and fifth bull and the junior appears
bottom of the list and fights the third and sixth bull. Seniority is decided
by the date when a matador took the alternativa, or when a novillero first
fought in a novillada with picadors. If only two matadors or novilleros
are appearing, it is known as a &quot;mano a mano&quot; (hand to hand)
and they will fight three bulls each. Occasionally a matador or novillero
will appear alone (en solitario/unica espada) and fight all six bulls.
If there is a combination of matadors and novilleros or rejoneadors on
the same cartel it is known as a &quot;corrida mixta&quot; (mixed corrida).
Some carteles announce a string of bullfights for a whole &quot;feria&quot;
(fair) held to celebrate local festivities, during which there will usually
be a bullfight each day.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>18. What is a rejoneador
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A rejoneador fights
the bull from horseback in the style of the Portuguese &quot;cavaleiros&quot;
using rejones de castigo (punishment spears) in place of a pica, banderillas
and a rejon de muerte (spear of death) in place of an estoque. If he fails
to kill the bull with the rejon de muerte, he must dismount and use a descabello.
A rejoneador can fight either toros or novillos and also takes an alternativa
to graduate to the former. A bullfight with a cartel comprised entirely
of rejoneadores is known as a rejoneo. It is also customary for the tips
of the bulls' horns to be taken off or in Portugal to be covered with leather
cases to give added protection to the horses.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>19. What are forcados
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Forcados appear
in Portuguese bullfights and line up in teams wearing bright suits, taking
the bull's frontal charge and catch it by the horns in an atttempt to bring
it to a complete halt. They appear in a separate performance after the
cavaleiro has finished with the bull. In past times the bullring had a
staircase to the Royal Box and forcados were employed to ensure that the
bull did not enter the stairs. To assist them they used a pole (approx
1.7m long) with a half-moon of steel at the top. This was called a &quot;forcado&quot;
(meaning something close to &quot;fork&quot;) and it is from there the
name comes. Nowadays they only use it in the &quot;cortesias&quot;, the
Portuguese name for &quot;paseillo&quot; or in historical demonstrations.
After the forcados have finished, the bull is led out of the ring alive,
but is killed later in the corrals of the bullring.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>20. What is the
escalafon ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The escalafon is
a league table and there is one each for matadors, novilleros and rejoneadores.
Success is not measured by the number of ears cut but by the number of
fights fought, as a successful torero will be one who is in demand and
thereby will be awarded the most contracts. The &quot;lider del escalafon&quot;
(league leader) is often also known as &quot;El Numero Uno&quot; (Number
One).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>21. What is a plaza
de toros ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A bullring. As
the sun will predominantly shine on one side of the ring, that section
is known as the &quot;Sol&quot; (Sun) and seats are cheaper there. The
side predominently in the shade is known as the &quot;Sombra&quot; (shade).
During the fight there will be areas where the sun will go down and also
areas where the sun may appear. These may be sold as &quot;Sol y Sombra&quot;,
cheaper than the Sombra but more expensive than the Sol. The biggest bullring
in the world is the Plaza Monumental in Mexico City. The biggest bullring
in Europe is the Plaza Monumental de Las Ventas in Madrid. Spanish bullrings
are categorised into first, second and third-class. The &quot;plazas de
primera&quot; are Madrid, Seville, Barcelona, Valencia, Cordoba, Zaragoza
and Bilbao. &quot;Plazas de segunda&quot; are mainly capitals of provinces
and the rest are third-class. Although Pamplona is officially second-class,
that and the Roman arena in the French city of Nimes are regarded by many
aficionados as first-class in all but name.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>22. Why are there
two white rings painted in the arena ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The picador has
to remain outside the outer circle to receive the bull's charge in the
first tercio and the toreros must station the bull inside the inner circle
before it can charge the picador.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>23. What is a sorteo
?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A sorteo is literally
&quot;a drawing of lots&quot;. On the day of the bullfight, usually at
noon, representatives of the matadors or novilleros will attend the corral
of the bullring to decide which of the string of bulls will be fought by
their employer. Bulls are sometimes matched up for instance so that the
heaviest and the lightest, the one with the biggest horns and the one with
the smallest horns, etc are put together in pairs. The numbers of the bulls
are written on pieces of paper and placed in a hat and the representatives
draw one out each which decides which bulls their employer will fight.
Following the sorteo is the &quot;apartado&quot; (separating) of the bulls
into individual pens where they are left until they are required in the
bullfight. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>24. Why does the
bull have a &quot;rosette&quot; on its back when it enters the ring ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>All bulls are bred
on ganaderias (ranches) which specialise in fighting bulls (toros de lidia).
Each rancher (ganadero) makes his own distinctive notches in the bulls'
ears, has his own branded insignia and his own colours. The rosette (divisa)
shows the colours of the ranch which bred the bull and has a small barb
on it. Just before the bull enters the ring via the toril gate, it is inserted
into its hide using a long spring-loaded pole. The most famous ganaderia
is that of the infamous Miura bulls from Seville.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>25. What is an
encierro ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>An encierro is
where bulls are run through the streets and corredores (runners) attempt
to run in front and alongside them as closely as possible. The most famous
encierros are held in Pamplona but they are also held in Logron~o, San
Sebastian de Los Reyes, Cuellar, Tudela, Tolosa and elsewhere. The bulls
in the Pamplona encierros are the actual bulls that will be fought that
afternoon although this may not be the case in other places.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>26. How are bullfight
results reported ?</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Usually in the
Spanish press the date, venue and breed of bulls are given followed by
the matadors or novilleros in order of seniority and against each one are
two comments (three comments in case of a mano a mano and six comments
in the case of a solo performance). The first comment refers to their performance
with their first bull and the second comment relates to their performance
with their second bull, etc. Comments in order of precedence range from
&quot;dos orejas y rabo simbolicas&quot; (two symbolic ears and a tail,
the bull's life having been pardoned for bravery), &quot;dos orejas y rabo&quot;
(two ears and a tail) &quot;dos orejas&quot; (two ears), &quot;una oreja&quot;
(one ear), &quot;vuelta&quot; (lap of the ring), &quot;ovacion&quot; (standing
ovation), &quot;aplausos&quot; (applause), &quot;saludos&quot; (salutations),
&quot;palmas&quot; (polite handclapping), &quot;silencio&quot; (silence),
&quot;pitos&quot; (whistles), &quot;bronca&quot; (venomous protest, sometimes
accompanied by throwing of cushions (almohadillas) into the ring). There
is also &quot;division de opiniones&quot; (division of opinions) where
some of the crowd think the performance was acceptable, others not. A performance
could be reported with &quot;con peticion&quot; (with petition) for example
&quot;oreja con peticion&quot;, where the crowd demanded the next trophy
up (two ears) but the President would not allow it. Sometimes a section
of the crowd will object to a trophy being awarded so it may be reported
as &quot;oreja con protestas&quot; (ear with protests). On these occasions
a matador may choose not to take a lap of the ring. Some reports of bullfights
continue with performances and weights of the bulls, the size of the crowd,
the weather and any particular incidents of note. There may then follow
a full article on the bullfight in question describing the different passes
used, etc </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>27. What is a feria
? </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>A feria (fair)
is usually held in most Spanish towns and cities to celebrate a particular
religious feast day and there are usually an accompanying bullfight or
bullfights helds. Some ferias such as Pamplona's feria of San Fermin are
held on fixed dates whereas others such as Seville's April Fair depend
on when a religious feast day falls. Many ferias start and/or culminate
on a Sunday. Below is a list of the major Spanish ferias which all last
for at least a week and which will all have at least one bullfight per
day . Carteles might only be announced two weeks in advance. The cities
of Madrid and Seville usually have bullfights every Sunday during the whole
season and Barcelona has them every Sunday during July and August. </FONT></FONT></P>
