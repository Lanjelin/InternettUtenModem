Maryland had its beginning when four friends got together on 21 January
1989 to talk about bulls. These original four are Mario Carri&oacute;n,
Matador de Toros from Seville; Pepe C&eacute;spedes, son of Matador Paco
C&eacute;spedes (an honorary member) of Chiclayo, Peru; Luis Flores, banderillero
from Columbia and Jim Toland, retired command pilot of Washington's Special
Air Mission Wing (of Air Force two and other dignitaries).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Avid traveler Katherine
Cave was the first woman to join Pe&ntilde;a Taurina MD in 1989, followed
by dancer Linda Moll and language teacher Diane DiFerdinando. Wonderful
additions were also realized when long-time officials of Taurine Bibliophiles
of America Ray Turner and Don Conover joined, sharing their vast taurine
experiences. Entrepreneur and knowledgeable of the French/Spanish scene,
Ren&eacute; Arneodau filled out the European influence while Fernando and
Mariana Wandemberg brought their aficion all the way from Qu&iacute;to,
Ecuador. Finally, epistler Gil Arruda became a non-resident member to complete
the roster.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The club met every
four-six weeks, rotating the hosting between the membership. Video tapes,
detailed discussions, demonstrations and &quot;toreo de salon&quot; with
both capote and muleta under the watchful eye of Matador Carri&oacute;n,
were the usual program activities.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The club was published
in Mexico's &quot;Esto&quot; championing the cause of Matador David Bonilla.
Members have been quoted in Spain's &quot;Aplausos&quot; and are always
well-represented at NATC conventions and tertulias. In 1993, the management
of the club became too much for the current president, Jim Toland, whose
job as a commercial pilot was very demanding. As a result, the club was
disbanded; the small amount of monies in the treasury was distributed among
the members.</FONT></FONT></P>
