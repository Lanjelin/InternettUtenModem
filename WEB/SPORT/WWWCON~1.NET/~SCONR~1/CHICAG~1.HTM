<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>During the summer
of 1961, two separate groups of aficionados decided to organize a bullfight
club in Chicago. The two groups united to form the nucleus of what would
become Club Taurino de Chicago. After unification this group consisted
of an &quot;odd dozen.&quot; After a few informal meetings, the group had
grown to 32 members when it held its first charter meeting in January,
1962.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The purpose of
the club has been to stimulate the understanding of La Fiesta Brava; to
serve as a center for the exchange of taurine ideas and experiences; and
to provide members and the general public with information about the history,
lore, and current situation of &quot;taurom&aacute;quia&quot; in all countries
where it exists.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Club functions
have not been limited to &quot;bullfighting&quot; per se, but have also
embraced the study of the Hispanic-Latino cultures as they relate to art
and literature. The monthly journal (newsletter) of the club - &quot;Pases
y Lances&quot; - is recognized throughout the United States, Europe, and
Latin America as being one of the outstanding taurine publications in the
English language.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The club has sponsored
numerous tours to Spain, Mexico, Colombia, and more recently, France. On
these tours, the club has been entertained and welcomed by the Mayors and
bullfight clubs of the cities visited, as well as by ganaderos of bull-breeding
ranches.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the more
unusual club events was a &quot;bloodless&quot; corrida de toros staged
at Wauconda, Illinois, on June 27, 1965 with some very contrary Brahma
bulls from Louisiana. This event received not only local publicity, but
national and international coverage as well. As a result of this world-wide
exposure, we had some Swedish visitors who wanted to see &quot;the bullfight
club&quot; in Chicago.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The club also presented
a very extensive international bullfight art exhibit at Marina City on
September 17, 1965, featuring a costly museum display which was air-shipped
to us in Chicago from Mexico City with the assistance of the Chicago office
of the Mexican Department of Tourism. We also had the assistance of the
Spanish Commercial Attache, who provided us with bottles of sherry at our
meetings during those early years.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>CTC loves to travel!
In 1963, 1964, and 1965, the club visited Spain and attended the ferias
of Malaga and Valencia. In 1966, the club went to the feria of San Miguel
de Allende in Mexico. In 1969, the club went to the ferias in Malaga and
San Sebasti&aacute;n. In 1970, the club returned to Mexico for the f&eacute;ria
de San Marcos (Aguascalientes); and the club visited Spain again in 1971
-- Pamplona.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>We continued our
busy travel schedule in the 1970's: to Mexico - Aguas, Guadalajara, and
Colombia -- Cali, Bogota, Manizales, Cartagena. In 1973, we went back to
Spain (Gij&oacute;n), returning to Sevilla in 1975 and Pamplona in 1977.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Since 1968, CTC
has attended the NATC conventions. At that time we took the famous train
ride to Los Mochis. In 1986, CTC sponsored its first NATC Congreso in Salamanca,
Spain. In 1988, we sponsored our second NATC Congreso in Mont-de-Marsan,
France. These were &quot;firsts&quot; for the NATC. All previous Congresos
had been held in Mexico, California, or Texas. CTC again sponsored the
NATC congreso in Nimes, France in 1992.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The original &quot;odd
dozen&quot; probably had no idea that in the intervening years the scope
of their venture would grow in membership and would feature a long list
of honorary members including many dignitaries and authors of the taurine
world.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>As we pass &quot;middle
age&quot; (1991-1992 marked our 30th anniversary!) we are still committed
to providing the following: exciting trips; a top-notch journal; and programs
that are both educational and interesting. Ol&eacute; for the years behind
us, and a toast for the years to come!</FONT></FONT></P>
