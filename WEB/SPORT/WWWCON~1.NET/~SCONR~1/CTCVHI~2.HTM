<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Our club was organized
on March 14, 1961 with 54 founding members. The object and purpose was
the establishment in Chula Vista of a non-profit, non-political organization
for the advancement, understanding and promotion of La Fiesta Brava. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Quite a few of
our members have been avid aficionados for many years and, of course, we
have garnered many others as members as well as losing a few along the
way. We have traveled to Mexico, Spain, France and even the U.S.A. in pursuit
of knowledge and pleasue.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Over the years
CTCV has been host or co-host for nine of our annual NATC Conventions where
we were proud to have friends and guests gather to enjoy the ambience of
this group.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>One of our big
projects each year has been our charity program to help the needy in Tijuana.
We first adopted a neighborhood in a canyon in Tijuana, then a Mission
and the last few years an orphanage for boys in Tecate. These projects
have been very fulfilling for all of us.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>We have been fortunate
to be the only club in the U.S.A. with our own clubhouse. There we have
much memorabilia; ears, tails, posters and ticket stubs dating back over
30 years, a bull's head, an extensive library and our own bar! We have
had wonderful gatherings for parties, Bar-B-Ques, meetings, etc. in the
comfort of our clubhouse. We have been fortunate, being close to the border,
to have had the presence of many notables including: banderilleros, picadors,
puntilleros, ganaderos, empresarios and of course, toreros and rejoneadors.
Many of these were from Spain, Portugal and South America as well as Mexico.
All of them have added to our knowledge and appreciation of La Fiesta Brava.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>We're proud of
our club, our members and what we have accomplished over a period of thirty-plus
years.</FONT></FONT></P>
