His first appearance with picadors was in Lerma, in the province of  Burgos, on September 8, 1983.  He appeared with S&aacute;nchez Marcos y Marcos Valverde, fighting Salustiano Galache novillos. In Madrid his first appearance as a novillero was July 3, 1985. He appeared with Pedro Lara y Rafael Camino, fighting novillos from  Mart&iacute;n Pe&ntilde;ato.

<P>José -- fighting the the Carlos N&uacute;&ntilde;ez bull, "Correvias" -- took his alternativa in M&aacute;laga, April 20, 1986.  His padrino was D&aacute;maso Gonz&aacute;lez, and Juan Mora was the "testigo." His alternativa was confirmed in a cartel including Curro Romero (his padrino) and Paco Ojeda (the testigo). José fought the Aldea nueva bull, "Cotidiano," and was the triunfador of the afternoon.

<P><IMG SRC="ARROYO01.GIF" tppabs="http://www.concentric.net/~sconrad2/ARROYO01.GIF" ALIGN=RIGHT> From there, José stepped into the mundo taurino, becoming one of the stellar figures of the day in Spanish bullfighting. In México he has fought with accomplishment, principally outside Mexico City.  He has only appeared twice in Plaza M&eacute;xico (prior to 1996), cutting an ear in his second appearance.

<P>José's alternativa was confirmed in México on November  10, 1991 with the Santiago bull, "Motorista." Mariano Ramos was his padrino, and Miguel Espinosa Armillita the testigo. Joselito had not been particularly successful in his appearances in Plaza M&eacute;xico, but on February 25, 1996, his fame increased with a tremendous faena that earned him both ears and the tail with the Santiago bull, "Valeroso." Many have high expectations for Joselito in the 1996-1997 Mexican temporada.
