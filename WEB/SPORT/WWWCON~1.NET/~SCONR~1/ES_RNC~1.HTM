<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>&quot;Why four?&quot;
you may be asking yourself.. Well, thanks to Mart&iacute;n Ru&iacute;z
G&aacute;rate, President of the association <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#68" tppabs="http://www.eltoro.org/">El
Toro de Madrid</A> (whose site may be visited for contact information on
these groups) here's the story:</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The &quot;Uni&oacute;n
de Criadores de Toros de Lidia&quot; was created at the beginning of this
century (it's the oldest of all the groups) with the intention of standing
up to the demands of the matadors who, at that time, had begun to refuse
to fight bulls from certain ganaderias (Miura bulls, for example). Because
of this, several ganaderos created the Union, structured so that if a matador
vetoed bulls from a Uni&oacute;n ganaderia, the rest of the ganaderos would
refuse to sell bulls for that matador to fight. In addition, the ganaderos
established a series of blood-line purity requirements in order &quot;keep
out&quot; the common livestock breeders. As time passed, the bullfighting
regulations established that only bulls from the Uni&oacute;n's ganaderias
could be fought in corridas and novilladas (with picadors).</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Later, the &quot;Associaci&oacute;n
Nacional de Ganader&iacute;as de Lidia&quot; was formed, whose bulls could
only be fought in becerradas and comic-bullfight events. This association
was made up of a large part of the breeders who were not able to gain admittance
into the Uni&oacute;n, and also of many new-breed ganaderos who, though
they bought their animals from the Uni&oacute;n ganaderias, could not belong
to it because their brands were not included in the original association.
When a ganadero that did not belong to the UCTL wanted to join the Uni&oacute;n,
he had to buy bulls from a Uni&oacute;n ganaderia, and later pass a test
of a number of novilladas (unsure how many were required) and one corrida
without a single bull receiving &quot;banderillas negras.&quot; With this
situation, it was obvious that the UCTL held an intolerable monopoly, and
the prices charged for their animals soared astronomically.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>When Spain entered
the European Economic Union, it became necessary to abolish those obsolete
regulations and monopolies. Now any ganaderia's bulls can be fought in
any kind of taurine event, although the UCTL continues to have (less and
less, however) an arrogant attitude. Every day there are more ganaderos
from other groups whose bulls are appearing in major corridas.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>Regarding the other
associations of ganaderos, one can say that they include the ganaderias
that for one reason or another can't belong to either of the first two
groups.</FONT></FONT></P>
