of<BR> Club Taurino of London</B></FONT></FONT></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The Club Taurino of London was founded by George Erik in 1959. We have grown into a loosely structured club of members who share a common interest in taurine matters There are currently about 200 members, whose command of Spanish varies from nil to native, but we mostly find it 
convenient to communicate in English with a smattering of technical words in Spanish.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>We have meetings at 8 pm on the second Thursday of the month. These meetings are organised around special events arranged by the members. They may be visits by special guests from the taurine world, discussions of specific themes, quizzes, or simply the showing of videos, and the 
opportunity to meet up with other members for a chat in a convivial atmosphere. Naturally enough, members also meet up at ferias in Spain, but this is all done on a very casual basis as a result of arrangements made by individual members. There are usually some CTL members at the important ferias in Spain.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>There is an Annual Dinner on the last Saturday of November. This is held 
in a London Spanish restaurant, and the Club invites celebrity guests 
from the taurine world. This year it was matador de toros Manuel 
Caballero; in 1995 it was the matador José Miguel Arroyo Joselito; and the previous year it was the senior President of the Madrid plaza de toros, Luis Espada Simon. In other recent years our guests have included 
the veteran photographer Cano, and the matador Luis Francisco Esplá. We have received visits from matadors, novilleros, ganaderos and taurine critics. The <B>CTL Trophies</B> for the best matador and novillero for the 
year, as elected by the membership, are announced at the Dinner.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Courier New"><FONT SIZE=-1>The most important features for most of our widespread membership are the occasional newsletter Sobresaliente and the bi-monthly magazine <B>La Divisa</B>. These publications are composed entirely from contributions by members, under the editorship of Edinburgh-based Jock Richardson. There are news items, personal reports of corridas, translations of foreign articles, illustrations, and original articles debating taurine themes. The very high quality of these publications is admired world-wide, and <B>La Divisa</B> is seen as the leading English language publication on the subject. [Webmaster's Note: Those are CTL's words -- I agree with them] The Club also has an extensive video library which supplies copies of VHS cassettes of taurine subjects for members.</FONT></FONT></P>
