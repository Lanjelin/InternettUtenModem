BULLFIGHTER</A> -- ?(19??) &quot;... takes the viewers on a wild and wooly
ride over the course of three years in the life and times of rodeo's unsung
heroes: the bullfighting clowns.&quot; Yes, we know that the &quot;bullfighting&quot;
rodeo clowns are not part of what a tauromaquian purists would consider
&quot;bullfighting.&quot; We're 'inclusionists' however -- our view of
the &quot;mundo&quot; taurino is quite broad. 60 minutes.</FONT></FONT></LI>

INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES</A>-- Videos designed for language-instruction
classrooms, focusing on the culture of the target country. Many videos
have bullfight sequences and relate bullfight history. Ordering information
is included at the bottom of the Babbit page. EL ARTE DE LA TAUROMAQUIA
- English Title - THE ART OF TAUROMACHY (The History of Bullfighting from
Remote Times to the Present). (Video Instructional Unit in Spanish and/or
English, 30 min., Advanced Level, 1996). Including &quot; the history of
bullfighting from early man to the present. We see bulls on the cave walls
of Altamira and Laxcaux. The symbolism of the bullfight is stressed (light
vs. dark) as well as the importance of the bull in the representation of
power and invincibility. The video traces the progression of the bullfight
from medieval times to the modern forms of today. Scenes are shown of the
famous &quot;Fiesta of San Ferm&iacute;n&quot; in Pamplona. The video ends
as we see the sequence of a modern bullfight and the significance of each
act or &quot;tercio.&quot; A must for the &quot;aficionado&quot; of the
bullfight.&quot; PAMPLONA / VIVA SAN FERMIN - English Title - FIESTA OF
SAN FERMIN (Video Instructional Unit in Spanish and/or English, 50 min.,
Intermediate/Advanced Level, 1995). This visual covers one of Spain's most
famous festivals - San Ferm&iacute;n - which takes place in July. We begin
with the &quot;chupinazo&quot; and follow the many parades and floats.
We can't miss the &quot;gigantes y cabezudos,&quot; the gracefully dancing
figures that everyone loves. We witness the exciting &quot;encierros&quot;
and follow up with the many activities held during the week - the &quot;corrida
vasca,&quot; the &quot;fiesta campera,&quot; the &quot;c&oacute;mico taurino,&quot;
and the &quot;aizkolaris&quot; or &quot;woodchoppers.&quot; The finale,
of course, in the bullfight every afternoon. There are two or three interludes
which give a brief background in history and we see some of the picturesque
towns of Navarra. SEMANA SANTA EN SEVILLA - English Title - HOLY WEEK IN
SEVILLE (Video Instructional Unit in Spanish and/or English, 16 min., Intermediate
Level, 1995). Including &quot; a short bullfight sequence in the Plaza
de la Maestranza.&quot; SEVILLA EN FERIA - English Title - APRIL FAIR IN
SEVILLE (Video Instructional Unit in Spanish and/or English, 16 min., Intermediate
Level, 1995). Including &quot; a bullfight at &quot;La Maestranza.&quot;
LOS MAYAS DE YUCATAN - English Title - THE MAYAS OF YUCATAN (Video Instructional
Unit in Spanish and/or English, 16 min., Intermediate Level, 1989). Including
&quot; a country bullfight not too unlike one described by John Stevens
in 1840.&quot; MEXICO / CIUDAD FASCINADORA - English Title - FASCINATING
MEXICO CITY (Video Instructional Unit in Spanish and/or English, 16 min.,
Intermediate Level, 1995). Including &quot; a bullfight at the &quot;Plaza
M&eacute;xico,&quot; the world's largest bullring.&quot; SALTILLO DE FIESTA
- English Title - FIESTA IN SALTILLO (Video Instructional Unit in Spanish
and/or English, 12 min., Elementary Level, 1995). Including &quot; one

EL TORO</A> (1966) 8 min.,16mm short subject, educational for spanish-language
classes. &quot;A way of life, and part of a given culture is portrayed
in this version of Munro Leaf's kindly satire on bullfighting. The Spanish
version is a smooth and easily paced narration, designed for the most effective
listening comprehension, enjoyment, and interest on the part of the foreign
language student.&quot; (&quot;kindly&quot; satire???)</FONT></FONT></LI>

and their love for this fiery Iberian horse. 80 min.&quot;</FONT></FONT></LI>
