<h3>Less activity in Glomma</h3><strong>
Lot of wind, and colder weather this week, and so less trips and less fish caught.<br>
But there are reports on good trout fishing on lures(wobblers).<br>

<h3>Season opening in Glomma !</h3>
And then we have started ! Glomma was partly icefree already in February,<br>
and trout were caught at the bottom on bait.<br>
Pike weighing 12 kg (26 pounds) were caught in Easter.<br>
Some rises since april, 1, especially early morning and late evening,<br>
but windy conditions have "destroyed" the fishing.<br>
Calm weather Thursday april 10, and then the fishing get on !<br>
Caught 10 grayling from 6 to 7.30 pm, all on a dry fly throwed towards<br>
rising fish. Biggest caught: only 485 gram (36 cm), but fish is fish !<br>
The biggest grayling had eaten: 2 large adult stoneflies, 2 big<br>
stoneflynymphs, about 100 small stoneflies(well known as the "Grindalsflua")<br>
about 40 midgepupas and two spiders! They were rising to midgepupas.<br>
Saw some stoneflies.<br>
<h3>Factfile 1997</h3></center><ul><ul><ul>

</ul></ul></ul><center><h3>The 1996 season in Glomma</h3>
The fishing started late dute to the cold winter.<br>
First day I found some free water was april, 5.  At april, 8. there were<br>
more open water and a good deal of insects, but the first flycaught fish<br>
I caught first may, 1. A grayling caught on hares ear Gold Head on a DI-6 line.<br>
The trout bit well throuh out the summer, and species were caught weighing<br>
3,7 and 3,6 kg (8 pounds) on lures, biggest reported on a dry fly: 2,8 kg!<br>
The catch of grayling however, was as in Rena, under normal.<br>
Nice pike-cathes with more species over 10 kg.<br>
The waterlevel was a bit hi during the summer/autumn, after that the<br>
hi level at spring didn't appear at all.<br>
Maximum meature inmay/june was only 1 meter above normal summer level!<br>
The insectslife was under normal, no big hatches was seen.<br>
This may result in a good 1997, so sharpen your hooks!<br><br>
I will thank you all who has contributed to my site with advices,<br>
questions and greetings. I will try to give even better information<br>
this year. May you all have a good fishing year!<br>

<h3>Overview of the season in Rena river</h3>
A year a bit under normal in Rena river. Less insects than normal,<br>
with less rises as the result. The water level has been very much back and forth<br>
due to regulation, this has to stop. The water temperature has since july<br>
been app. 2 degrees above normal, with max in august at 16 degrees Celsius.<br>
Cathes of trout has been near to normal, with one weighing 3.6 kg on a<br>
Rapala lure, and several on 1.5 kg on dryfly. My best: just 0.89 kg.<br>
Cathes of grayling has been under normal, the biggest one known weighing<br>
1170 gram. My biggest was 980 gram, but I lost a trophy(1.55 kg) near the net.<br>
Cathes of whitefish(gwyniad) has been well above normal with many fishes weighing<br>
1.2 kg or more.  The biggest at 1.9 kg. My best catch 1.5 kg.<br>
