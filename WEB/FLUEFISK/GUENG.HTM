<H3><a NAME="innled" </a>The GLOMMA-GUIDE, a book and interactive CD-ROM
fishing guide.</H3> 
OT. Ljostad, Elgveien 30, N-2400 Elverum, Norway.<BR>
<br>
	I am working on a fishing guide for the Glomma and the Rena River: The GLOMMA-
<BR>GUIDE. The guide covers the Glomma River north of Elverum (Elverum to the Aursunden 
<BR>Lake) and the Rena River (The Storsjø Lake to where the Rena River enters the Glomma 
<BR>River). Totally about 300 km of varied and interesting rivers, with good populations of trout, 
<BR>grayling, pike, white-fish, etc. The GLOMMA-GUIDE will be published as a book and as an 
<BR>interactive CD-ROM. Both the book and CD-ROM can be used separately, but I will strongly 
<BR>recommend both: You can take the book with you to the river, and looking at all the pictures 
<BR>and other information on the CD-ROM on your home computor. This will give you a deeper 
<BR>understanding about the rivers, making it easier for you to find your own «hot spots». If 
<BR>everything goes as planned, the book and the CD-ROM will be published in late 1996.
<BR><BR>
<H3><a NAME="bok"</a>The Book:</H3>
	The book will be published in a format suitable for use at the river. The GLOMMA-GUIDE 
<BR>consist of two parts, introduction (in English and Norwegian) and many VERY detailed maps. 
<BR>On the maps you will find information like:
<BR>
<UL><LI>	Water velocity.
	<LI>Where it is possible to wade.
	<LI>Where you will find the deepest pools and water depth at other parts of the river.
	<LI>Dangerous parts of the river. This is valuable information for canoeists.
	<LI>Potentially good fishing areas like pools, riffles, etc.
	<LI>Where it is possible to find larvae of a tiny stone fly, the Grindalsflue, used for<BR> 
		   the very popular ice-fishing in April.
	<LI>Access to the river.
	<LI>Where it is possible to launch a boat.
	<LI>Where you can hire a boat or a fishing guide.
	<LI>Where you can buy a fishing license.
	<LI>Fishing regulations.
	<LI>Hotels/motels/cabins for hire.
	<LI>Cultural and natural points of interest.
	<LI>Post offices/grocery stores/gas stations.
	<LI>Maps of the biggest cities: Elverum, Rena, Tynset and Røros.
</UL><BR><BR>
	This will be a fishing guide for ALL kinds of sport-fishing - lure, worm, fly and ice-
<BR>fishing. A good fishing area varies wether you are fishing with a spoon or a dry fly, and at what 
<BR>time of the year you are fishing. Therefore you will not find X on the maps indicating the «hot 
<BR>spots».

<BR>	In the written introduction you will find:

<BR><UL><LI>	Practical information for you as a foreigner.
	<LI>Information about fishing in the area from January to December. Lures, worm, <BR>
		   fly and ice-fishing.
	<LI>Insects and other fish food.
	<LI>The fish species living in the area.
	<LI>What is a «hot spot» for you as a sport fisher.
</UL><BR>
	There will be few pictures in the book. All the pictures will be on the CD-ROM.
<H3><a NAME="cdrom"</a>CD-ROM:</H3>

	The reason for the GLOMMA-GUIDE to be published as a CD-ROM is that this is the 
<BR>only practical way to «print» maybe as many as 1 000 pictures. No other fishing guide in the 
<BR>world gives so much practical, useful river-information as the GLOMMA-GUIDE. The CD-
<BR>ROM will help you to plan your trip on beforehand. The information on the CD-ROM will be 
<BR>given in German, English, Norwegian or Swedish. 

<BR>	In addition to all the information given in the book, you will also find:
<BR><UL>
	<LI>500 very detailed aerial photographs. Many of the pictures are so detailed that it <BR>
		   is possible to see small stones on the river bottom!
	<LI>Pictures taken from the shore for each 2,5 - 3 km of river.
	<LI>Pictures of all the natural and cultural points of interest in the area.
	<LI>Pictures of all hotels/motels/cabins for hire.</UL>

<BR>	Please contact me if you have some views of the contents of this guide. What kind of 
<BR>information would YOU like to find in a fishing guide of a Norwegian river?

<BR>	You can also contact me if you want to be informed when the GLOMMA-GUIDE are 
<BR>published.
