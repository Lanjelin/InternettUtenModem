This fly comes from Arve Tangen.  His absolutely favorite.<br>
<br>
Tying/Materials:
</center>
<ul>
<li><b>Hook:</b>Streamer hook with 2-3 X length. size # 4-10
<li><b>Tread:</b>Brownolive flymaster 6/0
<li><b>Eyes:</b>Silver beadchain size small.  Anchor with turns of eight.  Put some cement on to make the fly last longer and the eyes to stay.
<li><b>Tale:</b>none
<li><b>Rib:</b>Larva Lace clear. Ty in just behind the eyes. Make the larva lace stay on top of the hook. This makes the fly thicker.
<li><b>Body:</b>Flat silvertinsel in suitable size.  Start behind the eyes and turn it egal towards the hookbend and back. Ty in behind the eyes.  Then turn the Larva Lace egally and with strength, over the body.
<li><b>Wings:</b>Two feathers from the grizzly hen's ass section, coloured tan.  Use 2 similar feathers too make the fly function properly.  Put the feathers in water too ease of use.  Ty in behind the eyes.
<li><b>Sides:</b>Two similar feathers from the same hen tyed in on each side of the fly.  These should have the same length as the body.
<li><b>Topwing:</b>Another feather from the hen on the top of the fly. The same  length as the sides.  This feather imitates the backfin.
<li><b>Head:</b>Naturel squirrel spun with dubbing twister. Put cement where the head is to be build, and turn the dubbing behind, between and in front of the eyes.  Comb the head with a downclipped toothbrush.
</ul>

This fly also comes from fra Arve Tangen. A killer with wiggle movement.<br>
The fly imitates the nymph of Ephemera vulgata.<br>
<br>
Tying/Materials:
</center>
<ul>
<li><b>Hook:</b>Behind: short hook. Ex: Mustad 94841 # 14.
<li><b>Hook:</b>In front: some longer hook. Ex: Partridge K12ST # 12.
<li><b>Tread:</b>Brownolive.
<li><b>Tale:</b>Three ostrichherl fibers, ty aspread.
<li><b>Rib:</b>Loop of tyingtread to segment the body.
<li><b>Body behind:</b>Grizzly Marabou hen, coloured tan.  This is the same feather as for the sculpin.  Hold the feather in the ticker part, that is by the root.  Put the feather along the hook, the ticker part at the hookbend.  Turn 2-3 times with the tread, and pull the feather backwards so it nearly looses it grip.  Stop pulling and tighten with the tread.  Start dubbing the hook with the feather and after a few turns, start spinning the feather as well.  This will build more body towards the hookeye. Ty in and cut the excess. Spinn the loop and come forward in wide turns. Ty in an ostrich-herl coloured dark grey, and make a few turns just behind the hook eye.  Now cut the hook at the hookbend.  There shall be no point on this hook.  This part of the fly is now finished.
<li><b>Body front fly:</b>Pull a monofilament (Ex: 0,25 mm) trough the eye on the hook behind and ty it in at the hookbend of the forward hook.  Put the monofilament alongside the forward body, turm over with tying tread.  Place the butts of the monofilament towards the hookbend again and make som turns with the tread.  This is to prevent it from gliding.  Ty in a grizzly maraboufeather at the top of the nymph, ty in another under the nymph.  Both of them tyed in flat. Ty in a wide section of dark brown turkey (ca. 8 fibres).  Ty in two more sections (2-3 fibres) on each side of the first one.  This will be the thorax.  Make a loop of hte tyingtread.  Pull a paperholder through squirrel-fur.  See to that not too much fur is chosen.  Clip off and put it in the loop.  Spin the loop with a dubbingtwister.  This dubbingbrush of squirrel is tyed on the hook.  Let there be space for the head.
Turn the turkey over and ty in.  Cut off some squirrelhair under the fly.  The rest of the hair will imitate the legs.
<li><b>Head:</b>A black ostrich herl is tyed in together with the tread to make it stronger.  Cut of the excess and the fly is finshed !
</ul>

This is my own favorite.  Variations may be tyed to imitate other insects.<br>
<br>
Tying/Materials:
</center>
<ul>
<li><b>Hook:</b>Partridge K12ST. Ex. # 10.
<li><b>Tread:</b>Brownolive.
<li><b>Tale:</b>Some fibers naturel fox or squirrel. May be dropped to imitate sedge-pupae.
<li><b>Body:</b>Dubbing of hare's ear, naturel fox, oppossum etc. Tyed in dubbing loop as instructed above (see Wiggle nymph forward body).
<li><b>Head:</b>Goldbead in suitable size.  Put it on the hook from the point.  It shall pass around the hookbend, but not over the eye.  Doesn't this work, change hook or change bead.  Ty in the tread behind the bead and turn it towards the hookbend while tying in the tale.  Make the dubbingloop and ty the body towards the bead. Finish with whip finish.  Put cement on the bead to make it stay nice longer.
