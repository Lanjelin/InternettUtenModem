<h3><a name="Maxims">Assorted Opinions and Maxims</a></h3>
<hr><p>
<em>The most dangerous party member.</em>-- In every party there is one who through his all too credulous avowal of the party's 
principles incites the others to apostasy.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.298, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Not suitable as a party member.</em>-- Whoever thinks much is not suitable as a party member: he soon thinks himself right out
of the party.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.579, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>The most dangerous follower.</em>-- The most dangerous follower is he whose defection would destroy the whole party: that is
to say, the best follower.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Wanderer and his Shadow</cite>,s. 290, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Hundred-year quarantine.</em>-- Democratic institutions are quarantine arrangements to combat that ancient pestilence, lust for
tyranny: as such they are very useful and very boring.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Wanderer and his Shadow</cite>,s. 289, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Not too deep.</em>-- People who comprehend a thing to its very depths rarely stay faithful to it forever. For they have brought
its depths into the light of day: and in the depths there is always much that is unpleasant to see.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.489, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Punishment.</em>-- A strange thing, our kind of punishment! It does not cleanse the offender, it is no <em>ex</em>piation: on the
contrary, it defiles more than the offense itself. 
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Daybreak</cite>,s. 236, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
