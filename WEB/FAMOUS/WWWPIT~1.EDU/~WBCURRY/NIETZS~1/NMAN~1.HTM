<h3><a name="Man">Man</a></h3>
<hr><p>
<em>Family failing of philosophers.</em> -- All philosophers have the common failing of starting out from man as he is now and
thinking they can reach their goal through an analysis of him.  They involuntarily think of 'man' as an <em>aeterna veritas,</em>
as something that remains constant in the midst of all flux, as a sure measure of things.  Everything the philosopher has declared 
about man is, however, at bottom no more than a testimony as to the man of a <em>very limited</em> period of time. Lack of historical
sense is the family failing of all philosophers.

<em>Truth as Circe.</em>-- Error has transformed animals into men; is truth perhaps capable of changing man back into an animal?
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.519, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>In the stream.</em>-- Mighty waters draw much stone and rubble along with them; mighty spirits many stupid and bewildered heads.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.541, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>When asses are needed.</em>-- You will never get the crowd to cry Hosanna until you ride into town on an ass.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Assorted Opinions and Maxims</cite>,s. 313, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Anti-theses.</em>-- The most senile thing ever thought about man is contained in the celebrated saying 'the ego is always
hateful'; the most childish is the even more celebrated 'love thy neighbor as thyself'. -- In the former, knowledge of human nature 
has ceased, in the latter it has not yet even begun.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Assorted Opinions and Maxims</cite>,s. 385, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Not enough!</em>-- It is not enough to prove something, one also has to seduce or elevate people to it. That is why the man of
knowledge should learns how to <em>speak</em> his wisdom: and often in such a way that it <em>sounds</em> like folly!
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Daybreak</cite>, s. 330, R.J. Hollingdale transl
<hr><p>
<em>Gardener and garden.</em>-- Out of damp and gloomy days, out of solitude, out of loveless words directed at us, 
<em>conclusions</em> grow up in us like fungus: one morning they are there, we know not how, and they gaze upon us, morose and gray.
Woe to the thinker who is not the gardener but only the soil of the plants that grow in him!
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Daybreak</cite>, s. 382, R.J. Hollingdale transl
<hr><p>
<em>The vain.</em>-- We are like shop windows in which we are continually arranging, concealing or illuminating the supposed qualities
other ascribe to us - in order to deceive <em>ourselves</em>.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Daybreak</cite>, s. 385, R.J. Hollingdale transl
<hr><p>
It is not <em>things</em>, but opinions <em>about things that have absolutely no existence</em>, which have so deranged mankind!
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Daybreak</cite>, s. 563, R.J. Hollingdale transl
<hr><p>
The men of corruption are witty and slanderous; they know of types of murder that require neither daggers nor assault; they know that
whatever is <em>said well</em> is believed.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Gay Science</cite>, s. 23, Walter Kaufmann transl
<hr><p>
<em>Will and willingness.</em>-- Someone took a youth to a sage and said: "Look, he is being corrupted by women." The sage shook his 
head and smiled. "It is men," said he, "that corrupt women; and all the failings of women should be atoned by and improved in men. For
it is man who creates for himself the image of woman, and woman forms herself according to this image."<br>
"You are too kind-hearted about women," said one of those present; "you do not know them." The sage replied: "Will is the manner 
of men; willingness that of women. That is the law of the sexes - truly, a hard law for women. All of humanity is innocent of its 
existence; but women are doubly innocent. Who could have oil and kindness enough for them?"<br>
"Damn oil! Damn kindness!" someone shouted out of the crowd; "Women need to be educated better!" - "Men need to be educated better,"
said the sage and beckoned to the youth to follow him. - The youth, however, did not follow him.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Gay Science</cite>, s. 68, Walter Kaufmann transl.
<hr><p>
The greatest danger that always hovered over humanity and still hovers over it is the eruption of madness - which means the eruption
of arbitrariness in feeling, seeing and hearing, the enjoyment of the mind's lack of discipline, the joy in human unreason. Not truth
and certainty are the opposite of the world of the madman, but the universality and the universal binding force of a faith; in sum,
the non-arbitrary character of judgements... Thus the virtuous intellects are needed - oh, let me use the most unambiguous word - what 
is needed is <em>virtuous stupidity</em>, stolid metronomes for the slow spirit, to make sure that the faithful of the great shared
faith stay together and continue their dance... <em>We others are the exception and the danger</em> - and we need eternally to be 
opposed. - Well, there actually are things to be said in favor of the exception, <em>provided that it never wants to become the rule.</em>
