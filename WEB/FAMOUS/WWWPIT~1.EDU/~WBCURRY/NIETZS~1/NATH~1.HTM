<h3><a name="Atheism">Atheism</a></h3>
<hr><p>
"God", "immortality of the soul", "redemption", "beyond" -- Without exception, concepts to which I have never devoted any attention, 
or time; not even as a child.  Perhaps I have never been childlike enough for them?<br>
I do not by any means know atheism as a result; even less as an event: It is a matter of course with me, from instinct. I am too 
inquisitive, too <em>questionable,</em> too exuberant to stand for any gross answer.  God is a gross answer, an indelicacy against 
us thinkers - at bottom merely a gross prohibition for us: you shall not think!

What distinguishes us [scientists] from the pious and the believers is not the quality but the quantity of belief and piety; we
are contented with less. But if the former should challenge us: then be contented and appear to be contented! - then we might
easily reply: 'We are, indeed, not among the least contented. You, however, if your belief makes you blessed then appear to be
blessed! Your faces have always been more injurious to your belief than our objections have! If these glad tidings of your Bible
were written on your faces, you would not need to insist so obstinately on the authority of that book... As things are, however, 
all your apologies for Christianity have their roots in your lack of Christianity; with your defence plea you inscribe your own 
bill of indictment.

<em>Historical refutation as the definitive refutation.</em>-- In former times, one sought to prove that there is no God - today
one indicates how the belief that there is a God <em>arose</em> and how this belief acquired its weight and importance: a counter-proof
that there is no God thereby becomes superfluous.- When in former times one had refuted the 'proofs of the existence of God' put
forward, there always remained the doubt whether better proofs might not be adduced than those just refuted: in those days atheists
did not know how to make a clean sweep.
