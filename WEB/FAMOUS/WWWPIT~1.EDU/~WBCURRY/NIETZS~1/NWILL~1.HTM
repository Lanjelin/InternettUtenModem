<h3><a name="Will">Will to Power</a></h3>
<hr><p>
In order to sustain the theory of a mechanistic world, therefore, we
always have to stipulate to what extent we are employing two fictions: the
concept of <em>motion</em> (taken from our sense language) and the concept
of the <em>atom</em> (=unity, deriving from our psychical "experience"):
the mechanistic theory presupposes a sense prejudice and a psychological
prejudice...<br>
The mechanistic world is imagined only as sight and touch imagine a world
(as "moved") --so as to be calculable-- thus causal unities are invented,
"things" (atoms) whose effect remains constant (--transference of the
false concept of subject to the concept of the atom)...<br>
If we eliminate these additions, no things remain but only dynamic quanta,
in a relation of tension to all other dynamic quanta: their essence lies
in their relation to all other quanta, in their "effect" upon the same.
The will to power is not a being, not a becoming, but a <em>pathos</em>
--the most elemental fact from which a becoming and effecting first emerge--

My idea is that every specific body strives to become master over all
space and to extend its force (--its will to power:) and to thrust back
all that resists its extension. But it continually encounters similar
efforts on the part of other bodies and ends by coming to an arrangement
("union") with those of them that are sufficiently related to it: thus
they then conspire together for power. And the process goes on--

[Anything which] is a living and not a dying body... will have to be an incarnate will to power, it will strive to grow, spread, 
seize, become predominant - not from any morality or immorality but because it is <em>living</em> and because life simply <em>is</em> 
will to power... 'Exploitation'... belongs to the <em>essence</em> of what lives, as a basic organic function; it is a consequence 
of the will to power, which is after all the will to life.
