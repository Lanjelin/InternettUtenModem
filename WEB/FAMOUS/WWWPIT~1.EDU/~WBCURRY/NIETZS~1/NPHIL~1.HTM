<h3><a name="Phil">Philosophy and Metaphysics</a></h3>
<hr><p>
How I understand the philosopher -- as a terrible explosive, endangering everthing... my concept of the philosopher is worlds removed from any concept that would include even a Kant, not to speak of academic "ruminants" and other professors of philosophy...
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Ecce Homo,</cite> s 3.2.3, Walter Kaufmann transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Knapsack of the Metaphysicians.</em>-- Those who boast so mightily of the scientificality of their metaphysics should receive
no answer; it is enough to pluck at the bundle which, with a certain degree of embarrassment, they keep concealed behind their
back; if one succeeds in opening it, the products of that scientificality come to light, attended by their blushes: a dear little
Lord God, a nice little immortality, perhaps a certain quantity of spiritualism, and in any event a whole tangled heap of 'wretched
poor sinner' and Pharisee arrogance.

<hr><p>
Even today many educated people think that the victory of Christianity over Greek philosophy is a proof of the superior truth of 
the former - although in this case it was only the coarser and more violent that conquered the more spiritual and delicate.  So 
far as superior truth is concerned, it is enough to observe that the awakening sciences have allied themselves point by point 
with the philosophy of Epicurus, but point by point rejected Christianity.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.68, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Socrates.</em>-- If all goes well, the time will come when one will take up the memorabilia of Socrates rather than the
Bible as a guide to morals and reason... The pathways of the most various philosophical modes of life lead back to him... 
Socrates excels the founder of Christianity in being able to be serious cheerfully and in possessing that <em>wisdom full
of roguishness</em> that constitutes the finest state of the human soul. And he also possessed the finer intellect.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Wanderer and his Shadow</cite>,s. 86, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
