<h3><a name="Truth">Truth and Knowledge</a></h3>
<hr><p>
There are no facts, only interpretations.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Nachlass,</cite> A. Danto translation.
<hr><p>
<em>Enemies of truth.</em>-- Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.483, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Linguistic danger to spiritual freedom.</em>-- Every word is a prejudice.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Wanderer and his Shadow</cite>,s. 55, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Man and things.</em>-- Why does man not see things? He is himself standing in the way: he conceals things.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Daybreak</cite>, s. 483, R.J. Hollingdale transl
<hr><p>
<em>Just beyond experience!</em>-- Even great spirits have only their five fingers breadth of <em>experience</em> - just beyond
it their thinking ceases and their endless empty space and stupidity begins.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Daybreak</cite>, s. 564, R.J. Hollingdale transl
<hr><p>
What then is truth?  A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms -- in short, a sum of human relations, which 
have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, 
and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that is what they are; metaphors which are 
worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins.<br>
We still do not know where the urge for truth comes from; for as yet we have heard only of the obligation imposed by society 
that it should exist: to be truthful means using the customary metaphors - in moral terms, the obligation to lie according to 
fixed convention, to lie herd-like in a style obligatory for all...

<hr><p>
Because we have for millenia made moral, aesthetic, religious demands on the world, looked upon it with blind desire, passion 
or fear, and abandoned ourselves to the bad habits of illogical thinking, this world has gradually <em>become</em> so marvelously 
variegated, frightful, meaningful, soulful, it has acquired color - but we have been the colorists: it is the human intellect 
that has made appearances appear and transported its erroneous basic conceptions into things.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.16, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live - by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, 
form and content; without these articles of faith nobody could now endure life.  But that does not prove them.  Life is no argument.
The conditions of life might include error.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Gay Science,</cite> s.121, Walter Kaufmann transl..
<hr><p>
The reasons for which 'this' world has been characterized as 'apparent'
are the very reasons which indicate its reality; any other kind of reality
is absolutely indemonstrable.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Twilight of the Idols</cite>,
ch.3, s.6, Walter Kaufmann transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Metaphysical world.</em>-- It is true, there could be a metaphysical
world; the absolute possibility of it is hardly to be disputed. We behold
all things through the human head and cannot cut off this head; while the
question nonetheless remains what of the world would still be there if one
had cut it off.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, All Too Human</cite>, s.9,
R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
<em>Truth.</em>-- No one now dies of fatal truths: there are too many antidotes to them.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>Human, all too Human,</cite> s.516, R.J. Hollingdale transl.
<hr><p>
What are man's truths ultimately?  Merely his <em>irrefutable</em> errors.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Gay Science,</cite> s.265, Walter Kaufmann transl.
<hr><p>
To renounce belief in one's ego, to deny one's own "reality" -- what a triumph! not merely over the senses, over appearance, but a much higher kind of triumph, a violation and cruelty against <em>reason</em> -- a voluptuous pleasure that reaches its height when the ascetic self-contempt and self-mockery of reason declares: "<em>there is</em> a realm of truth and being, but reason is <em>excluded</em> from it!"<br>
But precisely because we seek knowledge, let us not be ungrateful to such resolute reversals of accustomed perspectives and valuations with which the spirit has, with apparent mischievousness and futility, raged against itself for so long: to see differently in this way for once, to <em>want</em> to see differently, is no small discipline and preparation for its future "objectivity" -- the latter understood not as "contemplation without interest" (which is a nonsensical absurdity), but as the ability <em>to control</em> one's Pro and Con and to dispose of them, so that one knows how to employ a <em>variety</em> of perspectives and affective interpretations in the service of knowledge.<br>
Henceforth, my dear philosophers, let us be on guard against the dangerous old conceptual fiction that posited a "pure, will-less, painless, timeless knowing subject"; let us guard against the snares of such contradictory concepts as "pure reason," absolute spirituality," "knowledge in itself": these always demand that we should think of an eye that is completely unthinkable, an eye turned in no particular direction, in which the active and interpreting forces, through which alone seeing becomes seeing <em>something</em>, are supposed to be lacking; these always demand of the eye an absurdity and a nonsense.  There is <em>only</em> a perspective seeing, <em>only</em> a perspective "knowing"; and the <em>more</em> affects we allow to speak about one thing, the <em>more</em> eyes, different eyes, we can use to observe one thing, the more complete will our "concept" of this thing, our "objectivity," be. But to eliminate the will altogether, to suspend each and every affect, supposing we were capable of this -- what would that mean but to <em>castrate</em> the intellect?
