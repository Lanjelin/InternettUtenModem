<h3><a name="Recurrence">Eternal Recurrence</a></h3>
<hr><p>
<em>Remorse.</em>-- Never yield to remorse, but at once tell yourself: remorse would simply mean adding to the first act of stupidity a 
second.
<p align="right">from Nietzsche's <cite>The Wanderer and his Shadow</cite>,s. 323, R.J. Hollingdale transl.

The metaphysical comfort--with which, I am suggesting even
now, every true tragedy leaves us--that life is at the
bottom of things, despite all the changes of appearances,
indestructibly powerful and pleasurable--this comfort
appears in incarnate clarity in the chorus of the satyrs, a
chorus of natural beings who live ineradicably, as it were,
behind all civilization and remain eternally the same,
despite the changes of generations and of the history of
nations.

<em>The greatest weight.</em>-- What, if some day or night a demon were to
steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: "This life
as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and
innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every
pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably
small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same
succession and sequence - even this spider and this moonlight between the
trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of
existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of
dust!"<br>
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon
who spoke thus?... Or how well disposed would you have to become to
yourself and to life <em>to crave nothing more fervently</em> than this
ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?

<em>Plan for an unfinished book: The Eternal Recurrence</em>
<p>
My philosophy brings the triumphant idea of which all other modes of
thought will ultimately perish. It is the great cultivating idea: the
races that cannot bear it stand condemned; those who find it the greatest
benefit are chosen to rule...
<p>
I want to teach the idea that gives many the right to erase themselves -
the great <em>cultivating</em> idea...
<p>
Everything becomes and recurs eternally - escape is impossible! -
Supposing we <em>could</em> judge value, what follows? The idea of
recurrence as a <em>selective</em> principle, in the service of strength
(and barbarism!!)...
<p>
To <em>endure</em> the idea of the recurrence one needs: freedom from
morality; new means against the fact of <em>pain</em> ( pain conceived as
a tool, as the father of pleasure...); the enjoyment of all kinds of
uncertainty, experimentalism, as a counterweight to this extreme fatalism;
abolition of the concept of necessity; abolition of the "will"; abolition
of "knowledge-in-itself."
<p>
Greatest elevation of the consciousness of strength in man, as he creates
the overman.

1053,1056,1058,1060, Walter Kaufmann transl.
