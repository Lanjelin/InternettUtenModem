Let me get this straight. These aliens, representatives of a civilization
whose wisdom and technology is far beyond our own, cross the vastness of 
interstellar space to kidnap and rape loony 300 pound waitresses, to spin
through fields of crops leaving neat patterns, and to slice various body
parts off of steers. 

Oh yeah, I believe that.

We may never know very much about these aliens, but one thing is for sure:
Their home planet must be a *very* boring place.
