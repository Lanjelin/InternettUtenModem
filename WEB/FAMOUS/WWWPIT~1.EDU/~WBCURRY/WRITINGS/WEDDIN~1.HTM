<em>
My friends Rob and Annie just got married last November. They opted for a "modern" ceremony instead of the good, old-fashioned
one that I suggested here. Hmmph!
</em>
<p>
The forlorn cry of a wolf echoes across mist-shrouded fens. By the
light of a full moon you see in the distance the cyclopean bulk
of a gigantic stone cathedral, its ramparts slashing through the
fog and towering as if to touch the vault of the heavens. Drawing
near you see the exquisitely hewn blocks of marble that form its
walls, while high above are the grotesque caricatures of the
gargoyles: frozen in stone, seeming to leer and gibber their
demoniac blasphemies into the moaning wind swirling down from the
towers. You enter the dimly lit nave. The flickering candlelight
reveals hundreds of ancient oaken pews flanked by yellowed
tapestries and stained glass depicting the deeds of the
christian martyrs and saints. The hall resounds with the
ethereal harmonies of a centuries old pipe organ and the air
is filled with the sweet fragrance of incense and the waxen
foetor of hundreds of burning candles. The wizened crone at
the organ starts to play the wedding march. The wedding is
about to begin!
<p>
Now that would be a cool wedding!  
(Oh, yeah. There would also have to be a hunchback swinging from
rafter to rafter and calling out "Sanctuary, Sanctuary" during the
ceremony. Then it would be really cool!)
