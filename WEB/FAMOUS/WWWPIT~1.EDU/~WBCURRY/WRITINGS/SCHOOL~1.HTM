God damn, boy. Why don't you pull your head out of your ass, wipe the
shit from your eyes, and read a history book: The days when there was
prayer in the schools were *hellish* times for racial minorities. Or is
that what you meant by a "cure": Making sure that these minorities know 
their place in a white christian society, just like in the good old days?
