Wrong.

Deuteronomy 24:16
"The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
every man shall be put to death for his own sin." 

So spake the LORD unto Moses.

his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
his works. 
Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
in his kingdom."

The last of Jesus' disciples "tasted of death" over 1900 years ago. I 
wonder what could possibly be delaying him? I suppose the fact that he 
*does not exist* could be something of a hindrance, don't you think?

Jesus is a lie, a mere myth. He is the invention of the "apostle" Paul,
who based him upon a jewish teacher ( let's call him Yeshua to avoid
confusion). Yeshua was a jew, not a christian. His teachings were for the
Jews. He may or may not have claimed to be "Messiah" but he probably would
have found contemptible and blasphemous the notion that he was the "Son of
God." But then again, Paul would have had to turn him into a god, because
otherwise he would garner no converts: no self-respecting pagan would
accept the teachings of a mere (dead) man when there were so many savior
gods to choose from. And so Jesus was born, and he has spread like a
plague through the minds of billions of people, and it is only in these
minds that he has ever existed. If Yeshua had had the misfortune to be
resurrected a few centuries after his death, and if he attempted to tell
the truth about Jesus, the loving church fathers would have condemned him
as a heretic and shoved a red hot poker up his ass. Mercifully, he died
never having met a christian.
