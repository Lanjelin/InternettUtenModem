This is pure Creationist obscurantist bullshit. Entropy can decrease
locally at the expense of a correspondingly greater entropy increase
elsewhere.  This is *not* an "anomaly"; this is exactly what happens here
on Earth. Each day the Earth absorbs energy from the Sun and radiates the
same amount of energy back into space. However, because the surface
temperature of the Sun is ~5800K while that of the Earth is only ~300K,
the entropy absorbed is much smaller than the entropy radiated away (check
out _Physics of Climate_, by Peixoto and Oort, for entropy balance
calculations).  Thus, the Earth loses a vast quantity of entropy each day,
so there is no conflict between the 2nd law and evolution.
