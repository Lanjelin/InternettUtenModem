What you should do is go and rent the movie "Conan the Barbarian" and
memorize the part where Conan is describing his god to his pal. I think
it goes something like:

   "My god is Crom. When I die I will be summoned before him and if
    I cannot answer the riddle of steel he will laugh at me and throw 
    me out of Valhalla. That is Crom, strong in his mountain."

when anyone asks you what your religion is, just rattle off those
lines in your best austrian accent.
