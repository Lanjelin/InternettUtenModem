All the important characters in the bible happily indulged in incest.  
Abraham was married to his half sister Sarah.  Ol' Abe must have liked it 
a lot, because he made his servant (Eliezar?) swear on his 'nads that he 
(the servant) would find a wife for Abe's son Isaac from among Abe's 
relatives.  The servant found a cousin, Rebecca, for Isaac to marry.  
Isaac's son Jacob married two of his cousins, Leah and Rachel. Lot's daughters
got their Father drunk and had their way with him (without his knowledge 
8^}).  On this family "tree", the branches curve back and rejoin!
