Let's use your methods to calculate the probability that hydrogen and 
oxygen will combine into water.

Desired product: HOH

Possible products: HHH,HHO,HOH,HOO,OHO,OOO

Probability of occurrence: 1/6

So only 1/6 of the product should be water. But this is only considering 
all the 3 atom molecules. There are 1,2,4,5,... atom molecules too, so 
the probability that water is formed is much less than 1/6.  Yet, when 
hydrogen and oxygen react at standard temperature and pressure, water is 
by far the most abundant product. This can only mean one thing: GOD 
HIMSELF MUST HAVE PUT TOGETHER EACH WATER MOLECULE!!! Hallelujah! Open up 
the taps and look at the MIRACULOUS POWER of the LORD!
