Why should all of reality have to conform to that very limited slice of
reality that "we see every day". There are two problems with your view:
First, it is prejudiced in the sense that you expect the universe at
all scales, both very large and very small, to work the same as at
the human scale. Second, you appear to be arguing from ignorance:
Because you cannot understand how quantum mechanics "fits" in with
the macroscopic world, you reject it.

Physicists have been complaining about quantum mechanics for almost 
seventy years. So what?

You overlook the very nasty consequences of keeping causality at the
quantum level, especially non-locality.

Your prejudice is showing again.

I look forward to my advisor getting his grants renewed. It will keep
me off the streets, and who knows, we may discover a thing or two. ;^}
