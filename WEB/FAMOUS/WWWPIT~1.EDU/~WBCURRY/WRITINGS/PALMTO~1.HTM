My geeky friend Scott has an HP-100 palmtop PC. He carries it around with him everywhere. He's very fond of it; perhaps too fond. 
That's why I had to quote some holy scripture to him:
</em>
<p>
I am concerned about your unnatural affections toward your palmtop,
brother Scott. I think that serious study of these bible verses might help
to set you on the proper path.
<p>
<P>
The Book of Palmtops, chapter 19, verses 1 to 3:
<blockquote>
"  And the LORD did look upon Pittsburgh, and he did see that the inhabitants
therein did commit great abominations in the sight of the LORD.
<p>
   For among them was a man who would lieth with his HP palmtop as with a
woman. And the LORD resolved to destroy the city and all the inhabitants
therein.
<p>
   Then the LORD rained upon Pittsburgh brimstone and fire from the LORD
out of heaven; And he smote them a very great slaughter, and overthrew the
city, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the city, and that
which grew upon the ground."
</blockquote>
<p>
Amen!
