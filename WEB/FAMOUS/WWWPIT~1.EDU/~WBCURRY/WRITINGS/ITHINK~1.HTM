This has to be the most ludicrous misapprehension of the way that science
is done that I have ever heard. Is it your contention that all that a
scientist knows about reality was acquired by the reading of scientific
texts? Do you believe that scientists regard these texts as revealed
truth, not to be questioned or contradicted? Haven't you ever heard of the
notion that theories are to be checked for inconsistencies and tested by
experiment and, if they are found wanting, are to be discarded? Do you
have any idea of the vast amount of experimental data which comfirms the
predictions made by our foundational theories of electrodynamics, quantum
mechanics, and statistical mechanics? Don't you know that an advanced lab
course is a requirement at most universities, meaning that most scientists
have *personally* tested predictions of these theories and confirmed them
for themselves? Sorry to disappoint you, Lawnmower Man, but the
foundations of science are strong and secure after all.
