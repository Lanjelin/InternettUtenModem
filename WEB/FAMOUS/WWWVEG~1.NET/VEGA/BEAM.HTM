Hi Everyone,
<p>
I asked Gordon, who initially posted the bit on Suzanne, for more info on the
article. He graciously typed up the entire piece, which I forward to you.
 Thanks, Gordon!  Incidentally, the author's email address appears at the
bottom of his article should any of you wish to contact him.  
<p>
On the positive front, the website got another national plug... Welcome, Bob
T. and all other new 'lurkers'!

By Alex Beam
<p>
We in the glamorous media business have mixed feelings about the men,
women and, yes, children who write in to express their views. On the one
hand, it is always pleasant to discover tangible evidence of readership
behind the putative circulation statistics. On the other hand, we can't
help wondering: 1. Why do they bother? 2. Gee, I wish I had that kind of
time on my hands.
<p>
Ironically, it is the people who don't have much time on their hands who
often prove to be graphomaniacs. For example, look what Judge Lance Ito
does in his spare time: He scrawled a note to Entertainment Weekly saying
he was ``delighted to see Helen Mirren is getting the recognition her
talents command.'' Thank you for sharing, Lance.
<p>
When not finger-wagging from the bench like Larry King, Ito has also found
time to scribble a note to Money magazine, quibbling over a factoid, and
has even written a groveling missive to my friend Jeff Danziger, the
Christian Science Monitor cartoonist. The judge tried to wheedle the
original artwork for a cartoon that caught his fancy. Danziger, easily
flattered, complied.
<p>
And what about Suzanne Vega? Here's someone with a demanding concert
schedule and a knife-edged keyboard that she brandishes quite freely. To
Spin magazine: ``I was never a (expletive) waitress, you guys. You should
check before you make a headline out of it.''
<p>
If you check the ``Correspondence'' file at the Suzanne Vega web site
(www.vega.net/vega/) you will see that the scribbling songbird is anything
but a virtual presence. ``I caught the measles earlier this year and
thought of posting this news to get sympathy,'' she recently wrote. ``One
day I will write an autobiography. I promise,'' she informed her webmates.
<p>
On a more elevated plane, it is hard to avoid the writings of Alfred Kahn,
the man famous for deregulating the airline industry under Jimmy Carter.
Kahn, a professor emeritus of political economy at Cornell, just can't stop
professing - February 1995 letter to The New York Times:  ``How to Keep
PBS''; July 1994 letter to The Wall Street Journal: ``Let's Play Fair with
Utility Rates''; March 1994 WSJ: ``A Way Out of the Baby Bells Dilemma'';
and many, many more.
<p>
``Did you get the one I wrote in 1943?'' Kahn asked when I phoned to
comment on his prodigious epistolary output. He believes that serial
correspondents display a ``mixture of eccentricity and exhibitionism.''
Kahn frequents the letters pages partly because ``it's good practice for
writing'' and partly from ``pure vanity.'' And he correctly points out that
his output falls far short of the acknowledged record holder, one Louis Jay
Herman of New York. He has written more than 800 letters to The New York
Times in the past eight years. And that was mostly before e-mail.

Hello all,
<p>
It's been rather quiet here lately, but this one should provoke some 
reaction!  (Thanks, Gordon Zaft for posting the excerpt).  Here's mine:
<p>
>And what about Suzanne Vega? Here's someone with a demanding concert<br>
>schedule and a knife-edged keyboard that she brandishes quite freely. To<br>
[Spin magazine quote deleted]
<p>
And Mr. Beam's point being what???  Yes, so she chose to correct a story
that was inaccurate.  Yes, she has occasionally been out-spoken about
her opinions on certain other matters as well.  (I also don't see how this
has anything to do with her 'demanding concert schedule').  In fairness, 
I'd like some more info. on what the rest of this article was about.  It
always helps to put things in context.
<p>
>(www.vega.net/vega/) you will see that the scribbling songbird is anything<br>
>but a virtual presence. ``I caught the measles earlier this year and<br>
>thought of posting this news to get sympathy,'' she recently wrote. ``One<br>
>day I will write an autobiography. I promise,'' she informed her webmates.<br>
<p>
Again, the point being???  I gather from Zaft's post that this wasn't meant
in a complimentary manner.  Most of Suzanne's posts to this list are greatly
informative, thoughtful, and even humorous.  It seems greatly unfair to 
take her remark about getting the measles *out of context*.  Casual readers
of Mr. Beam's column will probably get the wrong impression about Suzanne. 
<p>
Here's the *entire* 'measles' quote:  "Anyhow--I think of you with affection 
(the readers of this list). I caught the measles earlier this year and for
a moment thought of posting this news to get sympathy, but resisted the urge.
(I am all better and do not need the sympathy now, so don't send it! :) "
Kind of puts a different "spin" on things, now doesn't it? :)
<p>
I'm not going to get *too* bent out of shape about this -  I'm sure it's
not the first time Suzanne's been quoted out of context.  Nevertheless,
again not knowing anything else about the article in which it appeared,
it's kind of distressing.  I, for one, hope that Suzanne will continue to 
speak out, and to post to this list!  We *enjoy* reading her thoughts from  
her "knife-edged keyboard" as much as we enjoy her music (and anyhow, the
music's why we're all here in the first place!)  :) 
<p>

Well, this may be a bit off the main subject of this list -- but I'd like 
to hear your theories about heckling. What's so funny about disturbing a 
concert with idiotic comments (very popular especially in England)? It 
must be a hell of a kick, since people actually pay to do it.
<p>
To be honest, I can understand some of the low motives a person might 
have to do this -- you get noticed, make sure that other people don't 
have a better time than yourself, and you may even express some kind of 
perverse love for the artist this way. But I'd like to think that 
columnists are above this sort of thing. But obviously they aren't. I 
once wrote an angry reply to some idiotic things they wrote about Suzanne 
in Melody Maker (UK). It got published -- but in a crippled form, and with 
yet another idiotic comment from the editor.
<p>
It's creepy to think that they're even evesdropping here. But don't keep 
quiet for that, Suzanne or anybody else. Let the free word flow free 
and drench the idiocy of the hecklers.
<p>
Written in an angry mood -- sorry!

Hey all,
<p>
Have read with interest, and some amusement, the threads on Alex Beam
and his "news" on Suzanne and her post to us here at Undertow.  I use
the word "amused" because the article was nothing more than gossip and
was really not worth taking seriously.  Sure, it may have "seemed" to
be derogatory and/or a slap at both Suzanne and us, *BUT* look at it
in the proper context and it is nothing more than a trifle.  In fact,
I think it says less about Suzanne than it says about Mr. Beam and 
his putative "journalistic" talents.  
<p>
Therfore, I was shocked and suprised to see the following message from
Eric concerning the original post in question....:
<p>
>------------<br>
>Also, in response to the letters I'm getting about the Correspondence 
section<br>
>- <br>
>- Yes, Suzanne's post mentioning 'measles' (cited by the Beam column) 
IS<br>
>gone.  Sorry if you went there searching for it...<br>
>------------<br>
><br>
<p>
....and I'm very curious as to what has happened.  I hope that this
is not a rash reaction to the brouhaha described above, as I would 
rather have seen it a)ignored or b)dealt with head on, rather than in 
this fashion.  I think it would be only fair that those of us who 
subscribe to this list be told what *did* happen and why.  Then, 
hopefully, we can put this one to bed and talk again about things that 
*really* matter.
<p>
BTW, Eric, thanks again to you and Hugo for all the efforts on the web
site.
<p>
And, thanks all for the vent, the air feels good....!

Hey Paul and Everyone -
<p>
I guess I was naive to think that pulling the messages would go unnoticed.
 The Beam article obviously drew some attention to the site and I've gotten a
bunch of mail asking me what happened to the excerpts the column cited.
<p>
So, in response to that, I acknowledged that they were pulled. Now, of course
I'm getting messages like Paul's asking 'why?'.  
<p>
I was asked by Suzanne through her management to remove the 'measles' message
and the one following it which discussed a greatest hits/retrospective album.
I complied. That's "what *did* happen and why."
<p>
I'm sure I could write more than a few paragraphs on how I feel about this,
but suffice it to say that I'm not happy that this Beam fellow would not only
use snippets of Suzanne's correspondence to negatively portray her, but even
less pleased that Suzanne would allow  Mr. Beam to influence what appears on
the website.
<p>
Time to talk about things that *really* matter...I hope!
<p>

Speaking as someone in approximately the same occupation as Alex Beam, all
I can say is -- what a fucking ass. 
<p>
Not for any slight against Suzanne -- if anything, he seems like a fan. I
mean, that knife-keyboard remark sounds like fairly Vegan imagery to me. 
And why else would he be cruising the home page? And why would any
columnist be randomly selecting Suzanne as newsprint-fodder three years
after her last album and quite a few years since she's had a big hit? To
your average attention-span-less scanner of pop culture, she surely would
have faded off the radar screen by now (unless, of course, you happen to
be a clueless Newsweek editor with a peasant blouse fetish). 
<p>
No, what's truly pathetic is that this is ALL HE HAD TO WRITE ABOUT.
Imagine that! Of course, that's a perennial hazard for columnists, who
have to try to appear to be bright and informative and wise and witty and
perceptive and knowing as many as three or five days a week, when you and
I probably know lots of people who've been around for many years and
haven't managed the task even once. But this one rings all the bells on
the Lame-O-Meter. I'm sure hope nobody left this column lying around in
the Boston Globe cafeteria, because the stink would keep people from
eating there for months. 
<p>
The sure sign that any columnist has lost it, or is shamelessly coasting,
is when he/she/it/tango (sorry, Laurie Anderson reference) turns
transcriber and resorts to using other people's words to fill space.
That's what happens when Ann Landers spends her column answering readers'
pleas like "Please rerun that letter from the dead 17-year-old who died in
a car accident and wishes he weren't dead" or "I'd really love to see that
poem about gonorrhea again! My old one grew moldy on the fridge." Dave
Barry's been relying on the device much too much lately, which is why we
keep reading those letters from readers about the North Fork Wombat Liver
Ultimate Frisbee Toss in Gutmunch, N.D. It's a great way to let other
people do your work for you. 
<p>
So what does Mr. Beam do? He just finds a bunch of "celebrities" (though
that Kahn guy is pretty far down the food chain) who've written letters to
the editor, reprints excerpts and makes snippy comments in between. It's 
maybe mildly amusing that Judge Ito has become such a frequent letter 
writer (and also raises even more questions about how much the OJ trial 
has gone to his head). But good Lord, how many years ago did Suzanne 
write to Spin? Was Bill Clinton even old enough to vote back then?
<p>
No matter. Column's done, in, edited, and Alex Beam is free to go enjoy
the rest of his day without having unduly exerted himself beyond
performing a few Nexis searches. Seems to me he might have had an early
date with another Beam -- Jim. 
<p>
Good pay if you can get it.
<p>
Anyway, I can sort of understand the reaction from Suzanne's management. 
We all know how guarded she is about her personal life (and 
understandably so), and she's been extremely kind in gracing us with her 
presence and comments here. But I can see how she might feel differently 
about having certain remarks of hers posted permanently on a homepage 
that's open to anyone cruising the web, especially once her words start 
being used against her in the press.
<p>
It's also possible that she had told us some stuff about her future
projects that maybe A&M didn't know yet. 
<p>
All I can say is, I hope this won't cause her to drop out of participation
here. I would still like to think that we're a closeknit family of Vega
fanatics who would never think of turning on each other in print.
<p>
Except, of course, for that big article I'm writing about Wendy!
<p>
-- The formerly elusive Bob King
<p>
P.S. I really love the Spin letter and hope it gets even more press. It's 
hilarious and contradicts all those stereotypes about Suzanne being 
constantly cold and aloof and serious, though it does seem to confirm 
that she's a New Yorker.
<p>
Maybe instead of Love Hotel, the next album should be called I Was Never 
a Fucking Waitress!

Well after seeing the entire column, I still don't get the point. Unless it
was this: "I, Alex Beam, am a professional; anyone else who tries to write is
an amateur and should not only be discouraged but publicly humiliated."
Sheesh. Makes me sorta embarrassed to be a journalist myself. Actually, much
of what I read in newspapers and magazines makes me sort of embarrassed to be
a journalist, but that's another story. Shame on him especially for that

FWIW, management was the messenger. It wasn't their reaction.  Suzanne's
notes *were* informative and harmless and enjoyed by website visitors and
Undertow subscribers. Beam's column succeeded in causing the content of the
website to be altered.  So much for the "small voices" and "David and
Goliath" stuff.

If that were the case, the 'measles' note would have stayed up.  I doubt that
this is the issue as the column was the catalyst.

Subj:	New editor, "measles" and etc.<br>
Date:	95-09-07 19:37:59 EDT<br>
From:	Suzanne Vega<br>
To:	undertow@serv1.law.emory.edu<br>
<p>
Dear Webmates;<br>
 (are we spiders? ducks perhaps?) -- (or "Gang", as I prefer it):
<p>
A lot has happened in a month.  I hear that we have been acknowledged by AOL
as one of their more "attractive" sites --  That's very cool, and Eric S
should take a bow for that --  I have to thank him personally for taking the
time to set up the page to begin with, and for maintaining it so well.
<p>
I wanted to say hi to Hugo and to welcome him publicly as the new editor of
the page.
<p>
I have to say that it is ironic to me that the page has received 370,000
"hits" in 6 months, when I am not able to access it yet myself -- I am
working on that and hope to be able to see it myself soon from my own
equipment.  I have only seen it once, and I was not aware that everything I
posted to Undertow was being filed in the Correspondence Section.
<p>
So I was very surprised by what Alex Beam said in his column -- how did he
know?  Did he subscribe to this list of 300 people?  No, he found it on the
board.  So I asked my management to ask Eric to remove 2 posts that I thought
could be harmful if taken the wrong way, including the "Measles" one. 
<p>
It was like thinking you were playing to an intimate club of 300 (this
newsgroup called Undertow) and suddenly realizing that every whisper was
being broadcast to hundreds of thousands of people (on the WWW page), some of
whom may not be interested but who are just cruising through for material
(that letter to Spin is at least seven years old.)
<p>
On reading it again, it really isn't that bad, and it is affectionate, and it
was taken out of context, for Christ's sake, so perhaps Hugo or Jeremy at AGF
could do me the favor of reinstating that particular one.  I am just going to
be more careful with what I say, as self-mockery in print is dangerous,
especially when inane editors of Melody Maker may be lurking somewhere
waiting for more cheap shots.  But then why blame the British, when we have
our own American Alex Beam!  (he is, right?)
<p>
When I have access to the page myself, I can give more input as to what
should or shouldn't be posted (not everything has to be).  Yes, Hugo, please
post this one!!
<p>
Quick updates regarding some questions you guys were peltering Eric with:
<p>
1.  I don't know what happened to the VH1 special regarding the Police.  It
has been postponed, is what they told me.  Maybe they shot it without me,
maybe it has been cancelled.
<p>
2.  "Fighting w Boys" -- unedited version -- I have to see what the legal
situation is with that.  I have to wait at least 90 days from July before
reprinting it anywhere.
<p>
3.  Amnesty Int'l forward -- I will have that for the page next week when I
am back in NY.
<p>
By the way -- my comments on the Steven Talkhouse gigs are:  I thought
Thursday's audience was great!  It was lively and excited -- Friday's was
good, too, but more subdued, more jaded?  I was tired also from the night
before.  I thought I was going to meet you, Wendy -- I thought you were the
woman at the soundcheck Friday.  But you came Thursday.  I should have known.
<p>
Enough for now.
<p>
Thanks again,<br>
yours truly,<br>
Suzanne Vega
