<p><body>In the summer of 1987, Suzanne Vega's single <i>"Luka"</i> hit 
the Top 10, peaking at number 3.
It was an event that surprised everyone, including Vega's record label, 
A&M, and Vega herself, for Vega was 
considered a "folk" musician and folk was no longer considered a 
commercial musical style.  Because the folk
era of the '60s (when albums by artists like Joan Baez and Peter, Paul 
and Mary had been consistent sellers)
had long since passed, Vega had found it hard to attract the interest 
of a label in the early '80s because of her
perceived "folkie" roots.  But despite her use of an acoustic guitar 
and her aprrenticeship in the traditional folk
spawning ground of Greenwich Village clubs, Vega's introspective lyrics 
were actually closer to the work of early
'70s singer-songwriters than '60s folkies.  Even so, A&M had been 
reluctant to sign her, but were eventually
won over by the persistance of Vega and her manager, Ron Fierstein.  
"We went after A&M specifically because
we had heard that they were interested in artists for the long run," 
Vega explained in <i>Musician</i>.  Nancy
Jeffries, then an A&R rep for A&M, related the label's concerns in the 
same article.  "We all had some doubts
because you're scared of signing a folk singer in 1985," she said.  
"But then I go down to see her, and before
she's through with three lines, I'm in love.  Everyone (at A&M) went 
through the same cycle with me: 'Oh my God,
it's a folk singer - what are you doing?"  Then they'd see her and 
instantly it was, 'Okay, let's make this work."</body>
<br>
<p><body>The <i>Musician</i> article on Vega appeared in their June 
1988 issue, with a cover that featured
a picture of Sinead O'Conner and the headline: <b>WHY THE BEST NEW 
ARTISTS OF 1988 ARE WOMEN: THE
MAJOR LABELS CHANGE THEIR TUNE.</b>  The approach itself was not 
unique; women performers had routinely
been asked about the female perspective of working in a male-dominated 
field, with the equally obligatory questions
about feminism tagged on in the '70s.  The number of articles and books 
that focused on female performers ws
increasing, but unlike the <i>Musician</i> piece, they profiled the 
women as individual performers, not as a specific
development within the industry.  But the <i>Musician</i> cover story, 
which featured profiles of O'Conner, Tracy
Chapman, Michelle Schocked, and Toni Childs, also discussed why these 
women had emerged at approximately
the same time.  The new question asked of female performers was how 
they felt about being part of an apparently
new genre of "women-in-rock," not the sole woman performer in a group 
of men, but part of their own musical
"movement."</body>
<p><body>Many - though not all - of the women lumped into the 
women-in-rock "trend" were, like Vega, singer-songwriters:
solo performers who played acoustic guitars who had been overlooked 
during the first half of the '80s as the rise of
MTV and other video outlets played up the importance of a performer's 
appearance.  Annie Lennox, Cyndi Lauper,
and especially Madonna had been able to exploit the necessity of an 
extravagant look to their advantage, but women
who were not interested in or willing to play that game found it harder 
to compete in the marketplace.  Vega's
success changed that attitude when she proved that a "serious" female 
performer could make money.  Thirty years
earlier, George Goldner had questioned whether the Chantels were 
"saleable" because he doubted anyone would be
interested in listening to a group of teenage girls; in the early '80s 
it was obvious this type of reasoning was still being
applied to performers who fell outside the boundaries of what was 
believed to be commercial music.  "Since when
did the industry that insisted its strongest women play cartoon 
characters such as rock's Tina Turner, Cyndi Lauper
and Annie Lennox allow a serious, powerful, flesh-and-blood female to 
stand firm on a concert stage?" wrote Susn
Wilson in an article about the women-in-rock "trend" in the <i>Boston 
Sunday Globe</i>.  "Since when did the folks
who brought us Tiffany and Pebbles care about female singing or 
songwriting talent?  Since when did the corporations
that gave us Sheila E. and Madonna allow a female performer to sell 
social conscience instead of sex?"  Finally, 
because of Suzanne Vega's success, a number of female performers were 
able to stretch those "commercial"
boundaries with a vengeance, introducing a wealth of fresh, new musical 
talent into the music scene.</body>
<p><body>Born and raised in New York City, Vega had grown up thinking 
she was half-Puerto Rican until her
father, writer Ed Vega, told her he was really her stepfather and that 
her biological father lived in California and
was white, a revelation that set off something of an identity crisis 
for Vega.  "I was really confused because I
had this really strong identity as a half-Puerto Rican girl, " she told 
<i>Musician</i>.  "I had all these really weird ideas
about white people.  So to realize that I was in fact white was 
obviously a big shock.  It was hard for me to
accept that I had this other <i>thing</i> that seemed to mark me as 
being different from my family."  When vega
finally met her "other" father, after her success with <i>"Luka"</i>, 
she learned that both of her parents had
musical backgrounds; not only was her mother a jazz guitarist, her 
biological father's mother had been a drummer
who played with the Merry Makers Ladies Orchestra in the '20s and 
'30s.</body>
<p><body>Vega's own interest in the arts had been encouraged as a 
child: "Both of my parents thought that being
an artist was the only reasonable thing in this society that a person 
could do," she said.  Vega initially pursued
dancing, which she studied while attending New York's High School for 
the Performing Arts, but she also wrote
songs, sang, and played guitar; she later recalled one of her first 
singing experiences ws in a show sponsored
by the Alliance of Latin Arts ("I was the only white girl").  By the 
time she attended her first rock concert, a Lou
Reed show, at age nineteen, she had given up her dream of being a 
dancer, was attending Barnard College,
and was trying to get booked in Greenwich Village clubs.  When her 
efforts to find work in the Village proved
unsuccessful, she sought out gigs on the college coffeehouse circuit 
and began building a following, keeping a
notebook diary evaluating every show.  By the early '80s, she managed 
to move into the Greenwich Village scene,
at last finding a welcoming atmosphere for her work from people who 
didn't consider her to be a '60s throwback.
"That five years I spent there was like finding my own tribe of 
people," she said in <i>Musician</i> in 1990.  "I
felt accepted.  I was popular.  I'd stay out and drink all night, and I 
had a lot of fun."</body>
<p><body>After being turned down by A&M twice, Vega's manager submitted 
a demo to A&M's then-president
Gil Friesen, who then gave the tape to Nancy Jeffries; Vega was signed 
to the label in the mid-'80s.  Her self-titled
debut LP, released in 1985, kept the focus on Bega and her acoustic 
guitar despite the use of elcetric instruments.
Co-produced by former Patti Smith Group guitarist Lenny Kaye and Steve 
Addabbo, the album's songs, all written
by Vega, combined poetic imagery with a cool delivery to create a 
subdued, but intense atmosphere.  Although
the album had little impact on the charts, it generated good reviews in 
the press, and her subsequent tours met
with a positive response from audiences, particularly in Britain, where 
Vega played the Royal Albert Hall and was
one of the few Americans on the bill at the annual Prince's Trust 
charity concert in 1987 (her "<i>Marlene On
The Wall"</i> wa included on the album of highlights from the show).  
Back in the States, the song <i>"Left Of
Center,"</i> included on the soundtrack of the John Hughes film 
<i>Pretty In Pink,</i> became an alternative
radio hit.  By 1987, the stage was set for the release of Vega's second 
album, <b><i>Solitude Standing</i>,</b> which,
if all went according to plan, would build upon Vega's previous success 
and expose her to a larger audience.
What was not expected was that the album would be a Top 20 hit 
(reaching number 11 and selling over one
million copies) or that <i>"Luka"</i> would be a breakthrough 
smash.</body>
<p><body>Produced by the Kaye-Addabbo team, <b><i>Solitude 
Standing</i></b> had lusher instumentation
than its predecessor, though Vega's concise delivery still took center 
stage.  But there was no obvious single
on the album, which made <i>"Luka"</i> a surprise hit.  Songs about 
child abuse were not unheard of in rock
music (Pat Benetar's <i>"Hell Is For Children"</i> being an obvious 
example), but the issue was rarely adressed,
even in the realm of political songs, and no song on the subject had 
ever made it into the Top 40 before.  But
<i>"Luka's"</i> story, narrated in a calm, near-expressionless voice by 
the abused victim, struck a responsive
chord in the public, and Vega received awards from child abuse 
organizations for the recognition her single had
brought to the issue.  Many of the album's other songs had equally 
disquieting themes: the narrator in the a capella
<i>"Tom's Diner"</i> is cast as an eternal observer even when 
reflecting on a failed love affair, <i>"In The Eye"</i>
depicts a potentially violent confrontation that could be either an 
argument or an assault, and the title track
depicts "solitude" as an eternally present, enigmatic visitor.</body>
<p><body>Vega's next album, <b><i>Days of Open Hand</i></b> (which she 
co-produced), was released in
1990.  In contrast to the personalized focus of her previous work, the 
majority of the songs on <b><i>Days of 
Open Hand</i></b> were observations of the outside world, with Vega, 
the omnipresent narrator, maintaining
a detached perspective, even in situations where she is a participant, 
such as <i>"Institution Green,"</i> where
Vega waits to cast her vote in an anonymous bureaucratic building.  
<i>"Fifty-Fifty Chance,"</i> the story of
 a suicide attempt, features a taut undercurrent of strings, arranged 
by Philip Glass, <i>"Men in a War"</i>
contemplates physical and emotional loss, and the opening track, 
<i>"Tired of Sleeping,"</i> has Vega trapped
in a dream-like haze.  In comparison to the success of <b><i>Solitude 
Standing,</i></b> <b><i>Days of Open
Hand</i></b> did poorly, only selling around 350,000 copies.  Vega 
admitted in <i>Rolling Stone</i> she was
disappointed in A&M's handling of the album: "They (A&M) had forgotten 
what I represented, what I stood for...
I never started making songs in order to get played on the radio - that 
was just a nice bonus."  Her penchant
for experimentation continued the following year when the British duo 
DNA released a bootleg record called
<i>"Oh Suzanne"</i> that reworked <i>"Tom's Diner"</i> into a 
dance-rock track.  A&M apprehended the duo 
for their unauthorized use of Vega's vocal track (which had been 
extensively sampled for DNA's record), but
Vega suggested releasing DNA's imaginative "cover" as a legitimate 
record.  The song became a number 2 hit
in the British dance charts, and in 1991 Vega produced the compilation 
<b><i>Tom's Album,</i></b> a collection
of widely varying cover versions of <i>"Tom's Diner."</i>
