            CALYPSO

          My name is Calypso
          And I have lived alone
          I live on an island        
          And I waken to the dawn
          A long time ago
          I watched him struggle with the sea
          I knew that he was drowning
          And I brought him into me
          Now today
          Come morning light
          He sails away
          After one last night
          I let him go.

          My name is Calypso
          My garden overflows
          Thick and wild and hidden
          Is the sweetness there that grows
          My hair it blows long
          As I sing into the wind
          My name is Calypso
          And I have lived alone
          I live on an island
          I tell of nights
          Where I could taste the salt on his skin

          Salt of the waves
          And of tears
          And though he pulled away
          I kept him here for years
          I let him go

          My name is Calypso
          I have let him go
          In the dawn he sails away
          To be gone forever more
          And the waves will take him in again
          But he'll know their ways now
          I will stand upon the shore
          With a clean heart

          And my song in the wind
          The sand will sting my feet
          And the sky will burn
          It's a lonely time ahead
          I do not ask him to return
          I let him go
          I let him go
