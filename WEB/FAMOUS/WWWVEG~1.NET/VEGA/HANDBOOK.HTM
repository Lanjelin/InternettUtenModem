"Tired Of Sleeping" is a song from the dream images.  I find it weird to sing because it makes me feel sad, 
but I also feel that it's one that I  <i>have</i> to sing.  Its a song of having intense dreams and wanting to
wake up from them in your real life, as opposed to a deluded dream world where no one's connecting.  The
"Oh Mom" lines aren't specifically about birth.  But probably there have been many times in my life when I felt
that I was the child reassuring my mother that everything would be fine.  I put the quote marks around "clean
 quilted heart" because the phrase was so clear in the dream.  In the dream, the man was trying to prove his
innocence, to show that he was pure.  It's a little strange, but it makes emotional sense to me.   I trust that and 
go with that.

<p>
To me, "Men In A War" is about missing a piece of yourself, whether it's a physical piece or a part of your
will or spirit.  I put the woman in the song because I wanted toshow these two people in opposite
circumstances, both of them feeling incomplete.  The man is feeling something he doesn't have, and the 
woman is not feeling something she has.

<p>
"Rusted Pipe" is like "Language" from the last album.  "Language is liquid" there and "Words are like water"
 here.  And I'm rusted.  The "creak" is like a faucet turning on.  Basically, it comes down to feelings.
Because as a child, I think I must have decided that feelings were impractical and not useful, so therefore
you put them away for a while.  It's a song more about <i> finding </i> the story than telling it.  But Paul
Nelson's reading of it - that it could be about a baby who wants to speak and walk but can't do it yet - 
is accurate.  Not in a literal sense, but to me, a song is like a piece of sculpture.  You hammer at it from all angles
until the pure thing is left in the middle.  And then if it works from every angle, you know you've got something.

<p>
In "Book Of Dreams," I wanted to write something about the way I wish things would be.  Again, it has dream images,
 but they're more like daydreams or fantasies.   It's me going, "What do I wish I could do?"  Unlike the
situation in "Institution Green,"  your name will be called.  And <i> everybody </i> is in my book of
dreams.   No one will be forgotten.

<p>
"Institution Green" could be about a mental institution, going to vote, a police station or waiting to get
blood taken in a doctor's office.  The context isn't so important. It's whether I hit the emptional bull's-eye
 that makes a difference to me.  The actual events here are a combination of a doctor's office and voting. 
When I was a kid, I'd go to the clinics with my mother.  If you don't have any money, you go to free clinics, 
which means you wait for hours.  And it's all dependent on this one person in charge, who, if she's 
dropped your card on the floor or she's having a bad day - well, you'll wait forever.  It's extremely
dehumanizing to feel that you're just one of a million people, and that a lot of people have your last name
and no one cares enough to pick you out.  That's where the rage comes in.  You want to say, "I want to 
go in now," because you've waited for hours and hours.

<p>
"Those Whole Girls (Run In Grace)" was inspired by the feeling of wanting to be whole and confident and
complete.  I was reading Annie Dillard's <i> An American Childhood </i>, and she seemed so sure of her
feelings.  She seemed so different from the way I was as a child, when I always felt that I had to look two
ways before I took a step.  Also, I was playing with the language.  I liked each word being one syllable.
 And the <i> crunchiness </i> of the consonants and the way the words felt in my mouth.  I didn't write
the song with any malice or bitterness.  It's more that I would like to be that way one day.

<p>
"Room Off The Street" was originally called "Cuba."  It was what I imagined Cuba might feel like at some point.
The feeling of giving your life for the cause, and how it incites all sorts of passions that don't have to do
with the politics but with the feeling in the air.  The poster of the man with his hand in a fist was a 
recurring image in the posters we had at home.

<p>
"Big Space" is about the body being a network and finding the center.  Then you think, what if there
isn't any center?  Or what if you get there, and there's nothing?  Those were the fears I was trying to confront
as I sat down to write this album.  "Anger in a cold place" - that's like, well, what do you hide when you put
on the uniform to get through the day?  What are the things you're not acknowledging? What does the
calm face hide?  And it's the feelings that you're taking away.  YOu just strip yourself of them, and you
become not human - or wooden, as in "Wooden Horse (Caspar Hauser's Song)."  I guess as a kid, I felt
like a <i> thing </i> sometimes. Or like an object.  I felt sometimes that I wasn't sure.  As a child, it's easy
to get that confused.  You look at a doll, and it seems to have a life.  Then you look at yourself, and you 
seem not to be able to move.

<p>
Leonard Cohen's "Who By Fire" was an influence on "Predictions."  One day, I was looking up a word or 
something, and I suddenly came across this weird list of ways that people have told the future.  And each of 
these ways had its own name, its own  <i>-ology.</i>  I thought the images were so beautiful and pure.
  And all of these objects - the hatchet, the nails, the dough of cakes, the wax in water - are the kind of
things you'd find around your house.  I loved the idea of magic being contained in these everyday objects.

<p>
"50-50 Chance" is based on a real incident.  Someone I'm close to had that experience last year.  A suicide 
attempt.  She's okay now.  She hasn't tried it again.

<p>
"Pilgrimage" comes from an incense bowl.  I've been a Buddhist since I was 16 - the Nichiren Shoshu sect.  
So every morning I chant and burn incense.  It's that linear thing of time as a line that's burning.  Sometimes 
I watch the incense burn, and I imagine that it's this great journey from one end of this big, dusty bowl
 to the other.  the song starts off with the one line of incense that turns into the life that turns into the land, 
and I felt happy with the idea of expansion.  I'm saying, "I'm coming to you/I'll be there in time' to death as well 
as to the source.  But there's a feeling of, when I die, it will be okay, because I will have done what I 
mean to do. I won't have missed it.
