Although the ladies of the Grand Hotel were eclipsed by late '70s punk, designer pop and the awful boys'
 pop rock of the mid-'80's, they emerged in 1987 when a slip of a girl with a long face from New York City
 made female acoustic songwriting Big News again.
<p>
I first met Suzanne Vega in 1992 in an impersonal record-company office. 
 MTV flickered on a screen in the background, while she sat almost demure, dressed in
 loose, beige clothing - very calm, very Buddhist, very yin-and-yang.  Her image seemed  to be reflected
 in her music: considered, precise. lyrical, literary, but with a smart pop sensibility.  A year later she
 inadvertently admonished me for coming to conclusions about her supposed serenity.  "People don't 
bother to probe beneath the surface.  Usually there's all kinds of things going on."
<p>
The second time we met it was a hot August afternoon in 1993.  In the lull between touring and the next 
album, she was taking a break, holed up in a London flat, observing life and waiting for the muse to 
overtake her.  We arranged to meet in Kew Gardens.  The trains had been delayed and I was half an 
hour late;  as I rushed up to this impatient sylph-like figure, I was struck by her incongruity amid the lazy,
bright, bee-crammed flowerbeds of Kew.  Fully made up, dressed in a black designer suit, Filo-fax in hand,
 she looked very New York, very professional.  It reminded me of something she'd said before: "I went about
 my career like a business."
<p>
Sitting in the shade of a secluded summerhouse, Vega tackled this thorny question of "women in rock".  In
 many ways Vega is a good spokeswoman.  Articulate and imaginative, she is an intellectual with a keen 
appreciation of "the street."  She came to prominence in 1985 with the hit single <em>Marlene On The 
Wall</em> and self-titled debut album, her success ushering in a new wave of record-company investment 
in women singer/songwriters.  This was a Good Thing, especially considering the low point women 
performers reached in the early '80s, when after the collapse of punk, the vacuum was filled with 
commercialized video-friendly pop/rock acts such as Pat Benatar or Madonna.  Vega offered new hope for 
women who wanted to express themselves through the integrity of a new kind of urban folk.
<p>
Growing up in New York City with her mother and Puerto Rican stepfather, Vega saw herself as half Puerto
 Rican, imbibing the rich, frenetic multicultural vibes of the city, yet creating in the midst of that an oasis of
 calm for herself.  A former dance student, she went on to Columbia University and majored in English.  She 
could have carved a path as a straight writer, but chose instead to channel her talent in songwriting.  
Vega's musical career began when, as a child, she was picked to sing at Pete Seeger's knee in Carnegie
 Hall.  By sixteen she was playing downtown coffee houses, establishing herself on the early-'80s New York 
Village folk circuit.
<p>
Acknowledging the generational influence, she recalls her grandmother, the late Helen Grant, who played
 drums in a '30s all-female boogie-woogie band that was described on posters as "the hottest band this side
 of Hades."  "I never knew her," says Vega.  "But it's ironic that I picked her way of life without meaning to.  I thought I was being original and clever picking this lifestyle for myself - then I found out that she did it fifty years before."
<p>
In her determined way the teenage Vega sought out the best venues to play
<p>
"Someone told me if I went down to The Other End Cafe in the Village, that was how I'd get my start.  From 
The Other End you eventually work your way up, if you're really good, to Folk City.  I got turned down from 
The Other End; the auditions were horrible.  The guy would sit there and eat his dinner while you were 
playing.  You'd sing three songs while he ate pork chops and drank beer.  At the end he'd say, No thank you.
It hadn't occurred to me to go somewhere else.  The plan is, you start there and end up at Folk City.  After 
two years of being rejected, it dawned on me that maybe I should just go over to Folk City.  I left a demo 
tape; they liked one song and gave me a Sunday afternoon."
<p>
Vega's thirty-strong following for her first date impressed Fok City, who gave her regular work on a scene
 that was then small but vibrant.  "To us it'd never gone away.  The real world wasn't paying any attention,
 it was into punk and New Wave - but we were all thrilled, writing a lot, influencing each other."  After 
associating with prime movers like Jack Hardy, Vega came to the attention of A&R woman Nancy Jeffries, 
then at A&M.  It took a woman to realize the potential of a female singer/songwriter, flying in the face of
 fashion and signing Vega to widespread record-label opposition.  She effectively launched the next wave 
of the genre.  "I wasn't sure at first; I'd been sent a tape through a friend in the company and thought she
 was just another folk singer," recalls Jeffries.  "Then I went down to see her and realized that there was
 something different about her, something interesting."
<p>
Vega's downbeat, street-level approach won her a deal.  "Nancy really took a chance on me," she says.  
"She felt it was too good to pass up.  I owe her a lot.   She was great at seeing me through the whole thing.
 'Sfunny, when I heard an A&R person was coming to see me, I was expecting a big fat guy with a cigar, and
 here was this long, skinny woman with a delicate stomach.  She was fascinating - a real kinship there."
<p>
Despite record-label scepticism ("maybe she'll sell 30,000"), Vega's debut album sold over a million, and her
 second, <strong>Solitude Standing</strong>, sold three million, with follow-up albums 1990's <strong>Days 
of Open Hand</strong> and <strong>99.9</super>o</super></strong>, in 1992, also charting well.  Despite
 unlikely singles success with <em>Luka</em> in 1987, a subtle song about child abuse, and the dance-floor
 rap of 1990's <em>Tom's Diner</em>.  Vega is more the archetypal album artist.  Working in a field where 
women are encouraged to explore their emotional range, she covers every topic from transsexualism to love
 in Liverpool.  Vega's success showed how female singer/songwriters could reinvent themselves.  Although 
their relative disappearance after punk gave the impression that they went away and came back, they had 
been there all the time, writing, constructing and commencing on their lives, regardless of music-industry 
hype.  
<p>
"I don't like to think that women can't understand larger issues or express them.  But if a woman did do 
a "larger" song, I don't know if it would be preceived in the same way.  I've always felt like the character 
form <strong>Notes From The Underground</strong>, sitting in a small room, identifying in a Kafka-esque 
way with people who work in day jobs.  I then realized that as a woman I am an anti-hero.  There are no 
women heroes.  The only one you really have is Joan of Arc, and she's a martyr, not a hero.  I find this
 frustrating.  How can I take my anti-hero stance if I'm already considered to be an anti-hero because I'm a
 woman?  That's not fair.  Once women learn how to write in that broad way without losing their individuality, 
it'd be a good thing for everyone.  If you were to write a song called <em>Pride In The Name Of Love</em>, 
it might not feel real to a woman singing it.  Love to a woman means other things like sacrifice or caretaking, n
ot necessarily pride."
<p>
Thirty years earlier, Peggy Seeger had grappled with the same issue.
<p>
"A woman's territory is much smaller than a man's.  Women seem satisfied with less, which is probably why
 we've gotten less.  It was traditional for women to be involved with children and family - I see nothing
 wrong with that.  What is more universal than love, than the domestic?  As a Marxist, I saw that one of the
 purposes of [Marx's] philosophy was to decentralize.  The concept of a "brotherhood of man" is hightly 
centralized.  I don't think universal is a good idea.  Universal is what creates multinationals - pop music 
that's the same whether you're in Rio de Janeiro or Iceland.  If that's universal who wants it?"
