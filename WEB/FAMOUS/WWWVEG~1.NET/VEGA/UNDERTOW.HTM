            UNDERTOW

             I believe right now if I could
             I would swallow you whole
             I would leave only bones and teeth
             We could see what was underneath
             And you would be free then

             Once I thought only tears could make us free
             Salt wearing down to the bone
             Like sand against the stone
             Against the shoreline

             I am friend to the undertow
             I take you in, I don't let go
             And now I have you

             I wanted to learn all the secrets
             From the edge of a knife
             From the point of a needle
             From a diamond
             From a bullet in flight
             I would be free then

             I am friend to the undertow
             I take you in, I don't let go
             And now I have you

             I wanted to see how it would feel
             To be that sleek
             And instead I find this hunger's
             Made me week

             I believe right now if I could
             I would swallow you whole
             I would leave only bones and teeth
             We could see what was underneath
             And you would be free then

             I am friend to the undertow
             I take you in, I don't let go
             And now I have you

             I am friend to the undertow
             I take you in, I don't let go
             And now I have you
