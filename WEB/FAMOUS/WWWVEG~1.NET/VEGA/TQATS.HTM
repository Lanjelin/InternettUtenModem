This may sound silly, but I do not quite uderstand the lyrics of the song 
`The queen and the soldier' Sometimes I suspect a second layer in this 
song. For example "she knew she had seen his face before..". Did they 
know each other? And (correct me if I misquote) "...and to love a young 
woman who I don't understand". Perhaps the purpose of this song is to 
create doubt, or isn't it?
<p>
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

I've always felt this song could be interpreted on two levels.  The first 
is just conjecture, but I think that it's supposed to represent a 
relationship of Suzanne's that she feels she handled badly due to fear.  
I've no idea how true that is.  It may not be Suzanne herself, but as 
someone pointed out the "secret burning thread" could represent Suzanne's 
desire to be a writer like her father, so the queen would appear to 
represent Suzanne on some level.
<p>
The second level is about the relationship between the sexes, and how it 
can be seen as a battle, and when it is there are no winners.  This comes 
from reading a double meaning into "woman for whom we all kill", and also 
from lines like "I've seen more battles lost, than I have battles won".  
<p>
Does any of this make any sense?

To me, this song has always been an allusion to Queen Elizabeth I.  I have a
friend who is an expert on British Royalty and he has confimed that it's
basically true:
<p>
QEI never married and only had affairs with these sort of commoners and would
elevate them to a high ranking position and then, when they got to big for
their britches, she'd either demote them or kill them or whatever.
<p>
I think, that that is what is going on in this song.  These two definately
have something going on.  And he thinks he can persuade her because of their
affair--what he finds out is that she is always queen and not so easily
moved.

Wow ... all the time I have wondered about this song, and even written
about it in an essay once, without ever guessing that the references
were *this* precise!! The things that struck me most about it were the
literary images of "female" inner space (down the long narrow hall he
was led...), the way that the soldier was trying to penetrate, though
(she never once took the crown off her head). This might also have
to do with the cliche of Elizabeth I as "The Virgin Queen", and that
bit from (I want to live as an honest man) to (Your Highness, your
ways are very strange) has always seemed to me like a coded marriage
proposal. I also think the song is paired with "Knight Moves", which
puts the Queen in a less negative light by hinting that her power is
tenuous in "male" society. So the devious action of TQATS is not to
do with women being naturally false, but more to do with hanging on
to one`s own autonomy by any means necessary at that time...
<p>
Thanx for shedding new light :)

I always thought "she knew she had seen his face someplace before" just 
meant that the queen had noticed the soldier, maybe admiring him, perhaps 
out on the battlefield. that is, maybe she was already attracted to him 
but didn't want to admit it.
<p>
the other lines you asked about are among my favorites in vega-dom:
<p>
.. and to love a young woman<br>
who I don't understand.<br>
Your Highness, your ways are very strange.<br>
<p>
I always thought that was a wonderfully roundabout way of saying "I love
you." I want to love a young woman I don't understand, and I don't
understand you -- so therefore ... you fill in the blanks. (It's basically
a syllogism, with the third part being unfinished. It's sort of similar to
the ad slogan Arby's has been using: Arby's is Different, Different is
Good ...)
<p>
Not to get too personal here or anything, but the first time I really, 
really fell in love I wrote those lines in this occasional journal I was 
keeping. Um, not the Arby's lines, the Suzanne ones. That was in my 
sloppy romantic days, before I became the bitter, cynical bastard I am now.

<p>
My initial reaction was that the "secret burning thread" lines refer to
menstruation. The biological process, for one thing, sets the queen apart
as a woman from all the male soldiers killing on her behalf, just as she
has separated herself generally from the world and people around her. It's
something many women (at least of my acquaintance) aren't all that
comfortable discussing, even with other women. And it's also something she
apparently understands only dimly; she has no idea why she bleeds, so she
imagines that she has swallowed something that is cutting her internally,
sort of the way people once believed that a chariot carried the sun across
the sky. Sex education apparently is not all that strong in her kingdom.
<p>
Symbolically, I think the thread is also her picture of the secret source
of her pain, which she conceals from the world for the sake of not losing
the grip on her power. "She never once took the crown from her head." 
It's the same way people often starve themselves spiritually by focusing
only on their material status, not on their needs for love or meaning or
connectedness. The sudden presence of the soldier unbalances the queen by
awakening these desires within her -- "she wanted more than she ever could
say." But instead of satisfying those desires, she chooses to bury them
and remove the immediate source of her anxiety by having the soldier
killed. It's sort of the ultimate example of panicking and sabotaging a 
relationship that becomes too intense.
<p>
Does anyone else think that that long "ooooooooo" after "He bowed her 
down to the ground" refers to the queen and soldier having sex? In 
concert Suzanne has implied that the two never consummated their 
relationship, but I think it's also true that the black widow kills the 
male _after_ they've mated.
<p>
Anyway, I guess we could get into a big thread on the use of blood 
imagery in songs. In certain contexts, I think (for sort of obvious 
reasons) that it's a very "female" concept that wouldn't occur to a lot 
of male songwriters. Two examples I can think of right off the bat are PJ 
Harvey's song "Happy and Bleeding" and a really beautiful song by the 
Seattle band Tattletale called "Fly Away": "I've seen the blood 
that the earth is losing/and it's falling over me."
<p>
In other contexts it can be sort of male and aggressive, as in "(Don't Go 
Back to) Rockville" by R.E.M.: "If you were here I'd only bleed you."
<p>
Two other thoughts on the song:
<p>
1) Aside from being a battle of the sexes, you can also view the song as 
similar to Edgar Allan Poe's "Fall of the House of Usher": as a struggle 
between two opposing sides of the same mind. The "room with her 
tapestries red" could be the heart (or maybe the womb, using the 
menstrual theory).
<p>
2) It's kind of depressing that Suzanne's alternate ending to this 
confrontation, "Knight Moves," turns the queen needy and passive while 
the knight flits from woman to woman, playing one against the other. 
Basically you can either deny your inmost needs or set yourself up to be 
a chump. (Of course that is how it seems some days ...). If this did 
reflect Suzanne's worldview at the time, I'd sort of wager that that has 
changed.
<p>
Anyone else?

<p>
One thing I found interesting about TQATS is that, though the song is
written from an intensely female viewpoint, it's the soldier who 
comes across as a basically good, decent person: courageous (he just walks
up and knocks on the queen's door to turn in his resignation), perceptive,
straightforward about what he wants and willing to speak frankly. These
have often been stereotypically cast as "masculine" traits (as in that My
Fair Lady song, "Why Can't a Woman Be More Like a Man?") and contrast with
the queen's habit of hiding in labyrinths, denying herself and concealing
her deepest needs. The soldier doesn't come across as macho by any 
stretch of the imagination, but he's secure in his own self. Based on 
Suzanne's comments about androgyny, I'd sort of like to think she's 
writing about the "masculine" part of her own personality -- some of the 
traits she may admire in people of both genders.
<p>
In "Knight Moves" it all gets turned around and the soldier becomes an 
insensitive, macho jerk, apparently unconcerned with his "woman who is 
crying in the hall." The sensitive "female" self, having let down her 
guard and given her heart to this guy, finds out she's been duped, 
contemplates suicide ("it's like drinking gasoline to quench your thirst 
until there's nothing there left at all") and practically begs him to say 
he loves her, receiving no reply.
<p>
Not a pretty view of human nature, is it?
<p>
I'm intrigued, Tanita, by your raising the possibility that Suzanne may 
view the queen's tactics in the first song as unpleasant but necessary. 
It does seem that the characters in the first album spend a lot of time 
cutting connections with the world to keep from being hurt.
<p>
Hmmm. Do I have anything else to say about this song?

<p>
I think she has this intuition of seeing his face before because, at 
least in a certain sense, the soldier is a part of herself, as you've 
suggested in your other posts.
<p>
In Jungian terms, the Soldier is most definitely an Animus figure, a 
symbolic representation of the contrasexual element in the Queen's 
psyche. There may, of course, be a real soldier, but the reason he makes 
such an impact on the Queen is that he corresponds to something within 
herself. Being a very one-sided person, rigidly identified with her role 
as a queen -- her Persona symbolised, perhaps, by the crown she refuses to 
take from her head -- her other qualities are undifferentiated and 
unconscious. They are part of the Shadow. Now, althought the Shadow 
appears to the conscious mind as dark and threatening, it need not be all 
bad and evil. If your Persona is hateful and belligerent, love and 
peacefulness may be completely unconscious, and part of the Shadow.
<p>
For a brief moment when the crown falls from the Queen's head, and the 
Soldier takes her to the window, she sees the golden sun and feels her 
want. Just like in Cracking, the Queen catches a glimpse of the light 
through the crack when she herself (or her Persona) is cracking. But her 
hunger is too strong, she has been starving for too long, and she cannot 
take the pain in her heart, so she kills the Soldier in a vain attemt to 
get rid of the Shadow, and the battle continues on.
<p>
The thread is certainly interesting. According to D.W. Winnicott, strings
are often used by children to symbolise relationships -- with a string you
can remain connected though still separate. So in a painful relationship,
you can keep some distance without cutting the bond altoghether. 
<p>
I also agree with Bob's thoughts about menstruation and female imagery. 
The thread could be an Ouroboros -- the snake biting its tail --
symbolising, among other things, the eternal regenerative power, certainly
a female image. It could of course also be the Kundalini snake, often
associated with the female power, shakti, of the Indian goddess Khali. 
<p>
There are certainly other female images in the song -- "the long narrow 
hall" with the "tapestried red" would certainly be a lovely mothpiece for 
a Freudian. But, to me, it is more interesting if you view these images 
as symbols of the sexual aspect within a person, than looking at it from 
a gender perspective. It may just be my own preferences, but in so doing, 
the songs and the images concern everyone, not only a woman in a certain 
situation. The battle is raging in you and me, man or woman. It is also, 
unfortunately raging outside us -- in wars between people, sexes and 
nations. Perhaps because we cannot deal with our inner drama in an 
appropriate way when the inner world has been ravaged.
<p>
Bob, although women certainly have more experience of bleeding than most
men, I think blood and bleeding is a very universal symbol -- let me, for
instance, remind you of Bob Dylan's song "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only
Bleeding)". 
<p>
So I don't think The Queen and the Soldier refers specifically to Queen 
Elisabeth I, Tanita, although it is interesting to see the historical 
person in the light of this song. I'm sure there are many people living 
like the queen, and if you are actually a queen, with a queen's power, 
your conduct can indeed be highly destructive to many people.
<p>

<p>
I'm happy that there are so many discussions going on about Suzanne's 
lyrics -- the more you think about them, the more you hear of other 
people's interpretations, the more they mean to you. So please keep the 
discussions going!

Tanita,
<p>
I see the connection in the song between QEI and the Queen, but I can't say
for sure that Suzanne was making a reference to QEI specifically.  But, I
like where you open the song up to a sort of femenist reading--a powerful
female within a patriarchal society and the struggles she has to maintain
that power.  It might be interesting to unpack this song from that direction.

I always thought this image (the burning thread) referred to an IUD, and
its related to the Queen having to keep her purity (no 'souvenirs' must be
left of the relationship the Queen had/has with the soldier).

Curiouser and curiouser (with apologies for the possible duff spelling!):
this is a comparison I too have pondered for some time without making any
particular conclusion. The Kate Bush track ("Eat the Music") has a chorus
about a man who is "a woman at heart", for which the singer loves him. I
think this is far less somatic about gender than the Suzanne Vega track
"As Girls Go", though I always wondered how this figure of a man who is
like a woman would relate to Kate`s belief in "feminine" energy?. As far
as I recall the Alice Cooper track, it is all to do with women being weak
and men being heartless swine, sort of like a kind-hearted old Victorian
duffer on hard drugs. Cross reference with Dylan on "Just Like a Woman"
for something which is just plain nasty IMHO...
<p>
I remember someone was saying about how TQATS might not be specifically
to do with Eliazbeth I as the lyric was too universal. Although I take
your point on this, and agree there are many interpretations, I don`t
think the *possibly* specific reference is in contradiction with other
suggested readings. One thing about a *really* good song like this is
that it may offer a lot of potential meanings, including but in no way
limited to those consciously intended by Suzanne Vega. Reading through
this thread as it has grown has increased my enjoyment of a favourite
song, and I would love sometime to talk about Marlene on the Wall in
the same way if it hasn`t been done to death already here:)

Thanks for the support Tanita on the QEI interpretation.
<p>
I never meant to suggest that Suzanne had intended to specifically write a
song chronicalling the life of QEI.  As Tanita was writing, a great song has
many layers to unpack--one layer may be the reference to QEI and her own
sexual politics--this scratches the surface and I think the rest of my
Undertow friends have done a fine job in digging in deep.
<p>
When dealing w/ issues of power/politics/and gender, who better to look at
that an historical figure who used all of these things to her advantage.
 Really, that's what the song is getting out--using sexual politics and
position to one's own advantage.  Had the soldier been in charge--or been
able to get at the Queen's heart--perhaps she would have had to relinquish
some power.  Instead, she desperately holds on to her own sense of identity
and does away with anyone who might threaten that--like the bothersome
soldier.
<p>
Perhaps we can look at the Queen as not wanting to be weakened by love
(position wise)--because in some ways she is weak.  Love/male dominance--it
all poses a threat to her position as Queen. QEI is just the historical
figure who lived such a life--had such a psyche.

Actually, I'm unfamiliar with the Alice Cooper version of "Only Women
Bleed." I've only heard Pee Shy cover the song, with two women singing to 
the accompaniment of a slow accordion and keyboards. It comes across as 
very mournful and perhaps not at all what Mr. Cooper intended. But the 
man-as-heartless-swine theme is certainly intact.
