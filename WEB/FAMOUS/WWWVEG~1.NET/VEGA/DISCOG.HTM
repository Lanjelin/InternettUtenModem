<PRE>
Suzanne Vega wrote the forward to a book by Amnesty International, called
<I>Childhood Lost</I>, about the political abuses of children.  The book was
launched in the UK recently.

Suzanne Vega was asked by Philip Glass to sing a song for a movie he is
working on -- he is writing the music, not sure who wrote the words -- the
director of the movie is a Brazilian woman.

A promotional video was filmed for the Hector Zazou song "The Long Voyage"
from the album <I>Songs from the Cold Seas</I> (CD 94.12? FR Columbia (Sony) COL
477585 2), featuring Suzanne Vega.

D.A. Pennebaker filmed a documentary about Suzanne Vega during her <I>Days of
Open Hand</I> tour (Spring 1990) in England, but the film was never finished.
A shortened version has been aired, called <I>Portrait of an Artist</I>, very
different from the album of the same name.

The Lemonheads covered Luka on their album <I>Lick</I> (CD US Taang! TAANG! 32),
and released the song as a single (7" US Taang! TAANG! 31).

On her 1988 album <I>Good Thing He Can't Read My Mind</I>, Christine Lavin
performs the song "Mysterious Woman", a tribute to (and perhaps parody of)
Suzanne Vega.

The limited edition CD package for <I>Days of Open Hand</I> won the the Best
Packaging award in the 1992 Grammy Awards.  There was a small notebook with
a soft cover called <I>Book Of Dreams</I> for use as a personal dream logbook
released as a promotional item.

``Weird Al'' Yankovic covers a small portion of "Tom's Diner" in his song
"Polka Your Eyes Out" on his album <I>Off The Deep End</I> (CD US Scotti Bros
72392 75256-2).

Information flagged with a question mark has not been verified (a guess,
a rumour).  If you have further information about these or other related
releases, please write me.

Many CD track times were found using my compact disc player and the
time indicated on your CD player may vary slightly (+/- 1-3 seconds),
due to the way different machines calculate track times.

While the existence of unauthorized recordings is documented herein,
I cannot advise on the legality of such recordings, nor can I advise
where such recordings can be obtained.  Please do not ask where to
find bootlegs, rare recordings, videos, or other releases.  I don't
have any to trade or sell and I'm not interested in doing so.  Try
record shows and collector magazines.
