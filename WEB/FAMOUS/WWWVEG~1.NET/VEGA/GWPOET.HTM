<i>Is Suzanne Vega the start of a new folk boom? Was she really influenced by
punk rock? And what does she think of our very own Morrissey?</i>
<p>

Have you heard the one about the kid from "Fame" who turned out all right?
Or the folk singer who'd rather be a member of the Velvet Underground and
admits to sharing the same black humour as Morrissey of the Smiths?
<p>
Meet Suzanne Vega - the singer/songwriter who's leading the New York folk
movement belatedly into this decade with singles like "Small Blue Thing"
and the currently re-released "Marlene On The Wall".
<p>
Already her ethereal, introspective, almost neurotic style of music - owing
nods of acknowledgement to such diverse people as Patti Smith, Laurie
Anderson and Lou Reed - has secured her self-titled debut album a modest
run in both the British and American LP charts.
<p>
Born in Santa Monica, California, 26 years ago to a Puerto Rican father and
an American mother, she's lived in New York since the age of two. Her first
love was dancing, which she studied at the infamous High School of
Performing Arts - the real-life home of the film and TV series "Fame".
<p>
"I was there before the film. After the movie it had a new glamour and
probably changed the attitude of a lot of the kids there. A lot of the kids
I knew were fairly arrogant and, I must admit, I was too. Everyone who goes
there feels misunderstood in some way and it's heightened because everyone
has a special talent and wants to be noticed. It was worse for me because I
had the sort of competitive nature that If I couldn't be the best, then I'd
be the worst - I'd get noticed somehow. It becomes fairly unhealthy after a
while."
<p>
Her interest in music grew when she realised the joy of dance classes was
dependent on who played piano. While majoring in English at college, she
was auditioning at the many Bohemian folk clubs in Greenwich Village.
<p>
"I was always being told that I was too shy, too quiet - a nice folkie
girl. "If you'd been born 10 years before you'd be a big star, but now...
come back when you're more professional". There was one side to me which
said I had the talent and another which kept pulling me off stage. I'd get
up and be overwhelmingly shy and hostile to audiences - sort of "what are
you looking at?"."
<p>
After years of writing songs and being influenced by Woody Guthrie, two
events changed her direction. The first was seeing Lou Reed and the second
was experiencing the British punk scene.
<p>
"I went to Lou Reed almost by mistake. To me rock'n'roll was noise and who
needs more noise in New York City? But his songs really stuck out. They
weren't safe - they really went out on a ledge. It made me feel horribly
uncomfortable and that was something I couldn't forget. At his best he
doesn't write about run of the mill things. He writes with complete
unpretension about things he knows in a way that's so direct it's
uncomfortable."
<p>
"When I came to Britain I saw punk in a different way to what I'd seen in
America. In New York punk was rich middle class kids ripping their shirts
and making a lot of noise about nothing. In Britain I saw it as a means of
personal expression."
<p>
"Before that, the only kind of anger I'd seen expressed was black or Puerto
Rican. White people in America don't express anger so directly - it's
masked, subtle and ironic. It was the first time I'd seen anger expressed
by white people and it made an impression on me. As soon as I came back to
New York I started to write in a different way."
<p>
Now she's at the forefront of a whole new generation of Greenwich Village
inhabitants all poised to slide into her slipstream.
<p>
"I was in a quandary about how to define myself. We all consider ourselves
to be folk writers - but that's not to say that it's folk music. There are
a whole lot of people who won't listen to folk and say "it's so gauche, so
overly sincere and so naive". But it is possible to write music that's
simple and unaffected but can still be in vogue. It's now a lot more
contemporary than people think."
<p>
Her album was co-produced by Lenny Kaye, the ex-rock critic and guitarist
with Patti Smith's band.
<p>
"Since my own experience had been very conservative, I thought it'd be good
to have Lenny in as a random element. I ended up having to defend electric
guitars and drums to him which is not something you'd expect from someone
who played with Patti Smith. He wanted strings. I thought - "how
disgusting, what sort of girl do you thing I am?". In the long run he made
me keep an open mind."
<p>
"There are two sides that fight against each other in me. One wants to be
in control, very proper and restrained. The other wants to be John Cale -
completely unpredictable and challenging."
<p>
"I may look like I come from Connecticut and sound like I come from
California but I have a New York sensibility. There's a definite humour
that comes from New York. It's a form of the black humour you find in most
cities."
<p>
"I sense it in Morrissey of the Smith's writing. To me Morrissey is very
funny, but most people think he's depressing. He's actually brilliant in
the way he puts two lines together and is completely absurd, but it works
well."
