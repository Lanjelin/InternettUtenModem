<A NAME="tired"><h2><b><i>Tired Of Sleeping</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
             Oh Mom, the dreams are not so bad<br>
             It's just that there's so much to do<br>
             And I'm tired of sleeping<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, the old man is telling me something<br>
             His eyes are wide and his mouth is thin<br>
             And I just can't hear what he's saying<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking<br>
             It's just that there's so much to do<br>
             And I'm tired of sleeping<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, the kids are playing in pennies<br>
             They're up to their knees in money<br>
             And the dirt of the churchyard steps<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, that man he ripped out his lining<br>
             He tore out a piece of his body<br>
             To show us his "clean quilted heart"<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking<br>
             It's just that there's so much to do<br>
             And I'm tired of sleeping<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, the bird on the string is hanging<br>
             Her bones are twisting and dancing<br>
             She's fighting for her small life<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking<br>
             It's just that there's so much to do<br>
             And I'm tired of sleeping<br>
<p>
             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking<br>
             It's just that there's so much to do<br>
             And I'm tired of sleeping<br>

<A NAME="men"><h2><b><i>Men In A War</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
             Men in a war<br>
             If they've lost a limb<br>
             Still feel that limb<br>
             As they did before<br>
<p>
             He lay on a cot<br>
             He was drenched in a sweat<br>
             He was mute and staring<br>
             But feeling the thing<br>
             He had not<br>
<p>
             I know how it is<br>
             When something is gone<br>
             A piece of your eyesight<br>
             Or maybe your vision<br>
<p>
             A corner of sense<br>
             Goes blank on the screen<br>
             A piece of the scan<br>
             Gets filled in by hand<br>
<p>
             You know that it was<br>
             And now it is not<br>
             So you just make do with<br>
             Whatever you've got<br>
<p>
             Men in a war<br>
             If they've lost a limb<br>
             Still feel that limb<br>
             As they did before<br>
<p>
             If your nerve is cut<br>
             If you're kept on the stretch<br>
             You don't feel your will<br>
             You can't find your gut<br>
<p>
             And she lay on her back<br>
             She made sure she was hid<br>
             She was mute and staring<br>
             Not feeling the thing<br>
             That she did<br>
<p>
             I know how it is<br>
             When something is gone<br>

<p>
             Now the time has come to speak<br>
             I was not able<br>
             And water through a rusted pipe<br>
             Could make the sense that I do<br>
<p>
             Gurgle, mutter<br>
             Hiss, stutter<br>
             Moan the words like water<br>
             Rush and foam and choke<br>
<p>
             Having waited<br>
             This long of a winter<br>
             I fear I only<br>
             Croak and sigh<br>
<p>
             Somewhere deep within<br>
             Hear the creak<br>
             That lets the tale begin<br>
<p>
             Now the time has come to move<br>
             I was not able<br>
             Water through a rusted pipe<br>
             Could make the moves that I do<br>
<p>
             Stagger, stumble<br>
             Trip, fumble<br>
             I fear I only<br>
             Slip and slide<br>
<p>
             Somewhere deep within<br>
             Hear the creak<br>
             That lets the tale begin<br>
<p>
             Somewhere deep within<br>
             Hear the creak<br>

             I took your urgent whisper<br>
             Stole the arc of a white wing<br>
             Rode like foam on the river of pity<br>
             Turned its tide to strength<br>
             Healed the hole that ripped in living<br>

             In my book of dreams<br>
             In my book of dreams<br>
<p>
             The spine is bound to last a life<br>
             Tough enough to take the pounding<br>
             Pages made of days of open hand<br>
<p>
             In my book of dreams<br>
             In my book of dreams<br>

             Number every page in silver<br>
             Underline in magic marker<br>
             Take the name of every prisoner<br>
             Yours is there my word of honor<br>
<p>
             I took your urgent whisper<br>
             Stole the arc of a white wing<br>
             Rode like foam on the river of pity<br>

             The walls are cracked and dim<br>
             And we are standing in a line<br>
             Waiting for our faces to be seen<br>

             Of a man with his hand<br>
             In a fist<br>
<p>
             Is a woman who's drinking<br>
             And her dress is so tight<br>
             You can see every breath<br>
             That she takes<br>
<p>
             Every sigh, every sway<br>
             You can hear everything that they say<br>

             Or a fast love affair<br>
<p>
             The man on the wall<br>
             Is his symbol of freedom<br>
             It means he has brothers<br>

<p>
             She is moved by<br>

             Or a fast love affair<br>
<p>
             She leans against him<br>
             Her dress is so red<br>
             They talk of the salt<br>
             And the truth and the bread<br>

             The night goes along<br>
             The fan goes around<br>

             He said you look from your direction<br>
             I said I like to keep perspective<br>
<p>
             Close to the middle of the network<br>
             It seems we're looking for a center<br>
             What if it turns out to be hollow?<br>
             We could be fixing what is broken<br>
<p>
             Between the pen and the paperwork<br>
             There must be passion in the language<br>
             Between the muscle and the brain work<br>
             There must be feeling in the pipeline<br>
<p>
             Beyond the duty and the discipline<br>
             I know there's anger in a cold place<br>
             All feelings fall into the big space<br>
             Swept up like garbage on the week-end<br>
<p>
             Between the pen and the paperwork<br>
             There must be passion in the language<br>

             There must be feeling in the pipeline<br>
<p>
             All feeling<br>

             All feeling<br>
             Swept into the<br>

<p>
             Between the pen and the paperwork<br>
             I'm sure there's passion in the language<br>
             Between the muscle and the brain work<br>
             I know there's feeling in the pipeline<br>

             I hum to you<br>
             I've come to you<br>
             I touch you<br>
<p>
             I tell you<br>
             I love you<br>
             I sing to you<br>
             Bring to you<br>
             Anything<br>
<p>
             Her little heart<br>
             It beats so fast<br>
             Her body trembles<br>
             With the effort to last<br>
<p>
             I hug you<br>
             I hum to you<br>
             I've come to you<br>
             I touch you<br>
<p>
             I tell you<br>
             I love you<br>
             I sing to you<br>
             Bring to you<br>
             Anything<br>
<p>
             She's going home<br>
             Tomorrow at ten<br>
             The question is<br>
             Will she try it again?<br>

             This line is burning<br>
             Turning to ash as it hits the air<br>
             Every step is a day in the week<br>
             It's a Sunday or Monday<br>
             A march over months of the year<br>
<p>
             This life is burning<br>
             Turning to ash as it hits the air<br>
             Every death is an end in the race<br>
             It's a stopping and starting<br>
             A march over millions of years<br>

             Travel. Arrival<br>
             Years of an inch and a step<br>

             This land is burning<br>

             Every line is a place on a map<br>
             It's a city or valley<br>
             A mark on these miles of fields<br>
<p>
             Travel. Arrival<br>
             Years of an inch and a step<br>
