I agree with most of your interpretation, although
my read on it is slightly different on a couple of points.<p>

For this bit I think Suzanne was trying to say that
she (the transsexual) was 'more girl than girls'
are because she was so positive about her femaleness
that she had to change her gender despite the biological
evidence.  Most women don't have the same conviction
on femininity - because they just are and don't think
about it..<p>

Or dark as in hidden... her secret that she keeps from
the people she meets..<p>

I just took this as the curtain being a metaphor for
her skirt.  Suzy was just curious about what was (or wasn't!)
between her legs.. 'if I pull this (skirt) off, would I
know for certain?', whether she had had the surgery ('felt
the steel side of the knife').<p>

I disagree.  In the early days of this list, someone posted
that they had heard that this song was just about a waitress
in a bar that Suzanne had been in.<p>

I think that the straightforward explanation works best.
It's just expressing Suzannes curiousity about this
person, albeit in her inimitable poetic style which we
all love.<p>

Ok, my 2c...<p>

On the one hand, I line up with the straightforward explanation folks--the
sex-change thing makes perfect sense. I would not have assumed that Suzanne
was striving for ambiguity here as much as for an original, memorable turn of
phrase-- sort of in the (midcareer era) Joni Mitchell school of
songwriting... a lyric fragment of Joni's comes particularly to mind: she
once sang the words "between the forceps and the stone" to mean "from birth
to death."  Obviously the second way is the direct meaning, but the first way
is a great turn of phrase, and anything that makes you stop and interpret for
a moment or two provides, IMO, a richer experience as a
listener/reader/whatever.<p>

On the other hand, Hugo does bring up an interesting point:<p>

>there must be some, conscious or unconscious, intention, and<br>
>therefore I think alternative symbolic (rather than  metaphorical)<br>
>interpretations arecalled for<p>

With artists whose work you value, speculation on unconscious intention can,
obviously, be an interesting exercise. My mind is sorta blank right now, but
I seem to remember some recurring knife and/or cutting imagery in other SV
songs-- "Straight Lines" come immediately to mind but I'm sure there are
others.. Haven't thought too long or hard about what this  may mean. Plus, of
course, there's the ongoing, underlying flesh/blood motif for the whole
"99.9F" album, so asking about a sex-change operation in a way that
accentuates the, um, mutilation involved probably fits in.<p>

Now, gee, why am i rambling on and on about this? Clearly, because I have
work of my own to do and I'm *procrastinating* big time.. <p>

What in the world are you talking about?  There _is_ no "simple, prosaic,
boring interpretation" of those line... it _is_ a metaphor.  There is not a
"straight forward" way to interpret the lines. If it was not meant to be
interpreted in a metaphoric way it would say "did you ever have the
sex-change operation?"<p>

Suzanne is, in the best traditions of poetics and songwriting, saying
something in an artistic way, and so lines might be able to be interpreted in
many ways.  As an English major that studies all kinds of works of art
involving language and as a writer I resent this implication that one
interpretation is "better" than another, especially for these kind of deep
metaphoric lines.  _Any_ interpretation is valid if you can show some sort of
evidence and/or background to back it up.  That is what you did and that is
what I did.<p>

Subject: Re: Steel Side of the Knife<p>


Okey, folks, here is my SIMPLE interpretation of As Girls Go:<p>

The narrator, I venture to call her Suzanne, is sitting in a local
restaurant, waiting for her food. She is looking at the waitress, a
stunning girl. She never really thought of it before -- but there is
something vaguely masculine about the waitress. Still, she looks very
much like a girl... <p>

         You make a really good girl<br>
         As girls go<br>
         Still kind of look like a guy<br>
         I never thought to wonder why<p>

"But there IS something strange about her... Could she be a guy
underneath? I wonder...<p>

         If I could pull this off<br>
         Would I know for certain<br>
         The real situation<br>
         Behind the curtain<p>

"Well, there's something unnatural about the her, something strained,
but she is very beautiful none the less... <p>

         So beautiful<br>
         Damsel in distress<br>
         Not exactly natural<br>
         But stunning none the less<p>

"Must be a guy ... she looks too feminine ... a transvestite. Or maybe
she's had an operation. But why?<p>

         What happened to you?<br>
         To make you more girl than girls are<p>

"I guess I'll never know. I wonder if she even asks herself... She
seems alright so far...<p>

         Would you ever show or tell<br>
         Cause you're so good so far<p>

"But if we dig a bit... What happened, really?<p>

         Let's chronicle<br>
         The dark side of a life<br>
         Did you ever keep the date<br>
         With the steel side of the knife<p>

"Well, it's really none of my business... Besides, it really doesn't
matter.<p>

         Doesn't matter to me<br>
         Which side of the line<br>
         You happen to be<br>
         At any given time<p>

"And she looks good..."<p>

         You make a really good girl...<p>

***<p>

Suzanne is just sitting there, observing and thinking to herself. No
need for a dialogue, changing of perspectives, flashbacks, or
anything. It probably didn't happen just like this, but if you want a
simple interpretation, I think this one might do.
<p>
Now, why would Suzanne write a song about this??? Surely not to account
for what was going on in her mind during a few minutes when she was
waiting for her food in a restaurant! There must be something else...
<p>
My theory -- and of this I'm pretty sure -- is that something in the
situation fascinated Suzanne, meant something to her. But she didn't
quite know what. So she kept thinking about it, and eventually, she
wrote a song.<p>

If this is what happened, can you really say that the song is *about*
sitting in a restaurant, wondering if the waitress has undergone a sex
change operation? I don't think so. It was certainly *inspired* by this
situation, but I would rather say that it is based on something inside
the poet: a true feeling, and an understanding of the world and of
other people based on personal experience. The transvestite, and the
situation (s)he seemed to be in, had a *symbolic* significance for
Suzanne (I'm certainly not implying that she has been a transvestite
herself!), and in the process of writing, this largely intuitive
understanding was constellated into a poetic image, a song, that can
mean something to all of us.<p>

I think this is the power of great art: To discover the general in the
particular; the meaning and significance in the mundane.<p>

This is why I think a symbolic interpretation is more interesting than
a "simple, prosaic" one. In a way, we are on shakier ground trying to
find symbolic meanings -- that's why I started this thread in the first
place -- but at the same time we are not. Mutually exclusive symbolical
interpretations can coexist peacefully, just like a ray of light is
both a particle and an electromagnetic wave at the same time, depending
on how we, as observers, look at it.<p>

So here is my personal metaphorical interpretation. First, though, I
want to make it absolutely clear that I'm talking about what the song
means to *me* -- I know virtually nothing about the psychology or
physiology of transvestitism -- so please don't call me prejudiced.<p>

What do I recognise in the transvestite? The feeling of not being at
home where I have been placed, that the life I'm living is not
authentically mine. That is has been imposed on me from the outside.
That it is "living suicide", to quote the title of a song Suzanne wrote
in her teens. So I want to find my true life somewhere else. The
transvestite could also be a symbol of someone who has actually managed
to take his/her life in his/her own hand -- and that's the beauty of
it. But not without sacrifice, so there must be a dark (hidden, unseen,
unconscious, painful, perhaps evil) side, too.<p>

This is where I though the question, "Did you ever keep the date / With
the steel side of the knife", could reveal something interesting
through a double meaning of the word 'date". I may have been wrong, or
perhaps my language, inspired by the bulk of Jungian literature I've
been reading lately, was unintelligible. So I'll try to repeat my point
a bit more clearly.<p>

Let us assume that the main meaning is, "Did you undergo an operation
to change your sex?" Let us also pretend, for a moment, that the lines
have a second meaning, "Did you ever record/mark your life with the
sharpness of a knife?" Together, these two interpretations could mean,
that the poetic significance of the operation was to make life
tangible, real, and authentic by making a cut that separates old and
new, infinitely close, yet totally different, like the two sides of the
edge of the knife.<p>

Despite the fact that this interpretation doesn't seem to appeal to
anyone else, it continues to fascinate me. But I have also learned a
lot from all your postings. Perhaps the most interesting is that the
operation seems to be so central in the song. I guess I had ignored
that aspect (an act of repression, to be sure). A surgical operation,
in itself, has a tremendous symbolic significance, not to mention the
physiological one. I remember what I felt when I read that Suzanne had
been delivered by c-section...<p>

Before signing off, here is a quotation from an interview with Suzanne
that I think expresses almost everything I've tried to say in this
post:<p>

"A lot of people say I'm very observational, but I'm really much more
involved than I pretend. These are not just clinical observations about
people. There is a direct connection between me and the person I'm
writing about. There was a boy named Luka but he was not abused. He's
probably shocked to death that I put him in this song.<p>

"[In] the things I'm writing about, I'm revealing some facet of my own
life. It's something that I've seen or been involved with. It's not
just a question of reading a paper and saying, 'That's a good topic. I
think I'll write a Gulf War song.' That to me is too academic. I think,
in order for it to ring true, you have to know what you're talking
about. It's not enough just to *look* and say, 'This is what I deduce.'
You have to be involved."<p>

         /Hugo<p>

P.S. Perhaps it's time to start a new thread on the song Undertow. I
think a lot more could be said about that song...<p>

P.P.S. Please do send me a copy of your 79k analysis of Wooden Horse, Bob.<p>

<p>
Hi all,<p>

While browsing through some old copies of 'Language'
(published by the Suzanne Vega Info Center) I came across the
Suzanne Vega / Leonard Cohen double interview, and in it
Suzanne talks about "As Girls Go" as well, amongst many many
other things. I hope this doesn't kill the threads with all
your interpretations - I'm never any good at interpreting
lyrics myself, or rather, at putting my interpretations into
words, especially in another language, but I enjoy reading
them. :)<p>

Here's what she said about "As Girls Go" back then.<p>

  "In that song it's wondering how far did this person take
their own wish to be somebody else. You know, that's a song
about a woman, by all appearances she's a woman except that
you know she's a man. So you see someone like this who seems
very rare. This one particular person had a very rare quality
which you could kind of understand after you realized what her
situation was. But, it didn't explain everything. It just made
her extremely attractive and so you felt yourself drawn into
her because of this rare quality and then you start to wonder
how far did the whole thing go, and does the whole thing go.
How much pain does this person put themselves through in order
to present this extremely attractive appearance, this
extremely graceful and beautiful appearance. So that was my
question. I mean, I never found out the answer. I didn't need
to know the answer. It was more just the way this person was
alluring."<p>

(Suzanne Vega in Language, Vol. 6, no 1, February 1993. The
meeting with Leonard Cohen took place sometime in Autumn
1992.)<p>

Best wishes,<p>

Okey, folks, here is my SIMPLE interpretation of As Girls Go:<p>

The narrator, I venture to call her Suzanne, is sitting in a local
restaurant, waiting for her food. She is looking at the waitress, a
stunning girl. She never really thought of it before -- but there is
something vaguely masculine about the waitress. Still, she looks very
much like a girl... <p>

         You make a really good girl<br>
         As girls go<br>
         Still kind of look like a guy<br>
         I never thought to wonder why<p>

"But there IS something strange about her... Could she be a guy
underneath? I wonder...<p>

         If I could pull this off<br>
         Would I know for certain<br>
         The real situation<br>
         Behind the curtain<p>

"Well, there's something unnatural about the her, something strained,
but she is very beautiful none the less... <p>

         So beautiful<br>
         Damsel in distress<br>
         Not exactly natural<br>
         But stunning none the less<p>

"Must be a guy ... she looks too feminine ... a transvestite. Or maybe
she's had an operation. But why?<p>

         What happened to you?<br>
         To make you more girl than girls are<p>

"I guess I'll never know. I wonder if she even asks herself... She
seems alright so far...<p>

         Would you ever show or tell<br>
         Cause you're so good so far<p>

"But if we dig a bit... What happened, really?<p>

         Let's chronicle<br>
         The dark side of a life<br>
         Did you ever keep the date<br>
         With the steel side of the knife<p>

"Well, it's really none of my business... Besides, it really doesn't
matter.<p>

         Doesn't matter to me<br>
         Which side of the line<br>
         You happen to be<br>
         At any given time<p>

"And she looks good..."<p>

         You make a really good girl...<p>

***<p>

Suzanne is just sitting there, observing and thinking to herself. No
need for a dialogue, changing of perspectives, flashbacks, or
anything. It probably didn't happen just like this, but if you want a
simple interpretation, I think this one might do.
<p>
Now, why would Suzanne write a song about this??? Surely not to account
for what was going on in her mind during a few minutes when she was
waiting for her food in a restaurant! There must be something else...
<p>
My theory -- and of this I'm pretty sure -- is that something in the
situation fascinated Suzanne, meant something to her. But she didn't
quite know what. So she kept thinking about it, and eventually, she
wrote a song.<p>

If this is what happened, can you really say that the song is *about*
sitting in a restaurant, wondering if the waitress has undergone a sex
change operation? I don't think so. It was certainly *inspired* by this
situation, but I would rather say that it is based on something inside
the poet: a true feeling, and an understanding of the world and of
other people based on personal experience. The transvestite, and the
situation (s)he seemed to be in, had a *symbolic* significance for
Suzanne (I'm certainly not implying that she has been a transvestite
herself!), and in the process of writing, this largely intuitive
understanding was constellated into a poetic image, a song, that can
mean something to all of us.<p>

I think this is the power of great art: To discover the general in the
particular; the meaning and significance in the mundane.<p>

This is why I think a symbolic interpretation is more interesting than
a "simple, prosaic" one. In a way, we are on shakier ground trying to
find symbolic meanings -- that's why I started this thread in the first
place -- but at the same time we are not. Mutually exclusive symbolical
interpretations can coexist peacefully, just like a ray of light is
both a particle and an electromagnetic wave at the same time, depending
on how we, as observers, look at it.<p>

So here is my personal metaphorical interpretation. First, though, I
want to make it absolutely clear that I'm talking about what the song
means to *me* -- I know virtually nothing about the psychology or
physiology of transvestitism -- so please don't call me prejudiced.<p>

What do I recognise in the transvestite? The feeling of not being at
home where I have been placed, that the life I'm living is not
authentically mine. That is has been imposed on me from the outside.
That it is "living suicide", to quote the title of a song Suzanne wrote
in her teens. So I want to find my true life somewhere else. The
transvestite could also be a symbol of someone who has actually managed
to take his/her life in his/her own hand -- and that's the beauty of
it. But not without sacrifice, so there must be a dark (hidden, unseen,
unconscious, painful, perhaps evil) side, too.<p>

This is where I though the question, "Did you ever keep the date / With
the steel side of the knife", could reveal something interesting
through a double meaning of the word 'date". I may have been wrong, or
perhaps my language, inspired by the bulk of Jungian literature I've
been reading lately, was unintelligible. So I'll try to repeat my point
a bit more clearly.<p>

Let us assume that the main meaning is, "Did you undergo an operation
to change your sex?" Let us also pretend, for a moment, that the lines
have a second meaning, "Did you ever record/mark your life with the
sharpness of a knife?" Together, these two interpretations could mean,
that the poetic significance of the operation was to make life
tangible, real, and authentic by making a cut that separates old and
new, infinitely close, yet totally different, like the two sides of the
edge of the knife.<p>

Despite the fact that this interpretation doesn't seem to appeal to
anyone else, it continues to fascinate me. But I have also learned a
lot from all your postings. Perhaps the most interesting is that the
operation seems to be so central in the song. I guess I had ignored
that aspect (an act of repression, to be sure). A surgical operation,
in itself, has a tremendous symbolic significance, not to mention the
physiological one. I remember what I felt when I read that Suzanne had
been delivered by c-section...<p>

Before signing off, here is a quotation from an interview with Suzanne
that I think expresses almost everything I've tried to say in this
post:<p>

"A lot of people say I'm very observational, but I'm really much more
involved than I pretend. These are not just clinical observations about
people. There is a direct connection between me and the person I'm
writing about. There was a boy named Luka but he was not abused. He's
probably shocked to death that I put him in this song.<p>

"[In] the things I'm writing about, I'm revealing some facet of my own
life. It's something that I've seen or been involved with. It's not
just a question of reading a paper and saying, 'That's a good topic. I
think I'll write a Gulf War song.' That to me is too academic. I think,
in order for it to ring true, you have to know what you're talking
about. It's not enough just to *look* and say, 'This is what I deduce.'
You have to be involved."<p>

         /Hugo<p>

P.S. Perhaps it's time to start a new thread on the song Undertow. I
think a lot more could be said about that song...<p>

P.P.S. Please do send me a copy of your 79k analysis of Wooden Horse, Bob.<p>

Subject: As Girls Go
<p>
Hi all,<p>

While browsing through some old copies of 'Language'
(published by the Suzanne Vega Info Center) I came across the
Suzanne Vega / Leonard Cohen double interview, and in it
Suzanne talks about "As Girls Go" as well, amongst many many
other things. I hope this doesn't kill the threads with all
your interpretations - I'm never any good at interpreting
lyrics myself, or rather, at putting my interpretations into
words, especially in another language, but I enjoy reading
them. :)<p>

Here's what she said about "As Girls Go" back then.<p>

  "In that song it's wondering how far did this person take
their own wish to be somebody else. You know, that's a song
about a woman, by all appearances she's a woman except that
you know she's a man. So you see someone like this who seems
very rare. This one particular person had a very rare quality
which you could kind of understand after you realized what her
situation was. But, it didn't explain everything. It just made
her extremely attractive and so you felt yourself drawn into
her because of this rare quality and then you start to wonder
how far did the whole thing go, and does the whole thing go.
How much pain does this person put themselves through in order
to present this extremely attractive appearance, this
extremely graceful and beautiful appearance. So that was my
question. I mean, I never found out the answer. I didn't need
to know the answer. It was more just the way this person was
alluring."<p>

(Suzanne Vega in Language, Vol. 6, no 1, February 1993. The
meeting with Leonard Cohen took place sometime in Autumn
1992.)<p>

Best wishes,<p>

 Subj:	"Date with the knife"<BR>

 As a pre-op (before sugery) transsexual woman, the words are quite clear 
 to me. The "date" is the sugery date. Much conversation with my fellow 
 transsexual women friends includes questions and statements about "Do you 
 have a date?" or "When is a your date?" for Sexual Reassgiment Sugery 
 (SRS).
 <p>
 The "dark side" is that sugery at best is a Faustian bargin. You don't 
 know how much feeling and sensitivity you will lose. You don't know much 
 much function you will gain. You do know you will pay thousands of 
 dollars of an unknown result. You man never be orgasmic again. What is 
 removed is lost forever. That is definitlly a dark side gamble
 <p>
 The question of the song is "What makes you a woman?" The curiosity is 
 "Does surgry make you a woman?" The short answer is NO. I knew I had a 
 "woman's sprit" long before I ever starting living as a woman. What 
 convenced me beyond a shadow of doubt that "I am woman" is the acceptance 
 and validation I got from non-transsexual woman. They recoginzed and 
 accepted me as "one of them" long before I could accept my being woman.
 <p>
 What really pisses me off is the implication that the words have any 
 thing to do with committing violence and harm by transsexual women. I 
 find that typical projection of the Male violence culture that all people 
 are forced to live in. Anything that seems to threat some poor male ego 
 is attacked with vingence and mayhem. (See what OJ did to Nicol) If 
 anything, both transsexual and non-transsexual women are beaten, raped, 
 murdered and other wise abused by "MEN" because we don't validate their 
 male egos. There is nothing I can ever do add to or detract from a 
 "man's" ego. That is totally in his control. But these men want to blame 
 women for their lack of being a man.

I agree with Dani's interpretation of "dark side of a life."  I would just like
to throw in my 2 cents worth...
<p>
In my opinion,  another possible interpretation of As Girls Go is that it is a
song to an object of desire who may have a past (dark side of a life) which the
narrator is willing to accept unconditionally.
