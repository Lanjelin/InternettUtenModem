<h4>Continued from Part 1...</h4>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>When making the third album, did you then try to make one of those
songs a radio hit as "Luka" was?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>The most obvious one, obviously, is "Book of Dreams."<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>That was your intention while writing it?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>When I wrote it, it was just an interesting idea.  And I thought,
let's do this with the chorus.  I had been listening to a lot of XTC at that
point.  Production.  Somewhere in the back of my mind I was thinking, this
will make everyone happy.  Which, of course, it didn't, and it doesn't.
[<i>Laughs</i>]<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>What was it that you did to the song to make people happy?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>You repeat the chorus a lot of times.  You make it bright.  You put
the hooks on it.  You decorate it with riffs and hooks.  But even so I think
my idea of what a pop song is is different than a record company's.  Because
they weren't sure at first what the single was going to be.  I was thinking
"It's obvious!"  I don't think they heard it.<p>
     I think it's a good song but most people seem to feel it's <i>very</i>
obscure.  And, again, it's one of those things where people say, "What
did you <i>mean</i> by 'Book of Dreams'?"  I said, "Well, 'in my book of dreams'
is a phrase, like 'in my wildest dreams, in my imagination.'"  That's the way
I meant it.  I didn't mean it as in my journal where I put my dreams that
I dream at night.  People think of it very literally.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>That's how I took it, that you were referring to an actual collection
of dreams.  I took it as a reference to Kerouac's <i>Book of Dreams</i>, which is
a very faithful record of his actual dreams.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Someone gave me that.  I read some of it.  I've never really been
into Kerouac, though my brother is.  You know, "Tired of Sleeping" is about
night dreams.  "Book of Dreams" is about day dreams and the future.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>The thing about Kerouac's book is that it's so revealing to write
down, uncensored, your actual dreams.  And he wrote in the introduction, "what
shame I'd feel to see such naked revelations so stated."  Which seems very
similar to the process of writing songs, and expressing those interior ideas
without the conscious mind getting in the way.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Right.  See, that's the hard part, when you start to have a little
jury of critics: journalists, record company executives, boyfriends, family
members, fans.  When you start to have those people speaking up and going,
"Hey, that won't work!"  You have to work through that.  Cause if you're really
a songwriter in your blood, your instincts will take over.  And once you're on
the right track, there's no stopping you, really.  Regardless of how famous
you are and how much money you have.  I think if you're really a songwriter,
once you start, your instincts will really guide you.  But you've got to get
rid of the critics.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>How do you do that?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Hide.  [<i>Laughs</i>]  You withdraw for a while.<p>
     Reading other people's stuff helps me.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>Songs?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>No, just other people's writing.  Annie Diller's writing, for me.
She writes essays.  She wrote a book called <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i> which
won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975.  It's mostly her observations on life and
nature and herself and art and fiction and she's just great, she's got this
great mind.  So you read her and you start to feel that you can do anything.
You start to feel lit up by her vision.  And so you can kind of <i>catch</i> it
from her, or from other people.  It's catching.  It's contagious.  You can
catch the spirit again.  But you have to be careful about that, to go towards
those things that will help you and not make you judgmental towards yourself,
or critical.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>So when you're writing, are you able to suspend that critical voice
or does it still enter into it?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Sometimes it still enters into it.  But I find recently that if
I'm writing about something that really interests me that the subject itself
just draws me in and I'm not thinking about what the newspaper is going to
say.  So that helps.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>When you're writing, do you actively guide the meaning of the song
or do you follow it?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>I try to do more following.  I find if I try to lead it, then you
get something that is stiff or contrived.  Whereas if you go back to the
original thing that provoked you to write the song, there's some answer in
there.  It's outside of yourself.  It's in the situation that you're writing
about.  That's where the answer is if you get into trouble.  I find that I
feel more that I'm following something that is already there.  There's a way
of arranging the information so that it will make sense and be beautiful.
And so it will be all in harmony and everything will feel right.  And it's a
question of wiggling it around until it falls into place.<p>
     A song, when it is really well done, feels balanced and it feels right.
It's a question of manipulating it a little bit here and there, a little bit
every day, for months, until it falls down, falls into the music.  That's
the way it feels to me.<p>
     You have to write about something real in the world.  You can't just
say, "Oh, I'll write about this."  It has to be based on something actual.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>In your own life?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Yeah.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>When you mentioned the way songs will fall into place, I thought
of your song "Men In A War" --</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>That was hard [<i>Laughs</i>] to write.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>I can imagine.  It revolves around the idea of a phantom limb, that
one would still feel a leg or an arm even after it is cut off, which isn't
the easiest idea to get into a song.  And the song is so perfectly balanced.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>That was a weird one, because I was not paying attention.  I was
driving somewhere in a car and it appeared almost like a telegram in my
mind.  Men in a war.  And that's basically a medical fact.  I thought, "I'd
better write this down, because it's such a strange idea."  And I thought,
"Well, what are you after?  What are you trying to say?"  I wanted to bring
the comparison of violence to your body.  Whether it happens through a war,
or whether it happens through sexual violence.  The woman in the song is
experiencing sexual violence.  Some people don't get that, and they think
she's getting an abortion.  To me, there's a parallel between the two
experiences.  To me, that was valid enough reason to write the song.<p>
     But it was very hard.  People listen to it, and it's not a clear anti-war
song.  It's not "We must end the war."  Some people listen to it and they
don't know how to feel.  Except that when you sing it live, it really has
a strong impact.  And everybody just seems to start getting up and jumping
around.    Not dancing with joy, but just moving.  The rhythm of it and
the intensity of it just seems to <i>hit</i>.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>When I heard it, I didn't even think of war as much as how we have
to deal with reality, that we still feel things even after they're gone.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Yeah.  When you receive a bulletin like that:  "Men in a war who
have lost a limb...", you start to think, "What am I trying to say and
what is the reason for it?"  And it's not so important that you state it
in a song but that you know what it is.  Because that's what forms the
secret heart of your song.<p>
     People, when they listen, want to know what you're singing about.  And
if you know what it is, they'll know what it is.  Not even that you have to
say it, but if you know what it is, then they'll know.  Because it will be
there in the structure.<p>
     That one I don't know if I pulled off.  That one took a long time for
all the pieces to fall into place, and I still wasn't sure.  I think if it
were a perfect song, I probably would have edited out some more and done
something else.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>It's a challenging idea to get into a song, and that seems like a
signature of your work, that you will get some pretty ambitious concepts
into a song, things most people wouldn't try.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>I try.  Those things are interesting to me.  If I'm going to write
a song, I might as well try to write something that hasn't been heard before.<p>
     Although my <i>ideal</i>, and I have to say lately, I've been listening to
Elvis Costello, all of his songs over the last ten years, and the great thing
about what he does is that he still writes about love, thwarted ambition,
jealousy, all these basic things in life that aren't particularly ambitious.
Everybody writes about love.  But at the same time he'll do it in a way that
it's his and it's distinctive.  He's not afraid to use long words, he's not
afraid to use his vocabulary.  He's not afraid to say, "I want you," and say
it over and over again for five minutes.  And it's still unmistakably Elvis
Costello.<p>
     As a songwriter, I need to be able to say those things that are a part
of everyday life:  I need you, I want you.  War must end.  How you get to
say them without sounding like a jerk or sounding simplistic, that's my next
challenge.  Because everyone says, "Oh, she's so intellectual."  But I <i>am</i>
trying to communicate.  How do you say it but say it in such a way that it
seems as if they haven't heard it before?<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>It seems that you answer that question in your work by your use
of images.  You use pictures that show us something that allows us to feel for
ourselves, rather than be told something.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>That's what I find beautiful.  I found that to be one of Dylan's
strengths.  Not that he said war must end, which he did, but when he said,
"A hard rain's gonna fall," and used the images of "white ladder covered
with water" and "white man walking a white dog."  All of these images have
mystery in them and <i>they</i> say racism must end and all men must be brothers.
But they don't come out and say it.  They have it within the images, which
we recognize from our own lives.  And that to me is where his strength was.
Not that he was a great politician, but that he was a great poet and he used
those images to reveal those basic messages.  Because it's not about messages.
If it was just about printing messages, you could write a pamphlet or a 
bulletin on index cards and pass them out.  So it's obviously not just
messages that we're trying to give.  It's got to work on some other level.<p>
