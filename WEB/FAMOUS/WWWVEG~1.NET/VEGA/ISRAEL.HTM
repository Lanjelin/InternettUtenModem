Hi everyone.
<p>
My name is Adi and I've been lurking this mailing list for quite a time.
I'm from Israel , and I'm very sorry to say that I haven't seen SV performing
in Caesaria, I guess I was too young at the time.
I can say that she haven't performed in Israel since then, and that there are
many Israely Suzanne Vega fans looking forward for such a performance (hint
hint...).
<p>
happy new year

Hi you all!
<p>
Another Israeli fan here :-) - surprisingly enough, who didn't see the 
performance either...
<p>
Maybe with enough pressure around here on the 'net, someone would hear our 
call.
<p>
Happy New Year to you all,

Hi, my post will sound similar to Dan and Efrat's...  
<p>
The local Israeli Defense Forces Radio broadcasted the Caesaria concert
and I was home, jealous of the crowds who went to see Suzanne.  I admit
I only knew 'Luka' at that time, but that's no excuse.
<p>
Well, will someone -hear our call- and organize a Middle-East tour?

Well, I have been to the concert in Caesaria (the second of the
two), and it was probably the best concert I've been to. I was 
sitting at the rigth side of the stage, and the wind was blowing
from behind Suzanne, causing her hair to flow over the top of 
her head and cover her face, which was quite impressive (Imagine 
standing with your back to a BIG fan turned to max power).
<p>
Greating to everyone from me, Amitai Irron at Tel-Aviv University,

Alas, I did not see that concert in Caesaria - and even worse, there was 
no others. Wish there was... :(<br>

No, you're most certanly NOT the first Israeli who entered Suzanne's Web 
site, or in this list... We've done it before.... - BUT! it's good to have 
you around now, since we all (i.e. all the Israelis here) are trying to 
"arange" some sort of a Middle-East tour, cause a lot of us seemed to have 
missed Suzanne's performance at Caisaria.
<p>
Someone hear the call of the people of Israel....

And yet another Suzanne Vega fan from Israel who didn't see her on '89 
(no excuse there - just plain stupidity) and looking fwd to seeing her.
<p>
I guess it's ok to hope...
