Subj:	In-stores and World Before Columbus<br>
Date:	96-09-11 23:38:17 EDT<br>
From:	Suzanne Vega<br>
To:	undertow@serv4.law.emory.edu<br>

Hi gang --
<p>
Sorry it has been a while since I posted but as you might imagine, I've been
busy.  It's been fun meeting some of you on this radio and in-store promo
tour I'm doing -- I like connecting faces to the names I see so often!
<p>
There were a couple of things I wanted to clarify -- someone posted recently
complaining about the imagery of World Before Columbus, saying there were
other explorers before Columbus who proved the world was round, and that the
line "cruel as the  world before Columbus" was one that my Puerto-Rican
stepfather wouldn't have liked, implying, I guess that I was talking about
the cruelty of Native Americans? or indiginous people in general?
<p>
Normally I let criticisms go, but this one offends me because it is not what
I mean, not how I was raised, and not what I believe.  To me, the main image
of this song is that of the world being flat if this person's love were taken
away.  Nowhere do I mention Indians.  A flat world (surrounded by demons)
that one could fall off and never get back to is my idea of a cruel world.
 Similarly, when I say the world could be as "dark as the world before
Columbus" I am NOT talking about Africa, savages or anything like that,
implying that Columbus somehow civilized the world and made it bearable.
<p>
I am only referring to the one belief -- that the world was flat.   That's
all.  As for the other explorers you mentioned -- their names don't sing as
well.  I guess the choruses are clear enough.  Most of the time I don't mind
interpretations, but I found this one offensive.
<p>
I also wanted to answer Charlie's question of a month or two ago -- before he
shelled out the money for the new album he wanted my position on gay rights,
marriage, adoption, the whole shebang.  For the record, I think gay people
should have the right to marry, with all the privileges of marriage -- no, I
don't think it tears at the moral fiber of society, (as someone suggested); I
think quite the opposite.  But I don't think you should buy the album because
of  my political beliefs!  I am not running for office.  But since you wanted
my position -- there it is.
<p>
I enjoyed the live chat the other night!   I'll see you soon!  It's been an
exciting week.  Thanks to everyone --
<p>
love,<br>
Suzanne

Subj:	New York City Show at Tower Records<br>
From:    Unique212@aol.com<br>
Date:	09/11/96<br>
To:	undertow@law.emory.edu<br>
<p>
Hi webmates,
<p>
The New York City Tower Records at Broadway and 4th Street was the site of the first concert of the 
in-store promotion tour at approximately 6 p.m. Tuesday evening.  Suzanne was in fine voice, and played 
a new small-bodied mahogany Taylor guitar which sounded wonderful.  She was accompanied by Mitchell 
Froom on myriad keyboards and synths and Mike Visceglia on bass (alternating with electric guitar) as well 
as a tambourine-and-cymbal setup which he occasionally played with his left foot.  There was a large 
audience turnout, and an autograph-signing session followed the show.
<p>
SV was announced as being "direct from Tribeca," the neighborhood in downtown NYC where she lives. 
 SV said she was very pleased to be starting the record-release tour in New York instead of Europe for a 
change.  She mentioned that it reminded her of her first in-store at the same Tower location about 12 years
 ago (just after she quit her day job as a receptionist) when an overenthusiastic fan  was silenced by 
another audience member saying "Shut up, Dick" in a no-nonsense tone which became the watchword 
of that tour.  
<p>
The songs were (I think this is the correct order):
<p>
Rock in This Pocket (Song of David) <br>
Marlene on the Wall<br>
Blood Makes Noise<br>
World Before Columbus (after asking how many people were into computers, she explained that the song had nothing to do with colonialism and mentioned that some of the Internet people seemed to be getting bogged down in interpreting this one.  She said something about having to write in and tell us about it.)<br>
Caramel (she described the scene in the movie "The Truth About Cats and Dogs" where Uma Thurman is sitting on a sofa and being fed cake by Ben Chaplin and going into ecstasy while Caramel is played on the soundtrack.  She was surprised that many people seem to think this song is about dieting.   Apparently men think the song is hopeful while women think it is sad, she said.)<br>
No Cheap Thrill<br>
Luka<br>
<p>
Encore:<br>
Tom's Diner (which became a singalong after the first verse when she mentioned that she heard just one 
small voice in the back of the room -- soon it was a free-for-all, with SV encouraging us and waiting for us
 between verses.)
<p>
Altogether an excellent, if too brief, show, and the whole band seemed to be having a great time.  
There were at least two Undertowers in the audience, Alex of the chat-session fame (thank you Alex!) and 
yours truly.

Subject: Suzanne Vega was superb<br>
From:  bluenote@jcn18.com<br>
Date:  Wed, 11 Sep 1996 11:24:28 -0400<br>
<p>
Suzanne Vega played a superb show at Tower Records.<p>
Gone are the days when she rhapodizes about aloneness. On her latest album,
she captures the sparks that fly from a lover when she (he) meets another in
desire.  "World Before Columbus" celebrates maternal love: "If your love
were taken from me, Every light that's bright would soon go dim, It would be
as dark as the world before Columbus, Down the waterfall and I'd swim over
the brim".  By contrast, "Stockings" provocatively paints a picture of
female love: "Do you know where friendship ends, and passion does begin?
It's between the binding of her stockings and her skin."  And in the aching
"Caramel", she attempts to extricate herself from an obsessive romantic
passion.
<p>
She ended her performance of new material last night with "No Cheap Thrill",
a mocking step away from the warmth of the other three songs. It compares
the mating dance to a game of poker, with the loser, of course, being the
one who folds first. The net result of the set was an illuminating
multi-faceted portrayal of passion.
<p>
Between and around the new songs, she sang selections from her impressive
catalogue. Openers "Rock in My Pocket" and "Marlena on the Wall" expressed
her fears about her first tour in five years: "But the only soldier now is
me, I'm fighting things I cannot see, I think it's called my destiny, that I
am changing."
<p>
And in songs like "Luka", "Tom's Diner", "Blood Makes Noise", and "99.9",
she reprised her old hits as well as swinging with her newer electronic
sound. (Songs from each album were sung except from the brilliantly crafted
"Days of Open Hand", an omission which this listener regretted.)
<p>
Happily, on the songs from "Nine Objects of Desire", she melds the warmth
and passion of her voice nicely with the metallic production she has begun
to favor. The net result is that the electronics work for her-accentuating
the human, connective quality of her voice and the relationships she sings
of by contrasting their warmth with the machine-made music in the
background. Quite the opposite happened on "99.9", her last album. Some
songs on "99.9", the first to feature the new production, were fun but,
overall, the alienation in her voice magnified the metallics. The net result
left the listener disengaged. At least that is my opinion. When you write
your review, you can add yours.
<p>
My advice for DJ's:  you would serve her sound best if you played the
mocking "No Cheap Thrill" back to back with a more passionate selection such
as  "World Before Columbus" or "Caramel" (as Vin Scelsa brilliantly did when
he introduced her new record to his listeners).
<p>
And if you see her live (Irving Plaza, Oct), you might come out bouncing as
I did from her engaging personality. The show was filled with laughter as
she interacted with us. One highlight--when she remarked that she is rusty
on anecdotes after her five-year touring hiatus, I called out with a smile:
"Don't worry." She laughed. A minute later, she remembered the following
story about her first tour: At her first Tower appearance, she continuously
apologized for stopping to re-tune her guitar. A male fan courtously said:
"hey man, don't worry, take all the time you need". Finally a woman yelled
out to him: "Shut up dick!" This New York minute became the watchword of her
tour.
<p>
(Vin, if Suzanne mentions this on Sunday, you can tell her that the woman
who said "Don't worry" is a regular listener to your show.)
<p>
As for me: I am going out to buy her record as my Rosh Hashanah present. Her
lilting portrait of passion will form a nice bookend to Patti Smith's poetic
portrayal of loss in her album "Gone Again" and Me'Shell Ndegeocello's
subtle, smooth song of anger in "Peace Beyond Passion."

Thank you for the wonderful mini-concert at Tower Records/Boston!
You sounded just great and I'm really looking forward to your October show at
the Berklee Performance Center.
<p>
I'd also like to thank you for the autograph and for taking the time to chat
about UNDERTOW with me.<p>
I was the guy with the beard wearing a crayola crayon necktie  :-)

i arrived about 10 minutes before they began
and had to search around
for a seat<p>
unfortunately, my companion and i were seated
behind a woman with a video camera on a tripod for
much of the set<p>
she mercifully took it down during the
fourth song
<p>
suzanne, dressed in black
made her way to the stage and started right in with
marlene on the wall <p>
she made a remark about being glad everyone was there
or else it would be a very different show
<p>
next she sang gypsy
during which a faint PA announcement
could be heard from elsewhere in the store
<p>
suzanne noticed a poster of singer tony vega
on the wall
and told a story of meeting a woman at an 
in-store who had heard a "rumor" 
that suzanne thought she was puerto rican 
for some of her childhood<p>
the woman asked suzanne this, expecting to
find out it was a tall tale
instead, of course, suzanne told her it was true
the woman told suzanne she thought that was sad
<p>
suzanne introduced caramel, saying that the woman
had said it was her favorite song from the new album<p>
about 4 bars in
the PA went off again 
this time suzanne stopped
apparently amused, or perhaps disappointed 
that the spell had been broken
but this gave her an opportunity to
tell the audience how caramel was used in
the truth about cats and dogs
and asked us to imagine uma orgasmically
eating cake
and she began again
<p>
next was honeymoon suite
which she indicated was a true story
<p>
then came world before columbus which 
'is about my daughter', she said
<p>
the last song sung from the new album 
was stockings<p>
i really enjoyed watching suzanne sing
this song, as she seemed to delight
in the turn of phrases
<p>
she told a story about how the man
translating the song into german had difficulty
with the difference between stockings and tights
and she wondered if it was lost in the
english-german translation
or the woman-man translation
<p>
she also mentioned that one of the
"challenges" of working with one's husband
is coming to him with songs such as 
stockings and getting questions like
'uh, is this a recent thing?  is there 
something i should know?... '
<p>
rock in my pocket was next and she mentioned it was
about david
from the bible
<p>
as she was singing i was reminded of how
the song can be taken very literally to tell
the story of david & golith 
or can be taken from all sorts of other directions
(one's need/desire/frustration involving communicating
with someone, for example)
and while i enjoy knowing the artist's motivation
behind a work
i also enjoy being free to let the song take my subconcious
where it wants to go
and since we're all humans with different experiences,
emotions, etc ... we'll each have
unique journies to take with these songs
<p>
i guess that's why i dont involve myself much in 
the literal discussion of lyrics 
here on the mailing list
<p>
(well there's also the thought that suzanne can 
read it and say 'well that's not what i meant at all'
and that would be not so nice...  ok back to 
the in-store report)
<p>
she then sang luka
put the guitar down and closed with tom's diner
encouraging folks to sing along
the crowd decided to be kind of meek
suzanne seemed a bit surprised by this
and stopped
making another request for people to join in
(shaming them into it with threats of being
the quietest store)
and this time people did
<p>
my companion and i left at this point 
because i really didnt know what i'd say to 
suzanne if i stood in line 
what do you say to someone who's work has accompanied
you through so many phases of your life? 
all i can muster up is.. 'thank you' 
<p>
(i had entertained thoughts of bringing her
something from work with our logo on it... 
i work for AOL and she's a member there... 
but decided against it, thinking it too cheezy
an idea.... perhaps when she comes back to
town to play the 930 club.. who knows.... )
<p>
at any rate
it was a very nice evening
even with the PA and the flourescent 
lights
<p>
thank you suzanne

Subj:	Suzanne signed my CD booklet<br>
Date:	96-09-16 11:32:36 EDT<br>
From:	hollie_satterfield@mail.amsinc.com<br>
To:	undertow@serv4.law.emory.edu<br>
<p>
As there do not seem to be many Undertowers in the D.C. area, I feel 
compelled to add my two cents worth to the previous (very complete) 
report.
<p>
Suzanne said that she does not mind signing autographs at stores 
because of her own autograph experiences.  She said that she was once 
quoted in the New York press as saying something along the lines of 
"Some days you just wish you were Lou Reed" at one of her early shows, 
and that Mr. Reed embarassed her by asking her to explain this remark 
when she told him her name at one of his autograph sessions.
<p>
Being shy myself I did not have any clever remarks to make to Ms. Vega 
when she signed my booklet.  (Being a male named Hollie is usually 
enough complications for any autograph I have managed to get.)
<p>
P.S. I would like to be the first to say that I will never be able to 
look at the cute back cover of the CD booklet without thinking of a 
famous scene from the film 'Daddy-O' which was soundly mocked on 
Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Hey All--
<p>
I'll let Wendy do the big report, but I wanted to toss in a couple of my
favorite moments from the broadcast last night. I was lucky enough to
finagle tickets from my station (the Mountain in Seattle) and got to be
there in person. (I asked several women if their name was Wendy, to no
avail.)
<p>
About halfway thru the show, I think it was 99.9, you may've heard some
chuckling from the audience. Mitchell was playing an electronic wind
instrument (doing a VERY cool solo), and at the same time, Suzanne was
trying to get a drink of water from a pre-packaged water bottle. Well,
the bottle had a seal inside and after fruitlessly tilting it up to try
to squeeze a drink out, she put on a frustrated frown and unscrewed the
top, peeled off the paper seal, making a humorous production out of it,
and screwed the top back on. At that moment Mitchell's solo ended and
she had to sing. Funny stuff.
<p>
More generally--
<p>
I don't know if this came across the airwaves but the mood before the
commercial break was kind of stilted, Suzanne seemed pretty nervous. I
will say that the music definitely did not suffer, just that her
between-song banter seemed awkward. During the commercial break, we got
a chance to see her loosen up: she talked a little bit about Ruby, about
the tour. After the break, she really started to get into the music,
physically. Gesturing, making faces like she was really telling us a
story rather than simply singing a song. She was dancing a little,
swaying...
<p>
A suprise to me: She did The Queen and the Soldier. I'd read that she
wasn't doing that song anymore. Major sentimental value for me. Touching
moment.
<p>
She came out after we went off the air and mentioned that when the last
song ended, Mitchell came up behind her and grabbed her ribs. With the
mic' still live, she said,"What the fuck?," though not loud enough for
the audience to hear. Don't know if it made it out into radioland. She
did one more song, acoustic, and left. 
<p>
Quite an evening, a real treat.

Hi Everyone,
<p>
Well, yesterday was a busy day.  I left work early to catch SV at the
Virgin Megastore.  She was running late and a little tired so the set was
short because she had to get to the Gene Autrey museum.  It was not
crowded probably less than 100 people.  Afterwards she did autographs.
<p>
The Autrey show was really awesome...I hope some of you got to hear.  She
had perked up and a story she told during a commercial break was that Ruby
had her first sound check that afternoon.  She took her up on stage and
Ruby grabed the mic and there was major feedback and Ruby burst into tears
and had to be taken home.  Mike Visceglia said it probably cured her of
her musical asperations.
<p>
After the show ended, Suzanne played Gypsy for the audience and that was
it.  I got a chance to go back and chat w/ her after the show again and
she said they are planning fun stuff for the concert tour.
<p>
Wendy!

The songs played by Suzanne at the Virgin Megastore in Los Angeles:<br>
	Marlene on the Wall<br>
	Gypsy (in which she began to sing the same verse twice before stopping
		the song to correct herself!)<br>
	Stockings<br>
	Honeymoon Suite<br>
	World Before Columbus<br>
	Luka<br>
	Tom's Diner<br>
<p>
I got my "When Heroes Go Down" single signed after the performance. I 
disagree with Wendy! about there being less than 100 people. I think 
there were around 200, but it still didn't seem as crowded as it should 
have been.
<p>
I think I spotted Wendy! standing on the steps leading upstairs, but 
I didn't get the chance to speak with her.

<p>
To everyone:
<p>
I was one of the lucky ones to win passes to Suzanne's performance last
night at the Autry Museum.  Hope you heard it on the national broadcast.
 What a great night!!  We arrived early by a couple of hours, and because
of that and the fact there were only 300 invited, we got front row
center.  To be a fan of hers and sit that close in those cosy confinds,
was a dream.  "Caramel" just melted my wife and myself, as did most of
the songs.
<p>
Although it was a short set, it was great.  Can't wait to see the full
set when she comes to the Galaxy in Santa Ana.  For all you radio
listeners, we received a bonus that you didn't hear - "Gypsy".
<p>
That was not all.  We lingered afterward until only a small group of 8 or
10 of us was left.  We then were allowed to join the backstage (actually
side stage) gathering of press and friends.  Suzanne was so gracious to
say hi to us (and Suzanne, if you're reading this we were the ones who
had you sign a the playlist that we plucked off the stage (being in
the front row and all.  See you at the Galaxy.  We'll be at one of the
front tables, as we were one of the first to buy tickets when they went
on sale.
