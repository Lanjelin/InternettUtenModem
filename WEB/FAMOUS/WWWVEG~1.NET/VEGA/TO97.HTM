Nouvelle Vega<p>
New York boho Suzanne Vega became a bedsit heart-throb in the mid-'80s
thanks to songs like "Marlene On The Wall" and "Luka". Now, after a
four-year sabbatical in which she married her producer and had a baby,
she's back with her best album yet.
<p>
Lustful Suzanne Vega In Tawdry Love Tryst With Top Pop Superstar. Well
hardly, but all may be revealed if, as intended, she one day publishes her
private journals. "There's nothing in them about famous people I've slept
with," she stresses, with a mischievous glint in her eye. "There's very
little of that kind of stuff. Although one time, Sting's wife Trudi took me
aside and explained, very carefully, that they had a really wonderful
relationship." She laughs, "I didn't know what to think... I was just,
like, a fan. I was kind of flattered. Sort of tickled, really. In fact, I
spilled a cup of tea down the front of my sweater when I was talking to
him, because I was nervous being there and I started to swirl my glass and
it just sailed down the front of my shirt. I went running into the kitchen
to try and swab it off. Now I use that sweater as part of the cat's bed. I
didn't want to throw it away. It's still there, the tea stain and
everything. But that was a long time ago, 12 years or something."
<p>
In the intervening years, Suzanne Vega has transformed herself from an
intelligent, aware and feted folkie, famed for hits like "Luka", "Marlene
On The Wall" and "Tom's Diner", into an artist who is free to pursue a more
individualistic and musically challenging (all be it less commercially
successful) path. Drinking coffee in the light, airy library of her
expansive Manhattan loft apartment overlooking the Hudson River which
flows, silent and grey, beneath the ice-blue skies of a city in the clutch
of a sudden, bitter freeze, she appears contented and serene. As well as
the likes of Steinbeck, Carver, Nelson Algren, Emily Bronte and an "I Hate
Madonna handbook", the shelving that takes up one whole wall is home to
various New York Music Awards, from "Best Folk Artist" to "Best Pop Song"
and, in 1992, "Best Rock Album" for "99.9F".
<p>
Although Vega has been pretty much out of the public eye since then, her
life has nevertheless been both full and hectic, rich and rewarding. In
1995 she married producer and musician Mitchell Froom - noted for his work
with the likes of Elvis Costello, Richard Thompson, Los Lobos and Crowded
House - and they have a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Ruby. "The week
before I gave birth I was living in a hotel because they had taken the roof
off the house and the rain was coming in," she says with a shudder. "Later
I was trying to breast-feed and there'd be workmen marching round in boots,
screaming instructions. It wasn't until Ruby was a year old that I started
writing again."
<p>
"We had started travelling because Mitchell was working on different
projects, so we would go to England and Los Angeles and France. But trying
to get a moment to myself in the conditions I was living in was practically
impossible. In Paris I'd find myself going out on the streets for privacy!"
<p>
The result, however, "Nine Objects Of Desire", is her best album to date.
Curiously, although it appeared throughout the rest of the world last
September, the record company in the UK chose to delay it's release here.
"I guess they didn't want it to compete, with..." She pauses, a little
flustered. "With... um...er..."<br>
"Sheryl Crow?" I finally venture.<br>
"Right! Yeah..." she laughs, vaguely relieved, before adding, possibly a
little disingenuously: "Which is fine by me. I think it's very considerate
of them to have thought of that!"
<p>
It is bizarre but typical of a record industry which commonly perceives
women as artistically alike purely by dint of their sex that Vega's album -
a deftly seductive amalgam of soft jazz stylings, pounding beats, casual
bossa nova and evocative lyrical grace, beauty and humour - should have
been deemed too similar to Sheryl Crow's rather vacuous and derivative
rock-chick chic to offer to the public at the same time.
<p>
"I don't see why Sheryl Crow and I should be falsely competing against each
other," asserts Vega baldly, "but at the same time, we're both on the same
record label. I don't like it, but I can understand it".
<p>
"I was relieved to listen back to the album," she adds, changing the
subject. "To my ears it sounds fairly graceful. It doesn't sound the way it
was conceived, which was kind of nuts and pieces and bolts." Husband
Froom's production certainly gives her sound a gently skewed subtlety and
edge - an almost exotic air; without him she imagines she might still be
making stripped-down, acoustic records more like her first two, "Suzanne
Vega" and "Solitude Standing". "We have a terrific working chemistry. The
only time that we have gotten into any trouble is if he wants to know what
a particular song is about... and then you have the usual, "Well, I don't
have to tell you," or, "It's about something that happened a long time
ago." That kind of thing. So, she adds coyly, "we had a few intense
late-night discussions. Like, I should know what the song is about!" and,
"No, you don't have to know what the song is about! I mean, as my husband I
suppose he has a right to know, but as my producer he really doesn't. And
conversely, when I wrote about our honeymoon, he was not... thrilled. He
had one sort of complaint - he would have preferred that the sexy songs
were about him and the funny ones about someone else!"
After a period out of the limelight, Vega intends for a higher profile in
the coming years. "I have plans for three different projects. "Tried and
True", which is a singles and hits anthology. "On Demand", which is pieces
like the song I did for DNA and other collaborations that I've done. And
also an album of early work, which I think could be surprising to a lot of
people. I think I would try and put them together as a box set, and also
have them available separately. It's probably a good time to look back a
little bit, and that would also give me time to work on new songs. I have a
bunch of travelling songs I haven't really finished yet. Also rattling
around in my brain is a sort of historical romantic novel."
<p>
Right now, though, radiating a cool, dignified elegance, the 37-year-old
Vega is immersed in preparations for a two-month trip to Europe to promote
"Nine Objects". A baby daughter (whose name, incidentally, was the
inspiration for US band Soul Coughing's album, "Ruby Vroom") and a husband,
who for work purposes still has a home in LA, makes for an often frantic
schedule. She doesn't, for example, participate in what she calls the
"formalised part" of her long-held Buddhist faith as much as she used to.
"I do still maintain my altar, though... which has also been harder since
Ruby's come around, because now she puts the seven dwarfs up there, so I'll
have, like, Sneezy and Dopey sitting next to the incense bowl and candles
and offerings." Her laughter is drowned out by shouts and banging from the
next room, where equipment is being packed for Europe. In the light of the
noise and sub-zero temperatures, plans for a photo shoot on the roof of her
apartment are nixed, and we head down to her favoured local coffee bar, the
Bell Cafe on Spring Street. On the way, dodging traffic, huddled and
scuttling through the icy winds, she looks forward to selling her loft and
moving into Greenwich Village. (A cheeky enquiry as to the asking price is
rebuffed with a look and not a word, though she does mention that Helen
Mirren is scheduled to view it the following week.)
<p>
On arrival, settling down with the seemingly de rigueur hot cider and
exuding an air of warmth and calm, she reflects: "I like where I am now. I
think it's about right, because I have the freedom to go places in the
world and play. I have the freedom to publish what I like. People who want
to know who I am know who I am, and I think I've been given a tremendous
amount of respect in the pop world, which is not easy to do, and I've
lasted a fairly long time, which is also not easy to do. I think that this
is about right for me. Of course, nothing's static, and so I sense that
things had been very big and now they're getting smaller, and that bothers
me sometimes. But things go up and down, I know that. Nothing stays the
same."
