<A NAME="tom"><h2><b><i>Tom's Diner</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>  
             I am sitting<br>
             In the morning<br>
             At the diner<br>
             On the corner<br>
<p>
             I am waiting<br>
             At the counter<br>
             For the man<br>
             To pour the coffee<br>
<p>
             And he fills it<br>
             Only halfway<br>
             And before<br>
             I even argue<br>
<p>
             He is looking<br>
             Out the window<br>
             At somebody<br>
             Coming in<br>
<p>
             "It is always<br>
             Nice to see you"<br>
             Says the man<br>
             Behind the counter<br>
<p>
             To the woman<br>
             Who has come in<br>
             She is shaking<br>
             Her umbrella<br>
<p>
             And I look<br>
             The other way<br>
             As they are kissing<br>
             Their hellos<br>
<p>
             I'm pretending<br>
             Not to see them<br>
             Instead<br>
             I pour the milk<br>
<p>
             I open<br>
             Up the paper<br>
             There's a story<br>
             Of an actor<br>
<p>
             Who had died<br>
             While he was drinking<br>
             It was no one<br>
             I had heard of<br>
<p>
             And I'm turning<br>
             To the horoscope<br>
             And looking<br>
             For the funnies<br>
<p>
             When I'm feeling<br>
             Someone watching me<br>
             And so<br>
             I raise my head<br>
<p>
             There's a woman<br>
             On the outside<br>
             Looking inside<br>
             Does she see me?<br>
<p>
             No she does not<br>
             Really see me<br>
             Cause she sees<br>
             Her own reflection<br>
<p>
             And I'm trying<br>
             Not to notice<br>
             That she's hitching<br>
             Up her skirt<br>
<p>
             And while she's<br>
             Straightening her stockings<br>
             Her hair<br>
             Is getting wet<br>
<p>
             Oh, this rain<br>
             It will continue<br>
             Through the morning<br>
             As I'm listening<br>
<p>
             To the bells<br>
             Of the cathedral<br>
             I am thinking<br>
             Of your voice...<br>
<p>
             And of the midnight picnic<br>
             Once upon a time<br>
             Before the rain began...<br>
<p>
             I finish up my coffee<br>
             It's time to catch the train<br>
<p>

<A NAME="luka"><h2><b><i>Luka</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>

          My name is Luka<br>
          I live on the second floor<br>
          I live upstairs from you<br>
          Yes I think you've seen me before
<p>
          If you hear something late at night<br>
          Some kind of trouble. some kind of fight<br>
          Just don't ask me what it was<br>
          Just don't ask me what it was<br>
          Just don't ask me what it was
<p>
          I think it's because I'm clumsy<br>
          I try not to talk too loud<br>
          Maybe it's because I'm crazy<br>
          I try not to act too proud<br>
<p>
          They only hit until you cry<br>
          And after that you don't ask why<br>
          You just don't argue anymore<br>
          You just don't argue anymore<br>
          You just don't argue anymore<br>
<p>
          Yes I think I'm okay<br>
          I walked into the door again<br>
          Well, if you ask that's what I'll say<br>
          And it's not your business anyway<br>
          I guess I'd like to be alone<br>
          With nothing broken, nothing thrown
<p>
          Just don't ask me how I am<br>
          Just don't ask me how I am<br>
          Just don't ask me how I am<br>

	In the ironbound section near Avenue L<br>
	where the Portuguese women come to see what you sell<br>
	the clouds so low the morning so slow <br>
	as the wires cut through the sky<br>
<p>
	The beams and bridges cut the light on the ground<br>
	into little triangles and the rails run round<br>
	through the rust and the heat<br>
	the light and sweet coffee color of her skin<br>
<p>
	Bound up in wire and fate<br>
	watching her walk him up to the gate<br>
	in front of the ironbound school yard.<br>
<p>
	Kids will grow like weeds on a fence<br>
	She says they look for the light they try to make sense.<br>
	They come up through the cracks<br>
	Like grass on the tracks<br>
	She touches him goodbye.<br>
<p>
	Steps off the curb and into the street<br>
	the blood and feathers near her feet<br>
	into the ironbound market<br>
<p>
	In the ironbound section near Avenue L<br>
	where the Portuguese women come to see what you sell<br>
	the clouds so low the morning so slow <br>
	as the wires cut through the sky<br>
<p>
	She stops at the stall<br>
	fingers the ring<br>
	opens her purse<br>
	feels a longing<br>
	away from the ironbound border<br>
<p>
	"Fancy poulty parts sold here.<br>
	Breasts and thighs and hearts.<br>
	Backs are cheap and wings are nearly free.<br>
	Nearly free"<br>

	I would still look you in the eye<br>

	as long as you were still alive<br>
<p>
	I would live inside of you<br>
	I'd make you wear me like a scar	<br>
	And I would burn myself <br>

	I would not run<br>

<p> 
          By day give thanks<br>
          By night beware<br>
          Half the world in sweetness<br>
          The other in fear<br>
<p>
          When the darkness takes you<br>
          With her hand across your face<br>
          Don't give in too quickly<br>
          Find the thing she's erased<br>
<p>
          Find the line, find the shape<br>
          Through the grain<br>
          Find the outline, things will<br>
          Tell you their name<br>
<p>
          The table. the guitar<br>
          The empty glass<br>
<p>
          All will blend together when<br>
          Daylight has passed<br>
<p>
          Find the line, find the shape<br>
          Through the grain<br>
          Find the outline, things will<br>
          Tell you their name<br>
<p>
          Now I watch you falling into sleep<br>
          Watch your fist curl against the sheet<br>
          Watch your lips fall open and your eyes dim<br>
          In blind faith<br>
<p>
          I would shelter you<br>
          Keep you in light<br>
          But I can only teach you<br>
          Night vision<br>

<A NAME="sol"><h2><b><i>Solitude Standing</i></b></h2></a> 
  <p>

          Solitude stands by the window<br>
          She turns her head as I walk in the room<br>
          I can see by her eyes she's been waiting<br>
          Standing in the slant of the late afternoon<br>
<p>
          And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
          Her palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
          Solitude stands in the doorway<br>
          And I'm struck once again by her black silhouette<br>
          By her long cool stare and her silence<br>
          I suddenly remember each time we've met<br>
<p>
          And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
          Her palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
          And she says "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"<br>
          And she says "I've come to lighten this dark heart"<br>
          And she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear<br>
          And I say "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>
<p>
          I turn to the crowd as they're watching<br>
          They're sitting all together in the dark in the warm<br>
          I wanted to be in there among them<br>
          I see how their eyes are gathered into one<br>
<p>
          And then she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
          Her palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
          And she says "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"<br>
          And she says"l've come to lighten this dark heart"<br>
          And she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear<br>
          And I say "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>

          My name is Calypso<br>
          And I have lived alone<br>
          I live on an island        <br>
          And I waken to the dawn<br>
          A long time ago<br>
          I watched him struggle with the sea<br>
          I knew that he was drowning<br>
          And I brought him into me<br>
          Now today<br>
          Come morning light<br>
          He sails away<br>
          After one last night<br>
          I let him go.<br>
<p>
          My name is Calypso<br>
          My garden overflows<br>
          Thick and wild and hidden<br>
          Is the sweetness there that grows<br>
          My hair it blows long<br>
          As I sing into the wind<br>
          My name is Calypso<br>
          And I have lived alone<br>
          I live on an island<br>
          I tell of nights<br>
          Where I could taste the salt on his skin<br>
<p>
          Salt of the waves<br>
          And of tears<br>
          And though he,pulled away<br>
          I kept him here for years<br>
          I let him go<br>
<p>
          My name is Calypso<br>
          I have let him go<br>
          In the dawn he sails away<br>
          To be gone forever more<br>
          And the waves will take him in again<br>
          But he'll know their ways now<br>
          I will stand upon the shore<br>
          With a clean heart<br>
<p>
          And my song in the wind<br>
          The sand will sting my feet<br>
          And the sky will burn<br>
          It's a lonely time ahead<br>
          I do not ask him to return<br>
          I let him go<br>
          I let him go<br>

<p>

          If language were liquid<br>
          It would be rushing in<br>
          Instead here we are<br>
          In a silence more eloquent<br>
          Than any word could ever be<br>
<p>
          These words are too solid<br>
          They don't move fast enough<br>
          To catch the blur in the brain<br>
          That flies by and is gone<br>
          Gone<br>
          Gone<br>
          Gone<br>
<p>
          I'd like to meet you<br>
          In a timeless, placeless place<br>
          Somewhere out of context<br>
          And beyond all consequences<br>
<p>
          Let's go back to the building<br>
          (Words are too solid)<br>
          On Little West Twelfth<br>
          It is not far away<br>
          (They don't move fast enough)<br>
          And the river is there<br>
          And the sun and the spaces<br>
          Are all laying low<br>
          (To catch the blur in the brain)<br>
          And we'll sit in the silence<br>
          (That flies by and is)<br>
          That comes rushing in and is<br>
          Gone (Gone)<br>
<p>
          I won't use words again<br>
          They don't mean what I meant<br>
          They don't say what I said<br>
          They're just the crust of the meaning<br>
          With realms underneath<br>
          Never touched<br>
          Never stirred<br>
          Never even moved through<br>
<p>
          If language were liquid<br>
          It would be rushing in<br>
          Instead here we are<br>
          In a silence more eloquent<br>
          Than any word could ever be<br>
<p>
          And is gone<br>
          Gone<br>
          Gone<br>
          And is gone<br>

              You come from far away<br>
              With pictures in your eyes<br>
              Of coffeeshops and morning streets<br>
              In the blue and silent sunrise<br>
              But night is the cathedral<br>
              Where we recognized the sign<br>
              We strangers know each other now<br>
              As part of the whole design<br>
<p>
              Oh, hold me like a baby<br>
              That will not fall asleep<br>
              Curl me up inside you<br>
              And let me hear you through the heat<br>
<p>
              You are the jester of this courtyard<br>
              With a smile like a girl's<br>
              Distracted by the women<br>
              With the dimples and the curls<br>
              By the pretty and the mischievous<br>
              By the timid and the blessed<br>
              By the blowing skirts of ladies<br>
              Who promise to gather you to their breast<br>
<p>
              Oh, hold me like a baby...<br>
<p>
              You have hands of raining water<br>
              And that earring in your ear<br>
              The wisdom on your face<br>
              Denies the number of your years<br>
              With the fingers of the potter<br>
              And the laughing tale of the fool<br>
              The arranger of disorder<br>
              With your strange and simple rules<br>
              Yes now I've met me another spinner<br>
              Of strange and gauzy threads<br>
              With a long and slender body<br>
              And a bump upon the head<br>
<p>
              Oh, hold me like a baby...<br>
<p>
              With a long and slender body<br>
              And the sweetest softest hands<br>
              And we'll blow away forever soon<br>
              And go on to different lands<br>
              And please do not ever look for me<br>
              But with me you will stay<br>
              And you will hear yourself in song<br>
              Blowing by one day<br>
<p>
              Oh, hold me like a baby...<br>

<A NAME="wooden"><h2><b><i>Wooden Horse (Caspar Hauser's Song)</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
          I came out of the darkness<br>
          Holding one thing<br>
          A small white wooden horse<br>
          I'd been holding inside<br>
<p>
          And when I'm dead<br>
          If you could tell them this<br>
          That what was wood became alive<br>
          What was wood became alive<br>
<p>
          In the night the walls disappeared<br>
          In the day they returned<br>
          "I want to be a rider like my father"<br>
          Were the only words I could say<br>
<p>
          And when I'm dead<br>
          If you could tell them this<br>
          That what was wood became alive<br>
          What was wood became alive<br>
<p>
          Alive<br>
          And I fell under<br>
          A moving piece of sun<br>
          Freedom<br>
<p>
          I came out of the darkness<br>
          Holding one thing<br>
          I know I have a power<br>
          I am afraid I may be killed<br>
<p>
          But when I'm dead<br>
          If you could tell them this<br>
          That what was wood became alive<br>
          What was wood became alive<br>
          Alive<br>
