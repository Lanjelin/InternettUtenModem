TEN YEARS OF SUZANNE...
</b>
<p>
Last week I went to see Simply Red in concert. Singer Mick Hucknall said that
that particular concert was
a sort ofanniversary, because it had been ten years since it all started for
them, "and I feel so oooollld..."  
Could you imagine Suzanne Vega bending forward, pretending towalk with a
walking stick and saying "I
feel so oooollld"? I can't. And yet I realised that indeed, it had been ten
years since Simply Red's debut
album knocked Suzanne's debut off the Number One spot she had held in my own
personal Top 30 for a
whole 11 weeks. Ah, those early days of October 1985 when I first heard
Suzanne. 'Marlene on the wall'
was being played on the radio, and I let it go unnoticed at first, until
suddenly I _heard_
the song and thought "Hey, I like that!" The next week a dj said that her
debut album would be played on
the midnight album show, and I stayed awake, with my clock-radio/tape deck
stand-by next to my bed.
And so I heard 'Knight Moves', 'The Queen and the Soldier', and I heard
'Small Blue Thing'. I
could picture it in my mind as I lay in bed: "with my knees against my
mouth/I am perfectly round", and I
fell in love with her music.
<p>
I found out she would open up for John Cale in Utrecht, on 20 October 1985,
and I bought tickets. I'd
never done anything like that - go to see somebody in concert that I didn't
know anything about, I had
only heard those four songs, she wasn't the main act and the album wasn't
even available in the shops
yet. As you can tell, I was the only one in the audience who came to see the
support act rather than John
Cale (though he was impressive live as well), and when she started with
'Tom's Diner' people just kept on
talking, and I admired her for her courage to go on. It's still my favourite
concert of Suzanne's, I liked the
intimate setting in the small concert hall, and I liked the way she kept
re-tuning her guitar as if
she didn't know what else to do on stage... But most of all I liked her
stories, about 'Calypso', about 'Left
of Center'... 
<p>
Needless to say I ran to the music shop as soon as the album was available.
Suzanne's music changed my
musical live. Until I heard her I used to listen to melodic new wave rock,
and looking back I feel that until
then I never realised that lyrics in songs could actually tell you something,
create
images in your mind. Oh yes, I knew that Kate Bush' 'The Kick Inside' still
did it for me, even after seven,
and there was an occasional song that would struck me, but they were
exceptions. And never in a way as
personal as Suzanne's lyrics struck me. "Wondering where the hell/I have
been"... And I loved the way the
music supported her lyrics. Suzanne was different.
<p>
The images kept coming, 'Solitude standing', 'Pilgrimage', 'In Liverpool'...
every album brought new
pictures. The music kept changing, growing, and even though I'm still not
overly
fond of the 'industrial' sound on '99.9Fø' the music suits the lyrics once
again.
<p>
Since I heard Suzanne I became interested in other female singer/songwriters,
and she put me in a
direction where I found a whole load of interesting music, mostly women, who
create their own music,
share their stories, their observations, make you think about life, about
living, about living your own life.
<p>
Thank you Suzanne!

THE LONG VOYAGE
</b>        
<p>
My fondest and earliest memories of Suzanne are of my junior year in
highschool with my best friend.
While driving the streets of Tampa, the songs of Suzanne were never far away.
And that was the summer
of 1987. I never realized what a big part of my life Suzanne would become,
and neither had I realized that
Suzanne was here to stay.
<p>
    Suzanne arrived into my mucical world among the Beatles and 10,000
Maniacs, and after recovering
from the new-wave explosion of the 80s which gave rise to such groups as the
Cure and Depeche Mode. I
believe I first heard Suzanne off the "Pretty in Pink" soundtrack; I imagine
that many of her fans would
consider themselves "Left of center". Then "Luka" became a hit, and my
journey with Suzanne began. I
soon purchased "Solitude Standing", and "Suzanne Vega", listening to each
song in solitude and with
reflection. At the time I didn't 
know as much about Suzanne's life as I do know. I wondered where she got her
inspiration and if her
lyrics came from actual experiences. 
<p>
    In college I remained loyal to Suzanne by also religiously listening to
"Days of open Hand" and then
"99.9Fø". By then I was also very sure about my music, therefore at least a
couple of Suzanne's songs
were always featured on any musical complilations I sent to friends (I was
always secretly trying to
convert them to listen to my kind of music).
<p>
    And here I am now in the winter of 1995 sitting in my office listening to

"Do you love any, do you love none
do you love many, can you love one
do you love me?" 
<p>
    Even after all these years Suzanne Vega is still the most articulate and
profound songstress and
songwriter. I tried to find others but none were  comparable. I went through
my stages of listening to Paul
Simon, Joni Mitchell, the Indigo Girls, Tori Amos, Sara McLachlan, and even
Shawn Colvin (who is a close
second), and they are all very good. But Suzanne Vega still stands alone,
sometimes as Marlene or Calypso
or just "the neighborhood girl".

JOURNEY
</b>
<p>
There she is, a girl in a wide flat land <br>
all alone<br>
Now she moves, yet not sure,<br>
changing her direction all the time.<br>
<p>
But look, a big white house is waiting for her<br>
see this tiny little hand in a window<br>
waving hello.<br>
She's arrived, she's at home<br>
in her love hotel.<br>

SUZANNE VEGA AND THE SURREALIST MOVEMENT
</b><p>
A few months ago I was preparing a term-paper about Leonora Carrington, a
surrealist painter and writer
who might be best known for her romance with Max Ernst in the early 1940s.
And while I had a close look
at the strange and dreamlike paintings of hers I felt the same intense and
rather inexplicable feeling I have
when I listen to Suzanne's music. There seemed to be something true and
honest about these paintings
and although the pictures showed rather confusing and bewildering scenes they
felt quite familiar to me.
<p>
Looking at some of them I thought: Well, this might be the result when one
tries to paint "Small Blue
Thing" or "Fat Man and Dancing Girl". While I was reading more about
Carrington, I was reminded of
Suzanne from time to time. There are in fact some parallels in the work of
both women. 
<p>Carrington uses a
lot of mythical characters and symbols. Witches and creatures half human half
beast appear frequently.
Now, there aren't that many mythical references in Suzanne's work, she uses
much more urban images.
(Not surprising since she grew up in New York, probably the most urban place
on the whole planet.) 
<p>But
still there are similar images. The white horse for example, which is
Carrington's most important symbol of
freedom and strength and a sort of alter-ego, appears in some of Suzanne's
songs, too. In "Wooden Horse"
it serves as an alter-ego for Caspar and in "The Silver Lady" the character
finally manages to break free on
the back of her horse. There are other "fantastic" characters in Suzanne's
songs which I can imagine
finding in a Carrington painting. "The Wind Fairies" for example which "come
at the Wind Queen's each
and every call" or Solitude who stands by the window, her palm split with a
flower, with a flame. 
<p>
Carrington's dark humour reminded me very much of Suzanne's, and Carrington's
habit of referring to
nursery rhymes such as Harry Graham's Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes
(Little Francis home from school<br>
Swung the baby by his tool:<br>
Mother screamed, Auntie shuddered,<br>
Father muttered, "I'll be buggered!"<br>
Nanny said, "Naughty Francis!<br>
You've ruined Baby's future chances.")<br>
reminded me of that "Wallaby Song" Suzanne used to sing in the schoolyard and
during the 99.9F_ tour. 
("I called the doctor <br>
and the doctor said<br>
I've got a pain in my stomach<br>
Because my baby's dead.")<br>
But most remarkable is the statement Carrington once made in an interview:
"We are all different me's." 
<p>At once Suzanne's "You are the outside of an inside like mine" sprang to my
mind. The similarity of those
statements may be rooted in the fact that both women are Buddhists. 
But there were more traces of Surrealism in Suzanne's work. When I was
looking through a variety of
books about women and the Surrealist movement, I stumbled over a picture
which showed two hands
holding a dice pinned to a surface covered with numbers. It was the
"Surrealist Object" by Valentine Hugo.
<p>
I thought: Wait! I have seen this before and I got out my Days of Open Hand
cover and was stunned by the
similarities. Looking through other books I found various pictures by Chirico
or objects by Marcel Duchamp
in which hands and gloves play a big part. Confused I asked my literature
professor whether she thought
this was an accident or quotation. And she advised me to check out the work
of Joseph Cornell. Now,
watching his Dadaist/Surrealist objects I really thought I had the Days of
Open Hand cover in front of me.
<p>
Thumbing through the pages I came across an object called "Even before we met
I knew you were out
there somewhere" which I thought could have been a line written by Suzanne.
Then I recently looked
through old Language issues and by accident (or was it the Surrealist hasard
objectif????) my look fell on
the SongTalk interview:
"I love the artwork on your newest album [Days of Open Hand]. It reminded me
of those great boxes by
Joseph Cornell."
"Yeah, I wanted it to look like that. The whole idea of putting things into
boxes and different contexts was
interesting to me." 
<p>
And in an interview with the German magazine Musik Express/Sounds from June
1990 Suzanne says: "I
had the feeling that the purely narrative structures were too restricted. I
wanted to write more surrealistic,
to put more feeling into my lyrics. So I got rid of the narrator and waited
for the effect you get when you
just have the images left. So my lyrics don't make a lot of sense in the
reality. Only in the dream, in the
dreamworld of the song the intention of the words can be seen."
The intention of the words and the difficulties to deal with language is a
common theme in Suzanne's
songs. Now, there is a German writer called Unica Zrn who was associated
with the Surrealist movement
and who struggled like Suzanne to deal with language, to discover the hidden
meaning, the "realms
underneath, never touched, never stirred." She tried to explore the magic and
the strength of language by
decomposing and rearranging words like in the old alchemist tradition. She
cut them into their single letters
to arrange them to new words, anagrams. Now, this is actually what Suzanne
does with some of the key
words in the Days of Open Hand artwork. They are shown as a loose combination
of letters, some of them
falling apart even. Another image which is used frequently in the work of
Unica Zrn and Suzanne is the
image of the knife. (Perhaps as one of the most important tools of the writer
to cut the words to discover
their actual meaning??) "A knife is better than a friend" Unica Zrn wrote
and Suzanne refers to it in a
number of songs like in "Undertow", "Feather and Bone", not to mention the
Knife Pendant. 
<p>
Zrn was
married to the Surrealist artist Hans Bellmer, who might be best known for
his work with dolls which he
arranged with their limbs at odds. So I was all the more stunned when I
opened my copy of "Urgent
Whispers" and it was full of photos of dolls, blindfolded and with white
horses and with twisted legs.
<p>
Well, summing up possible links to the Surrealists, one should certainly not
forget "Night Vision", which
was inspired by the poem "Juan Gris" (a Dadaist/Surrealist painter) by Paul
Eluard, who was probably the
most important Surrealist writer.
And then there is of course Suzanne's former boy-friend "a Dadaist painter
from Liverpool" whom she met
in 1978 and for whom she wrote "Gypsy" and whom she most probably had in mind
when she was
writing "In Liverpool".
Well, maybe working on my term paper made me suffer under a severe fit of
Surrealist paranoia, but there
seem to be certain Surrealist aspects in the work of Suzanne Vega. Sure I'm
not saying that she is a
Surrealist artist or that she shares the aesthetic and social ideas of the
Surrealists. (No one would state
that Sylvia Plath is a Surrealist artist, either, just because her poem "The
Disquieting Muses" refers to the
painting by Cirico with the same title.)
<p>
It is always hard to tell in how far an artist is actually influenced by
phenomena as the Surrealism and
unfortunately discussing such a problem very soon leads into the realm of
speculation. (I'm not even sure
that Suzanne knows Zrn or Carrington, as the work of both women is
unfortunately hardly known.) So in
how far Suzanne is involved with the theories and ideas of the Surrealist
Movement is not for me to judge
and we will probably never find out. This is of course only unless she lets
us know in the next issue of
Language.
