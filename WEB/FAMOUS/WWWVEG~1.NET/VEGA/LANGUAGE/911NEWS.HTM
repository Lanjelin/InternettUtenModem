A beautiful CD which includes all the original lyrics to the songs
performed on this album.  "The interpretations are unique to the
artists.  It is a testament to the Dead's writers that these songs
have enough room to work from the country roots of Dwight Yoakam to
the alternative sounds of Jane's Addiction.  Yet the mark of the Dead
surely shines through these diverse and often radical versions." 
Significant proceeds from teh sale of this project are going to
benefit two organizations closely allied with the cause of rainforest
preservation:  Rainforest Action Network and Cultural Survival.  So
don't forget to buy this album.  It is unique and the songs performed
by Suzanne Vega are 'cracking' beautiful.<p>

"A couple of years ago, I was invited by the Grateful Dead to perform
with them at Madison Square Garden in New York for the Rainforest
Benefit.  I went to the hotel to rehearse with them, and said, "What
do you think we should do?"  I was nervous - I'd never met them and we
were going to perform in fron of 20,000 people.  So Jerry Garcia gave
me a big smile and said, "We just want you to be happy."  And all week
long, I used that as my guide and did only things that made me happy. 
We sang 'Chinese Bones' by Roby Hitchcock and my song 'Neighborhood
Girls.'  And we had a great show."<br>

Positive conclusions in the reviews of the papers.  Suzanne Vega is
charming;  as a mater of course she is great;  a highlight of the
second day. And she was really great, singing in front of all these
people who couldn't get all a seat in the tent.  She was communicating
with the audience and even tried a very funny new song.  Next year it
has to be the right time to perform on one or more of the bigger
festivals of Europe.  We hope to see you there Suzanne!
