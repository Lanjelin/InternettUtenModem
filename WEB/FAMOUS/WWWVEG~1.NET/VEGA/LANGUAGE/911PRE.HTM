<title>Language 4:1, December 1991: Preface</title>

<h1>PREFACE</h1>

As we promised in our issue of December '90, 1991 has been a
relaitvely quiet year for the Info Center.  However for Suzanne Vega
it has been a little busier than we expected.  First, she took part in
a tribute to the Grateful Dead, contributing vocals to two songs on
the Deadicated album, which was released earlier this year.  Then, she
played solo concerts at a number of folk festivals in Belgium,
England, and Finland.  Lastly, there was the release of Tom's Album,
which consisted of compilation of the many different versions of Tom's
Diner that had been recorded by various artists since the rlease of
the 'original' remix by D.N.A.  In 1992 there will probably be a
proper new Suzanne Vega album.  In our exclusive interview in this
issue Suzanne talks openly about her ideas for the fourth CD.<p>  As you
will have noticed by now this issue of Language is written in English.
 In the future we are hoping to continue this policy.  The reason
behind this is that we are hoping to broaden our reading public. 
Language already has subscribers in countries as Germany, Italy and
the United States.<p>
You will find that this issue also contains some articles in German
and Dutch.  In the future people who would like to contribute to
Language, but feel that they are not capapble of writing in 'proper'
English, can write their opinions, reviews,etc. in their own language.
 By this, we are hoping to make the magazine even more international
and to do justice to the name of this publication.<p>  To continue your
membership of the Info Center in 1992 you will have to pay Fl. 15 (Fl.
20 outside Europe) cash or by an international money order.  In return
you will be informed on the activities of Suzanne Vega through
newsletters and hopefully two or three issues of Language, which
depeds on Suzanne Vega's artistic activities.<p>
For now we hope you will enjoy this issue of Language and please let
us know what you think of it.
