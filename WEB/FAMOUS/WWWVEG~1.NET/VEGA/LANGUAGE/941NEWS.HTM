Internet is a wondrous thing. It's said that there are some 22,000,000 people on the Internet, and the
figure is growing each day. Some of them are actually Suzanne Vega fans, and Undertow -- the
Suzanne Vega mailing list -- is becoming more and more active. It is nice to know that there are other
people who care. Internet has also been of great help when we prepared the present issue of Language
-- we've been sending files and messages to each other across land and sea as if there were no
distances. 
That which used to take days can be done in minutes.<p>
        Computers give you the feeling of reliability, dependability and control. But the feeling of
safety is deceptive. A couple of days before we had to print the issue, our channel for sending files
broke down. We never really figured out why, but managed to find another way of sending the crucial
file. So we're rather happy that Language is a printed magazine, after all...<br>

ok, gang.  I can no  longer pretend that I am not Online and reading this message folder from time to
time!  I am tickled to find it way down here in World Beat and thank you WaterBro for opening it in
such a sweet way.  I am amused that none of the readers of this folder reads People Magazine!<p>
 Anyhow -- I had no idea the Gap was playing "Saltwater".  I will give more details on what that is in
a later message.  I figure if I don't post from time to time Online will sweep in and throw the folder
away as it has done to many others.  Then I would never "see" you guys again!
with affection, Suzanne Vega<p>

Hi, gang.  I thought I'd check in.<p> 
Dear SNORM:  I appreciate your cynicism, and if someone signs on "SuzyB" they are definitely an
imposter, since mine is SuzyV.  It's true though -- how can you know for sure?  One person asked me
what my brother's name was, since he had been to one of his parties.  As if I didn't know my own
brother's name --<p> 

To Miba -- thanks for your comments -- the knife is neither ancient nor buddhist but a gift from
someone a few years ago.  It's like a good luck token.<p>

To PATNPETE -- if it was both Carnegie Hall and Radio City, it must have been 1987!  New music? 
There is another Leonard Cohen Tribute album coming out on A&M records, and I sing a version of
"Story of Isaac".  I think it's coming out in the fall, but I don't have the official release date on that.
Otherwise, I plan to start recording next year, and probably won't tour for a little while after the
baby's born in July.<p>

As for "Salt water" -- it was a song I wrote with DNA for their album called "Taste This" on EMI. 
The album came out in the UK in1992, and disappeared. I like the lyrics and I want to include it in a
"retrospective" of some kind, in about a year or so, with "Left of Center", and the singles from each
of the albums.  Any comments?<p>

thanks, you guys.<br>
most affectionately,<br>
Suzanne Vega<p>

Hi there -- just checking in.  The World Beat folder seems to be becoming more and more esoteric as it
gets shoved out even farther beyond the mainstream folders.  Soon we will be floating in our own little
island in cyberspace.<p>

Anyhow!  in regards to your 2 questions - no I wasn't asked to sing on the Carpenters tribute album
(can't say I'm regretful, there), and 2.  the due date is currently July 15.<p>

oh by the way regarding the Christine Lavin song "Mysterious Woman" -- I think it's one of her best!

Hello gang.  Thank you for the congratulations. Ruby is six weeks old today, and she is fine and I am
fine, though it took a while to emerge again.  I had no idea it would be like that.<p>

I hope to be dropping in more often these days - <br>
Thanks again-<p>

hi gang --<p>

sorry it has been a while since I dropped in.  I find that since Ruby is born I have only enough time to
do the "flashSessions", and very often I can't get to the Message Board at all.<p>

The Undertow newsletter gets "delivered" through the mail, so sometimes I answer any questions that
may be lurking in that forum.  To get onto that mailing list you write to
"undertow-request@vader.cc.emory.edu" (without the
quotes), and you post the word "subscribe".
There's a little more action on that front, but there probably won't be much until next year when
another album comes out.<p>

By the way, The "Ruby Vroom" album, by Soul Coughing, was produced by Tchad Blake, who is
Mitchell Froom's partner and engineer -- they asked to use Ruby's name for their album, and I said
they could if they changed it.  In case you were wondering!<p>

Otherwise -- I did a  half hour benefit on Saturday afternoon for the Fast Folk Cafe on N. Moore street
in Manhattan.  And I participated in the J. Morgan Puett fashion show, carrying Ruby. (she's the
designer who made the big baggy pants from the last album and tour.)  Otherwise, let's see --
breastfeeding mania has subsided somewhat, but I'd rather not go into the gory details, if you know
what I mean.<p>

Thanks for hanging in there --<p>

Hi --<p>

Ruby Maria Froom was born July 8, 1994 -- she was 6lbs, 9 oz. It was a long and difficult labor,
ending in a C-section but I am well and just about recovered.<p>
I have been reading your comments with interest -- I am especially intrigued with all the questions and
comments about "Wooden Horse", the song about Caspar Hauser, and am working on a reply about
that song.<p>
Forgive me if I don't write in all the time. I tend to be reclusive, but I am so very happy to know that
there is a group of you out there who want to discuss the songs. Your questions and comments stay
with me for days. I only found out about this list a few days before I went into the hospital. So while I
have been reading the list, I haven't responded so far. I'll write in from time to time.<p>
Thanks a lot for listening.<p>

I have not forgotten about the list -- I really want to answer some of the questions, especially the long
one about "Wooden Horse". Also, the Leonard Cohen Tribute album is postponed till early next year
(the one with "Story of Isaac", sung by myself). Also, there is an article in the August 1994 issue of
"Current Biography" that has the most up-to-date biography of myself I've ever seen.  It has
everything but Ruby in it.  I was surprised to see it. I think it is very well done. (read it in this issue)<p>

Anyhow, I'll be in touch!<br>

dear members of this list --<p>

I thought I would quickly explain why "Soul Coughing" named their album what they did -- they
wanted to call it "Ruby Froom", but I said no, so they changed it to "Ruby Vroom", which I found
acceptable.  The album was produced by Tchad Blake, who is Mitchell Froom's partner and engineer. 
Basically they thought it was a pretty name.  I said no because -- what if she wants to make her own
album when she gets older?<p>

I'll write again--<p>

dear members of this list --<p>

just so you know, I am doing a benefit for The Fast Folk Cafe on October 28, singing for a half hour
at 2:00 in the afternoon. The Fast Folk Cafe seats about 74 people and is run by Jack Hardy; it's at 41
N. Moore Street in Manhattan.<p> 
I'd like to ask you guys not to write to me directly, because I'll never have time to answer directly;
and it's not really the spirit of this -- what is this?  this newsletter?  It's better, I think, to address the
list as a whole.  That way I'll answer when I can, and everybody's in on it.<p>

yours truly and affectionately,<p>

hi Tim--<p>

re: concert venues:<p>

many times I will get to a city and find out that the venue is "21 and over", even though we are slated
to play that city because it is a college town. weird, huh?  a few people brought that to my attention on
the last tour.<p>  
it is a glitch in the agent's way of thinking.  there were a number of problems like that on the last two
tours I did.  as much as I try to control what happens on a tour beforehand, once I'm out there it is
nearly impossible to keep track of each gig at each venue at each city -- that's why you hope your
agent is a good one, with some contact with reality.<p>

by making the gigs "21 and over" I cut out a large portion of the audience who are obviously teenagers
-- it is a stupid rule and someone should remind of this issue when I make plans for the next time out.
till next time --<p>

Suzanne Vega<br>
(05-11-94)<p>

dear tim--<p>

one more thing -- do I have control over where I play?  only if I make specific requests or if the gigs
are slanted one way or another.  obviously I can't ask for each venue in each city by name.  
ironically, on the last tour, most of the promotion was slanted toward the "alternative" market, which
is a younger crowd, so many of the venues reflected that, or I thought they did.  and yet you have
problems like the one you brought up.<p> 
I myself don't see why you can't have the records slanted towards both "alternative" and "folk"-- it's
hard for someone like myself who doesn't fit any specific category.  how do you target an audience? I
never think of those things-- I assume whoever likes the record will buy it.  this is a problem
only in America -- in Europe there is no "alternative" or any of these subdivisions Americans are so
fond of.<p>

thanks for writing --<p>

Regarding L. Cole --<p>

he and his wife had a baby recently (about a year ago? maybe more) and one can find him many
afternoons in a playground in Greenwich Village.  He's working on a new album, which he wanted to
sound like Sade --<p>

Just thought I'd add some gossip to this file --<p>

Gang --<p>

Uh, I meant "Anton's" roof -- Anton was the keyboard player in my band and the co-producer of
"Days of Open Hand", and my boyfriend at the time.  How funny to read that interview now -- I guess
it was eight years ago.  Most of it still holds true.<p>

Dear Hugo, et al;-<p>

I will probably put out a retrospective at some point, but not next year -- next year I will be working
on the fifth album, tentatively titled "Love Hotel".<p>  

After that I want to put out two things -- one collection called "Thirteen Early Songs" w songs like
"Marching Dream", "Silver Lady", "Daniella", "Black Widow Station", and some others that aren't
known, like "Feather and Bone" and "Not Me" which I used to think were too intense to sing in
public. 
I also want to put out a "Best of", but the kind I like is the kind you hate -- I love records that collect
an artist's singles throughout a period, with no odds and ends, no filler, no experiments, just the tried
and true. Sometimes I'll buy that instead of someone's entire collection (like the Pretenders, for
example.)  I am always assuming people don't have the money or patience to buy tapes of someone
fooling around, because I never did.  But I will consider it -- PJ Harvey's demos are supposed to be
even better than her second record, for example.<p> 
As for bootlegs -- I assume that if someone goes to all the trouble of getting something illegally, they
probably have the legit stuff already. Live is another thing -- my voice isn't that strong sometimes, so
I don't like the thought that there are lousy shows floating around somewhere.  That doesn't mean I
encourage bootlegs, but I figure what the hell.<p>
Keep writing ( and I'll do the same ) --<p>

the Tarantino 20 questions from the November Playboy<p>
<pre>
</pre>
PLAYBOY: What do men learn about women from listening to girl groups?<p>
TARANTINO: I love gril groups. [Laughs] But in the sixties, pretty much all they ever sang about
was their boyfriends: "He's so cool/he's so tough/I'm not too young to get married." The Go-Go's
were terrific, and their songs seemed poignant and real. But even they were basically signing about
their boyfriends, too. So I don't know if you actually get insight from girl groups. If you want to learn
about how a woman feels, you might want to listen to someone like Suzanne Vega.<br>
