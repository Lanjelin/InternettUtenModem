<title>Language 5:2, December 1992: Christine Lavin</title>

<h1>CHRISTINE LAVIN</h1>
            
<pre>        I used to dream of owning an air conditioner. Then I
        got one. I used to dream of owning a microwave oven.
        Then I got one. Now I dream of being a "Mysterious
        Woman," which I know will remain my impossible
        unfulfilled dream, since I blab everything. This
        song probably comes from listening to Suzanne Vega's
        albums one too many times. I love her music. Oh ...
        to be of those elusive sirens of the night. Oh ...
        to keep everyone guessing. Oh ... to be a mysterious
        nightbird in flight. Oh ... well.</pre>

Writes Christine Lavin about her song <i>Mysterious Woman</i> on the album
<i>Good Thing He Can't Read My Mind</i>. This is a funny, yet beautiful,
song where half-digested images of Suzanne Vega, and from her songs,
blend with Lavin's reactions and personal dreams. It is a strange
bridge between two songwriters of different temperaments and a
unique chance to listen to Suzanne's songs from another person's
point-of-view. Although <i>Mysterious Woman</i> obviously derives from
listening to Suzanne Vega, it is very distinctly a Lavin song, and
would probably be fascinating even for a person who knows nothing
about Suzanne. (There is a hilarious, totally idiotic
"modernistic poem" within the song that has been interpreted as a
parody of a Vega song, which I cannot agree with.)<p>
    Lavin is often the semi-detached observer. With her witty songs
and good-natured cynicisms she uncovers the hidden motives and
reasons behind others, as well as her own, behaviour. She has a keen
eye for the petty details that unite us all and make us human. And
she is irresistibly funny.<p>
    Although a few songs are contrived and overly witty, Lavin never
scorns or condemns. In fact, her disarming humour very successfully
evokes understanding and compassion for others. In many songs the
speaker, who is very easy to identify with, conveys this sympathy by
a single word or phrase indicating that she, and we, are just the
same.<p>
    Lavin's wit is both verbal, intellectual and emotional. She
frequently hits the nail on the head, as in the lines "he is not
unhappy / he is not satisfied". This is a very accurate description
of what I often feel -- not even Suzanne could have said it better.
Lavin is the outsider among politically correct vegetarians and
athletes, yuppies, <i>Sensitive New Age Guys</i> and "high-heeled women
with non-functioning feet". The love affairs she describes are
mostly bleak substitutes for an impossible romantic ideal. Why not
have a <i>Cold Pizza For Breakfast</i> instead?<p>
    In a time when stars and celebrities are supposed to be
preachers and perfect examples of the modern virtues (if they are
not totally depraved), it is comforting to hear someone sing that
"the joggers are jogging their lives away" and complain that "no
matter what it is I order / I know there's an avocado / hidden on
this plate" when "... a plate of pommes frites / is all I need". It
is so human.<p>
    Unfortunately, "the reality of me / cannot compete / with the
dreams you have of her" though "the reality of me / is probably much
like / the reality of her". Singing about the futility of love,
Lavin is capable of a sweet, melancholy voice that approaches the
romantic tone of a Leonard Cohen song:<p>

<pre>        She hasn't seen him in thirty years
        The mention of his name doesn't bring on tears
        If you ask her,
        "Are there any regrets?"
        She'll tell you, "no"
        But she never forgets</pre>

But Lavin's humour extends even to sulking:

<pre>        I'd like to tell you a story
        about how I've alienated everybody I've ever met
        in my whole entire life
        but I can't... 'cause you're so stupid
        you probably don't even know
        what a big word like alienate even means</pre>

Still, Lavin wants "... to be a mysterious woman / tantalize you
with my come-hither stare" like a Marlene Dietrich and "write
mysterious songs". But, as she has observed herself, she is less
successful in capturing the poetic and mysterious qualities of life.
Her songs are a bit too obvious, slightly superficial and she
sometimes falls into a boring sentimentality that fails to
communicate the intended atmosphere or sympathy. This is most
conspicuous when she leaves the sphere of the alienated urban people
she understands so well. But such minor faults are only natural for
a songwriter as productive as Lavin, and she should be judged for
the good songs that make up the majority of her work.<p>
    Musically, many of Lavin's songs are reminiscent of the early
Joni Mitchell, or Suzanne Vega before the Lou Reed concert of 1979.
As Suzanne has said, listening to this kind of music (folk) is like
drinking water -- it is something you can always go back to. I often
do. While the Velvet Underground's important albums lurk in their
covers, this is the music I really play a lot. Lavin is also a fine
singer and guitarist. Her plain and sweet singing voice is somewhat
similar to Suzanne's, although she lacks Suzanne's strong, deep and
beautiful speaking voice.<p>
    Christine Lavin has been around for quite some time. She was
among the first to record on COOP (later renamed Fast Folk) and she
has released several albums and singles. Lavin belongs to the New
York folk circuit, but has even toured Australia. I find her by far
superior to most of the female singer/songwriters who have enjoyed
brief commercial success in the wake of Suzanne Vega's singular
achievement.<p>
    Lavin's recent albums on Rounder Records are well produced and
very attractive to listen to. <i>Good Thing He Can't Read My Mind</i> is my
personal favourite. Unfortunately, they are difficult to find in
Europe, but since they are available on CD, your record store should
be able to order them from USA. If you like intelligent, contempor-
ary folk songs, there is a good chance you will like Christine
Lavin. <p>

<i><h4>Myserious Woman</h4>
I want to be a mysterious woman<br>
I want to write mysterious songs<br>
I want everyone to wonder<br>

existentialism? nihilism?

I am thinking about<br>
defrosting my refrigerator<br>

watch me ask the bartender<br>
for a drink he cannot make<br>
watch me order mysterious food<br>
food even Julia Child<br>
cannot pronounce right<br>
from cookbooks that time has forgot<br>
then maybe I will read<br>
Crime and Punishment for fun<br>
then again, maybe not<p>

I want to be a mysterious woman<br>
tantalize you with my come-hither stare<br>

if you pretend I was nevet a Girl Scout<br>
and I never learned how to twirl baton<br>
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh<br>
I feel a mysterious song coming on<br>

I think I hear I scream<br>
I think I hear ice cream<br>
melting all over<br>
the rock hard bread<br>
which is stuck to<br>
the chicken parts<br>
long since dead<br>
they're in a cold box<br>
within a cold box<br>
within a worm box<br>
(which is my room)<br>
there's a ceiling<br>
there's a floor<br>
there's a wall<br>
there's a window<br>
look at the moon<br>
it's a marble, it's a button<br>
it's a sequin, it's a polkadot<br>
stiched into the velvet sky<br>
the pocket of Sir Lancelot<br>
who is riding on Pegasus<br>
who is fighting with the Pleiades<br>
who is fighting Cassiopeia<br>
who is fighting with Hercules<br>
who is fighting with Betelguex<br>
who is fighting with the Milky Way<br>
that is stuck to the Bird's Eye Peas<br>
that is stuck to the ice cube tray<br>
that is stuck to the chicken parts<br>
that is stuck to the rock-hard bread<br>
hey, what am I doing here?
I should be home
defrosting my refrigerator<p>

But I want to be a mysterious woman<br>
I hate being so easy to read<br>
hey, bartender, give me a light
yeah, a Bud light<br>
and a plate of pommes frites<br>
is all I need<p></i>
