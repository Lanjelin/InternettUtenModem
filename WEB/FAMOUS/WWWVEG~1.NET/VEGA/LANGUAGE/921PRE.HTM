<title>Language 5:1, August 1992: Preface</title>

<h1>PREFACE</h1>

<pre> 	Mask will keep your features in check
 	Cause face is the place
 	Where the private goes public
 	And steps through the gate</pre>

In ten days the fourth album of Suzanne Vega will be available in your record store.
"Where the private goes public".....and everybody will be able to enjoy this incredi-
ble album.  But be prepared: the album kicks hard if you are already used to the 
sweetly romantic single "In Liverpool".<p>

The above quotation is from the bonus track on the European version of  99.9F&#176;.
It is called "Private Goes Public".  This time "Language" has a bonus too.  This
eleventh issue has many more pages, but this year there will only be a second is-
sue in December.  If you are interested to write something or to do something else
you have to send it in before November 23rd.<p>

I hope this will be an interesting issue for all of you.  Thanks to the people of the AGF
Management and especially Ron Fierstein.  Without their help it wouldn't have been
possible to publish an issue with an extensive review of 99.9F&#176;; the news, facts and
questions in "Rising Possibilities"; to have our own bonus track "Salt Water"; to pub-
lish the first available review in the New York Magazine'; and to show you some styl-
istic elements of 99.9F&#176;.<p>

The purpose of the Suzanne Vega Info Center and "Language" is still to give you as 
many information as available for the moment.  The second part of one of the most
interesting interviews I have ever read with Suzanne, the Songtalk Interview, will be
published in the next issue.  This interview is a kind of summary and a good prepa-
ration for the Suzanne Vega Crossword Puzzle, the surprising contribution of one of
our Vega-friends.<p>

Enjoy this issue and don't forget to rush to your record store, you never know if there
is a run on 99.9F&#176;.  Please let me know what you think of it.
