<title>Language 7:1, December 1994: Feather and Bone</title>

<h1>Feather and Bone</h1>
 

you said, come with me<br>
and so I did<br>
I thought I could take<br>
all your sorrow<br>
I thought I could hold it all<br>
I never imagined<br>
your oceans<br>
so bitter<br>
the killing<br>
the falling<br>
the slaughter<br>
of feather and bone.<p>

I sat, still<br>
in the five o'clock light<br>
the sun came in through the crack<br>
the floor to your room<br>
was all splinters<br>
and, still,<br>
some are remaining<br>
through skin<br>
and through flesh<br>
cutting in patterns<br>
like diamonds<br>
like needles<br>
down to the bone.<p>

I had to know<br>
I had to see<br>
I can take it all<br>
but I will learn<br>
to be free<p>

I loved you<br>
more that you'll ever know<br>
even through broken windows<br>
through the blood as it<br>
ran down your fist<br>
even<br>
though it was my life<br>
and my truth<br>
and my hope<br>
and my window gone.<p>

and now<br>
if you think I'm<br>
coming back home<br>
first I should tell you a secret.<br>
I sleep with a sword near my hand<br>
each night<br>
sharpened with dreams<br>
of your body<br>
your murder<br>
your blood<br>
as it runs down<br>
my street.<p>
