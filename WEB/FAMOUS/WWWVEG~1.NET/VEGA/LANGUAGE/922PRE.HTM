<title>Language 5:2, December 1992: Preface</title>

<h1>PREFACE</h1>

What the hell is going on with the Suzanne Vega Info Center?  They are
"extremely busy" with answering the mail and suddenly their address
appears in some Italian magazine.  We still don't know which one but maybe
one of our Italian friends can solve this mystery.  And all of a sudden
people are writing letters to Amsterdam because after sending a letter
ot postcard to New York they received a postcard with our address for further
information.  Of course we like that very much.  This year Language is
being read in Sweden, Finland, Germany, Italy, United Kingdom, Belgium,
Israel, Yemen, St. Maarten, Rumania, United States and even in the
Netherlands.
What will happen if all these members of the Info Center will tell their
Vega-friends about us?  Then we have to hire a person for answering the mail.
Hello, hello I like to do that.<p>

Well, we will see what happens next year.  Maybe then we will organize
another
Vega-party in Amsterdam or afterwards a concert of Suzanne somewhere in
Europe.  We remember the party of October 4 this year.  A memorable day
because of the discussions between Italy, Germany, Belgium and the
Netherlands
about the best song, video, album, haircut, etc.  We have not forgotten
this and maybe in the next issue of Language we will use some of that
information.  The next issue will be published in February.  It will be
a special issue about 99.9Fo and will include such topics as the Cohen-Vega
interview, the opinion of the critics and the success of Suzanne's amazing
album.<p>

Hopefully this issue is special to you too.  Please buy Shawn Colvin's album
as soon as possible, because even without a contribution from Suzanne it
is a good one.  You can read this in the review of Fat City.  Sweden plays
a big part this time with two interviews from Stockholm and the imaginative
opinion of our Swedish agent.  Read about the man behind the folk-rock,
Richard Thompson, Buddhism and the extra tracks of the single-CD's.  Part 2
of the SongTalk interview is as interesting as the first part.  Hopefully
you will be able to read this issue sitting under the Christmas tree.
Happy New Year!<p>
