	from "The Boulevardiers"
	cop. 1981 Suzanne Vega</pre>

Well, life isn't that simple anymore.  And neither are the songs of  Suzanne in 1992.  "The
Boulevardiers" is still my favourite of the non-recorded songs.  But seven years after her
all over the world highly acclaimed debut album and the commercially successfully follow-up Suzanne is back with 99.9 F&#176; that probably will produce the same effects.   Effects
that might have been expected with "Days Of Open Hand" but something went wrong.  It
didn't sell very good and by now it is the only album that ended up in the bargain-sale in
Holland.  Of course that doesn't say something about the artistic qualities.  But a lot of people were under the impression that "Days Of Open Hand" was too much "easy listening".  I never agreed with that opinion but I could understand it. Well, 99.9 F&#176; is really different and more important, it is excellent. As a Suzanne Vega fan you are always afraid that the new album won't be as good as the others. Instead of defending the new Vega-album you prefer to tell people that it will be the best of a whole year.  Well, 99.9 F&#176; exceeded
my wildest expectations.  Nobody ever did something like this, it's amazing good.   Mr.
Fierstein, Suzanne's manager and executive producer of all four albums, told me that
to his opinion 99.9 F&#176; is Suzanne's best album.  After four weeks of listening to the thir-
teen new songs I should agree with him if there hasn't been a song like "Cracking".

To attain the result that 99.9 F&#176; is the album that's on everyone's lips, the role of the
record company is very important.   Last year Rolling Stone published a critical article about A&M:<p>

  "Vega had been a classic example of how A&M could take an offbeat perform-
er and through creative marketing and promotion turn her into a commercial
success.  Through a strong alternative campaign that portrayed Vega as a cool,
idionsyncratic singer-songwriter in the tradition of Joni Mitchell, A&M was able
to sell 250,000 copies of Vega's debut album.  Her second record, "Solitude Standing",  contained "Luka", a song about child abuse that featured an infectious
melody line.  'All of a sudden they had a hit, and the album went platinum,' says
one record executive.  'That was typical A&M.'<p>

"But Vega's third album, 'Days Of Open Hand', released last year, was a commercial dud, selling about 350,000 copies.  Though Vega has been working very hard
to forge a new relationship with A&M, she feels the label didn't come through for
her last year.  Two months after 'Days Of Open Hand' was released, Moss himself
(Jerry Moss, record promoter A&M,; started A&M records with Herb Alpert) indicated to her over dinner that the company would not be spending any more money
to promote it.<p>

'He told me, 'Well Suzanne, you've made a brilliant record and they're just not
playing it on radio?' says Vega.  'He said, 'You're the kind of artist who will be
making records when you're sixty-five.  You should just go ahead and make an-
other record.'<p>

'At first it sounded like a compliment,' Vega continues.  'But after the dinner, I realized that had been the final blow.  He was basically telling me that was it for 
that album.'<p>

"Vega believes A&M lost sight of what she is about as an artist.  'Suddenly, I felt
like, because of the success of 'Luka', that I had been redefined,' she says.  'Somehow they had forgotten what I represented, what I stood for - that had been lost.
I never started making songs in order to get played on the radio - that was just a
nice bonus.  My intention ws never to be in competition with Top Forty artists.'<p>

(...)<p>

"But to be a truly successful company, A&M will need multiplatinum albums from a handful of major stars each year while breaking at least one or two new artists.
'I'm proud that we sold 2 million copies of the Police's greatest-hits album in Europe', says Levy.  'But I don't devote much of my time to thinking about that.  My
goal is Suzanne Vega's next album.  And what will the next Del Amitri album do?
What's impotant is for A&M to break new acts'.<p>

(Rolling Stone, May 16th, 1991)<p>

In 1992 A&M is able to tell us that they are very excited about Vega's new album, and
hope to make it Suzanne's most successful yet.  They are cooperating in every way.<p>

Two other issues concerning 99.9 F&#176; are the result of the kind of promotion by the
record company.  First of all the two singles and secondly the two bonus tracks for
Europe.  I asked Mr. Fierstein in a kind of fax-interview what A&M had in mind with
this decision:<p>

"There are two singles because different markets/territories offer different op-
portunities for promoting music, i.e., different formats of radio airplay, etc.  It's
a very complex issue, that I could discuss at great length -- however, the following explains the issue in one context.  In the U.S., etc. we are going with 'Blood
Makes Noise' because we want to appeal to the younger demographic by releas-
ing first a more 'radical', 'hipper' track.  Here we can promote that track through
MTV, music clubs and college and commercial radio stations that specialize in
that kind of music.  In a territory like the U.K., there simply does not exist that 
kind of radio diversity.  That market is dominated by Radio One (BBC), and the
U.K. record company chose 'In Liverpool' because they felt it had a better chance
as a single in that environment."<p>

"'Song Of Sand' is truly the last song on the album as it was conveived by Suzanne
and Mitchell Froom.  'Private Goes Public' is a 'bonus track' that was specifically
requested by the record company for inclusion on the European album only."<p>

Personally I agree with their opinion.  "In Liverpool" is a really good choice.  MTV Europe snatched it up and recorded an acoustic solo performance that is quite impressive.  Not really necessary then the video of this song is the best one since the release
of "Luka".  Hopefully, the success of this single is surprising too.  Suzanne herself about "In Liverpool":<p>

"It comes from one of the days that I was on tour.  It was a Sunday and I was in
a hotel room and I was across the street from the cathedral and the bells must
have rang for about an hour.  And I started to imagine who was ringing them. 
Who was ringing the bells?  And I started to imagine that there was some kind of
boy in the belfry and he was some lovesick person.  And from there I took it in to
imagining that I was the girl and there was an old boyfriend of mine who was
from Liverpool.  And I imagined that he was the one.  So it is sort of a romantic
fantasy."  (MTV-News, August 19th, 1992)<p>

"The difficult thing was that we weren't able to do the video in Liverpool.  We
ended up shooting in America.  But the video is split up right down in the middle.
There is one part that I am sitting in a room, singing and playing the guitar which 
has to be the reality part.  And then there is another part where I am the woman from the hunchback of Notre Dame and there is the boy in the belfry and the monk.  And
it becomes like this sort of wild fantasy.  And I am dancing as the gypsy girl which
sounds a bit precarious but I am really happy with it."
(MTV-Expo, August 23rd, 1992)<p>

I wish "In Liverpool" is successful as REM's "Losing My Religion" but I am not sure of
that.  The nineties are a difficult period for the original singer-songwriters.  Metal, rap
and country, especially in America, are very popular.  It's not only the problem of pro-
moting an album but even the album on its own can be a reason.  99.9 F&#176; is excellent
but I am a little bit afraid that press and public don't have enough patience to listen
to it really well.  Because only then it's possible ot discover the strength, the intentions
and the beauty.  Personal satisfaction is not dependent of chart success but success hangs on salability.<p>

Suzanne in one of the "first interviews":<p>

"I would leave the whole thing with a free and clear conscience and I would not
look back.  I don't have anything to prove.  I have enough money now to just wander the world if I wanted.  I don't need any more and it gives me great satisfaction
to know I don't need to plot and plan my career.   I feel I have nothing to lose.  If
I'm gonna continue to make records, I have to make it satisfying."<p>

About the frustration of being misinterpretated:<p>

"I do find it frustrating when people get it wrong, but I guess it's part of my job to
get out of bed and make people understand.  Perhaps I get misinterpreted because
of the way I look.  I'm a polite, pale person.  And I don't scream and curse much,
at least not in front of the tape recorders.  I don't use the obvious signs of anger and 
violence.  I don't have a shaved head like Sinead O'Conner and I don't dress up in
costumes like Kate Bush.  To all intents and purposes I seem innocuous.  I have
done since I was six years old.  It's because I'm reserved.  But I'm not timid.  People who listen to my records realise there's a whole weight behind my songs that
doesn't show in my face.  There are a lot of sensitive people in the world but that
doesn't mean we should listen to everyone who's bleating."
(Time Out, August 19th, 1992)<p>

Of course everybody is waiting.  They want to see how the album will be received by
press, radio, tv and by the selling public.  Maybe it is a good thing that there isn't  such
a gap in between 99.9 F&#176; and the former album like there was in between Solitude
Standing and Days Of Open Hand.  And almost everybody knows about "Tom's Diner".
Even my postman was humming the tune.  Next time I will tell him that 99.9 F&#176; is much
more the real Suzanne Vega.<p>
 
In the forthcoming weeks many people have to write a review about 99.9 F&#176;.  <p>

In conclusion some quotations of Suzanne's own opinion:<p>

"I thought, why not write about these really dark, horrible subjects, but with a sense
of humour.  Why not just fling away everything I've ever done before, why not?  I
guess a lot of things in my life had changed.  some long term relationships had bro-
ken up in the last year and I was working without my usual band.  That added to the
feeling of recklessness.  I guess Mitchell had said something about jumping off musical cliffs and that was the spirit with which we entered inot it: Hey, there's a cliff,
let's jump.  It's been great fun recording this album.  I wanted it to be fast and full of vitality.  I wanted to make my point and then quit.  I don't mean quit the business, I
mean the song.  That's why the songs are short and sort of in your face.  I've always
felt, the words had a lot of attitude, but for me the music has been a constant process of trying to be more vivid."<p>

"Before, the rule was to make everything sound clean and nice.  The intention would
be to sing on time, in time, and to get rid of any humming, buzzing, clanking, whirring, smashing noises.  This time it was to use everything we had.  To use the garbage as well as the clean stuff.  That made a lot more sense to me because that's 
how I write.  I pick up everything from little pieces of children's games to medical
text books.  We had a really great time.  How do yo keep that spirit going instead of
getting too old and serious about it?"  (Time Out, August 19th, 1992)<p>

Well, Suzanne made her point and hopefully the commercial results are as good as
she likes.  After listening to 99.9 F&#176; we like to see her live performing the songs.  Mr.
Fierstein about that:<p>

"We hope to tour the world in 1993, but we have made no firm plans yet.  We want
to wait to see how the album is received before committing to a tour.  However,
Suzanne will be doing a promotional tour in Europe during September during which
she may do some TV appearances.  The markets she's tentatively scheduled to visit are: Sweden, Holland, UK, Italy, Paris and Germany."<p>
