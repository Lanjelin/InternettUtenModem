<h1>FLEADH '92</h1>

On 7 June 1992, London celebrated Irish music at the Fleadh festival
(allegedly pronounced "flah"). Stuck in the mud of Finsbury Park
beside two junkies preparing something on a spoon, I listened to
Luka Bloom's energetic performance. He has named himself after
Suzanne Vega's battered Luka and James Joyce's trivial Irish-Jewish
Odysseus, Leopold Bloom. Luka Bloom performed his fine acoustic
cover of the rap song <i>I Need Love</i>, as well as his own <i>Delirious</i> and
<i>Gone to Pablo</i> from his first album, and some songs from the recent
album <i>The Acoustic Motorbike</i>.<p>
    After freeing myself from the dirt, I wandered about to feel the
atmosphere. There were a lot of traders and Irish agitators and some
leftover hippies and punks, but most people looked like quite
ordinary music lovers. I couldn't sense any togetherness at all,
people were simply too sober. And what is so desirable about being
part of a screaming mob, really?<p>
    Suzanne Vega should appear solo on stage three around a quarter
to six. The stage was in a huge tent which could hold a considerable
audience. As the programme promised, it took some fighting to get to
the front. I almost made it. Although I could see Suzanne perfectly,
the firm support of the fence would have been nice after standing
for hours.<p>
    Suzanne performing at an Irish festival might seem far-fetched.
The arrangers included her to widen the appeal of the festival and
because she has a good Irish following. Besides, some Irish blood
flows in her veins since her biological father is partly Irish.<p>
    At last Suzanne entered the stage, and her graceful beauty
immediately made her the centre of attention. She wore a tight black
shirt and loose grey trousers. Her hair was slightly longer than
recently, but still dyed copper.<p>
    Suzanne started the set with a new song, <i>Rock in This Pocket</i>
(or: <i>The Last Thing I Do</i>). It is a menacing song from the point-of-
view of David before he throws the stone at Goliath, and it is in
many ways a parallel to <i>In the Eye</i>. I also took it to be a song
about feeling small but wanting to get noticed, and about the right
to an individual perspective, however small. But in this song, like
in the Bible (1 Sam 17:4ff), a small thing can be very powerful. The
throwing of the stone could perhaps also be a metaphor for singing
and songwriting: "One moment / --- / It's what I need / --- / I'll
make you see".<p>
    The second song was M<i>arlene on the Wall</i>, a must in England.
Personally, I would have preferred something heard less often (why
not <i>Big Space</i>?). Then followed a wonderfully melancholy <i>Tired of
Sleeping</i>. <i>Neighborhood Girls</i> made a good contrast and is far more
effective played solo than it is on the album, which shows Suzanne's
range as a guitarist. <i>The Queen and the Soldier</i>, always a favourite,
was next.<p>
    Then came <i>Blood Sings</i>, an extremely moving song about looking at
damaged photographs of an ill-fated uncle Suzanne has never met, but
in whom she recognizes parts of herself. The beautiful melody and
urgent question "how did this come to pass?" makes me feel like
crying. This song is probably also about confronting personal
history and working through.<p>
    The next song, <i>When Heroes Go Down</i>, is a very direct and
powerful one "about people falling off of pedestals" and the
merciless treatment that awaits them. The recent downfall of
Communism and revolutionary heroes might have been an inspiration,
but there are no specific references at all. Both guitar and voice
are strong and rich -- for the first time Suzanne makes use of her
deep and forceful voice in singing.<p>
    The last of the new songs, <i>In Liverpool</i>, has stayed on my mind
and the haunting melody lives a life of its own inside of me.
Beginning very quietly, it describes a pale, ominous Sunday in
Liverpool. Suddenly, the silence is broken by a boy ringing the
church bells for half an hour and throwing himself down from the
tower. This loud and desperate chorus is again contrasted with
hushed and sparse verses expressing subdued memories of lost love.
The two moods are dramatically brought together when the speaker
identifies with the feelings of loss projected onto the "hunchback
in heaven". The magic of this song recalls the best live performances of Men in a War and the heartbreaking tone in Suzanne's voice
when she sings the word "fighting" in <i>Tired of Sleeping</i> on the
album. <p>
    <i>Luka</i> is still an urgent song, a masterpiece that hasn't lost its
appeal. Finally, the enthusiastic audience clapped and lilted to
<i>Tom's Diner</i> &agrave; la DNA. Despite frantic applause Suzanne never came
back for an encore, and when the next band entered the stage,
everyone left.<p>
    Immediately afterwards I felt a pang of disappointment. Was it
over already? I watched Suzanne backstage for a while and saw her
talking to Luka Bloom. When she signed someone's plaster cast I
almost wished I'd had a broken leg too. There was no chance to talk
to her this time.<p>

It is evident that Suzanne puts greater emphasis on melody than
before -- the new songs have a wider range and the music conveys more
subtle feelings. The musical beauty was further enhanced by her
marvellous guitar playing and more confident singing style.<p>
    The new songs also seem to be more emotional than her earlier
ones, perhaps suggesting that she has learnt how to feel her own
feelings in addition to thinking about them a lot. But the
intellectual aspect is certainly not lacking either.<p>
    Some images and themes in the new songs are easy to recognize
from Suzanne's earlier work. The lines "I'll be the girl / who sings
for my supper" are obviously derived from <i>The Rent Song</i> (which is
probably about ten years old). More interestingly, <i>Rock in This
Pocket</i> turns the stoic defiance of <i>In the Eye</i> into a heroic demand
for attention. The image of the small object making a great impact
has also been explored before (e.g. in <i>Undertow</i>), and there appears
to be an element of identification with that perfect inanimate
object -- which is peculiar to Suzanne Vega (e.g. in <i>Small Blue
Thing</i>). The battlefield is another metaphor that Suzanne frequently
returns to, most recently in both <i>Rock in This Pocket</i> and  <i>When
Heroes Go Down</i>. And the vague feelings of loss that so often tinge
her music are as present as ever. Like the recurring chorus of a
song, this is not simple repetition. Many of Suzanne's songs are
like photographs highlighting a specific situation or feeling, but
taken together they constitute a whole world view. It was extremely
satisfying to hear that the new songs are part of the rich web of
images, symbols and thoughts that make up the wonderful world of
Suzanne Vega.<p>
    I have a need to understand Suzanne's songs, to analyze them,
which is both fun and intellectually stimulating. But their real
magic cannot be grasped with the intellect. The slow process of
assimilating the songs and the sudden revelations they bring is what
really matters. Suzanne forces me to change myself and my perception
of the world; she helps me to endure and see beauty in life -- and to
feel my own feelings.<p>
    How I long for the new album...<p>

<pre>                                 * * *</pre>

The reviewers in the English papers didn't even mention Suzanne's
performance, while their colleagues were busy mercilessly digging up
the most intimate details of Princess Diana's marital life.
Irrelevant as it may seem, the silence of the press can result in a
grim economic reality that stifles creativity. Why has Suzanne not
produced the new album herself, for instance? I really hope she
hasn't yielded to short-sighted pressure from the record company.
Professional advice may be a short cut to a nice result as the two
first albums proved, but the strength of Suzanne's music does not
lie in a slick production. On the other hand, leaving the minutiae
to others may be necessary, and economic factors must unfortunately
also be taken into consideration. After all, it is thanks to the
commercial success of Suzanne's records that she has reached us all
and helped lots of abused children. It isn't as easy as art for
art's sake. I am convinced Suzanne's instinct and intelligence will
put her on the right track. And she has held her ground before.<p>
