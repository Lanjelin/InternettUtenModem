<h1>NEWS</h1>

* The fourth album by New Hampshire folk singer Bill Morrissey includes an
unexpected contribution from Suzanne Vega.  She is assisting Bill on backing
vocals on the titletrack of Inside.  And after Handsome Molly on Bill's album
Standing Eight of 1989 this is already the second contribution.  But we are
to the beautiful voice of Suzanne, especially when she is singing backing
vocals.  Just remember In a Lonely Place of the Smithereens and Diamond In
The Rough of Shawn Colvin.<p>

* Brian Rose, known as the photographer of Suzanne's story of Tom's Diner and
one of the founders of Fast Folk, is working on an album produced by Suzanne
Vega.  (Fast Folk-Musical Magazine, October 1992)<p>

* During her promotional tour in Sept.-Oct., Suzanne participated in a
benefit concert sponsored by Pavarotti, and staged at his ranch in Modena,
Italy.  Suzanne performed In Liverpool (singing live to a backing track),
and her performance will likely be included on a video and album PolyGram
is putting out of the show.  Also performing are Sting and Aaron Neville,
among others.  Pavarotti really seems to like Suzanne.<p>

* The video for the second single 99.9 F&#176; is being directed by the same
fellow, Nico Beyer, who did Blood Makes Noise.  In Europe Blood Makes Noise
will probably be worked after 99.9 F&#176;.  After that, the next likely single
is When Heroes Go Down.  The video will be directed by Peter Care, and will
feature appearances by Mitchell Froom on keyboards, Tchad Blake on guitar,
and Bruce Thomas on bass.  Next year we hope to write a review about the
four videos.<p>

* There exist several remixes of Blood Makes Noise.  One is by Mitchell Froom
and Tchad Blake.  The others are by C&amp;C Music Factory.  These are mainly
being used to promote the single in clubs and they are available only on the
12" vinyl single.<p>

* Rock In This Pocket is part of a German compilation album which is a
promotional and charitable project.  It is a TV advertised album sold at
a reduced price.  The purpose of including one of Suzanne's tracks is to
get the music heard by a range of people who might otherwise not hear it.<p>

* A World Tour will commence Suzanne and band in the U.S. on January 28,
1993.
The U.S./Canada leg will last until March 16 or 17.  A European leg will
follow in April and May.  The only dates announced so far are those on the
list.  Other dates will hopefully be announced shortly.  By then every member
of the Info Center will receive a newsletter.<p>
<br>
The band will include Marc Shulman, Mike Visceglia and Frank Vilardi.  Mark
Hart, who has played with Crowded House among others, will play keyboards
for the U.S. leg.  Mitchell Froom himself will play keyboards for the
European leg.  Kitchens of Distinction support on all shows.

&#91;an article from an unknown Italian magazine&#93;<p>

<b>Suzanne Vega</b> sta lavorando al suo quarto album negli studi Dreamland
Recordings a Bearsville.  La produzione e affidata a Mitchell Froom (Los
Lobos,
Peter Case, Elvis Costello, Pretenders, Crowded House) che suona anche le
tastiere in tutto il disco.  Froom ha interpellato, come session men, Jerry
Marotta alla batteria e Bruce Thomas al basso, il disco dovrebbe contenere 13
o 14 brani.  Ecco alcuni dei titoli probabilmente coinvolti:  "Rock in this
pocket", "Blood makes noise", "When heroes go down", "In Liverpool", "Bad
Wisdom", "Song of sand".  Se siete interessati ad informazioni su Suzanne
Vega,
