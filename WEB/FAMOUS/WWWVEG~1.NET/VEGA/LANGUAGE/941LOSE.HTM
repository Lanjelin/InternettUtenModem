<title>Language 7:1, December 1994: Beautiful Losers</title>

<h1>BEAUTIFUL LOSERS</h1>


stirred up by the noise i saw<br>
my clumsy words were worn out fast<br>
when the tower fell i knew<br>
they were not build to last<p>

so get me out of Babylon!<br>
lead me through this ruined town<br>
where people scream, lie lame like me<br>
spitting on your gown<p>

they snatched at me, they whispered loud<br>
"split your tongue so you'll have two!"<br>
i did and now i cannot but<br>
to cry help out to you<p>

help out to you who read me today<br>
help out to you who put my heart down<br>
help out to you who sighed without hurt<br>
that in the beginning was the word<p>

when you saw me burning down<br>
you taught me to be modest ashes<br>
you scattered me into the wind<br>
then taught me to the flashes<p>

my tongue you took to make it one<br>
and from my lips you washed the dirt<br>
you cut away the sore and sang<br>
"a word is a word is a word"<p>

welcome to you who read me today<br>
welcome to you who put my heart down<br>
welcome to you, teacher and slave,<br>
who kept me in verses so silently save<p>

when you went you kissed my tongue<br>
"don't get lost in the phrase" you said<br>
you left me, you left me at peace with the word<br>
and i'd like to thank you for that<p>

so thank you to thee who read my today<br>
thank you to thee who put my heart down<br>
thank you to thee, darling and friend,<br>
who miss me forever in you trip to the end.<p>
