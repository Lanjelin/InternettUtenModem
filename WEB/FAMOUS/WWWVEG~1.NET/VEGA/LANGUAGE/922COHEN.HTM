<title>Language 5:2, December 1992: Cohen Meets Suzanne</title>

<h1>COHEN MEETS SUZANNE</h1>

On a recent autumn day in Los Angeles, Leonard Cohen entered the gates of A &
M
Records carrying a bottle of red wine.  He made his way to the offices of the
international department yo meet up with his long-time friend, Suzanne Vega.
The two had previously agreed to get together around the L.A. shoot of
Suzanne's 99.9 F&#176; video to spend some time together discussing Suzanne's new
album.<p>

"To this end, we provided the pair with a couple of wine glasses, a
microphone
and tape recorder and we closed the door."<p>

The discussion that ensued - consistently compelling, at times exotic - has
yielded into a transcript.  In fact, the conversation represents one of
Suzanne Vega's most in-depth interview sessions to date and provides poignant
insight into her motivation for making the innovative 99.9 F&#176; album.<p>

With a new album of both Suzanne and Leonard Cohen (The Future) this unique
interaction will be used as an additional promotional tool.<p>

In the next issue of Language we will publish the most interesting parts of
this very special interview.  For now we leave you with this little teaser.<p>

Cohen:  That's another theme in this record, or at least in one of the songs,
     two of the songs, that there is something you find out too early.  Now
     I don't mean to be tedious with this emphasis on this secrecy but not
     everybody writes every song about something that happens offstage, about
     something that is concealed.  about a secret that is not told, not
     whispered.<br>
        It appears in a number of the songs.  It's a strong theme in the
     record, and that's why I'm just poking around trying to find out what
     this is.  Not what the secret is but what your devotion to the secret is
     and how it became in a certain sense the aesthetic irritation around
     which the pearl of the song formed.  It's something that seems to be
very
     present in your psyche, this notion that there's something to be
     concealed, something to be discovered, something glimpse behind the
veil.
     It seems to be there over and over again and forgive me for trying to
     uncover something which has been so deliberately concealed.<p>

Suzanne:  Well, I understand your reasons for it, but I suppose in the long
     run, it's become the way I prefer to work because there's something
     beautiful in it to me.  There's something beautiful in presenting it
     that way with the whole mystery about it intact.  I think the kind of
     writing that I always loved was the kind of writing that had all the
     complications in it and everything was not explained completely.  You
     have to say the same thing about your own work.  You don't reveal
     everything, relationships are not always clear.  There's a lot of
     specific things that are hinted at and you fill in the rest with your
     imagination but you don't come out and blurt out the sort of obvious
     arithmetic of it.  You don't come out and say, "Well, I loved you and
     you don't love me" although maybe you have said that.
