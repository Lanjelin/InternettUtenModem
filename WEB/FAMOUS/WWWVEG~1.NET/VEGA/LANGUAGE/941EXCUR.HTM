<h1>EXCURSIONS INTO SUZANNE'S WORLD</h1>

<h3>(1) Joining The Boulevardiers</h3>

Hello, excuse me, you look like, as you are here, you look... -- Like? -- Like someone who wants to
find out more. -- Find out more, about what? -- There is no short and obvious way of describing.
Maybe it's a certain angle you get from a certain point of view, a way of seeing, a perspective; it's
also something inside of you, that relates to people, and things. -- Things, from the material world? --
The material world of things, the aerial world of dreams and concepts, of which You are the
connection, in <b><i>Suzanne's World</i></b>. I am, just at this moment, a kind of guide. You wouldn't have
recognized me otherwise. And I wouldn't have taken notice of you. We wouldn't have met here. At
this time. At this place. Which is, maybe, part of it already. You see, I am not here to show you one
way or another but it's okay if you feel a longing. Let me tell you first how I came here.<p>
   Well, the first time I heard one of Suzanne's songs was on a radio program called <b><i>Night Flight</i></b>. It
took place weekly, between Saturday and Sunday around midnight. It always started somewhere, and
after two hours landed somewhere else and always seemed to be the first one in a series that never
materialized. I tried to get the plane each Saturday for about seven years until it took off the last time
to go to an unknown destination. Since then, when I'm about to listen to a new unheard record with
great anticipation, I try to make sure to have silence around me, to be in an inspired mood, in the
middle of the night, somewhere in space and time, in-between two days. I try to be really open to get
that <b><i>first impression</i></b> that under those conditions blends together pictures from films, dreams, from my
own experience with those I'm actually creating while listening to the song. To me it was the first
prove of the power and strength of her songs that these images have not faded after time. In a strange
way they seem to be new every time of listening; and they are following me, to be recalled sometimes
someplace. Like here.<p>
   We have to go for a quest. Let's call us <b><i>The Boulevardiers</i></b>. Sometimes we will be many, sometimes
we will be few, sometimes just the two of us. Most of the travelling we have to do for ourselves, and
at all the places we have to walk, they are not easily accessible. Follow the path of the <i><b>songlines</b></i> into
Suzanne's World. It is certainly a very real one, but there are always realms under the surface, and
they are always very near...<p>
   Our journey begins at a place where many worlds meet: New York; somewhere in an open space, in
a park. It is a cold and clear winter afternoon with almost no snow, and something is happening...<p>
   <b><i>It's a one time thing \ It just happens a lot...</i></b> -- What do you mean? \ 'A one time thing' if it
happens a lot? \ Will it happen to me? \ Has it happened to you? \ I just like to know what's on the
plot! -- I don't know. \ Seems to be there \ when you're about to remember \ what since the last time
you forgot. <b><i>Walk with me \ and we will see \ what we have got</i></b> --.<p>
   We get the rhythm of walking and we don't care much where from or where to, and our <b><i>footsteps
are ticking \ like water dripping from a tree</i></b>. Are you hearing something? -- We have to be very silent
now, like <b><i>walking a hairline \ and stepping very carefully</i></b>. -- Someone came along, someone was
passing by, he or she? Someone was murmuring, or was I talking to myself? -- What did you hear? -- It
was kind of a riddle, with a monotone melody... -- "<b><i>My heart is broken \ It is worn out at the knees \
Hearing muffled \ Seeing blind \ Soon it will hit the Deep Freeze...</i></b>" -- One cold winter day I walked
along a coast in Sweden. On she shore I saw a piece of ice, something seemed to be inside, totally
surrounded in its icy shell. I took it with me and left it near the fireplace. When I looked after it later,
I found a small, wet, red, smooth, heart-shaped stone... -- A nutshell under my shoe, or under yours,
or a piece of ice? -- <b><i>Something is cracking \ I don't know where \ Ice on the sidewalk</i></b> -- We're walking
under the trees, <b><i>brittle branches \ in the air</i></b> just above our heads, and beyond there's a pale blue sky, a
velvet underground.<p>
   And as it is darkening we realize that we're once again on the playground where we played games
that changed with the time. And <b><i>the sun is fading fast \ Upon the slides into the past \ Upon the
swings of indecision \ In the winter</i>time</b> -- First it's the cold and the excitement, the <b><i>tickling and
trembling \ of freeze tag \ in the dark</i></b>. Next time   <b><i>I stand with my hands in my pocket \ and lean
against the wall \ I feel like Bogart \ and you look like Bacall</i></b>. -- Time goes in circles. Now we're the
actors we once just played, I am now Ladd and you are now Lake. -- <b><i>Slow fade now to black \ Let's
play one more game of chivalry \ You and me</i></b> \ -- We watch <b><i>the dimming diamonds scattering in the
park</i></b> -- See, someone 's working late up there in the Trade Center! -- No, this is a star already... -- \
<b><i>And we can only say Yes now \ To the sky, to the street, to the night...</i></b>
