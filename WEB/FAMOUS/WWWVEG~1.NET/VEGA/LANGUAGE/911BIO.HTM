<h1>SUZANNE VEGA - BIO UPDATE</h1>


The release of "Days Of Open Hand" in April 1990 was met
enthusiastically by the press.  Rolling Stone, featuring the album in
a a 4-star lead review said:

<pre>	With each new album, Suzanne Vega gets
	stronger.  Days Open Hand is her hardest
	and loveliest music yet; it is distinguished
	by a prayerful intensity and a clean, sharp
	intelligence that announce a young artist
	fully come into her own...

	With Days, Vega assumes her place in the folk
	tradition as an individual talent.  Bob Dylan did
	it when he moved from the offhand plain speaking of
	folk songs into a denser folk rock...  Vega's record takes
	a similar leap; she's now beyond borders, making an 
	unaffected art music that's heady, heartfelt, very
	demanding - and very rewarding...

	Suzanne Vega's Days Of Open Hand is music on the 
	edges - the edges of redemptive meaning, tears and wisdom.</pre>

This view was shared around the world:  From Britain:  "Suzanne Vega
records sound like clear pools of sound" (N.M.E);  "A beautiful
record" (Sounds); "Vega is still unrivaled" (Q).  Also, Germany's
leading Stern Magazine called her "the woman who fell from heaven";
Holland's Language: "With her third album Days Of Open Hand, Suzanne
Vega has evolved into one of the clearest, most poetic voices of the
nineties";  Australia's X-Press:  "The soft-spoken wiz-kid from New
York has come of age with this one...  Suzanne has... moved into a
world of high-tech production and incredibly intricate arrangements,
so successfully as to make Days of Open Hand her best album to date"; 
and Italy's La Republica: "One could be tempted to say she is the
best...  extremely precise and detailed work...  her unmistakable
touch stretches from her physical appearance to the elegant album
cover and ends up resounding in all the 11 songs on the record."<p>

This universal acclaim culminated on January 10, 1991 with the
announcement by NARAS that "Days Of Open Hand" had been nominated for
two Grammy Awards:  Best Contemporary Folk Recording, and Best Album
Package.<p>

In support of the album, Suzanne toured the world in 1990:  the U.S.,
Canada, Europe (including Prague, Budapest, East Berlin, Zagreb, and
Belgrade - her first shows ever in Eastern Europe) and Japan.  The
reception was very gratifying (see U.S. reviews on attached Pollstar
ad; in this magazine on the last page), and was shared by audiences
and critics worldwide:  Suzanne "is quietly powerful, witty and
well-sussed, and sings extraordinarily perceptive songs as sweetly as
an orphaned angel" (Melody Maker - UK);  "Sensitivity, naturalness,
sense of humor, brains and the strength of poetic intuition were the
weapons with which Suzanne Vega made the whole audience spellbound"
(Helsingen Sanomat - Finland)<p>

Another surprise in 1990 was the emergence of a dance remix of
Suzanne's a-capella recording "Tom's Diner" as an international hit. 
The remix, which was done by two enterprising Londoners who go by the
name DNA, has been a Top Five Single in virtually every major market
worldwide, including #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, #2 in U.K., and #1
on the German charts for an incredible 7 weeks.  This single spawned
cover versions all over the world, of every variety - dance, reggae,
children's, rap, parody...  Many of these are being collected for
release in September 1991 on a compilation album, "Tom's Album," that
will also include a bonus track; a remix by DNA of Suzanne's Rusted
Pipe from Days of Open Hand.<p>

The first half of 1991 has seen Suzanne busy making several benefit
and tribute appearances in support of various causes.  She's appeared
at Princeton University in support of the Nuclear Disarmament
movement, at Canada's Juno Awards participating in a tribute to
Leonard Cohen, on Arista Records' Deadicated album - a tribute to the
Grateful Dead that benefited the Rainforest Environmental Action
Coalition, and New York's Hudson River Clearwater Festival, at a
Brooklyn College Anti-Bigotry event, and a Guggenheim Museum event in
support of an arts in the schools program for disadvantaged children,
and others.<p>

This summer, she will be making a few select solo appearances around
the world, including the Cambridge Fok Festival (U.K.) on July 27,
Dranouter Festival (Belgium) on Aug. 3, WOMAD Festivals in Seinajoki,
Finland on Aug. 4 and Jokohama, Japan on Aug. 31, and the legendary
Newport Folk Festival in the U.S. on Aug. 10.<p>

Suzanne intends to commence work on a new album sometime later this
year, with an eye towards having a release sometime in '92.<p>
