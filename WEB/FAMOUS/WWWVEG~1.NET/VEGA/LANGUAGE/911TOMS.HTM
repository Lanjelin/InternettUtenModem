<title>Language 4:1, December 1991: Tom's Album Review</title>

<h1>TOM'S ALBUM REVIEW</h1>

Has there always been a dance element to Suzanne Vega's music?  The
release of Tom's album certainly seems an appropriate moment to dive
into the Vega back catalogue and find out.  The cracking contribution
to the movie Pretty In Pink, Left of Center, showed that a mild
danceableness (thanks mainly to Arthur Baker) didn't harm her
thoughtful lyrics, and although it would be difficult to shake a let
to most of her other recorded work to date, (apart perhaps from Book
of Dreams, which set her up as Belinda Carlisle's mature sister) the
potential is there.  Vega's peculiar, Lou Reed influenced way of half
speaking, half singing her lyrics and the strong rhythmical texture of
most of her songs would both work well in a more dance oriented
context.  It is undeniable, however, that a lot of people who like
Suzanne Vega hated the DNA remix of Tom's diner, and an equal amount
of people who loathed her Girl-with-Guitar image loved it.  Does this
mean that Vega fans are afraid to dance?  Well, they could always take
up ballet...  At one point there was talk of a full album of Vega
remixes, but now that idea seems to have been put on hold.  A shame
really, because the remix of Rusted Pipe, which is featured on Tom's
Album, again shows how well Suzanne Vega songs can be adapted to the
dance floor.  There is a spiritual side to house music that is hardly
ever recognized but which goes very well with the song's lyrical theme
of self renewal.  Apart from Rusted Pipe there are twelve other tracks
on Tom's Album  Three of those we know.  The original a-capella
version and the instrumental version of Tom's Diner, which were both
featured on "Solitude Standing," and the 'original' DNA remix.  Which
leaves nine versions of varied quality.  Among the highlights are
Daddy's Lttle Girl, a funky rap version by Nikki D, with a new lyric
about 'getting nasty with Vaughn' and unwanted pregnancy.  Apparently
it is one of Vega's own favourites too.  Equally endearing is
"Jeannie's Diner," which incorporates the theme tune of the t.v.
series "I Dream Of Jeannie."  Marilyn Whitelaw's vocals are charmingly
out of key, which only adds to the gentle amusement.  Then there's
"Waiting At The Border," sung by Beth Watson, which takes the
viewpoint of a soldier in the Gulf War who is 'sitting in a bunker in
the middle of the desert' and reflects on the moment that he will be
called upon to go out and fight.  There are some crap versions
included too.  Take Michigan & Smiley, who churn out a rather lame
reggae version or the NDA Project, which is little more than an
inferior Itale-house imitation of the original DNA remix.  There is
also a Swedish version, "Takes Kafe" by Mats Hojer, which somehow
makes me glad that no one tried a Dutch one.  In the 'interesting'
category fall the versions of Peter Behrens and After One.  The first,
called Dep De Do Dep and sung in German, centers around the song's
hook line, and the problem that you can't get it out of your head once
you've heard it.  The Tom's Diner rap by After One takes the viewpoint
of someone in Tom's diner who is watching Suzanne Vega go through the
events that make up the song.  The funniest and at the same time most
embarrasing version included here comes in the form of Tom's ? by
Bingo Hand Job, who consist of REM, Peter Holsapple, and Billy Bragg. 
It was recorded during REM's now legendary 1991 performances at the
Borderline club in London.  Suffice to say that is even worse than
their drunken version of Roger Miller's "King Of The Road" (which is
on the Dead Letter Office album).  All in all, Tom's Album is an
entertaining listen which nearly fills the gap between "Days Of Open
Hand" and the new album which should be released in 1992.
