Suzanne Vega is since the beginning of this year a part of my life. I love her
fantastic music so much, so much that it isn't possible for me to say it in my own
words. I'm interested to get to know people who want to share with me the
enthusiasm. Please write to Martin Biewener, Behringweg 5, 31737 Rinteln,
Germany.<p>
