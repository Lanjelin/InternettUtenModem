<h1>GUITAR SOLO: RICHARD WHOM?</h1>

(25 years Richard Thompson history)<p>

However small his role on the new Vega album may be, you hardly can't miss
his remarkable, striking guitar solo in As Girls Go.  In my opinion, this
contribution certainly makes the song one of the album's best.  The person
who is responsible for this "catchy tune" is the British singer/songwriter
and guitarist Richard Thompson (1949).  The following article reviews the
impressive career of a man who has been active in music business for a
quarter of a century now.<p>

He grew up as a son of a policeman in the suburbs of London and learnt guitar
from friends of his eldest sister.  When he was seventeen years old, he was
one of the founding members of Fairport Convention, a band which would turn
out to be one of the most important folk-rock bands in the history of
popmusic.
The girl singer of the convention, Sandy Denny, was with no doubt one of the
best female singer/songwriters ever until her unfortunate premature death of
a brain hemorrhage in 1978.  One other early-time member, the singer Ian
Matthews, formed his own band Matthews Southern Comfort and hit the charts in
1970 with his song Woodstock ("We are stardust we are golden...").<p>

Thompson and Denny were the main songwriters of the band.  Their compositions
on the albums are being interchanged with traditional folk songs like Tam Lin
as well as covers from colleagues like Bob Dylan.  The best-known hitsingle
of the Convention is Si Tu Dois Partir, Va-t-en ('68), a cover from Dylan's
If You Gotta Go, Go Now.  With Thompson, Fairport Convention released five
albums, including the ultimate folk-rock album Liege and Lief (1969).<p>

Thompson left the band in 1971 to begin a solo career.  He took his decision
because he felt that the F.C. approach towards folk-music was still too
restricted.  He thought it could be integrated more with the English rock and
roll(2).  From '74 till '82 he recorded 6 albums with his wife Linda.  Two of
these albums (I Want To See Bright Lights Tonight and Shoot Out The Lights)
are in the Rolling Stone album top 100 of all times.<p>

After he continued making solo records.  Occasionally he appears on reunions
of the Fairport Convention.  He also evolved to an appreciated session-
guitarist, who cooperated with people like J.J. Cale, Crowded House, Bonnie
Raitt, Mitchell Froom and Shawn Colvin (You should recognize that name).
Colvin also played with the Richard Thompson band during his U.K. tour last
summer.<p>

His latest release is the 1991 album Rumor And Sigh.  It is his ninth solo
album, and has just as the two before been produced by Mitchell Froom (who
also produced 99.9 F&#176;).  The songs are an excellent mixture of modern rock
and traditional folk music.  A look at the cd-inlay shows that the used
instruments are not the ones of an average rock album:  chamberlin, celeste,
shawm, hurdy-gurdy, accordion... A very diverse set of instruments with very
unusual names.  Nevertheless it's his greatest commercial success until now,
selling twice the quantity of his previous albums.  The humourful and
ironical
lyrics are sometimes alternated with serious sad songs like Grey Walls which
seems to relate to a former lover who is being treated in a mental hospital.
One other striking song called Psycho Street is a very strange song about
crazy people: lyrics which could easily be taken out of a Stephen King novel,
and music that one moment sounds like Talking Heads' Psycho Killer, and next
moment like What A Day For A Daydream.  In sharp contrast are more animated
songs like Read About Love and I Misunderstood, which in an ironical way tell
the story of a man or a boy with just too much bad luck: "...She said (...)
We'll always be such good friends, you and I / But I misunderstood (..) /
I thought she was saying good luck / She was saying goodbye..."  You'd almost
feel sorry for him, won't you?<p>

This autumn, Thompson was in Holland to do some solo performances.  On stage
he turned out to be not only a great performer but also a great entertainer.
It's not just his lyrics which are very funny, he is also able to transmit
his humour to the audience and is a good improviser.  With his ironical
remarks
and little stories he strings his repertory which includes songs from his
latest album but also some very, very old songs.  Fragile folk of She Moves
Through The Fair meets the polka in Don't Sit On My Jimmy Shands and the old
fashioned rock 'n roll of Shake, Rattle & Roll in a fine concert.  Suzanne
certainly knows how to choose her people to work with!<p>

<h4>Pop Talk</h4>

<b>R</b>emember the good old days, when music was divided into three categories:
country, pop and blues?  These days, music terms are multiplying faster than
John Hughes movies.  For the confused, we have asembled the latest in sound
speak.<p>

<b>ANTIFOLK:</b>  Basically, folk singers who whine "I am <i>not</i> a folkie," even
if the Birkenstock fits.  Check out Suzanne Vega, Michelle Shocked, Billy
Bragg and 10,000 Maniacs in the folk section of Tower Records (but don't
tell them we sent you).<p>
