* After the last leg of the tour, in New Zealand and Australia  (June/July 1993), 
Suzanne Vega wants to start a new writing period to come up with material for a
new album that she would like to record fairly quickly, e.g., early '94. She will
very likely work again with Mitchell Froom.<p>

* There is no official live recording of the tour, but the management has taken a 
few of the tracks that they recorded for the Westwood One radio network in
America, 
and have packaged them for a special live EP for release in Japan, only as a tour-
related promotional package. The recording was done at The Coach House in San
Juan

Blood Makes Noise, Marlene On The Wall, In Liverpool, Left Of Center, (If You
Were) In My Movie and When Heroes Go Down.<p>
