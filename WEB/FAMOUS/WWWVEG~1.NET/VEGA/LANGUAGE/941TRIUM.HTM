<h1>WRITTEN AFTER A TRIUMPHANT FIGHT</h1>

I'm the baddest girl in the world<p>
I'm as bad as Super Fly<p>
and I don't need coke to get me high.<p>
I can beat you, Jack<p>
and you better get back<p>
when the Vega's come around.<p>
We'll kick your ass, and make it last,<p>
I got evil eye, and you sure gotta try<p>
to put me on the ground.<p>
I don't play, hey, you know what I say<p>
when I say it or pay.<p>
I can stare you down,<p>
make you crawl on the ground.<p>
I'm action, no talk, when I say to you walk, I'm not the kind you can knock.<p>
I use only my hands, no bottles for me<p>
But I got plans, and you won't go home free.<p>
When I don't smile, you know you're in trouble<p>
'cause I can get wild, I ain't got no double.<p>
I can make you cry, I can make you wanna die.<p>
No one beat me yet, and they ain't gonna get the chance.<p>
I can take mine and the little folks at the same time.<p>
I'm the baddest girl in the world.<p>
