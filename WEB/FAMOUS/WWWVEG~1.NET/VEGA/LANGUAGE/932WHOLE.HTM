<title>Language 6:2, August 1993: Those Whole Girls</title>

<h1>THOSE WHOLE GIRLS</h1>

<i>Those Whole Girls</i> unfortunately seems to be one of Suzanne's least
popular songs. It may not be her most evocative or beautiful song,
but it is doubtlessly one of the most original and effective. As a
clever experiment, it is fascinating enough, but it also works
uncomfortably well on a gut level. And Suzanne's own production is
far more daring than that which Mitchell Froom later did, and this
was even before the DNA remix...<p>
    On the surface, this song is an envious description of happy
girls; a list of signs of their wholeness. But, the abstract way the
girls are described surely doesn't make us see <i>them</i>. Rather, we see
the speaker, who presumably is nothing of what they are. We should
identify with her and feel miserably envious.<p>
    Biographically, it is easy to see Suzanne behind the speaker.
Being a sickly child, different from the rest of her family, she was
always "left of center" and saw her own body as "a collection of
weird things". A hurt child who is missing something, not knowing
what, and believing the other children to be whole and happy.<p>
    But the identification with the speaker is made difficult by the
strange, mechanical, staccato quality of the song -- the words are
only one syllable long and have a crisp, abstract sound. The music
further strengthens this alienation effect. We hear the song in a
different way.<p>
    Two words stand out because they are two syllables long:
"intact" and "mercy". They are the quintessence of the song -- since
those whole girls are <i>intact</i> (literally "untouched", implying the
possibility of shattering hurt), they need no <i>mercy</i>. Still, as the
last verse nags, they "run in grace", which the whole song
exemplifies. Mark how carelessly they receive this grace that the
speaker is so desperately lacking!<p>
    Thus, the strange form of the song not only makes the listener
critical, but also emphasises the almost unbearable envy, and the
paradoxical distribution of grace that is its cause. If it were not
for the incessant repetition of the last verse, this would be an
extremely unredeemed song.<p>
    "Run in grace" is repeated and repeated and repeated until it is
faded out and the repetition is left to continue inside the
listener. Slowly, the words lose their literal meaning and dissolve.
At the same time, the envious feeling the words carry become more
and more absurd and nauseating. (Try repeating any word in your own
language, and note the effect! Even your own name will eventually
turn into a sickening muddle of foreign sounds.)<p>
    The futility of envy becomes very clear as a reaction to the
song. The happiness of those whole girls is, in retrospect, hollow.
A somewhat Buddhist thought, perhaps.<p>
    This revelation is the listener's own, which of course is the
only way it can ever be a revelation. The song has worked with great
precision and transcended all biographical particularities.
