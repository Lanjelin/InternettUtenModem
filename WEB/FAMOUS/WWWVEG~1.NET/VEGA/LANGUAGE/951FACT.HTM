<b>OLD FACTORY TOWN</b>
   <p>
As I was sleeping the rain fell down<br>
Washing the streets of this old factory town<br>
I dreamed of the watchman making his rounds<br>
As the rain fell on this old factory town<br>
   <p>
When I awoke my wife was gone<br>
Down to the kitchen at the break of dawn<br>
I could hear her humming our favorite song<br>
When I awoke at the break of dawn<br>
   <p>
I kissed her waving frame in the door<br>
To rustle the kids and tend to the chores<br>
Each night she whispers let's have one or two more<br>
Rustling kids to tend to the chores<br>
   <p>
I punched in at seven at J.T. McTell<br>
Iron and brass hotter than hell<br>
Where I cast the clappers of church steeple bells<br>
Iron and brass at J.T. McTell<br>
   <p>
The whistle at four to the bar for a round<br>
Quenching the thirst of this old factory town<br>
The lights come up as the sun goes down<br>
Over the bars in this old factory town<br>
   <p>
As I was sleeping down the rain fell<br>
To strike in the streets and scatter pell mell<br>
Oh I dream of the clamor of all the church bells<br>
Cast in iron and brass at J.T. McTell<br>
