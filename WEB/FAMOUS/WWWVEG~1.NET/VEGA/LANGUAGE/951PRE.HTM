Hello again!
<p>
Although not on purpose, it's again a year ago since the last issue of Language came out. But the good
news is... this issue contains an awful lot of information. 
<p>
Miss Vega became Mrs. Froom, for example. And do you know the connection between Amnesty
International, Leonard Cohen, jail and the Polar Sea? Suzanne Vega, that's obvious, but how, you can read
it all on the following pages.
<p>
Furthermore in this issue you will find stories about Brian Rose and Hector Zazou, as well as a compilation
of reactions on the 'First time hearing Suzanne' query on the internet.
<p>
And there is more, much more. You can read it all for yourself and find out.
<p>
We hope you enjoy reading this issue of Language as much as we did editing and writing it. But remember,
we still need you to help us with articles, critics, photographs or whatsover to keep the future issues
coming. 
<p>
Hopefully the next issue will be filled with a lot of critics and comments on the new Vega album.
<p>
Karien and Huub.
