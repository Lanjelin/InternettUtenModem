<title>Language 6:1, February 1993: Preface</title>

<h1>PREFACE</h1>

This issue of Language is a special one. Almost the whole issue is the interview of Leonard Cohen with Suzanne Vega of last year (see also Language vol 5 no 2).<p>

Because of a lack of space in this issue and a lack of time of me this issue doesn't contain the results of 99.9 F&#176;. I will try it again for the next issue. By then it is possible for you again to publish something in Language. For example a review of the Suzanne Vega concert you will visit.<p>

Yes, yes, on page 25 you will find all the touring dates of Suzanne Vega that are available right now. During my holidays the Suzanne Vega Info Centre will be closed. But after March 15 I will send you a newsletter if there are any cganges in the touring list. Maybe I will see you in Rotterdam or Antwerp or D&uuml;sseldorf. Otherwise I am always interested in your stories.<p>

Some other issues:<p>

* I receive a lot of personal stories of people. I am very sorry that I can't answer you all with a proper letter. But I keep trying to answer all the questions. I hope you will understand that this takes a lot of time.<p>

* Two people like to get in touch with other Vega fans:<p>

Sharon Jennings<br>
10 Victor Road<br>
Gelnfield<br>
Leicester<br>
LE3 8AS<br>
England<p>

Philipp Hofmann<br>
Berenskamp 21<br>
33511 Bielefeld 1<br>
Germany<p>

* Please always mention my name if you have letters registered or delivered by express. If my name is not on the letter or package I will have some problems with the post office.<p>

Well, I hope you like this issue again. Have fun with Suzanne's concert in your neighbourhood or somewhere around the world.<p>
