When Suzanne ended her recent &#91;3 December 1993&#93; performance headlining Amnesty
International's Concert for Human Rights in London, she left me
ecstatically happy -- of the seventeen times I have seen her on
stage, this was perhaps the very best.<p>
    The Royal Festival Hall, a venue for classical music, worked as
a magnifying glass, almost a microscope, focusing on Suzanne, alone
with her guitar. Even the finest nuances could be heard with superb
clarity and the louder parts were free of all the distortion that
usually mars non-classical performances. It is obvious that most
artists would suffer under this merciless scrutiny. Not so Suzanne.<p>
    Starting with a blazing Rock in this Pocket, Suzanne immediately
turned the attention her way. By When Heroes Go Down, she had us
completely under her spell. There is a particular, determined energy
that is only Suzanne's, an urgency in her voice and in the way she
plays, which physically grips the heart. No big words, fancy sound
effects or histrionic gestures are needed, because the truth is in
the songs and in the woman who sings them.<p>
    To me, it became more obvious than ever before that Suzanne's
art is far from pop or folk music -- it is poetry in its truest and
most intense form. It is an enhanced language -- purified, yet
augmented -- that expresses what the words fail to say. A language
that ranges from the most subtle moods to the strongest passions,
penetrated by a sharp intellect.<p>
    In between the songs, Suzanne talked more than she has done for
years. As we all know, she is a marvellous storyteller with a dark,
profoundly disquieting sense of humour; and far from disrupting the
concert, as some band member seems to have told her, the stories and
her characteristic chat complement the songs to form a consummate
whole.<p>
    Bad Wisdom came across as one of the strongest songs. The
speaker conveys something very painful and vital so credibly that
you feel as if it were your own experience -- this is a truly
therapeutic song. A pity it wasn't released as a single, so even
more people could benefit from it.<p>
    Luka -- a famous song about child abuse to promote Amnesty's
working group for children -- what a nice but embarrassingly trite
idea it seems! But it worked, as always. The reason, of course, is
that Luka is <i>not</i> a song <i>about</i> child abuse. It is a song from the
point of view of an abused child. Anyone who has been hurt by
someone they love and depend on can identify with Luka and his
existential predicament. There is no patronising 'understanding', no
feigned indignation, just the plain, paradoxically expressive
language of the victim.<p>
    Tom's Diner brought a hint of hesitation, as some people tried
to get the DNA beat going, but the first note of The Queen and the
Soldier put Suzanne firmly back in command. The audience responded
passionately, and Suzanne finally gave us Men in a War as an
appropriate conclusion of this eloquent appeal for human rights.<p>
    Afterwards, Suzanne came down to the fans who had gathered
backstage, signed our various items and, although still quite
reserved, talked more freely to us than usual. At close quarters,
she looked slight and delicate, yet strong, dignified and intensely
beautiful -- just like her songs. She is a marvellous woman.<p>
