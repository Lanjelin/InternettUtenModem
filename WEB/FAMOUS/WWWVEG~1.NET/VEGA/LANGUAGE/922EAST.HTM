<title>Language 5:2, December 1992: A Look to the East</title>

<h1>A LOOK TO THE EAST</h1>

When you talk about a folksinger like Suzanne Vega the emphasis is usually
laid on the strength of her texts, on the simplicity of her movements and
finally on the softness of her voice.  On this occasion instead, I would
like to talk about the life philosophy which Suzanne Vega has been embracing
for several years: Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism.  For an individual, living
in a Western country, taking a look at the East means getting in contact
with a too vaguely defined reality, often similar to a fairy tale.  The
best way to face such a wide and complex subject is perhaps that of trying
to make a very simple comparison.  Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism can be
identified with the daily training of a modern athlete: so as the latter
tries every day to better his performances, in the same way a Buddhist's
devotee (a person practicing Buddhism) makes every effort to overcome his
own limits, constantly developing energy and self-confidence.  This life
philosophy is based on the conviction that every man can influence his own
environment, to which he is deeply tied.  Moreover, a person who has
accumulated enough energy so as to reach a high life condition will be able
to solve his own problems and to teach his fellow beings to do the same.
The fundamental practice of this Buddhism consists in chanting every day (in
the morning and in the evening) the phrase NAM-MYOHO-RENGE-KYO and two
chapters of the Lotus Sutra, which is the most important Buddhist teaching.
NAM-MYOHO-RENGE-KYO is the Mystic Law of Cause and Effect permeating all
the phenomena in the universe.  Even if it may seem strange, chanting
NAM-MYOHO-RENGE-KYO helps developing a great inner energy, which you can
take advantage of, as which you like.  It is as if you drew strength from
our unexanstable source, which is your own life, the regenrating power of
"MYO."  The main goal of Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism is that of teaching
you to free yourself from your own sufferings.  Its peculiar characteristic
is that you can obtain clear evidence of its validity just by chanting and
determining the goals you want to reach: the results will convince also the
strictly rational mind of Western people.
