<tt>  "So I have this friend Brian, and he's a photographer, and he said to me one night that he felt that he
  saw his life as though he were seeing it through a pane of glass, so that he felt that he was always
  witnessing things and never really involved in them. Which I thought was interesting. So the next
  morning when I was having breakfast at Tom's Diner, I was thinking to myself, how would Brian
  see this situation?"</tt><p>

Brian was Suzanne's big hero back in the early years of her career. He was five years older; a folk
singer and photographer of some renown. In the summer of 1980 he was free lance and Suzanne was
unemployed, which to her seemed like the same thing -- they were boulevardiers, and would 'sit in the
cafe / and eat and drink and talk all day / and watch the sun.' And as a game, they wrote songs with
medieval imagery, and out of this grew the Queen and the Soldier series.<p>

   We drink the wine<br>
   if we get it free<br>
   and if he buys you coffee<br>
   he can surely buy some for me<br>
   and one day we will work real hard<br>
   and get a job<br>
   and not just sit here<br>
   on this silly boulevard.<br>
   And everyone will know our name<br>
   and we'll be rich<br>
   or we'll at least have<br>
   some kind of fame.<br>
   We'll be brave,<br>
   we'll be bold,<br>
   we'll come riding through<br>
   like knights of old.<br>

A couple of years later, Suzanne wrote <i>Tom's Diner</i>. <i>She</i> was the one who eventually got really
famous, but she didn't forget her old friend Brian. In 1991, she produced his debut album, simply
titled <i>Brian Rose</i>.<p>
  There is a slight similarity between the two songwriters -- both tend to write about mundane things
in a way that transforms them into something universal. Both use language with great skill and
economy. A good example is Open All Night, a diner song written 1982, just like Suzanne's -- here is
an excerpt:<p>

<pre>   she wipes the counter
   and she sweeps the floor
   she makes the coffee
   and she asks you do you want some more

   she looks in the eye of a desperate man
   she can't say much but she can understand
   another aimless loner
   another brittle voice
   another ghostly goner
   head in his hands
   open all night</pre>

Brian Rose is a keen observer and his empathy for the people his songs is obvious. There is also a
touch of humour that opens new dimensions.<p>

<pre>   From the roof there is splendor, a city in the sky
   Lost to the sky-light's dull-witted eye
   As she plants her feet on the concrete sod
   She says to her husband, "We are close to God."</pre>

Suzanne is executive producer for the whole album, and she has also produced four of the eleven songs
-- the other songs were produced by Brian Rose himself. Suzanne has brought in her band and created
an fuller and more interesting sound picture without diverting too much from Rose's own style. There
is a very close connection between lyrics and music -- a happy combination of folk and more
contemporary arrangements.<p>
  Suzanne has also contributed background vocals on most of the songs -- and this alone is reason
enough to buy the album. Her angelic voice and perfect harmonies lift the songs and make you warm
inside -- she is absolutely unparalleled.<p>
  Brian Rose is an excellent exponent of the contemporary New York folk scene, and his late debut
album has almost the quality of a best of album þ these are songs that have stood the test of time.<p>
