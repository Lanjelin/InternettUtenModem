<title>Language 7:1, December 1994: Preface</title>

<h1>PREFACE</h1>

Yes, I know what you think: finally an issue of Language again. And you are right. After the last
issue, already one year ago, it looked like Suzanne Vega and Language passed into silence. But you
should know better: "If language were liquid/It would be rushing in".<p> 
No silence at all on Undertow, the Internet Suzanne Vega discussion list. But don't worry if you are
not connected to Internet. Undertow doesn't become an "alternative" to Language, maybe just a
complement. But we think that Language will survive in a printed format. Then not everybody is "on
line", so it's still important to spread news about Suzanne, but we must also make Language attractive
for people who are on the net. And I think we did.<p> 
As Suzanne tells you in this issue, next year we can expect another album. So hopefully two issues of
Language in 1995.<p> 
Please support Language again next year! And keep sending your contributions!<p>
