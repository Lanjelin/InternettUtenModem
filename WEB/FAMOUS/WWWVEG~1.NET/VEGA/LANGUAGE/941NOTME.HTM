<h1>Not Me</h1>
 


I said, I am a little girl<br>
he said, you never were<br>
I said, I am not ready<br>
he said, then tell me when you are<br>
I said, I am too young for this<br>
he said, you are not really<br>
I said, I think I am afraid<br>
he said, you're being silly<p>

not me<br>
not me<p>

I said, I do not understand<br>
he said, you are pretending<br>
that would seem to contradict<br>
the message you are sending<br>
I said, you must be lonely<br>
he said, I would not worry<br>
I said, I think I'm dreaming<br>
or I'm growing in a hurry<p>

this is not me<br>
not me<p>

he took somebody by the hair<br>
and dragged her down the hall<br>
he took her to the bathroom<br>
where they could not hear the call<br>
he took her to a little room<br>
she could not find the key<br>
but I don't know who it was because<br>
I know it was<p>

not me<br>
not me<p>

and when will you stop running<br>
from a human situation?<br>
he said, do you think your silences<br>
are helping this relation?<br>
do you think your solitude<br>
will teach you to be free?<br>
I said, I don't know who you're talking to<br>
I know it is not me<p>

not me<br>
not me<p>
