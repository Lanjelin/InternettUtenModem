<h1>LIVE</h1>

No<br>
Small it has never been<br>
It is so large to me.<br>
Like the happiest dream<br>
Like thoughts to share<br>
Like moon over road<br>
The Language<br>   
Follows everywhere.<p>

A distance to conquer<br>
Broken white line<br>
Has always tried.<br>
And lead to<br>
A thousand-headed monster<br>
Cruel and kind.<br>
Smile<br>
No smile<br>
Where private goes public<br>
Faces<br> 
Thousand single minds.<p>

Some seem to listen<br>
Some seem to dream<br>
Some seem to find<br>
The eyes<br>
"If they see what you mean".<br>
What you mean<br>
If they see<p>

A handful of dark lives<br>
Shot through with light<br>
The unknown strangers<br>
You somehow well knew<br>
For them<br>
The distance is conquered<br>
The happy few.<p>

And somewhere left of center<br>
In the fifth row<br>
You guess<br>
The knight moves.<br>
Who knows where to go<br>
If to a long since asked question<br>
The anser is<br>
Yes
