* The keyboard player for the U.S. leg of the tour, and for the portion of the European tour that Mitchell Froom does not do, will be Steve Gaboury. Steve is an experienced musician who has toured with artists like The Blue Nile and Peter Hoffman (German artist).<p>

* Much of Europe will be releasing the single <i>When Heroes Go Down</i> in conjunction with the tour. The video for the song was directed by Peter Care, who has done the new R.E.M. video for <i>Man on the Moon</i>, among others. The video was shot in a large part using a "lipstick" camera, which is a small video camera the size and shape of a stick of lipstick, thus allowing for great flexibility of camera movement -- you will even note some shots taken with the camera taped to one of the drumsticks. The "band" appearing in the video includes Mitchell Froom (keyboards), Tchad Blake (guitar), Bruce Thomas (bass) and Tim Mooney (drums), who is the drummer from a band called American Music Club.<p>

<u>SUZANNE VEGA ON DUTCH RADIO, OCTOBER 10th, 1992</u><br>
"I don't think of myself as presenting an image. I guess that if I could wear the same thing every day, I probably would. If I could wear some kind of uniform I probably would because I feel that the important thing is the music and the songs, and not so much what I look like although I realize that people have to look at me. That's how they get to know me. But to me it's not the most important thing about what I do.<p>

"I have to be careful because I'm aware that the things that I write are not obvious message; people say: 'Do you have a message?' and is it were as simple as just a message I could just speak, I could just go on the radio and say, 'this is my message, my message is that we all must love one another' or something like that.<p>

"I don't believe it's as simple as that. I try to keep my audience on the toes a little nit, I try to challenge them a bit. I try not to passify them or put them to sleep with the same things over and over again.<p>

"So I hope that they stick with me, that they have patience and will follow me through whatever room it is I'm going into, and realize that there's a plan and a thought behind it. I'm nout just experimenting wildly for my own benefit. I like the idea that there are people who do understand what I'm trying to do, even though it may seem unusual or not expected."
