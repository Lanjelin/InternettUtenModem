<title>Language 4:1, December 1991: The Suzanne Vega Interview</title>

<h1>THE SUZANNE VEGA INTERVIEW</h1>

<u>NEW YORK</u><p>

City of all cities, almost a European city like Paris or London, but
on the other side New 
York looks like the connection between the United States and Europe. 
New York is 
remarkable and unforgettable!<p>

I'll never forget the amazing skyline
of Manhattan.  Because of movies, books, television and photographs
many people will have the feeling they already know that sight but
feeling the atmosphere in and around Manhattan is still a difference. 
My wish to visit New York was realized so visiting the Empire State
Building, after the twin towers of the World Trade Center the highest
skyscraper, was like feeling on top of the world.  A mysterious point
of view on the city which looks on first instance a little bit unreal.<p>

It took two hours to walk from the hotel in mid-Manhattan to a
well-known place on earth for fans of Suzanne Vega: Tom's Restaurant. 
Eating pancakes was also necessary before walking back downtown.  It's
easy to find your way in this city of numbered streets and avenues. 
Walking downtown on Broadway on a normal Saturday afternoon is looking
to people on the street, doing some shopping, having their dinner in
one 
restaurant or going out around Times Square with all the theatres,
cinemas, ...The yellow cabs rule over the street.<p>

New York is alive
for 24 hours and New York City's facilities for visitors are unmatched
and expensive.  But just walking around in all the different
neighborhoods is rather simple and impressing.<p>

On the day of the
interview with Suzanne Ingrid and I are having our breakfast in a
diner somewhere in Mid-Manhattan.  It's freezing cold outside and we
are making plans to enjoy ourselves again.  Suddenly I see a man
buying a coffee and some bread.  I know that man, it's Marc Shulman of
the band of Suzanne Vega so we make acquaintance with each other
again.  Marc talks about living and working in New York, about coming
back after a huge world tour with Suzanne Vega and the problems of
finding work for a musician.  For us it's a good preparation for later
that day when we have our job to do.  Nice to meet you again Marc!<p>

They really expect us at the office of AGF Management LTD on 30 West
21st Street.  After the interview manager Ron Fierstein shows us the
whole office including the studio where Steve Addabbo is working on
something.<p>

On the next pages you'll find a live report of the
interview with Suzanne Vega!<p>

<u>The interview</u><p>

<b>Last summer I was very surprised to hear about the announcements of
several 
	concerts of you on different folk festivals all over the world.  Two
things were 
	surprising.  First the fact that it would be a solo-appearance and
second the fact 
	of playing on a folk festival.  And the huge world tour of 1990 was
really 
	unexpected.  What was the reason?</b><p>

Well, it was because of the world tour of last year.  Really!  Because
the world tour of 
last year was very expensive.  It's expensive to have a band and to
take a band on the 
road and especially with the show which we had last year; which has a
set and a lot of 
crew to take care of.  And also I felt I wanted to perform by myself
again, because this 
was how I had begun.  I spent ten years performing solo before I ever
had a band.  So I 
needed to just go out and perform again on my own, just to prove to
myself I could do it 
in front of a large audience and also to try out some new songs, which
are based on the 
acoustic guitar and not so much on the synthesizers as they had been. 
So, most of it is 
economic!<p>

<b>It's not because of a reason to start again?</b><p>

Well, it was also that because I had new songs I wanted to try.  It
was a way of testing 
myself because I had never sung in festivals by myself.  The first
festival I did was with 
20,000 people so it's hard to make an audience of that size stay with
you.  So I wanted 
to see if it would work and I thought that it did work.<p>

<b>At least in Belgium it worked very well and in Dranouter you had sung
a new song 	called "Men will be men."  Did you sing any other new songs
except this one?</b><p>

Not in these shows.  But I did a gig in the Iron Horse in Northampton.
 And I sang three of four new songs there.  In front of 20,000 people
you can't really experiment too much.  You can only experiment with
the audience.  I've written about eight songs.  so when I start
working on some demos at the end of this month we'll think about the
fourth album which I hope will be out next spring.<p>

<b>Compared to the last albums the fourth album will be out fast.  There
was always a 	period of three years within two albums.</b><p>

Well, I had a really good writing style because partly I did some
writing when I was on the road and doing those festival shows.  I
spent a lot of time for myself in hotel rooms and it's just the good
way of focusing myself and getting myself to write.  And a lot of them
came to me very fast which is not always so.  We'll start seriously on
the next album.<p>

<b>	Can you tell us something about those new songs?  What they are like
and if you 
	compare it to the first three albums what will it be?  The other
albums are very 
	different from each other.</b><p>

I think this next one will also be very different.  I think it will be
simpler than any of the 
other three.  Hopefully it will be simple in the orchestration and
instrumentation but also 
simple in the songs.<p>

<b>You mean simple in the way compared to the fist album?</b><p>

Yeah, I think even more simple than the first one.  On the first one
we were experimenting, because none of us had produced an album
before.  At that time we were confused, experimenting and fighting a
lot.  But this time I think it will be very straightforward and the
songs are more direct.  Each song has a subject and they are less
experimental and much more focused than the last album.  I can't
really say how it's going to sound because we haven't started looking
at things.  But so far every song has a focus and a point and it gets
to the point and then it stops.  So each song has its topic and its
point of view.<p>

<b>Like on Solitude Standing?  I think that on that album each song has
its own point of view.  It's a collection of songs as contrasted with Days of
Open Hand, which is more an album as a whole.</b><p>

With the big success of Solitude Standing I didn't want to follow it
up with an album that 
was going to be predictable, that people would say, oh yes, there are
the next ten 
songs of Suzanne Vega and they are all about child abuse or whatever. 
So I felt that I 
wanted to push against all the boundaries so I was experimenting with
the instrumentations and with the subject matter by not putting chorus
in some of the songs and not being specific.  Pilgrimage for example
is a song about how I went to find my father buy you don't know this
from listening to the song.  So I was experimenting with writing the
songs of Days of Open Hand but this next album is much more basic and
less experimental.  It's more obvious what the songs are about.  I
mean there is one song called "Blood sings" which is about looking at
photographs of an uncle that i never met.  We look very much alike but
I have never seen him in real life.  And he had a very tragic life and
a very short one so this is what the song is about; how it feels to
see yourself in someone else.  Another song which is called "If you
were in my movie" which is a very straightforward song and it's a sort
of flirting song with someone.  If you were in my movie:  these are
the parts you would play and the parts are:<p>
(Suzanne is thinking about the first part)<p>
Well, I can't remember the first one (laughing).<p>
The second one is a gangster; a detective, a gangster, a priest, and a
doctor.  It's easy 
to see what the songs are about.  The are about real things.  And they
are all based on 
the acoustic guitar so that I can play them in front of an audience by
myself.<p>

<b>Do you think that playing solo will happen more often in the future?</b><p>

I'm not sure (emphatically) but I like to know that I have the option
of doing that.  
Because I think the ones are the strongest are the ones I can play by
myself.  And I 
know that if times ever go bad, that's where my strength is, that's
always been my 
backbone, the acoustic guitar.  I felt a need to go back to it after
two or three years 
experimenting.<p>

<b>What will happen with the band?</b><p>

I am trying to figure that out myself (laughing again).  I think they
will be probably more 
like side-men than they had been in the past.  By then there was a lot
of collaboration 
which on one hand is fun; it's a profit when you are experimenting to
collaborate with 
other people.  But no experiments this year, I want to be direct.  So
they will be 
side-men like the way they began.  We'll have to see how it all works
when we start the 
process.<p>

<b>Will there be a world tour after bringing out the new album?</b><p>

I think so, but I don't think it will be as big as the last one.  With
the last one we went to 
every single, small town in America and Europe.  We seemed to go to
England five 
times a year and never asked why.  We'll definitely play.  I like
playing with the band 
because it gives it more variety and color.  But it will probably be
not as big as a world 
tour.  Unless by some chance you'll have a hit or something like that
and then everyone 
will be pretty excited and then you have to make as much money as
anyone can make.  
I don't think it's going to happen because the economy is different
now.  The recession 
has hit everyone very hard and last year was really the beginning of
it and it really hit 
hard, you could see it.  Most cities of America were very depressed
and there are about 
150 bands on the road last year so the competition was enormous.  So I
just don't know 
that it's very fruitful to keep going out on the road to lose money. 
I would rather spend 
the time writing, living a life, writing articles...<p>

<b>But it all depends on the success of the new album?</b><p>

No, I think, even when it's widely successful we'll probably keep it
small.  Because even 
last year when we had a hit with Tom's Diner it didn't necessarily
help the tour. It 
doesn't always connect.  It has to do with more than economics.  But
we'll still play 
major cities but it won't be a long eight or nine-month tour like it
has been last year.<p>

<b>Do you think of inviting a special guest on the new album?</b><p>

Yes, I thought about that.  Last time we had Philip Glass.  I have to
see.  Once we start 
working on orchestrating the songs.  I haven't really been thinking in
those terms but 
that might be a good idea.  I have to listen to how the new songs
sound on tape and 
then you figure out who to bring in that could make it interesting.<p>

Two weeks ago I worked again with DNA.  I met them in England and they
are coming 
out with an album in January.  The asked me to write a song with them,
so I wrote a 
song with them.<p>

<b>Did you work with DNA before?</b><p>

I had worked with them on doing the re-mix of Rusted Pipe.  Not very
much, just a little 
bit.  But this is a whole new song.  It was very funny and it all came
together very fast.  I 
don't think they will release it as a single, it's kind of a
collection.  The are afraid they 
are going to be dropped before the album comes out.  They don't really
know how to 
write songs (laughing).  They just have some  ideas and put them into
something.  They 
are very funny.  I like them, I have to say.<p>

<b>What do you really think of the success of DNA?</b><p>

I think it was very funny.  I mean , they didn't benefit.  They didn't
get any money from 
the success.  But it's given them some kind of career which is good. 
But I wouldn't have 
let them release it if I didn't think it had something.  If I thought
it was bad, I would have 
sued them.  I would have stopped it in some way.  But I thought it was
funny and 
inventive and I never dreamed that it would be a big hit.  And I was
really happy when I 
realized that it was going to an audience that is normally not my kind
of audience.  
Black and Puerto Rican kids in New York all heard it and I was grown
up in this kind of 
neighborhood so it was kind of ironic to me that without knowing it my
music has 
suddenly gotten into this other areas.  So to me it was like
translating the song in 
another language.<p>

<b>Luka was a small hit, but instead of all the other singles
Tom's Diner went straight to Top 10 in Netherlands.</b><p>

That's crazy.  You know, it doesn't bother me as long as people don't
expect me to get 
on stage and perform it like that.  I haven't had any problems with
singing it the way I 
have always sung it.  But I make the audience clap.  And they like it
and that's fun.  It's s 
not like it might have become a disco.  It has crossed my mind that it
would be funny to 
go on tour as DNA featuring Suzanne Vega but that would be a whole
other kind of 
show.  It crossed my mind once, but I don't know.  I really have to be
careful how I 
presented it, otherwise other people should say, "Oh, she is just
confused.  She doesn't 
know if she wants to be a disco queen or a folk singer.  But my
serious work, the work 
that I do on my own records is based on the acoustic guitar and that's
what I always fall 
back on.<p>

<b>Do you feel that your own work is the opposite from DNA?</b><p>

It is the opposite, but I still like to experiment and I won't deny
myself that opportunity to 
experiment with other people and have a good time with them as long as
it is fun.<p>
I got letters from people.  The hate DNA and they can't stand it.  My
feeling is, why not 
experiment?  If you hate that, if you hate Tom's Diner by DNA then
don't listen to it and 
go back to Solitude Standing.  It still exists in the original form. 
There's no reason to get 
hysterical.  People feel upset and write just about it but I don't
feel that way.  I think it's 
fun.<p>

<b>Oh yes, I know a huge Vega fan who really hates it.  It's happening a lot.</b><p>

A lot of people really hate it, but that's not my attitude.  In fact
many people probably 
hate this album (Tom's Album) with 12 different versions including
REM, who have a 
really nasty version.  But I thought I'd include it all because it's
interesting to me that my 
song would spark people's imagination to interpret.  It's not that
they destroyed the 
original, the original version still exists and so to me it's
interesting that other people 
interpret my song.  Why would REM and Billy Bragg want to stand on
stage and do 
what they did?  It has some impact on me.  And in some ways it's ok. 
They are having 
a joke and they are having a joke on my expense to some degree.  I
think I'm a big 
enough person that I can take all these jokes and put them together on
this album.  And 
then it's my joke.  Some of these are really terrible and some are
really great and some 
are very funny.<p>

<b>Which songs are great to your opinion?</b><p>

I like Nikki D's version.  Because I think she really took it and made
it her own.  ON a 
surface it looks we come from very different circumstances.  She is a
very black girl 
from Los Angeles and I am a very white girl from New York.  And it's
seen as we come 
from very different worlds but we don't .  I think the way she uses my
voice in that 
version is really good.  You know it's true to herself and the way she
is and it's very 
smart.  And I also like Michigan & Smiley.  It's very funny.  It's
like a live reggae version 
and it's so strange.  And I like Peter Behrens because I like the
lyrics.  So those are my 
favorite ones.  Peter Behrens wrote German lyrics.  A very existential
song.  I think the 
Swedish one is very sweet.  It's got a nice voice and he sings it very
sweet.<p>

I asked nobody to do this, someone just gave it to me.<p>

<b>Did you ever think of the idea to skip the song in your shows? Before DNA it was really quiet during Tom's Diner.</b><p>

Sometimes the audience don't clap.  The don't so I don't and that's
fun too.  I never 
started with tetete....  I always start by singing:  I am sitting... 
and then I want to see if 
the audience claps.  I don't push it.  Like in Japan for example; I
don't think they clapped.  Some people started in the middle.  At the
Newport Folk Festival some people started in the middle but they
didn't realize it.  I was listening to them waiting for them to
continue.  So I take the gut of the audience.  It was a folk festival.
 Nobody expected from me to sing DNA-songs.  I think in time it will
all blow over.  If I'll have some new hit everybody's mind will be
distracting.<p>

<b>A few years ago the Lemonheads covered Luka and didn't get
famous. What did you think of that song and do people cover your songs
a lot?</b><p>

I thought that was really good.  I met one of these guys recently in a
coffee shop.  They 
did it really well.  With DNA I thought, well this is just another
thing like the 
Lemonheads.  More people cover my songs, but most of them are not well
known.  for 
some reason in Japan people cover my songs a lot.  People have asked
to use my 
songs for different things, mostly commercials and I said no.  Some
company asked 
over and over again to use Luka and I said no.  I am selecting where I
let people do 
covers and where I let the music work on it's own.<p>

<b>Another surprise this year was your contribution on
Deadicated, a tribute to the Grateful Dead.  Can you tell us something about that?</b><p>

We recorded that last year in the middle of the tour.  In the first
day of the last leg of the 
tour we went to England a day earlier to record.  We prepared both
versions because 
we thought that we do one or the other and we liked China Doll as a
band.  But the 
producer had requested to do Cassidy.  So we prepared both and he
liked both 
versions.  So it was a big surprise in kind of recording all day and
night and get both 
versions down.<p>

<b>Before Deadicated you had several other projects, for example
with the Smithereens, Philip Glass, Arthur Baker, etc.  Any reason to
do that?</b><p>

Because I like to experiment musically and in some ways what I do with
DNA of a 
continuation of that train of thought to work with Arthur Baker and
Joe Jackson on Pretty 
in Pink was very different from working with Philip Glass.  So every
time I collaborate 
with an artist I learned some more and I am interested in the way my
music fits with 
other people's music.  And I just don't feel that I am writing by
myself, for myself in 
some kind of room.  I feel that when I interact with other people it
still sounds like me.  
The writing is still mine, my voice is with other people it still
sounds like me.  The writing 
is still mine, my voice is still my voice and every time I collaborate
with someone else I 
helped to exchange in a world of music.  I attituded some kind of
dialogue that 
everyone's had with each other.<p>

<b>I think you proved on the last album that your music fits real
together with Philip Glass' ideas.</b><p>

I was really happy with that.  I knew he could do a good job because I
knew that he 
wouldn't be sentimental about this.  I always said to him, "I want
something very, very 
simple," and he made something and it was great.  He is wonderful to
work with.  He 
will never sound sentimental.  He's very structured.<p>

<b>Will you work with him again?</b><p>

Yes, I'd like to.  His producer had suggested that maybe we should
make a whole 
album together.  I should think about that in terms of this next group
of songs because 
some of them are very acoustic songs and won't need the usual rhythm
section.  But I'll 
work with Philip Glass any time he asks me to work with him.  I think
we have a good 
chemistry.<p>

<b>What about other projects?</b><p>

I had an article come out recently in a magazine.  They had asked me
to write an article 
on state of masculinity today.  They asked a group of women to write
their views on 
masculinity.  I was one of them.  (Article in this magazine!)  I was
planning to do all 
these other things but suddenly I started writing again.  But there is
still writing for some 
film script on the Carson McCullers project.  That's always there on
the back of my 
mind.  I keep finding ideas to find the approach to it because I want
to do it in a small 
and independent way.  People come asking me to read for parts in
movies.  Recently I 
read for a part that I didn't get.  It's hard to crossover to another
culture.  People want a 
real actor.  So that's why I would prefer to work on my own films in
some kind of way, 
which means that you have to do a lot of work beforehand to set it up,
so that it has the 
quality that you want to have.  So it's not just you.  You have to
prove yourself in an 
unknown field.<p>

What happened to the film that was made during the last tour?
That was kind of finished.  It was finished because the record company
decided it was 
enough and they didn't give any more money.  So there was a half an
hour version of 
that film.  But no one feels very satisfied with it.  I've seen it
again recently ad D.A 
Pennebakers house.  We were looking to it and no one felt satisfied
with it because it 
was filming a very specific point from time.  And a lot of it was
filming about the planning 
of the tour.  By the end of the film the tour had changed a lot.  By
the beginning it was 
meant to be a big tour with a big set and a big crew and a big band
and a big sound, but 
at the end  of the tour it was a very small one.  So to have all this
documentation of this 
be tour that ended small is not really very satisfying.  So when I was
at his house we 
were discussing.  What are the interesting things in the film?  I
think the interesting thing 
is when I"m performing by myself and the interviews.  And Pennebaker
doesn't feel the 
same way so we're just in this limbo now.  He was thinking he might
come and shoot 
more and try to finish it in the future, but to do that you have to
finance it.  I don't know if 
the record company likes that idea.  The man who hired Pennebaker to
do the film left 
A&M to go to another record company.  At one point they were thinking
of releasing it 
on video, but A&M changed their minds.  The parts for me that were the
most satisfying 
was for example when I did a benefit at the Speakeasy Club where I
used to do shows 
when I was first starting.  So I went back there and did a show.  That
part was to me 
representative.  The film shows our first few gigs which weren't very
good.  We were still 
getting our show together.  It was very slow and the audience wasn't
very good.  It took 
a lot of work to pull that tour into shape.  So what you have is kind
of a failed 
experiment.  But one of these days we'll continue or finish it or
something.<p>

<b>I've seen the film on a copy of German television.  I liked
the lessons you gave.</b><p>

I thought that part worked well too because I like doing that kind of
thing.  I like to talk 
and I like to give interviews.  That part was effective.  Because I
felt I was speaking my 
mind and there were kids who wanted to be musicians.<p>

<b>You already told about the world tour of last year.  It
changed a lot which I noticed last November when all the lights were gone.  But was
it a success?</b><p>

Was it a success?  It depends on how what your terms of success are. 
In terms of 
money it wasn't a success.  In terms of going to new places where we
have never been 
before i was wonderful because we had more standing ovations for
example than we've 
ever had.  IN terms of show and musicality it was really good.  And we
all knew that it 
was very strong.  And we went to some of the places like
Czechoslovakia and Hungary 
and Yugoslavia.  Those shows were wild.  I mean we had 8000 people in
Hungary and 
they all knew all of the songs including the ones of the new album. 
The knew Tired of 
Sleeping and Book of Dreams.  And that was amazing.  Something we
couldn't be 
prepared for at all.  We went to Budapest and that was probably the
best show of the 
whole tour because it was crazy.  Frank, my drummer, has been on tour
for years and 
years in 10, 15 years and he had never seen anything like that.  And
after the show we 
had a hundred people to get something signed.  And we signed
everything.  It was very, 
very exciting and so there was a sense of breaking new ground and
going to places we 
have never been before.  And people say, oh well, that must have been
because you 
are western and you're going to these countries for the first time. 
And I said, "Yes, that 
might have been part of it except that they knew the songs.  It wasn't
just like it could 
have been anyone.  The knew the music which meant a lot to me. 
Because it was not 
well available to them.  In America you can go to the store and buy
it.  And we go down 
to Mississippi and there were 75 people looking at you.  so it was
very strange here.  
You play in a tiny little club in your own homeland and then you go to
Budapest where 
you have never been before and you play 8000 people who know every
single word.  
It's amazing.  A really strange year.  You feel like and Alice in
Wonderland.  You can't 
tell if you're big or small or in between and you have to keep you r
sense of identity.<p>

In which country has the video of Tired of Sleeping been shot?
Czechoslovakia.  We didn't exactly go there to film that part, but my
nephew was there 
and shot these pictures.  REM saw the video of Tired of Sleeping and
decided to use 
him for Losing my Religion.  And they told me this and I said, oh
that's great because 
Losing my Religion has won like seven of the MTV video awards, they
swept every 
single video award.  But my nephew was very pleased with Tired of
Sleeping used by 
REM.  Most directors catch a little bit of each video.  But he liked
that video himself so 
much that he used it for his own and sent it out to everyone to work
with.  I wished it 
was more widely played, but Tired of Sleeping wasn't releases as a
proper single.  
Because I think that's the song on the last album that the audience
was really pleased 
with.  In Japan where I played on the WOMAD festival that's the one
that people clap 
for.  So, somehow I was spite it wasn't releases as a single.  But
Book of Dreams was 
the choice of the record company for a single.  It wasn't my choice. 
I would have 
chosen Tired of Sleeping.  Because if I was one of my own fans I would
be more 
interested in Tired of Sleeping than I would be in Book of Dreams. 
Book of Dreams 
was an experiment and Tired of Sleeping was a song I needed to write.<p>

<b>I think you can hear the difference.</b><p>

I think so too.  When you're writing you think they are all very
important and you try not 
to distinguish.  Each one is very sincere.  But after a year or two,
after singing them 
each night, the ones you still need to sing after two years; that's
because of a reason.<p>

<b>When we heard Days of Open Hand for the first time we liked
all songs except Book of Dreams.  Why did you write that song?</b><p>

We were experimenting because we were listening to XTC.  To me that's
an example of 
great experimental pop and it was something we were trying.  We were
trying to push 
all the directions.  And that was one direction.<p>

<b>Do you like traveling around the world?</b><p>

There are parts that I really love and parts which are really tiring. 
 mean I've been doing 
it now since 1984 and now it's 1991, so that's seven years of
something.  I think as I get 
older I'll get pain in my back and you sit on the bus all day, and I
got all these pains in 
my back...<p>

But there are parts that I really love.  Like last year going to
Eastern Europe, it was 
great.  The thing that makes it worth it is when people want to see
you.  When people 
are excited that you are in town.  But it makes it terrible when
people come to the shows 
or they say, "Why are you back here?" which happens occasionally in
England because 
we tour a lot there.  You can't know in advance how well you're going
to do so you set 
the tours up and you come to to a town twice sometimes.  And people
ask why and 
then you feel bad and then you say, "Yes, I should go home, what am I
doing here?"  
But it makes it real worth it when the audience really loves it.  And
you can see town 
changing and you can see a sense of what's happening in the world.  I
mean being in 
Germany now is very different then it was five years ago.  And that is
thrilling, to get a 
sense of how countries change like that and feel that you are a part
of history and that's 
what I really love.<p>

<b>Do you get a chance to see anything from the city where you
are playing?</b><p>

You can if you look.  I mean if you look out the window it's something
you can't avoid.  
You know in 1986 we played in Berlin which meant at that point that we
had to go 
through a checkpoint.  You can't avoid something like that.  So you
are aware of the 
political atmosphere even if you don't want that.  There's a man
standing with a 
machine gun looking at you in the face so even if you want to avoid it
you can't.  You 
have to deal with the facts you know.  Or last year playing in
Yugoslavia.  Everyone 
could feel that there was a civil war coming.  Everyone knew that
there was one.  We 
just went from the venue to the hotel back and feeling the atmosphere
in the audience, 
standing on the stage and you could sense this feeling with the
situation.  And I try to 
know what's happening in the country before I go in because I want to
know what's the 
situation because the other thing is that certain songs like Tired of
Sleeping for example 
can be read in a political sense and sometimes they have more meaning
in those 
countries then they would in a country like America for example.  In
America they 
should say, oh it's a song about waking up, you know.  And in
Czechoslovakia it has a 
different meaning.  And some of these things are interesting to me
because I'm 
involving these people that I'm singing to.  It means you have to be
very alert all the 
time.  I made a mistake last year once because I went straight from
Eastern Europe and 
we did a show I think in Spain right after that and suddenly they
said, "Are you aware 
there's a coup in Argentina?"  That happened like the day before and
I've been so 
involved in what has been happening in Czechoslovakia, I had forgotten
South 
America.  So I said, "Oh!"  You try and keep aware but you
occasionally forget there's a 
whole entire part of the world having political problems.  And you
forgot that because 
you are in another part of the world.<p>

<b>Did it ever happen that you didn't perform a song for any
reason?</b><p>

No, I've always sung everything.  I never had a song censured, but I
think most people 
don't really know what I'm talking about so that's a sense of my
music.  Yeah, it's really 
poetic, but it doesn't really hit them.  I see that if most people
really understood what I 
was singing about they might try to censure it.  Most of the songs are
about sex or 
violence, you know, very sensible topics.  But most people don't seem
to understand 
exactly what it is I'm talking about.  Perhaps they will on this next
album because it's 
much more direct, but some of them are still  .......  you know, I
don't think I could ever 
write simple.  To me a simple song is like Luka and it still has some
of these strange 
angles.<p>

<b>What's your favorite song?</b><p>

I don't know.  I really like the songs I've just written.  I feel that
they are strong and that 
they are an interesting group of songs because they are not about the
same topic.  
Each one is different and each one has a different strength.  And the
language is simple 
and I try to more to work with melody and some things.  The last song
I wrote was 
called "The Last Think I Do" which is about the point of view of David
and Goliath.  It's 
the point of view of David before he throws the rock and it is a very
simple song and 
that song right now is my favorite one because it's just the way that
I hoped it would be 
and sometimes you get a song that's like you feel you didn't do what
you meant to do.  
That's always the thrill, that's the biggest thrill for me when you
can do it the way you 
planned it.<p>

<b>Can you tell us something about the way you write your songs?</b><p>

Usually I carry my guitar with me and some idea that's bothering me; I
keep going back 
to it.  This David-song was one I've been working on since February
and you can't just 
approach the song.  You have to kind of approach it sideways or it
occurs to you when 
you are walking down the street or you sit around and you're playing
some chords and 
suddenly, "Oh, this might work."  And then you have to kind of push
the song into being 
the right way.  And sometimes it means you have to put it down and
forget about it and 
come back and you  can hope that it will respond.  You have to kind of
pull it out of its 
hiding place.<p>

I'm trying to keep it all going because if I can finish
3 or 4 more songs the 
next album can be out early next year.  I really like to get something
out early next year 
because I think I could really feel last year that having three years
in between albums 
mad a long time.  I felt like I lost something and that bothered me
because I like having 
an audience and I like playing for people and I like people to
understand what I'm 
saying.  So I felt bad, I felt bad that I lost some of the people. 
Now today I don't feel that 
every album has to be a Top 10 hit, but I like there's an audience
there which 
understands me.  I'm not writing for myself and I"m not writing to
amuse myself.  I'm 
writing to sing for people.<p>

<b>So it's just your job and nothing else?</b><p>

It's my job.  Why should I stay on a stage and sing it when no one's
going to be there?  I 
like to feel that I'm doing a service, that I'm doing something
useful.<p>

<b>You talked very pleased about Eastern Europe.  Was there another
favorite 
place on earth to feel satisfied before you experience with the
countries of 
Eastern Europe?  When we spoke with Mike (Visceglia) last year he
told us 
about the audience of Japan, which is very quiet.</b><p>

Well, in Japan they react after the show and they are very passionate.
 Because I get a 
lot of letters from Japan.  But they are very reserved so you have to
break through and 
if you met a Japanese fan alone they are extremely fanatic and crazy. 
You know, they 
are not as reserved as they seem to b e, they are very passionate.<p>
I
like Japan too.<p>
I have a love-hate relationship with England because sometimes I love it
there, I just love 
it.  I love the climate.  And sometimes I really hate it because the
press is bad and mean 
and they really don't care.  It's just very arrogant.  I like to go to
England and just stay 
there.  I like to hang out there.  I did some more writing in England.
 I go and stay there 
in one hotel and sit in the room and just play.  It gets my
imagination working.<p>

<b>You went to London for writing songs for Days of Open Hand. 
So for the next album you did it again?</b><p>

Yes, that's right.  I went to the same hotel.  I really like it there.
 It's a very old hotel of 
the 1700's and it has a certain Dickens-feeling.  So it gets my
imagination going.  So I 
sit in that hotel and I think about New York.<p>

<b>What do you think of the fanzines?  One in Holland, one in
England, and even two in Italy, the second one in Italy is very small.</b><p>

I appreciate it.  I would never start one myself because that's a very
stupid thing to do, 
but I appreciate it because I'm a fan of other people.  I am a fan of
Lou Reed for 
example and I collected every piece of paper.<p>

<b>What do you think of  your fans in general?</b><p>

Well, I'm aware that I'm writing for them in a sense.  And I make a
distinction between 
fans who follow what I'm doing and take it seriously and other people
who hear what I 
play on the radio and don't quite understand it.  Because I'm a fan of
other people I 
appreciate the fan aspect.  Because obviously that's why I wanted to
make records.  
When I was a receptionist that was the main thing that kept me going. 
Going to the 
record shop at my lunchtime and standing in front of the R-section and
looking for the 
Lou Reed and trying to figure out for which album I had enough money. 
And which one 
would be the one I would get the most satisfaction out because I
couldn't buy all of 
them.  These were my thoughts then.<p>

<b>Other heroes except Lou Reed?</b><p>

Lou Reed and Leonard Cohen are kind of my very long period favorites. 
The ones I go 
back to.  And I used to love the Police, Rickie Lee Jones and Laura
Nyro.<p>

<b>What music do you like at the moment?</b><p>

I've been listening to dance music.  That's what I'm listening to at
home because I love 
to dance.  But when I want to listen to music to get myself writing
it's the usual stuff:  
Velvet Underground, Elvis Costello, who is another long-time person I
listen to.  I do 
listen to a lot of music of the late seventies, early eighties because
that was when I got 
really inspired by music and I still don't feel that my albums have an
edge that I would 
like them to have and that's kind of what I had started writing in a
certain way back in 
1981.  It was the music of Elvis Costello and Blondie and music that
had a harder edge 
to it and the way it's kind of weird.  My music has never really
expressed that, that edge 
that I started with.  You know songs like Cracking and Neighborhood
Girls were meant 
to express what was happening at that time.  It was never meant to be
nostalgic.  It was 
never meant to go back and revive the sixties.  It was meant to have
an edge to it.  So I 
feel sometimes that I haven't expressed that in the music.  That's
what I'm listening to 
and I want to get myself going.<p>

<b>You think it will be an influence on the next album?</b><p>

Well, it could be.  There are some musicians I go back to and Kate
Bush is one of them.<p>

<b>What's your place in the music world?  It's always difficult
to other people to explain your music.  The best thing to say is
singer-songwriter.</b><p>

I see myself as a little bit left of center of mainstream.  I see
myself not as part of them.  
I think as the mainstream, it goes up and down depending on what year
it is; some 
people say, "Oh, she's big, oh she's small."  But I'm just playing on
the sideway.<p>

<b>I think that's what most people like.  That you are not that
really big popstar!</b><p>

I like that too.  I don't think I could ever be a star like Madonna. 
Madonna is one 
because she is preoccupied being a popstar and that's not my role in
music.  My role is 
to have a life and to express things from a very street level point of
view.  This is what I 
really believe.  I don't think it's my job to express a popstar's
life.  So this means that I 
have to lead a what I consider as a normal life, which means walking
around, talking to 
people, experiencing things and struggling things.  It's snot like
riding around in 
limousines and that kind of thing.  That's not interesting to me and
that doesn't give me 
anything to write about, it doesn't help me, it doesn't inspire me to
write the songs.<p>

<b>What are the best songs?</b><p>

The best songs are the ones that I express, the ones that get me
excited.  I can tell you 
which ones of each album.  On the first one:  Cracking, that was the
one I felt very 
satisfied with.  On the second album I felt satisfied with Luka,
although I did not see it as 
a big hit.  On the third album Tired of Sleeping, it's the one I
thought a song I felt I had 
to write.  On the fourth album I guess the David-song is the one that
I feel satisfied with 
right now.  And there are others that I feel are pretty good.  They're
all the songs that 
have to do with struggling and expressing a point of view that's
specific to me in some 
way.  It's something I feel I have to do.  It's like I was born to do
that song.  I don't feel 
anyone else could have written Luka.  Other people have written songs
about child 
abuse, but no one else could have written Luka and so there are some
songs that I feel 
I have a specific reason.  I am the only one who could uncover that
specific point of 
view and so it's up to me to live the life that allows me to write
those kinds of songs.<p>

<b>Let's end with New York, because we are here for the first time.</b><p>

Oh really!<p>

<b>Yes, and we walked around a lot.</b><p>

You did?  Be careful please, it's very crazy.<p>

<b>Can you imagine yourself living somewhere else?</b><p>

Sometimes I do, sometimes I can see myself living in London.  I liked
Amsterdam too 
when I was there.  My friend Brian (the photographer) who I've been
very good friends 
with and I wrote Tom's Diner the way he's doing his job.  Well, his
girlfriend is living in 
Amsterdam, so he thinks of moving there so we're talking about New
York and 
Amsterdam just about three weeks ago.  I think I always need to live
in a big city 
because I like to have people around me.  I just like to be involved
in the way people 
live.  I like to go in the country, but I think I go crazy, I need the
big city.<p>

<b>But do you have special places in New York where you go to
enjoy yourself?</b><p>

Well, let's see.  I like Soho and I live near there now.  I just walk
around and I like the 
buildings there.  I like Battery Park.  I like it downtown and walk
around a lot.  I used to 
live in the Upper West Side and I still go there.  I visit the park
where I used to go as a 
child.  It's up to Riverside Drive & 102nd Street.  My sister still
lives there so I go up 
there and visit her and go to the park.  But it is all very different
now.<p>

<b>We went to Tom's Restaurant.</b><p>

So that's where the cathedral is and there used to be the Hungarian
pastry shop.  
Which I used to sit there and eat and read.  Just you can sit there
for hours and hours.  
Just across the street from the cathedral.  And I went to school up
there.<p>

<b>Well, we are finished with our questions now.</b><p>

That's nice and it's kind of an exclusive one because it comes in a
time when I am not 
doing any interviews and no one has heard of the new songs, Ron hasn't
even heard 
anything.<p>

<b>I hope it will be out next spring!</b><p>

Yeah, I'd like to do that because last year was a very strange and
long year but I was 
writing a lot in my journal and some of it just carried over.  I think
it will be out soon.
        Will 'Men Will Be Men" still be funny?
Yes, it will be very funny, but I'll leave out Johnny Uno's verses
because in his private 
life he is having some problems and I shouldn't be standing on stage
and talking about 
him.  So I won't put Johnny Uno in the song on the record, but live I
still can talk about 
him a little bit.  And it depends on who's working for me next year. 
It's the kind of song 
you can keep adding verses to and taking away and it's very simple. 
Spider's verse will 
stay and Andy's verse will stay too.  The verse about the horse in
Czechoslovakia will 
stay.  And the that still makes it a very long song because the chorus
is very long and 
as a special, live I'll talk about Johnny Uno maybe, if it is a good
audience and I like 
them.  In Japan I had some very drunken English people in the front
row and so I cut it 
very short.<p>

<b>What can we tell the people at home?</b><p>

Hopefully I'll be back during the summer to do some festivals if it
all comes together.  
We have to see how it goes.  It depends on how quickly this album
comes together and 
the economics of next year and how the album goes.  I think this time
the album will 
come out and then I come on tour.  Usually I've been on tour already
and then the 
album comes out which worked well in 1987 and was a disaster last
year.  So this time I 
think we'll be a little bit more careful.  We'll see.<p>

<b>Thanks a lot Suzanne!</b><p>
