<h1>MESSAGE (TO SUZANNE)</h1>

There's a voice<br>
From inside<br>
From outside<br>
It's in my ear<br>
It's low and benign<br>
It mingles and speaks now<br>
With all that I hear<p>

It's green<br>
And it's brown,<br>
It's all around in the forest<br>
And on the walls of the town.<br>
It's black<br>
And it's grey,<br>
When the waves wash back<br>
Hear the shingles, the spray<p>

It's written in patterns<br>
On the old wooden door<br>
See the shell in the flag<br>
Of the marble floor<br>
It's painted on a leaf<br>
That flows down the brook<br>
It passes by<br>
Just when you look<p>

It's breathed to the window<br>
Attached to the moon<br>
It's written on water<br>
Will be gone soon.<br>
It's whispered to the wind -<br>
Listen to the sound<br>
It has fallen by the wayside<br>
Look what you've found<p>

There's a voice<br>
From inside<br>
From outside<br>
It's in my ear<br>
It's low and benign<br>
It mingles and speaks now<br>
With all that I hear
