<h1>SUZANNE VEGA -- LIVE IN HOLLAND!</h1>
<u>English Summary</u><p>

A review of Huub's first concert of Suzanne Vega in Groningen.  Marc
told Suzanne about the audience, "He told me you were very cold and
reserved."  But the same Marc was stimulating the 'cold' audience to
be very enthusiastic during Men in a War.  Only one critic is thinking
that the concert is soporific.  Other highlights were Small Blue Thing
and The Queen and the Soldier.  During Tom's Diner Suzanne lost her
own lyrics but this painful occurence is at least an evidence that
even today some artists have the courage to play without a music tape.
 Huub was very satisfied with his first concert!
