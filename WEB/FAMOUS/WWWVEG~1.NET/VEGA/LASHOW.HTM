Hi All,
<p>
Just back--or well, I've been back for a few hours now from the SV concert
w/ Paula Cole and Sarah M.  It was great!  I have the play list, as I'm
usually bad about remembering what she sang and then people want to know
and I forget so I wrote the songs down on the back of my ticket.
<p>
1. Marlene on the Wall<BR>
2. Rock in This Pocket<BR>
3. Fat Man and Dancing Girl<BR>
4. Caramel<BR>
5. Small Blue Thing<BR>
6. Stockings<BR>
7. The Queen and the Soldier<BR>
8. World Before Columbus<BR>
9. No Cheap Thrill<BR>
10. Blood Makes Noise<BR>
11. Luka<BR>
12. Neighborhood Girls<BR>
13. Tom's Diner<BR>
<p>

Sorry if one or two of those are out of order.  I wrote them on the back
of my ticket and was running out of room so things got kind of screwed up.
I think she sang FMaDG later.
<p>
Anyway, after the show I got a chance to briefly chat with Suzanne and it
was really nice.  She's exactly as I had always thought she would be nice
and very very interesting.  If she doesn't mind, I hope to have the
picture up on my website soon.
<p>
(snip)
<p>
I hope all the others who saw her had as much fun as I did.  Thanks to
those especially Suzanne who made it happen.  And the Berkeley crowd will
have to let us know how it is up there.
<p>
Wendy!

Well, Paula Cole was amazing as usual...saw her 1.5 years ago as
an opening act for Sarah McL.  Paula's new tunes were...different,
but I'll probably buy the new CD (coming out Aug. 15th?).
<p>
Suzanne was great, but of course, I'd like to have heard a
longer set.  In this format, each of the 3 ladies had about 45 minutes
each.  While shorter, the performances were much more intimate
and all 3 mini-bands were very tight.  BTW:  I thought the sound
quality was quite high at this venue (the Starlight Bowl in Burbank).
<p>
Sarah McL. was the best of the three (please don't kill me for this).
Sorry to hear she's in the middle of a writer's block (that's why
she's doing these shows...to take some pressure off).  But it's always
great to see her perform and hear these stripped down versions of
her tunes.
<p>
My wife and are big fans of all 3 ladies' music, so this was quite
a big event for us.  Sarah said she planned to do more of this type
of show next summer (again, featuring female songwriters).

I wish I could've been there!  Did Suzanne have any stories to tell?  Any
witty, amusing intros, especially to the new songs?  Who was in the band?
<p>
Also, can anyone give their reactions to the new songs and how they 
compared with the old stuff?  This setting would seem to be ideal for 
such a comparison.  When she does tour, I doubt we'll get much of the
older material, unless she does a 2 hr. show!  (I hope, I hope...)
<p>
>Sarah McL. was the best of the three (please don't kill me for this).
<p>
OK, we'll let you off the hook this time, but don't let it happen again! ;)
May I ask why you felt this way?  Was it the performance, song selection,
etc.  Or, maybe you're an infiltrator and not a 'true' Suzanne fan!  ;)
(I'm joking here, for the sarcasm-impaired).
<p>
Waiting and hoping to see Suzanne in the fall,
<p>

She says she's working on some new anecdotes to tell.  Her life has
been filled with Ruby & Snow White & other kid stuff, which doesn't 
make for the best stories (she said).  Maybe doing a few of these
concerts will give some road stories to tell.
<p>
The band, as someone else said, was limited to three:  Suzanne,
Mitchell Froom on keyboards, and Michael Visceglia on bass, guitar,
and percussion.

The new tunes were great!   Can't wait for the new CD (coming soon).
I think the new tunes fit in well with the old ones.  As usual,
the new tunes reflect a variety of styles & arrangements ... great
for those of us who like such variety.

<p>
Yes, I'm a "true" Suzanne fan, but... I think Sarah was more "into"
the concert.  Also, I sensed a bit of needing to get back into the
groove by Suzanne... she hasn't performed for 3 years (as she said).
However, you couldn't tell she'd been away for a while, as her
performance was quite tight.

Hi all,
<p>
Some Websurfing turned up this review of the L.A. concert.  Any comments?

POP MUSIC REVIEWS<BR>
McLachlan, Vega, Cole Go Casual
<p>
By STEVE HOCHMAN
<p>
Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest.<BR>
"I never get to see people play," Sarah McLachlan said from the Starlight
Amphitheatre stage in Burbank on Friday, explaining why she recruited Suzanne
Vega and Paula Cole to join her on a quickie, two-date tour.<BR>
So with no more calculation, promotional hype or even new albums to promote
(though Vega premiered songs from an album due next month), the three women
each gave sets powered by an obvious love of performing.
<p>
Vancouver-based McLachlan, who has quietly built a sizable, rabid following,
took particular advantage of the casual format.  Abandoning the lush
arrangements of her albums for just drummer Ashwin Sood, bassist Brian Minato
and her own piano or guitar, McLachlan left no doubt about her triple-threat
talents as a dynamic vocalist, emotive writer and formidable instrumentalist.
In the stripped-down setting, she both reached back to her adventurous '70s
singer-songwriter influences (underscored by a passionate version of Joni
Mitchell's "Blue") and pointed in promising new directions by strapping on an
electric guitar for a couple of songs, giving her fluidly poetic, sensual
style a grabbing edge.  The setting also brought her naturally winning personality
to the fore.
<p>
Vega, too, was a winning presence, as she introduced not only her upcoming
album but herself in the role of a new mom, drolly spinning anecdotes about
her daughter.  While the icy detachment of her old favorites (including "Luka"
and the a cappella "Tom's Diner') has held up quite well, the new material--with
rich electronic tapestries crafted by her husband, keyboardist Mitchell
Froom--was especially intriguing for its expanded stylistic and emotional range.
<p>
Sound problems plagued the opening set by Cole, a former Peter Gabriel band
member whose 1994 album "Harbinger" was a promising debut.  But she sabotaged
herself with over-affected vocal mannerisms that obscured her talents.
<p>

Good review!  In Berkeley we didn't get any "droll anecdotes" about
Ruby, though :(<BR>
<p>
STEVE HOCHMAN wrote in his LA Times review:
<p>
  #But she [Cole] sabotaged herself with over-affected vocal mannerisms<BR>
  #that obscured her talents.
<p>
I must admit that this struck a chord -- I am somewhat fond of Dolly
Parton, and I was excited when Paula announced that her next song was
"Jolene".  (The Sisters of Mercy do a great cover of this song.)
However, Paula's version didn't do much for me.  Her vocal sound
effects seemed a little strange, and while they were certainly noticed
by the audience around me, the reaction was more amusement than
amazement.
