<I>Suzanne Vega said all these things: "I would like to be the wild woman of
rock." "My fantasy is to be like Lou Reed." "I have a strong need to be
solitary." "I'm terribly passive." "I was the strictest puritan you could
ever meet." Is she confused? Or is she still an outsider?</I>

<p>


After 26 years of being unfashionable, Suzanne Vega is surprised to
suddenly find herself in vogue. With one hit single in "Marlene On The
Wall" and her eponymous debut album becoming almost a permanent fixture of
the British best sellers listing, she can afford a wry smile as the aptly
titled "Left Of Center" proceeds steadily up the singles charts.
<P>
"The song was written specifically for the movie "Pretty In Pink". I read
the script and it seemed like a typical teenage movie, but there was
something about the female character. The film's about a 17-year old girl
who comes from the wrong side of the tracks and doesn't feel she fits in
with her social group. It was something I'd felt a lot."
<P>
"In third grade at school there's an "In" group and an "Out" group. I was
in the "Out" group. The groups had leaders; you could call up the leader of
the "In" group and ask to join, which I did. She told me, "Well, I don't
think it works like that". The "Out" group could be found playing "Star
Trek" - I'd be Mr Spock, my regular role. The "In" group would play R C K -
Run Catch Kiss - with the boys and be very cool."
<P>
A magazine story about a similar real life situation, that ended with the
stabbing of an "In" group leader for taunting the class misfit and the
lengthy six month investigation into the murder, led Suzanne to the song.
<P>
"It used to bother me, being in the "Out" group. On the one hand I envied
those people, but on the other I have a  strong need to be solitary. It was
tough, especially when I was 16 years old and playing an acoustic guitar in
the lunch room - it was such an uncool thing to do. The cool thing was to
be like David Bowie, dye your hair red, be into Patti Smith or punk rock -
anything but an acoustic guitar. Everyone thought I'd missed the boat
somewhere."
<P>
She found the same attitude when record company talent scouts would advise
her to write Top 40-styled material. It wasn't until she discovered the
sheltered artistic waters of New York's Greenwich Village six years ago
that she was able to find support and stimulation for her hypnotic hybrid
of folk and rock.
<P>
"I had this belief that if you were really good at what you did, then
somebody would be interested in you at some point."
<P>
Now, while a bigger star in Europe than in her homeland, she's attracted
the admiration of New York's artistic elite. She knew she'd arrived when
avant garde musician Phillip Glass added her to the lyric writing team for
his new album. The rest of the roster was impressive, containing Talking
Heads' leader David Byrne, top songwriter Paul Simon and multi-media artist
Laurie Anderson.
<P>
She heard the completed work on the same day as she finished the final mix
of "Left Of Center", co-produced with hip hop prime mover Arthur Baker. The
two bodies of work could not be more dissimilar; the nursery rhyme pop of
the single and Glass's "weird piece of music ". But she has no worries
about juggling the worlds of the commercial and the artistic.
<P>
"I believe to be really good you have to do both. It is not a question of
choice. My problem with the avant guarde is that people who write like that
are very elitist - "I understand this, my friend understands this, but you
are not going to, because we're going to leave out certain key sections and
you have to follow us". T me, I think why bother? It's hard enough to speak
plain English without making it more difficult for people."
<P>
"On the other hand, I don't subscribe to the mundane "I love you baby, I
hope you love me". If you're going to say something, you may as well say it
in a way which hasn't been said before."
<P>
"It's an artists responsibility to help people along a little bit. People
have to be moved by it, whether they understand it or not. there's still
something of the real folk singer in me that likes to tell stories - to be
amusing. How can you be amusing if nobody understands what you're talking
about?"
<P>
One story she still tells on stage is about the inspiration of her hit
single "Marlene On The Wall". She knew there was going to be a TV programme
on Marlene Dietrich. She switched on the TV and was flicking channels to
find the right station while the screen was warming up. From the blank
screen she heard the words, "You have led many men to their deaths with
your body".
<P>
"I was intrigued, and wondered what sort of answer I would give to that. I
knew I'd be either embarrassed or apologetic: "I'm really sorry and I'll
make sure it never happens again", or I'd tell them that they'd come to the
wrong apartment. Then the set warmed up and Dietrich came on the screen -
not looking embarrassed, apologetic or even concerned. She said with great
gusto "Give me a kiss". It was a terrific answer and one I wouldn't have
thought of."
<P>
"I'm terribly passive - part of it comes from being shy and always hating
it when people look at me. It's ironic since I force myself on stage every
night. Every now and again I get hostile and think, "What are you looking
at? - which is a bad attitude when people have paid 10 bucks to see you."
<P>
"In my work I'm passive, like a piece of film. I receive impressions and
then go away and develop them in to a full picture. It's a good way of
working. There are so many people who are crusading and parading - music
has got so loud and inflictive - I don't want to be like that."
<P>
"It leads to problems sometimes. I've see videos of myself, and I can see
why people might wish I was more demonstrative in performing. But having
grown up in New York, why be more inflictive? You can't possibly outdo
anybody else. There's always going to be someone who's louder, bigger,
fatter, stronger and who's going to devastate you; so why compete? Why not
go your own way?"
<P>
She used to have a picture of Marlene on her wall and admits she would like
to have some of her sass. But she confides that she's not a wimp."
<P>
"Most people who try and cross me, because they think I'm weak and fragile,
are surprised because I'm actually very strong-minded. I never used to
enjoy fighting, but I would if pushed into defending my younger brothers or
sisters. I get less articulate as I get angry and I tended to throw things
and fight. My last fist fight was when I was aged 15 - at an age when you
are supposed to be past those things - you're not supposed to be hitting
people in ballet class."
<P>
Sheltering in the cool of the Gran Caffe Degle Artiste on Greenwich Avenue,
away from the stifling swelter of the oppressive New York afternoon sun,
she looks like anything but the Marvin Hagler of the Greenwich Village folk
scene. Even though the delicious mix of the Bohemian and the chic
surroundings seem to suit the moods on her debut album, she acknowledges
that the seeds were sown in the tougher districts of Harlem and Spanish
Harlem in uptown Manhattan. Although born in Santa Monica, California, to a
Puerto Rican author father and a mother from the Mid-West, she spent 22
years surrounded by the squalor and danger of New York's wild side.
<P>
"My parents are very strict. We didn't go down on the street and hang out.
We were very isolated and used to stay home and play games to amuse
ourselves. It wasn't idyllic - both my parents were young and used to fight
a lot - but it was secluded."
<P>
While she had friends who turned to crime and got hooked on drugs and other
low life pursuits, she stayed resolutely clean.
<P>
"It was terror that stopped me joining them; a fear of chaos. I was the
strictest puritan you could ever meet. I didn't even take a drink until I
was 18 or 19. To me it was evil. It was a daily survival thing - if I let
up for a minute, I felt all hell would break loose."
<P>
Since then, she's obviously lessened the grip on her fears, apologising for
any fatigued incoherence induced by welcoming the dawn in the company of
her friends and a few glasses of White Russians a few hours before our
meeting.
<P>
Since her success in Europe and her more moderate breakthrough in America,
the New York folk scene has taken an upturn. Suddenly there's a lot more
work around for people with an acoustic guitar - and it's better paid. But
she's still the outsider - not a full member of the "In" group.
<P>
"There is a slight feeling of "Suzanne isn't a folk singer any more - she's
pop music"; which I have mixed feelings about. It's "She's doing the pop
routine now". It is a thinly veiled insult but it's done affectionately."
<P>
She admits that she's always been left of centre, off of the strip, in the
outskirts and in the fringes as far as the folk scene is concerned, and
positively hates British journalists who have called her kitsch or the "coy
darling of the New York music scene".
<P>
"You've got to understand that the folk scene is so homespun, especially
outside New York City. Most of the folk festivals have very sweet,
apple-cheeked young ladies with long flowing skirts singing about their
kitchens or their boyfriends. When I came on singing in my big black jacket
it was, "What was that?": It wasn't seen as kitsch at all. I was even
turned down for one gig because they thought I wasn't wholesome enough -
singing about "Neighbourhood Girls", a song about prostitutes. Now for me
to enter the real world and hear, "She's so kitschy and so sensitive"
bothers me. It makes me sound like I'm floating down life's river on a raft
with my hair blowing in the breeze - which I'm not. I've struggled through
my life like everyone else does but I think I'm a lot feistier than some
people might make me out to be."
<P>
She showed admirable qualities on her last European tour. Two members of
her band took the ferry to Sweden with the tour bus and crew. Someone broke
into the bus driver's cabin and stole his money, passport and keys, before
immobilising his coach. They flew someone out to get it off the ferry by
hot-wiring the ignition. The coach travelled 40 miles before stopping at a
service station. The hot-wired ignition sparked the diesel fuel and left
the coach little more than a heat-scorched shell of twisted metal and
ashes. The poor driver, having lost everything, went home. The two band
members had to take a cab ride from Sweden to their first gig in Norway at
a cost of £235 and arrived in a state of hysteria. And all before the first
gig and a background of the American bombing of Libya and the problems of
Chernobyl. It was left to Suzanne to raise morale after such an ill-fated
start.
<P>
"I talk about the rock'n'roll myth but I can't bring myself to do it. I
still have my fear of chaos but I'm drawn to it. My fantasy is to be like
Lou Reed. I told that to my audience at the Bottom Line club last Sunday
and they started to laugh. I met Lou Reed yesterday while he was doing an
album signing session at Tower Records store and he wanted to know why I'd
said it. What I meant was that he had so much spontaneity. He can tell the
band to play "Walk On The Wild Side" and talk for 15 minutes about the
critics and how they're up front and how the people who've paid good money
should push their way forward. He can do that because he's Lou Reed - no
problem. I envy that ability. For me, when I'm spontaneous I tend to stand
still and not say anything. I would like to be the wild woman of rock.
Hopefully one day it will come out."
