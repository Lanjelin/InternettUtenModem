     Like another onetime folksinger who now can't be so easily classified -
hint: he was
born Robert Zimmerman - Suzanne Vega (b. Aug. 12, 1959, New York) has
followed her
muse to very strange places indeed.  Raised in Spanish Harlem by a mother who
was
a musician and a Puerto Rican stepfather who wrote novels,Vega began writing
poetry
at an early age and songs when she was 14.  Within two years, guitar in hand,
she was
playing at New York clubs like Folk City and the Speakeasy, drawing raves
from the
likes of the New York Times, and attracting major label interest.  A&M
Records signed
her and , for her first two albums, astutely paired her with co-producer
Lenny Kaye.  Why
"astutely"?  Because Kaye was a well-respected former rock/folk critic, a
performer himself, and perhaps most importantly, an integral figure in the Patti Smith
Group - whose
leader was one of the most pivotal female vocalist-poets of the punk-rock
era.  Thus
Vega's eponymous solo album, released in April 1985, caught the ears of folk
fans who'd
heard the buzz about this fresh-faced and captivating New York folkie, and
punky post-
moderns who knew they wouldn't exactly be getting the next Odetta.  "I wanted
to take
the folk tradition and make it contemporary," Vega told the Los Angelas Times
in 1987,
"toughen it up and harden the language, learn how to use words differently."
<p>
     From the start, Vega's career zoomed, thanks to songs like "Marlene On
The Wall",
which - like much of her best work - was rich with imagery, tinged both with
hopefullness

and regret, and endearingly (considering her folk "roots") minimalist.
Though the success
of her first record was by no means minor - it spent 27 weeks on the Top Pop
Albums
chart - album number two,  Solitude Standing, really remains her landmark.
What propelled the album to gold status was the number three hit "Luka," Vega's
supremely memorable, haunting tale of an abused tenement child, which was promoted by an
equally stark
music video often played by MTV.  The album, very much in the public
consciousness
at the time, garnered three Grammy nominations.
<p>
     Having earlier contributed a song ("Left of Center") to the
platinum-selling Pretty 
In
Pink soundtrack album and lyrics to two tracks on avant-composer Philip
Glass's Songs
from Liquid Days set - she had heavy friends - Vega now seemed primed to be a
bigger
pop sensation than ever.  Or so it appeared.  Though her 1990 follow-up
album, Days Of
Open Hand, was warmly received by critics - most of whom felt Vega was
swiftly moving
from her folkish roots to a new pop-rock hybrid - it lacked a hit single, and
thus sold 
accordingly.
<p>
     What happened next was, in one sense, a singer-songwriter's dream: she
had a hit
record that she had nothing to do with.  Her a cappella performance of "Tom's
Diner" was,
without her permission, lifted from her Solitude Standing album, given a
hip-hop backing
by U.K. group D.N.A, and transformed into a hit dance record.  Vega heard it,
loved it,
and asked for its legitimate release, thrilled that her music was being heard
by a whole
new audience.  "If I thought it was bad," she disarmingly told the press at
the time, "I would have sued them."
<p>
     What began as a fluke soon became a mini-phenomenon: in 1991, A&M
released
Tom's Album, a hilarious compilation of 13 different "versions" of "Tom's
Diner" - by such
artists as reggae singers Michigan and Smiley and informal R.E.M. spin-off
group Bingo
Hand Job - that included the Vega/D.N.A "original."  If there is a lesson to
be learned
from this, it may be that despite the context, it's the song that matters.
That Vega was
writing better ones than ever was noted in nearly every rapturous review of
1992's 99.9 F 
-
which, with its startling use of electronic and industrial noises, was called
"Suzanne Vega meets Nine Inch Nails" by a few smarmy critics, albeit affectionately.
<p>
     Very few singer-songwriters - perhaps really only Joni Mitchell - have
managed to so
conspicuously grow in musical and lyrical presentation simultaneously, and at
so rapid
a rate.  For that matter, even fewer have inspired another performer's stage
name, as
Reprise Records singer Luka Bloom will happily attest.  No one knows what
Vega will
do next - and what more could any artist ask for?
