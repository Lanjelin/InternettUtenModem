Subj:	Seattle/Portland Concerts (Long, Part 3 and Final)<br>
Date:	96-11-19 17:45:51 EST<br>
From:	djhamma@aloha.net (David J. Hammar)<br>
<p>
Volume Three:  Portland (Friday, November 15th, 1996)
<p>
The Roseland Theater, from the outside, is not what you would normally
refer to as "impressive".  My info sheet said it was originally a church,
but  from appearances, I think "rescue mission" would be more precise.
Surrounded on four sides by bars, adult bookstores, drug treatment centers
and a Burger King, it looks - well, closed - boards cover every window, and
the absence of posters for any of the concerts supposedly scheduled for the
venue don't exactly boost my confidence.
<p>
I check again around 6:00 PM - this time things are more reassuring.  The
panhandlers are still in place on the corner, but the band has arrived and
are inside making preliminary sound checks.  Suzanne still hasn't shown,
but was expected momentarily, according to the male fan pacing near the
back gate.  He carries a single rose in a glass vase, and is a bit hard to
miss, actually, wearing a belt made from old stage passes over a pair of
two-toned bell-bottomed jeans which change to white at the knees. Kind of
gives me the feeling I'm talking to a Clydesdale, though he does most of
the talking, and doesn't seem entirely earthbound.   He's apparently a
professional concert poster distributor, and the flower is for Suzanne.  He
eventually hands it to a member of the crew, who takes it inside.
<p>
The layout of the club makes it difficult to hear much on the outside, but
one can still make out strains of "Rock in this Pocket" and "Stockings"
once the soundchecks begin.  Suzanne finishes around 7:05, and Jason
Falkner starts his rehearsals about 15 minutes later.  I move around to the
front of the building, where some brave souls are already waiting in line
for the General Admission show.  At the front of the line, a college-aged
girl proudly wears a paper Burger King crown.  I can't help wondering if
she's there to join in on "The Queen and the Soldier"...
<p>
I'm 14th in line.  Ahead of me are three "all ages" - two girls and a guy -
one of the girls, with gorgeous brunette hair down to the middle of her
back, is instructing her friends on the finer points of  the "Cat's
Cradle."  She does not have good students, and by 7:25 the group has moved
on to "What's in your pockets?"  She has a rubber band and some trash. Her
friend wins with an ink pen and string...
<p>
7:41 - There are now 30 people in line.  A group of  25 high school kids
walk past on the opposite side of the street.  All are wearing nametags,
and seem to be on some sort of orientation tour of the inner city.
<p>
The doors open at 8:00, and the line, which now stretches around the
building, starts to filter in.  I'm relieved to discover that the club is
much nicer on the inside than its exterior suggested.  We head upstairs -
the stage is on the second floor - towards the prized positions next to the
stage.  It quickly becomes obvious that the long wait wasn't really
necessary - the vast majority of the General Admittees head for the seating
upstairs (where drinks can be sold), or for the chairs lining  the lower
perimeter.
<p>
Since the downstairs isn't filling quickly, I take a few minutes to say
hello to Jason Falkner, and purchase a Calendar and a Key Ring before
returning to the Stage Area, where I find the Cat's Cradle girl - who's
name turns out to be Brandy - has taken up residence with her two friends.
The trio are impressed by my calendar, and soon return with their own
prizes.  A tip that a few copies of Suzanne's N9OOD posters are available
at the ticket taker's sends Brandy and I downstairs on a quest, for which
we are rewarded with the last two copies.  The rubber band in Brandy's
pocket comes in quite handy at this point...
<p>
The floor fills slowly, but by 9:00, when Jason Falkner takes the stage,
it's fairly crowded.  He runs through the same numbers he did in Seattle,
but his set is stronger and faster-paced this time, possibly aided by the
presence of his girlfriend and another acquaintance cheering in front of
the stage.   Jason plays for a little over 40 minutes, and is very
well-received.
<p>
The fact that this really *is* an "all-ages" show is driven home as a
father and his two daughters arrive at the stagefront.  One girl is ten,
and the other, whose name is Maya, is only six and a half.  Maya loves
"Nine Objects" and Brandy and her friends thoughtfully make room and help
her up on the ledge fronting the stage.  So at 10:15, when Suzanne and the
band take the stage, they're greeted by this adorable girl at center stage,
who immediately draws smiles from Mitchell and Mike Visceglia.
<p>
The band plays the same set as they did at the Seattle show, though the
positions of  "Queen and the Soldier" and "Gypsy" were swapped.  The
audience, however, was *much* more energetic, probably due to the more
intimate setting, which allowed for better artist-audience exchanges.
<p>
As a result, though, she spent less time storytelling than she had the
previous evening, with a couple notable exceptions.  The first followed
"Casual Match" to which she had danced during the instrumental breaks:
<p>
"I had a baby girl two years ago. (Cheers)  So I don't do much dancing
around the house anymore.  It used to be the sort of thing that I would do
all the time...('What's her name?') Her name is Ruby.  She's a very strict
little girl, she gives me rules around the house - no singing, no dancing,
no sharing.  No singing (Draws a unanimous 'Aww...' from the audience) -
unless it's the CD.  I don't know how we got onto this subject.  I think
it's because now I come out here and sort of hop and wiggle around.  It's
my way of dancing..."
<p>
Another fascinating narrative was given following "Headshots", in response
to an audience members seemingly self-evident question of  "Who's
Marlene?":
<p>
"There is an actress, called Marlene Dietrich, who I used to have a little
bit of an infatuation on. The very first time I ever saw Marlene Dietrich
on television was a long time ago, and I turned on the TV set,  and it was
one of these old sets that take a while to warm up, so you get the sound
before you get the picture.  So I turned on the set and I hear this voice
saying 'You have led many men to death with your body."' Oh wow! What's
this?  And I thought, What would I say if someone were to say that to me?
I suppose these things occur to you... What could someone possibly say in
return?  I think if it were me I would probably apologize.  'Oh, terribly
sorry!'  So then in the next minute, of course, Marlene Dietrich's face
bursts on the screen.  Is she embarrassed?  Is she apologetic? -- No.  She
says, 'Give me a kiss!'  Oh, yes!  Which is the only correct answer.  So
there you go!"
<p>
Following "Neighborhood Girls" (which Suzanne confesses she'd sung two
frets low) an emotional young woman near me shouts, "You're beautiful,
Suzanne!" (she wasn't bad herself!), which draws a graceful bow.  Suzanne
finally spots Maya, and inquires about her age.  We also discover her
favorite song is "Birthday", so when the song is introduced a short time
later, it's "For Maya, in the front row here."
<p>
The pairing of  "Woman on the Tier" and  "Blood Makes Noise" served to
energize the audience -- by the end most of the floor was dancing, and it
became clear why Suzanne prefers this type of venue.  The seats at the
Roseland are laid out in a sort of horseshoe around the dance floor,
four-deep on both the floor and the balcony overhead.  While half the
audience was dancing, the other half sat motionless, observing.  To
Suzanne, I imagined, they must seem like observers at a trial. (Or perhaps
with the spotlights in her eyes, an interrogation.)
<p>
Apparently she appreciates the extra energy in the club - following "In
Liverpool", she thanks them:
<p>
"Good audience!  Why don't you all come to San Francisco on Sunday?  What?
Oh, plane tickets.  We're going on the bus.  (The audience enthusiastically
offers to ride along.  Several members, though suggest alternate means of
transportation.)  Yes, let's do that, let's discuss travel arrangements.
Let's spend twenty minutes and discuss these things..." (laughs, as "Luka"
begins)
<p>
The audience blows "Tom's Diner" though missing the "Duh's", so Suzanne
starts over again. This time they get it right.
<p>
And the Portland crowd receives an extra reward - following "Gypsy" (during
which, at the suggestion of an audience member, she presents Maya with one
of her guitar picks) Suzanne brings the band back and they play "99.9"
(Incidentally, in Europe, does she perform this as "37.72"?) to close
things on a powerful note.  The show had been great, even more exciting
than Seattle.  Brandy's evaluation? -- "That *Rocked*!"
<p>
The audience is filtering out.  I decide to join them, having taken up
enough of Suzanne's time the previous evening.  A crew member comes out to
give Maya and her family an invitation backstage, and scurries off to get
the needed pass.  Brandy and her friends remain, hoping to speak with
Suzanne and get their CD's and calendars autographed.
<p>
I hope they made it.<p>

Re:	Portland Show, 11/15/96<br>
Date: 96-11-23 17:34:40 EST<br>
<p>
Suzanne Vega & Band Nov. 15, 1996 Portland OR Roseland Theatre
<p>
Just wanted to check -in on how the show went for myself.
I have been wanting to see Suzanne since her first or second album - but
I live 90 miles from Portland so it's not easy to catch her.  Anyway the
show exceeded all expectations and I am definately in love with her
"pop" sound - even though I tend to listen to more gritty
Guthrie/Dylan/Townes Van Zandt folk (became a Dylan fan around 1971 when
I was 14, is where I am coming from).  I was surprised that the Portland
crowd was older, folkier, than I have seen at the Roseland, where
Suzanne reported she has played about 4 times now.  
<p>
I went early to save good seats but soon abandoned them to work up to a
close, comfortable, better sounding spot (the Roseland is a big box that
rattles you might say - next time make it the Civic Auditorium PLEASE).
<p>
To me the music and Suzanne and the band's presence were magical - the
power of the tight, innovative, spontaneous, live sound was
intoxicating, sensual, and uplifting - just the reason I go to a lot of
concerts, and this was the best I have seen this year in that regard.
<p>
I did not write down the set list - I think the entire 9 Objects CD was
performed (which I was happy about since it is my favorite). Also most
of 99.9, and then many of my other favorites - I remember Luka, Small
Blue Thing, and Tom's Diner. There was a nice balance between solo
acoustic and full band numbers, quite a bit of jamming and solos (which
I always enjoy), and the show was a nice 2 hours long, including a
second encore.
<p>
The crowd was enthusiatic and well behaved, and everyone seemed to have
a great time.  Other than the acoustics in that place, it is a real nice
venue.  In less than a month, I have been to Portland and seen 3 legends
that I wanted to see for many years: Ian Tyson (awesome), Ferron
(ditto), and now Suzanne & band (the best!).  I noticed a piece of paper
on the soundboard, perhaps the set list, titled "No Cheap Thills Tour" -
as I bought 3 tickets for the show (I treated a couple of friends), it
wasn't cheap, but the thrill was definately worth it.<br>

Subj:	SV in LA and SA<br>
Date:	96-11-24 02:51:01 EST<br>
From:	wchapman@mizar.usc.edu (Wendy Chapman)<br>
<p>
Hi all,
<p>
While I have a second, I'll just say that SV's shows in LA and Santa Ana
were great.
<p>
Wed. in LA started an hour late because they were taping the show
for--what they said would be a 1 hr. special to air on PBS starting
sometime in early 97.  Suzanne told lots of stories and I think the place
really rocked.
<p>
Th. in Santa Ana was very rainy and an hour in traffic for me to get to
Orange County from LA.  Suzanne told fewer stories and was, I think, a
little mellower--or maybe I was.  I was pretty tired from the high energy
from the night before and I was tired.
<p>
At Wed. show, we stood right at the stage for 4 hours (well, we sat down
half way through Jason Falkner--can't say I'm a fan) but felt no pain
standing through Suzanne's set.
<p>
At Th. show, I sat kind of in the back as I was late but had a good view.
Falkner didn't open for her (I can't say I was sad) another acoustic cover
band opened for her--I liked them much better--I thought one of the
singers was cute (and it was a guy--can you believe it?) But of course
Suzanne is much cuter--so when she came out I forgot all about him.
<p>
Anyway, though I was quite tired by the end of the week--it was well worth
chasing SV around Southern California.
<p>
I hope the rest of the tour goes well and the stuff on the MSNBC site is
great (don't have cable so I didn't see the interview--damn--anyone tape
it?)
<p>
Wendy!

Subj:	The (second to the) last show of the U.S. tour!<br>
Date:	96-11-27 04:13:13 EST<br>
From:	wchase@silcom.com (Will Keightley)<br>
<p>
Howdy, Undertowers!
<p>
I took a break on Friday from a rather hectic work day, (I manage a 
video store in the heart of a college ghetto in Santa Barbara, and 
Independence Day had just hit our shelves) by wandering down the 
block to Espresso Roma for a tall, hot coffee. I sprawled the Santa 
Barbara Independent out on a table and perused it while the air 
combed steam from my cup, looking at the concert listings. I checked 
the Ventura Concert Theater schedule. I had purchased a ticket for 
the Suzanne Vega show about a month and a half ago, and I knew it was 
coming up sometime soon. Hmm...there it was. Suzy Vega: the 22nd. 
What was today? With a start, I realized that it was the 22nd! It was 
that night! I couldn't believe how close I had come to actually 
forgetting to go to the concert!
<p>
Still in shock, I drove to the theater, downed two gin and tonics 
and, as the room began to spin, Jason Falkner took the stage. I 
thought he was downright terrific. I loved the Grays album, and his 
new solo album has some great stuff on it as well. It was strange, 
seeing him without the benefit of a backup band, for his music is so 
layered on disc, but he pulled it off. He was so good that his odd 
decision to play the harmonium for "The Very Best Years" seemed like 
a stroke of genius. He kept making apologies for his voice. He was 
very sick, he told us, and he'd been drinking so much Robitussin that 
we all looked like Blue Meanies from where he stood. Funny, ingenuous 
guy.
<p>
Suzanne's show was good. The two standouts for me were "Small Blue 
Thing" and "In Liverpool" with it's extended, overwhelming finale. It 
felt like the "Starship Trooper" of the Suzanne Vega repertoire 
(maybe a YES reference is out of place on this mailing list?) I'm not 
sure what I think about her current tour setup. This tour seemed very 
much like the last one--very stripped down. Very simple. That's a 
good thing. Though there was something about the Days of Open Hand 
tour that blew me away. Never had I heard a live sound so pure and 
crystalline as when she launched into her rendition of "Pilgrimage" 
on that tour. She had a woman singing backup as well, and even an 
elaborate stage backdrop (which I realize contributed nothing to 
their sound, but it looked nice). I felt that, though Friday's concert was 
first rate, with several highpoints that will stay with me for years, 
it didn't quite match the sublimity of that first show.
<p>
The Ventura Concert Theater is a dinner theater, and that may have 
been part of the problem for me. For an extra fifteen to twenty 
dollars, you can make dinner reservations and sit right down in front 
of the stage, where, at any normal show, the pit, or general 
admission area would be. They bring you one of three depressing entrees, (all 
three of them made of and tasting like resilient cardboard) bring you 
your two-drink minimum and then clear your place while the 
headlining act takes the stage (or maybe it's just that they bring you your 
food for free and you have to  pay them twenty dollars to take it 
away). So what you have, when the lights dim, is the best area of the 
theater filled with engorged, depressed people with no room to get up 
and move around. They had the good sense to leave the dinner tables 
in storage for the WEEZER concert two weeks before, but I suppose 
they thought the typical Suzy crowd couldn't be bothered to get on 
its feet during the course of her show.
<p>
I'm a pretty empathetic concert-goer. I get antsy when the crowd digs 
in and refuses to budge. Suzanne made a remark about the diversity of 
her audience on this past tour: half of the audience wanted to dance 
around while the other half wanted them to sit down...so they could 
continue reading. I took the anecdote to mean, "Put your books down! 
Live a little!" Ah well...I enjoyed it all anyway.
<p>
A lame mistake cost us a second encore at the show's end. The crowd, 
roared its approval after the last chords of "Men in a War" rippled 
into stillness (what they lacked in bodily participation, they made 
up in vocal stridence, I'll give them that). We were ready to hear 
"The Queen and the Soldier." But someone started bringing up the 
house lights and music. They caught their mistake and dropped them 
both immediately, but it was too late. Like a choir of doused 
candles, the crowd began stumbling smokily for the exits. The 
applause paled. I sat and waited and hoped and prayed but 
nothing happened. At last, the lights and music gave in and chased 
the last of us hopefuls out into the night.
<p>
A fine show, and Suzanne looks quite fetching in black.

that'll have to wait for now)

<p>
Hi All,
<p>
I saw suzanne vega's show last night. It was absolutely great. I was
standing outside the club, waiting by the door to get inside when I noticed
two figures walking towards the enterance from the paring lot. It took me a
second to believe my eyes. It was her! She passed _right_ before the
speechless me. The show itself was even better. We even had 2 encores.
<p>
A very attractive part of Suzanne Vega's personality is her down-to-
earthness and her strong bond with the surrounding reality. Does anyone
think this perhaps damages her image as a recording artist? I hope she
doesn't feel that way.
<p>
One last thing, most of the san diego audience didn't dance. I for one did
and was relieved to read that she enjoyed to see people dance to her music.

From:	HUVF20B@prodigy.com (MR PATRICK F DURNING JR)<br>
<p>
Hi - <br>
This is my official de-lurk post, so be gentle...<br>
I went to the Christmas show at Ybor (Eee-bor) Square last night, and it
was,well, memorable. The original plan was to have the show outside, but
with Florida's unpredictable weather, it didn't happen. About an hour or so
before the show, an absolute deluge completely soaked the stage, the equipment,
and everything else. The show ended up happening inside a little bar
called the Oak Barrel Tavern - kind of a shopping mall tavern, with no stage, and
two stage lights for the entertainment - a hideous green light, and a
magentalight that actually shone on the audience. I knew things were going to
be interesting when I went into the men's room, and found two sound guys
holding the PA amplifier under the hot air hand drier, feverishly trying
to get all of the water out of the amp.
<p>
The show started with an acoustic duo called Bleeding Hearts; they did a
good job. Next was the Marshall Crenshaw band, who also did a good job,
considering the circumstances. Suzanne and Mike Visceglia came on about
9:30, and they were warmly received by about 300 of us, packed in like
sardines - there were people sitting on the floor right in front of her.
It was very cozy, and would have been nice if not for the noise from the bar
and the howling drunks in the back of the place. Here's the set list:<p>
Marlene On The Wall<br>
Small Blue Thing<br>
Rock In This Pocket<br>
Stockings (Mike V did a GREAT job on bass for this one!)<br>
Caramel (Mike V played guitar, SV sang)<br>
Neighborhood Girl<br>
Honeymoon Suite<br>
When Heroes Go Down<br>
World Before Columbus (Great job by both on this one)<br>
No Cheap Thrill (some audience participation here)<br>
Gypsy (she did the first verse twice & laughed when she realized it)<br>
Luka<br>
Tom's Diner (The audience did great on the Do-Do-Do's. Even the drunks<br>
in the back got quiet when they heard this one)<br>
Encore: The Queen And The Soldier<br>
<p>
Suzanne looked a little tired, like she was getting a cold, and was
trying to get used to the time change as well - she had flown in from Texas, I
believe. Despite her discomfort, she was very friendly and told a couple of
stories (including the shopping mall story - it was VERY appropriate!)
Overall, they did a super job, given the circumstances. It's neat to see
a pair of professionals do their job very well, despite the conditions.
I was hoping to meet Bob King, but didn't. It was hard to move around in
that place. Thanks, Suzanne for being a good sport, and doing a great show.
I hope you can visit again, this time in a better setting!
<p>

Hi Pat:  Great job on the review. When I hear about a concert like that, it 
really gives me a sense about Suzanne's, attitude, work ethic, and 
perseverance. It's at a gig like that one, as you said, that you quickly see 
the amateurs separated from the pros. What more can a performer give of 
themselves? What more can the fans ask for and not become greedy? That kind of 
show is worth ten Shea Stadiums (well, maybe three :-)). 
Regards, Bruce.

<p>
Hi all.
<p>
Well, it's more than 24 hours now and the wonderful 45 minutes 
last night are still fresh in my mind.  By my count, this is it
for the year, and the band got a head start on their break; it
was all acoustic - just SuzyV and guitar.  (Perhaps sometime, after a
couple more albums, around say, 2005 she'll stop by St. Louis again ;) and 
I'll get a chance to hear the band - not that I would have traded the 
solo show for anything.)
<p>
Set List:<br>
Marlene on the Wall<br>
Gypsy<br>
Caramel<br>
When Heroes Go Down<br>
No Cheap Thrill<br>
World Before Columbus<br>
Stockings  ("You don't have any questions about that song or anything 
	     do you?  Well, my husband had a few.") <br>
Small Blue Thing<br>
Neighborhood Girls<br>
Luka<br>
Tom's Diner<br>
<p>
It was a benefit concert - Toys for Tots again, and the entire night was 
acoustic - New World Spirits/Leah Andreone/Duncan Sheik/Suzanne Vega.  The 
show sold out (1000 tickets) in 8 minutes.  Most of the crowd (75% or 
better) seemed to be there primarily for SV. The lesson: stay away for 9 
years and you get some anxious people.
 <p>
It was all general admission, so I showed up about an hour before doors
and thankfully Mississippi Nights was allowing people into the little 
(15-person capacity) area in front of the box office so the first 15 of 
us didn't have to brave the single digit temps and sub zero riverfront
winds.  The rest of the poor folks... brrrr.
<p>
A great show that ended too early ;).   I really, really liked the 
acoustic No Cheap Thrill.  Yeah, the crowd blew Tom's Diner.  The 
do-do-do-do's were okay, but the crowd prematurely erupted into 
end-of-song applause not once, not twice, but three times.  I'm not 
sure if it was due to lack of attention or the crowd feeling the
effects of drinking for the previous 4 hours.  Couldn't quite
tell if she was amused or troubled.
<p>
What else... Her uncle and cousin were in attendance, up from a small
town about 2 hours south of here.  Small Blue Thing was a request 
from a sizeable, vocal contingent up front.  An apparent Chicago Cub 
fan inexplicably lobbed his hat up on stage during Marlene and she 
held it hostage, hanging on the guitar mic until after Caramel.  
No encore.  It being an all ages show, I think they had to make sure
the place was cleared out by 11:30.  At least I hope that's why.
It wasn't an exceptionally lively crowd, but I don't think we were 
that bad.
<p>
good night,<br>
