Curiosity got me.  I went out and bought it.  On first listen it comes 
off very sparse and ambient.  It also feels more cool and detached than 
any of the others, but then the intricacies haven't jumped out yet.  
<p>
Have a good weekend everyone.

Darcy,
<p>
Keep listening--listen to the subtlties of the albums--the rhythms, 
instruments, and background vocals--I feel that these all set a tone for 
the album that carries the lyrics.  Also, I think the imagry in the songs 
is also very important--and personal.  I believe more personal than the 
others because the "I" is used quite a bit in this album--where there 
were characters in the others (not all but a lot of) and there is a great 
a lot of dealing w/ the psyche (dreams, relation to society, religion, 
etc) in this album.  I think the music enhances these feelings.

This album is very interesting musically.  When I first started listening 
to Suzanne, it was the lyrics entirely that caught me.  As far as I 
was concerned, every song could have been sung acappella..it wouldn't 
have mattered.  Obviously with Days and even more so with 99.9F, the 
music plays a larger role. I still think though that 
it's her very direct singing style and lyrics that effect me the 
most.

I was thinking about your comments as I listened to it today, and I guess 
I disagree in part.  I is used a lot, but it's a reactionary I--how I 
relate to the outer world, and not so much how I relate to my own inner 
world.  Of course they're related, but I don't feel the same interspection 
I felt with her first album.  Of course this may be more due to where I 
am currently as a listener as opposed to where I was when I first heard 
her.  It's hard to separate the two.  I do really like Days.  I'm not 
discounting it at all, as I thought I might be able to given what I had 
read of it (even Suzannes own words).  
<p>
Institution green and rusted pipe stand out for me.  They seem more 
personal, but still I can't help but feel some detachment.  I wonder if 
producing an album demands that at all.  It seems like trying to 
perfect all parts might detract from the one central part.  I don't 
really know; it's just a hypothesis.  I'm glad I got it, though, and like 
all of her albums, I'm sure that more will reveal itself with each listen.
