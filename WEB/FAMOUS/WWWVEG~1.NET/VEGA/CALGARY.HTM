Hi guys,
<p>
Just want to give you all a quick report on Suzanne's
delightful performance in this year's Calgary Folk Festival.
<p>
First of all it's a wonderful surprise that, in June, she
had decided to come to this year's festival; but around mid
July, there was some rumors circulating here that she might
have to cancel her appearance this year. There was some
conflict with her band's schedule (or something I wasn't too
sure about). However it was such a relief that she was able
to make it even without her band and to perform in the
finale of the festival.
<p>
And it turned out to be a marvelous experience: since this
my very first time attending her acoustic-only performance,
all of my previous experience were limited to her concert
tours with her band. I've always been looking forward to
attend one of her solo performances at some smaller, more
intimate venues. Because to me, hearing her beautiful voice
together with her playing with acoustic guitar would be a
remarkable experience. And my dream has finally come true
this year: her singing was so alluring and clear without the
accompaniment of her band. As a result, it'd become a richer
experience for me personally. (please don't misunderstand,
I've also enjoyed her previous performances with her band,
but this was a different kind of experience).
<p>
During her performance there were some funny moments to make
it an intimate atmosphere. for examples, she joked about her
youthful fascination of Leonard Cohen's work and about why
she suddenly forgot the lyric of _Tired of Sleeping_
(because of no more sounded sleep due her new found
motherhood. :-) Later, it was hilarious when she forgot the
second verse of _Rock in This Pocket_  she joked about how
hard could it be, it only has three verses in it. :-)
Needless to say, she gave a beautiful performance of the
song during her encore.
<p>
Below were the songs that she performed during the festival:
<p>
     Small Blue Thing<br>
     Tired of Sleeping<br>
     Rock in This Pocket<br>
     Gypsy<br>
     The Queen and the Soldier<br>
     Knight Moves<br>
     Luka
     Neighborhood Girls<br>
     Tom's Dinner<br>
<p>
It was so wonderful to hear her perform acoustic versions of
the _Neighborhood Girls_ and _The Queen and the Soldier_
Furthermore, it was fun when the audience was providing
vocal beats for her during _Tom's Dinner_ I hope she had as
much fun as we had. :-)
<p>
In conclusion, it was a wonderful experience to hear
Suzanne's acoustic performance. I'm so grateful that she
would attend those smaller folk festivals such the one in
Calgary. And I hope she had enjoyed her experience in
Canada. I'm Looking forward to see her future performance
north of the border, such as the Vancouver Folk Festival.
:-)
<p>
Best wishes,<br>
Lee<br>
<p>
p.s. I've also heard some rumors that she will be peforming in 
     this year's Edmonton's Folk Fest?? Would someone please
     confirm this? thank you very much. <br>
<p>
