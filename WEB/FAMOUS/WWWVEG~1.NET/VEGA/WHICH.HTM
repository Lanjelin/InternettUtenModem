 "Anna Badowska" enthuses about 99.9F and asks:
<p>
>  Now I`m thinking about "Suzanne Vega" album and "Days Of..."<BR>
> which am I to buy first?
<p>
I'm sure Wendy will disagree, but I would get "Suzanne Vega" first 
because it's absolutely flawless. It's also got so many of the songs 
that we yammer about all the time here: Neighborhood Girls, Queen and 
the Soldier, Cracking -- not to mention Undertow, which provided our 
list name.
<p>
I've actually been spending a lot of time lately listening to "SV"
and "99.9F", which I both love to pieces in different ways. I hate
to say that "Suzanne Vega" is her best album, because it sounds like
I'm saying she's gone downhill since then, which is far, far, far
from the truth -- but I do think it's her best, if only because
perfection is such a rare thing. It's not musically as adventurous as
"99.9," but the songwriting is unsurpassed.
<p>
"Days" is probably her most ambitious album of the first four and 
well worth getting, but some of us find it a bit too labored and 
lacking in spontaneity. Others, like Wendy, think it's Suzanne's 
masterpiece.
<p>
The best solution: buy them all! And have fun.
<p>
Good luck.

P.S. I've listened to the "Birth-day" and "Caramel" clips but 
otherwise am trying to keep my ears fresh for the album's debut; for 
the same reason I've avoided reading the lyrics. But I'm really 
envious of you who've managed to see her live.
<p>
Does anyone have any idea of where the tour of "major cities" is 
going to hit? I hate making requests, but here's one -- please, 
please include Florida (Tampa Bay if possible). So many musicians 
don't like coming here because it's a long peninsula to nowhere and 
you have to turn around. But you have lots of fans down here who have 
been dying to see you for years, and will no doubt be packing the 
rafters at whatever venue you appear if I personally have to corral 
them inside with a cattle prod. That's a promise.
<p>
Or at least give us lots of notice so I have time to buy plane 
tickets.
<p>
Thanks.

<p>
I agree that "Suzanne Vega" is in a sense Suzanne's best album. And the
reason for that, I think, is quite simple: She had 15 years of songwriting
to draw from, and could choose only the very best songs. With the exception
of a few songs on "Solitude Standing", most of her later songs were written
for a particular album, which necessarily means that these albums contain
some sonngs that may not be as "tried and true" (in Suzanne's own words) as
others.
<p>
The remarkable thing about "Suzanne Vega" is that it's such a homogenous
album despite being a "compilation" -- the songs build on each other,
complement each other. "Suzanne Vega" is, all in all, an excellent
introduction to the fascinating world of Suzanne Vega.
<p>
But "Suzanne Vega" is of course not the whole picture -- each album is
essential, and which one you like most is, I guess, a matter of taste.
<p>
By the way, I've listened quite a lot to the soundclips, and I really think
this album could be one of Suzanne's very best. World before Columbus is
just stunning. I can't get it out of my head -- and I'm happy for that...
<p>

P.S. I agree with Wendy! -- buy them all!!!

I can't pick a 'best' album myself, since it depends on the mood I'm in, but
I will argue that they (SV and her producers) left off some of the 'very
best songs' for her debut album.  Some that weren't included on the debut, 
but theoretically could have been, include Gypsy (written in 1978), Calypso
(also '78, I think), Luka (1982?) and maybe Ironbound (don't have the CD in
front of me now).  They must have 'saved' these songs, for one reason or
another, for the 2nd album, since the 1st album only goes ~36 min.  But at
least Gypsy and Luka are among the best she's ever written, don't you agree? 
<p> 
All I'm saying is that including these would have made her debut even more
awesome than it already is.  I love both albums, of course!  Gypsy really
should have made it onto the debut, IMHO.  It fits the mood of the 1st album
better, plus you'll recall that when they recorded it for Solitude Standing,
they even used some of the studio musicians who played on the 1985 sessions
(percussion by Sue Evans, for instance).  
<p>
There are also some other good 'early' songs that didn't make it onto either
album, i.e. 'Black Widow Station,' 'The Silver Lady,' 'The Marching Dream,'
etc.  Anyone know if the plan to release these in an Early Songs compilation
is still on??  OK, Suzanne, we know your feelings on 'The Rent Song,' so you
can leave that one off if you want! ;)

I think Suzanne was afraid Gypsy would be a bit quaint, she wanted a sharper
edge to the album. Cracking was kind of turning point for Suzanne, and I
guess she wanted more of that and less older stuff, like Gypsy. But I agree
with you about Gypsy -- to me it's one of the most beautiful songs ever written.
<p>
Luka was written before the debut album, but it hadn't found it final for
yet (I've heard early live versions of it). So it was probably wise to keep
it until the second album.
 <p>
The song I really think should have been on the first album is The Marching
Dream. It's such a marvellous song! What a pity it's so hard to find. (It
was released on an issue of Fast Folk -- see the discography).
<p>
