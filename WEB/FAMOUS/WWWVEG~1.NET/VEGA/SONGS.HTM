<b>THE MAGIC KINGDOM</b> was based loosely on a newspaper article about
the design concepts behind the Disney theme parks where danger
has been defanged and cultural diversity is celebrated as
cultural kitsch.  I'm also having a little fun both lyrically and
musically.  Disneyland is too easy a target to treat in deadly
earnest.  I offer the song as an antidote to "We are the World"
sentimentality.  As Milan Kundera once wrote:  "The brotherhood
of man on earth will be possible only on a base of kitsch."
<p>
<b>THE STREET</b> was written largely about my former block on East 4th
Street on New York's Lower East Side.  That song and ST. BRIGID'S 
apply a patina of romantic dreaminess to a very gritty place.  In
<b>ST. BRIGID'S</b>, unrequited love meets the mean streets of the Lower
East Side where "spring blooms in costume" and the landlords and
warlords wait for their moment of opportunity.
<p>
<b>FEVER (LA LUNE)</b> is a tiny lyric, but a rather big song.  It's a
delirious but sober, feverish but cool, howling at the moon.  
<p>
<b>IN THE MIRROR</b> orignated from a specific reference, a drawing by
the turn-of-the-century Austrian artist Egon Schiele in which a
female nude stands before a mirror, the artist seen reflected as
well with pencil and paper in hand.  It is, at least some of the
time, my stance as a writer and photographer, to observe the
world as reflected in a mirror, framed and two-dimensionally
described.  
<p>
<b>OPEN ALL NIGHT</b>, written in 1979, was a stylistic breakthrough for
me.  For the first time I left myself entirely out of a song,
choosing instead to build a visual and aural scene, a passing
moment in a story that is left to the imagination.  It sounds
like a New York song, but it depicts a fictional 24-hour diner in
Washington, D.C.  That's where the address 14th and T is, an area
bordering on white Northwest and black Northeast Washington. 
<p>
<b>THE DANGER</b> and <b>BURN BURN BURN</b> were both written out of romantic
frustration mixed with revery.  Although they are more directly
heart-on-the-sleeve than <b>FEVER (LA LUNE)</b>, the songs, neverthless,
take on slightly comic tones in the exaggerated repetitions of
"the danger, the danger," and "burn burn burn." 
<p>
In 1982 I wrote <b>THE SWAN</b>, a song about lost love and lost
opportunity.  "She fell in love at last and flew away/Through a
looking glass some folks say."  The music was loosely interpreted
from Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," by way of a Public Image Limited
song of the same name--not that you can really tell.  Five years
went by after writing <b>THE SWAN</b> before I completed another song.
<p>
<b>CITIES ON THE AERIAL PATHS OF COMMUNICATION</b>, written in 1990, is
about the fall of the Soviet Union.  After the 1917 Russian
revolution, artists, writers and architects sought to build a new
utopian society.  This era of creative freedom was intense but
short lived, and by the 1930's it was crushed by the brutality of
Stalin.  In 1928 Georgi Krutikov, an architecture student,
created a series of drawings off futuristic flying cities, or
"Cities on the Aerial Paths of Communication." In the song, the
utter and unredeemable failure of the Soviet Union contrasts
starkly with the early visions of the "dreamers of a bright and
shining world."  In recording the song, I asked violinist Lisa
Gutkin to play a dissonant elegy as if alone in Red Square.
<p>
<b>OLD FACTORY TOWN</b> was written about Waterbury, Connecticut, the
former "brass city." All the factories are gone now, as in so
many northeast cities.  Like <b>OPEN ALL NIGHT</b>, the song is another
experiment in description and narrative restraint.  The setting
is the story. The outer images evoke the characters' inner world. 
In the recording, listen for Suzanne Vega's whispery shadow vocal
hovering above mine.
