Hi folks,
<p>
I found this on the Vin Scelsa [Radio] Show Digest, and thought that I'd post
it to Undertow for everyone's bemusement.

Ever notice how many women singers have their albums produced by their 
husbands? <BR>
Rosanne Cash-John Leventhal <BR>
Suzanne Vega-Mitchell Froom <BR>
Kristy MacColl- Steve Lillywhite <BR>
Sam Phillips-T-Bone Burnett <BR>
Marti Jones-Don Dixon <BR>
    No longer married: <BR>
Joni Mitchell-Larry Klein <BR>
Carlene Carter-Nick Lowe <BR>
I'll bet there are more...I'm not counting instances where "Svengali-like" 
husbands "discovered" their wives, and made stars out of them, e.g.: <BR>
Cher-Sonny <BR>
Ronnie-Phil Spector <BR>
Patty Scialfa-Bruce (I'm assuming he produced her album) 
 <p>
I can't think of any instance where wives produced albums for their
husbands; in fact the only woman producer I can think of is Linda Ronstadt,
who worked for David Lindley and Jimmy Webb (hey, does Jimmy Webb have a webb
site? Nevermind).  I guess Bonnie Raitt has done some production work, but
aren't there any others? Hmm, did Tom Waits' wife work with him on recent stuff? <BR>

Oh yes, the list of producers or managers or
arranger/bandleaders that have a relationship with a
chanteuse is long indeed. Whether it's of the svengali type
is not always easy to find, I'm sure. A lot of it may simply be
"on-the-job romance." 
<p>
I think it's a great book idea!
<p>
I know there's...
 <p>
Pat Benatar - her guitar dude hubby<BR>
Mariah Carey -her music-biz husband
<p>
Being a good little office-worker, I can't bring myself to think
of more but I'll bet this is an archetypal kind of relationship
going wayyyy...  back.

<p>
Angela Winbush, R&B producer-singer, produced husband Ron Isley's album 
and some tracks on the new The Isley Brothers CD.

(Here goes my first posting...)
 <p>
The business of husbands (usually) producing their wives'
albums immediately made me think of Edie Brickell (& husband
Paul Simon). Her first 2 albums I've almost played to death,
but her recent 3rd - 'Picture Perfect Morning' - was produced
by (new?) husband Paul Simon, and is possibly the most
disappointing album I've ever bought (given my expectations).
It was such a big departure for her, even to the inclusion
of (big) Barry White on some backing vocals (if you can
call it that). Aaaarrrggghh!
 <p>
I've no doubt readers of this are at least partly-familiar
with Edie Brickell - personally I tend to see her debut album
and that of Suzanne Vega in pretty much the same acoustic,
pared-down style.
 <p>
 
Cheers,<BR>
Mike.
