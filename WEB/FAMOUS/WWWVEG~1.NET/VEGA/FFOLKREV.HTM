Longtime subscribers to this magazine are probably
already familiar with the work of Brian Rose. His songs have frequently been
featured in Fast Folk since its inception, and he has been a mainstay of the
annual Fast Folk Revue at the Bottom Line. Recently, Rose made available a
collection of eleven of his songs, spanning various phases of his songwriting
career.<P ALIGN=left>This eponymously-entitled cassette affords the
uninitiated the opportunity to encounter the full breadth of Rose's musical
vision. Many of the songs here are touched by poetry without sounding
overwrought or hyperliterary. Rose has the gift of making the commonplace
seem almost mystical through his adroit lyricism. In "The Street," he uses
the everyday images of an unremarkable urban landscape in a manner that
transforms those details into something more: "From the roof there is
splendor, a city in the sky / Lost to the skylight's dull-witted eye / As she
plants her feet on the concrete sod / She says to her husband, we are closer
to God." While elevating the mundane to the spiritual, Rose nevertheless
maintains the evenhanded objectivity that is present in much of his work.
<P ALIGN=left>In the song's chorus, he sings, "There is a street of hope /
There is a street of despair / There is a street balanced 'tween neglect and
care." Here as in many of his songs, Rose takes the role of impartial
observer, drawing no conclusions, offering no opinions, and making no
statement save that which is created by focusing the listener's attention on
a particular situation.  In this, one is reminded of the Jack Hardy lyric,
"Anything is a work of art if you take the time to frame it." Often the
characters and scenarios chosen are not the ones that seem ostensibly ripe
for artistic plucking, yet Rose has the ability to make them resonate.
<P ALIGN=left>Two of the most powerful songs here employ this technique from
opposite ends of the narrative lens. "Old Factory Town" is a first-person
account of a day in the life of an unexceptional man. We find him lying in
bed before dawn, dreaming of nothing more exciting than the local watchman
making his rounds. He rises to the familiar din and clatter of his wife and
children in the house. We see him punch into his job at the factory "where I
cast the clappers of church steeple bells," and then retire to the bar when
the whistle blows. Night time finds him dreaming once more, this time "of the
clamor of all the church bells / Cast in iron and brass at J.T. McTell."
<P ALIGN=left>"Old Factory Town" is the most emotionally charged song here
precisely because it seems on the surface to be so devoid of emotion. At no
time does the narrator give us an indication that he has any feeling
whatsoever about the events that make up his daily life. It's through the
expert use of minimalism, a technique which has blossomed in the hands of
everyone from Miles Davis to Raymond Carver, that Rose makes these images
speak for themselves. As is the minimalist tradition, that which is left
unspoken speaks the loudest. The narrator is so completely absorbed by the
mundanity and empty horror of his life that he cannot even step outside
himself to describe it. Even his dreams are occupied by the same flat, bleak
visions that pervade his conscious mind. We learn more about this man's lfe
by what he doesn't tell us than we ever could from his most effusive
observations. Clothed in a traditional-sounding, minor-key melody perfectly
punctuated by bell-like synthesizer tones, the song is easily the centerpiece
of the collection, even though it comes at the very end.<P ALIGN=left>On
"Open All Night," a similar narrative device is used, this time in the third
person. Rose depicts the goings-on in a late-night diner, observing from a
distance the waitress, the patrons, and the passersby outside--"There's news
of a murder up at 14th and T and the waitress shivers with fright. "Just
outside the door, "the street is a minefield for the ex-soldier with the
tattooed arm." Again, Rose makes no statement about these characters and
draws no conclusions.  The effect is highly atmospheric, reminiscent of
nothing so much as an Edward Hopper painting (say, "Nighthawks") describing
the scene from outside while placing you smack dab in the middle, making you
feel rather than see the loneliness and isolation.<P ALIGN=left>There isn't
space enough here to examine all the different approaches that Rose employs
in his songs, but there is one composition in particular which differs so
markedly from the rest that it shouldn't pass without comment. "Cities on the Aerial Paths of Communication" is a
song about the idealistic utopianism of turn-of-the-century Russia before the
coming of Stalin. In sharp contrast to some of the more spartan offerings
here, "Cities" is a wildly imagistic, almost surreal song which attempts to
encompass a broad subject through poetic twists and turns. Rose lets loose
the literary muse that he holds in check on most other songs, delivering
lines like "architects descend the Odessa Steps to their blueprint islands on
the Black Sea." Wisely, there is little attempt at making these lyrics scan
metrically. Rather, they float freely over the dissonant chord progressions
that are often Rose's trademark, creating an element of tension.<P
ALIGN=left>It's easy to have mixed emotions about a song like this. On one
hand, it may be a bold piece of work that forsakes convention in pursuit of
high art. On the other, it may be unforgivably highbrow and impossibly
pretentious. I prefer to think that it's both, wonderful and irritating at
the same time, but regardless, one must respect the artistic courage that it
takes to write a song like this. The important thing is that Rose is not
afraid to take chances, or to venture far enough out to reach for what is
otherwise unattainable. This alone is more than enough of a reason for anyone
interested in originality and inspiration to seek out this recording.
