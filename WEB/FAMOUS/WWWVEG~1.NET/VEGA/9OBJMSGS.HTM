Hi Everyone, 
<P>
Here's the latest:
<P>
Some bad news to break to those of you in the UK .  The album is being
released in the UK in January instead of now.  It has to do with marketing
and promotion schedules of the record company.  They really want to give it a
major push and just feel that early next year will be clearer for that than
this Fall.  Suzanne's management had no say in the matter, and wants everyone
to know that they hope this doesn't inconvenience them. You can call A&M in
London to complain if you like. Or, just buy the record through one of the
links to the online record shops on our website - both are reputable
businesses - available on the 10th.
<P>
More soon,
<P>
Eric

Like I had found a promo copy of NOOD two days ago I wasn't on such a hurry
to buy the album today, so I didn't. But a French friend from the list (come
on, delurk!) told me he found a digipack version of the album. Did anyone
know about that? <BR>
Anyway I'll check tomorrow and let you know.

Hello to anyone else in New Zealand...
<P>
According to the record store I just visited, the NZ release date is
18th October.  (The distributor is Polygram, if you want to bug them.)
<P>
Are there any plans for an Australia/NZ tour?

  About the digipack : I found it yesterday in a shop called Fnac in
Paris. Fnac is a chain of shops selling records, books , audio and
video. I think it is (at least in France) a Fnac exclusive because there
was a sticker : "Digipack Fnac collector edition". The number on the
disk is 540 583-2 and on the box there is LC 0485 and PY 900.
<P>
  OK now I am going to take a deep breath, try to slow down my heart a
bit and I may try and send a few more comment when I am more quiet.

I bought this digipack version in a Fnac too, and I wondered if this version 
could be found anywhere else. Actually, I haven't seen any other version 
yet, and I'd like to know how the album is all over the world.
<P>
One more thing : I own two different versions of 99.9 F° (a US one with 12 
songs and a French one with 13 songs - including "Private Goes Public").
Is it the same for "Nine Objects..." somewhere or other?
Did anyone buy this album with more (or less) than 12 tracks?

I rushed to the Fnac today. (for Nael: it seems indeed to be a Fnac
exclusive but you can find the normal edition in other stores like Virgin).
But don't worry undertowers, this digipack is nothing special, it's a
two-fold cardboard packaging, with the normal front and back covers, and
when you open it you see the picture of Suzanne with apples, on an armchair,
so that's the only photo that is special (it's only bigger than the same one
at the end of the booklet). The CD itself is probably the normal one, not a
picture disc or anything. The first cardboard page is a double one and
inside there is the booklet (I hope you can picture what I mean). I bet it's
the very same booklet as in the normal CD too, except that it also includes
a French translation of the lyrics. I hope Suzanne will later release a real
digipack, the one for 99.9F is so beautiful!

Was I the only one who noticed that under "special thanks" in the liner
notes of NOOD, SV mentions Undertow? Now, I'm just a lurker here, but I
still thought that was pretty cool.

Hi there,

Isn't it interesting that Suzanne is one of the few songwriters who handles
writing in 3/4 or 6/4 or 6/8 time so well?  Or swing-time, for that matter?

hello everyone,
<P>
(my first ever message to undertow with three topics..)
<P>
I just thought you'd like to know that here in Turku, Finland we have 
been lucky enough to listen to the new album since last Friday (sept 6). I 
guess the release dates don't matter much here. The same happened to REM and 
Rush as well - I think they had the same release date (Sept 9). Has 
anyone seen/bought '9OOD' even earlier?

Has anyone seen a limited edition to 9OOD? I remember that the 99.9F
limiteds seemed to pop up in all the mall stores a year after the album
came out, as though someone were emptying a warehouse.

I don't think they've even made one yet.  It's not on any list of new
releases, etc. that I've heard of.  Perhaps they'll do one later?  (if
the regular edition does OK, I would guess)

Yes, but try finding one now!  Impossible, unless you get lucky and find
it used somewhere.  I'm glad I got mine when I did.

A quick check of SoundScan shows that last week 9OoD debuted at #92 (right 
below Weird Al Yankovic's latest).  Not exactly a great number, I was hoping 
for at least top 50.  I'm sure A&M is not overjoyed, either.  Oh well. :(
<p>
On a more upbeat note, my personal enjoyment of the new one deepens ... I've 
found the charms of World Before Columbus irresistable, and Honeymoon Suite 
draws a chuckle from me upon every listen.  My initial picks of Headshots 
and Casual Match are both holding up strong, as well.  WBC is an instant 
all-timer - on my list of Top 5 Suzy songs!  Going off the subject here, any 
other Undertowers out there that like 'Pilgrimage' as much as I do?
<p>
The album is reviewed on-line at mrshowbiz.com - a '66', which is not 
exactly high praise.  I did enjoy the overly florid Spin review, though - it 
seems the writer was more interested in impressing with his style than 
actually commenting on the album :)

Is the limited edition the same as the promo copy?  Cardboard
hand-assembled packaging with some handwritten lyrics in the
middle?  If so, those cool packages are typically put out by
the label on or before the street date of the record.  They're
sent to radio/press/retail basically for the purpose of making
those people feel important enough to the label that they do
something to help the record.  Occasionally it's earnest. :-)

Hi, 
<p>
A newly-delurked Undertower, Paul Burden from the UK, writes:
 <p>
<< I'll have to listen a bit more before making any intelligent contribution
 to the discussion but my first impression is of the warmth of the
 production. I've always thought the sound on SV's recordings a bit
 clinical, but 9OOD just reaches out of the speakers and hugs you!>>
<p>
And have you noticed the careful spacing of all the instruments?  This is one
of those albums that really demands to be listened to in stereo, as I found
out after initially playing it through a high-quality tube (valve, you Brits
would say) guitar amplifier with only one speaker and then playing it through
stereo speakers.  Some instruments are panned hard left and right, others are
more in the center.  When SV harmonizes with herself, it is a real second
track and not just studio trickery (notice that the phrasings don't exactly
match on certain words).  Some of the background keyboards sort of sneak up
on you in several tunes, one case in point being that little "da DA da da"
riff in the chorus of "Casual Match."   They have accomplished something
almost impossible if not oxymoronic -- subtle percussion.
<p>
Just a thought,
<p>
