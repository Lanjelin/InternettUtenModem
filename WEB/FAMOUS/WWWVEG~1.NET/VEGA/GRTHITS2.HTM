<p>
good point. just the other day, i was hanging out in a local record
store and overheard two men talking about music and such. one of them
said, "i'll just buy the collection since i don't want to go overboard
on their albums."
<p>
that made me realize that there is some value to these kinds of releases
for some people. however, for the most part, i don't qualify.

<p>
well, there's a good reason for that - but i'll save that debate for
love-hounds/rec.music.gaffa.
<p>
queen's greatest hits album is another example of a good collection.
<p>

<p>
that pretty much sums it up.

Sorry Wendy, I really don't agree with you !
The Queen and the Soldier is a really good "folk" tune (in 1985, when I
first listen to SV songs, it was my favourite).
<p>
But Knight Moves is intense, cryptic, strong.
And, really strange, it's one of the few SV songs where explicitly appears
the word "love". The more, a lot of times.<p>

<p>
Hi,
<p>
I've been around for a month now, enjoying the ideas and reflections.  I
became
familiar with Suzanne Vega's work 6.5 years ago, when I was 16.  Suzanne
held
a concert in Caesaria's Roman amphitheater (Israel) - it was her first
(and only) performance here, and I listened to it on the radio...  As they
say,
there's a silver line etc., so - in spite my disappointment that I wasn't in
the audience, at least it hooked me to Suzanne's music.
<p>
There aren't too many Vega fans around here; people who like Industrial
music
argue that 99.9'F didn't go far enough; people who enjoy light-dance can do
without Suzanne, and most MTV oriented ones (no offense...) are 'strangers
in
a strange land' when it comes to her songs.  But as you know, mass-
popularity
seldom characterizes quality.  As many of you stated, it's kind-of strange
to
imagine a 'best-of' Suzanne Vega collection, but IMHO it's mainly because
we've got used to the commercial artists who's compilations are usually
based
on hits, knowing this is the best way to sell.  If you take a quality artist
such as Suzanne you'd hardly expect a 'hits album'.  
<p>
Here's a list of my favorite Suzanne Vega tracks:
<p>
Bad Wisdom<br>
Solitude Standing<br>
Marlene on the Wall<br>
In Liverpool<br>
Blood Makes Noise<br>
The Queen and the Soldier<br>
Rock in this Pocket<br>
Gypsy<br>
Ironbound<br>
Book of Dreams<br>
As a Child<br>
Calypso                    <br>
<p>
This mailing list is shared by many people from distant places, but still -
when it came to supplying the 'Greatest' lists, there's a great similarity -
around 80% of the songs appear in (almost) all the lists.  Not all of them
can be described as 'hits' in the common sense of the word - neither
commercially nor melodically.  And yet, we all seem to love them.  So maybe
Suzanne Vega can produce a 'different' compilation, just the way she knows
how to write 'different' hits ?
<p>
Glad to be in Undertow;<br>
greetings and be seeing you.
<p>
ahik.

Date:	95-07-29 22:30:27 EDT<br>
From:	Suzanne Vega<br>

<p>
Hi gang --
<p>
you all did get my last message thanking you for the birthday greetings,
didn't you?  I got a copy of it myself, but the Internet sent me a message
recently saying they had "killed" the message because it was "undeliverable".
 Bizarre.
<p>
Anyway -- regarding the "greatest hits": obviously if it were a true greatest
hits package it would have 2 songs on it; Luka and Tom's Diner.  So it is
really intended to be a "retrospective".  
<p>
I think that to go back and take some songs from each album and place them
together in one collection would be interesting because it would change the
context of the songs.  To me, a song like "Cracking" is not that different in
concept from "Blood Makes Noise".  One is obviously -- well, noisier.  But
neither are really "folk songs".  To me they are more similar than they are
different.   And that would change the way people perceive the songs.  
<p>
Most people think of the first album as "more folk" and the last album as
"more industrial"  when actually all the albums are a mixture of acoustic
guitar and synthesizors (how the hell do you spell that?)
<p>
I'm also thinking of including other projects that were never included on any
album -- "Left of Center", "Salt Water",  possibly "Ignorant Sky", a song I
recently sang for Philip Glass (though I didn't write the lyrics).  A
retrospective is meant to give perspective.  (I want to get the "Squeeze "
one myself.)
<p>
If I could I'd release one every year, whenever I find I'm looking back and
trying to make sense of it all.  They could all have different slants like;  
"The Mental Health Collection ." featuring Cracking, Blood Makes Noise, and
others;  
"The Folk Songs of SV." featuring The Queen and The Soldier, Night Vision,
Bad Wisdom, Gypsy; 
"Love Songs."  with Night Moves.( that would be a very short retrospective so
far, I'm afraid).  
"SV Rocks Out" with Men In a War, Neighborhood Girls.  And so forth.
<p>
I'm getting silly now, sorry.  But I enjoy hearing what you would like and
your reasons, though I don't know that I will please everyone. (The DNA
version will probably be on it, and it will probably be called something
witty like "Retrospective").
<p>
I'm still trying to balance the "tried and true" with the "odds and ends".
 Maybe it will be  a 2 CD set -- one with "tried and true" and the other with
"odds and ends".  But first I have to finish the current one.
<p>
As to the "Covers" tape, of course, I am tickled that you would want to
undertake such a project.  I hope you are free and imaginative in your
interpretations.  I really liked some of the ones on Tom's Album ( though the
REM one was probably my least favorite).
<p>
Talk to you soon.

Yes, it went out. This mailing list is strange in that if there is an
error in delivery to **any** list member the bounce goes back to the
sender. Lots of people leave jobs, school, etc and the accounts are
cancelled.
<p>
And thanks sooooooooo much for stopping to write in again.

Please! and this has been mentioned before: while you're thinking along
those lines, how about a studio version of "Black Widow Station". Yes it's
an oldie, but it's a favorite of many of us - especially those lucky to
have it on that live Australian album from way back.

Actually it's the variety and willingness to experiment which makes your
recent albums interesting to listen to! But you're right in that people
lose the sense of similarities between songs of the same style which may
have been released years apart.

Hey, it worked for Jackson Browne :-)

Far be it for me to suggest album titles Suzanne, but the
obvious answer just jumped out of the page and slapped me
a couple of times:
<p>
  'Retroperspective'

This sounds like a lot of fun.. anyone on this list in my
part of the world (Christchurch, NZ) who wants to talk
about doing something? (preferable as many people as
possible so that my voice can be drowned out ;)

Yes, I know! I wrote only a couple of times to the list, both times speaking
about Knight Moves.
Sorry, I really appreciate all your threads: simply I LOVE this song.
<p>
But what happened to the "K in the front of the night"?

Hey everyone,
<p>
I've been out on vacation and when I got back I found my mailbox full
of all these threads and discussions.  So, I've been reading and trying
to find a good opening for joining in (kinda like pulling out into a
crowded traffic lane).  Funny, one of the last messages before I left
out of town was from Suzanne concerning the b'day messages.  This morn-
ing she's responded again.  So, thought this'd be a good opportunity
to get involved.
<p>
I've been intrigued about the "Greatest Hits" collection.  I like Su-
zanne's idea of possibly combining the rare ones with those more well
known.  Perhaps songs of similar themes could be grouped together, as
Suzanne was saying.  I believe that Bob Dylan did a similar project
with his "Biograph" CDs a few years ago.  I think this gives a fresh
slant to songs recorded years apart with similar motifs.  Whatever you
choose to do, Suzanne, I'm sure those of us on this list will support
it :-)
<p>
Since everyone has made suggestions for their favorites I might as
well give mine.  However, since I'm unable to pare them down to a man-
ageable size I'm going to list those from each album I like and trust
Suzanne to pick from them!  I'd accept substitutions from rare material
I've not heard, of course.  Here goes:
<p>

Freeze Tag          <br>     Tom's Diner  <br>          Tired of Sleeping<br>
Marlene On The Wall  <br>    Luka             <br>      Book of Dreams<br>
Small Blue Thing        <br> Ironbound             <br> Room Off The Street<br>
Undertow                <br> In The Eye            <br> Fifty Fifty Chance<br>
Some Journey            <br> Night Vision          <br> Pilgrimage<br>
TQATS                   <br> Language              <br> Men In A War<br>

99.9 F       <br>           

Rock In This Pocket     <br> Left Of Center<br>
In Liverpool            <br> Stay Awake<br>
99.9<br>
Blood Sings<br>
As Girls Go<br>
Song Of Sand<br>
<p>
Guess I'm not very good at making choices!  Got enough here for 3
disks.  Well, so be it!

Yes!! Thanks, Suzanne, for responding.  As the one who initially posted a
list,
I now realize that 'greatest hits' is not the best term for it... 
<p>

Great!  How about 'Men Will Be Men' (has there been a discussion of this one
yet?) and the bonus track only available on the 99.9F special edition -
'Private Goes Public'?  Kind of like R.E.M's 'Dead Letter Office', maybe,
minus the drunken covers of old Roger Miller songs, of course :) (sorry for 
that 'inside' reference...)

<p>
Ha!  This is hilarious!  See Suzanne poke fun at herself! :)  I've always
thought the two best 'rockers' were from Solitude Standing - those being the
title track, and 'In the Eye'.  Thanks again, Suzanne, for wading through
all the suggestions.  What a nice sense of humor and perspective about her
own work!  This response made my day!!
