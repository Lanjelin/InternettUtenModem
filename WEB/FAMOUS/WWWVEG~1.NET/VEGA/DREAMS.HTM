Are you CRAZY? A Suzanne Vega concert without "Wooden Horse" and "The 
Queen and the Soldier"? You've gotta be kidding.
<p>
OTOH, the concert idear sounds fine. But I think the most logical place 
to hold it would be Bradenton, Florida -- we could rent the Bishop 
Planetarium and hold a laser light show during the concert, then go feed 
Snooty the manatee afterward. (Bring lots of lettuce.)
<p>
Let me know when you work out the details.

I would favor Florida over NYC also, but how about San Antonio, Texas?  After
all, 
I don't think Shiner Bock exists outside of Texas and it's an absolute
essential 
for a small, intimate concert such as this.  We could use the Landing (a club
on 
the Riverwalk--normally a jazz club but I'm sure they'd make an exception).

I'd propose that the Daydream Concert be held in Austin, the Live Music
Capital of the World and a city Suzanne is rather fond of.  Plenty of
venues to choose from!

Hey ya all,<p>
I'm out of the lurking - to give you my two Agorot about this 'special'
concert -
Don't you feel like travelling ý?  So let's have it in Israel (six years ago
Suzanne
Vega performed in Caesaria's Amphitheatre and it was great) - I promise to
supply
the drinks !  (Just don't drink and drive)
By the way - I'd rather not compare her albums - I prefer taking them one
song at
a time, since the style might have changed and the influence might be
different,
but the motions and emotions follow the same pattern I just love.  So, if you
asked
me about my favourites (and how could you, if I'm just de-lurking?) - I'd
say:
The Queen and The Soldier, Marlene on The Wall, Gypsy, Solitude Standing, In 
Liverpool and Bad Wisdom.  There you go.
<p>
Happy 4th of July (to all whom it may concern) !

 I believe our esteemed collegues who wish to hold the proposed concert in
their own cities are denying themselves a true life experience. Why would you
wish this event ready made for you? The music delivered without effort on
your part? the ephemeral event falling about you like gossamer,
disintegrating in the lightest breeze? 
<p>
 I would expect that a pilgrimage would be in order, filled with physical
struggle and spiritual resolve. Ms. Vega's music is about struggle, both in
its form and imagery, and in its function - an attempt to find meaning in
what the artist experiences and witnesses. To experience the art is to engage
in that quest with her - to struggle, to question, to not shun unanswered
questions but to seek them out and revel in your effort to banish the gauzy
slumber of a contented mind. Your effort will be the touchstone of your
experience.  I don't believe the human condition allows us to properly
appreciate success without adversity. 
<p>
In the end the concert will have become more than a momentary pleasure, it
will be a resolution, and achieved goal, a milestone in your memory, a marker
to which you may affix and understanding of who you were at that moment, 
and from which you can measure how far you have come. In our youth we don't
understand the importance of these moments, but they are the events which
make a life.
<p>
 I can imagine no better place for the concert than the land which is formed
the experience of the artist. New York City is the only proper site for this
event. Do not ask for the art to deliver itself to you, engage yourself in
the art, remove yourself from your comfort, challege your body and your 
beliefs.
<p>
P.S. During your pilgrimage, haircloth shirts and fasting are optional ;-).

Oddly enough, Shiner Bock is now available outside of Texas. Its exported 
as a specialty beer, at least here, to the back woods of South 
Carolina.  'course the cheap price tag no longer holds...
The perfect venue for the show might just be the Aladin Theater in 
Portland Or.  A converted porn theater with about 600 seats and a lot 
of atmosphere....

Wendy! et al., I've had the same (day)dream many times. Concerts at big
venues are fine, and Suzanne has a wonderful ability to make even the
largest hall seem almost intimate. Especiallt if you manage to get to the
front row. But I still miss the feeling of a really small, "private"
venue.
<p>
I've heard a couple of recordings from 1984, when Suzanne was still
playing in small places. And despite lousy sound quality, those recordings
are still my favourites. There's just Suzanne with a guitar, singing songs
so intensely it simply breaks your heart. She tells stories or chats to
almost every song -- she's often very funny in her sharp, personal
observations of the dark side of a life. And she never misses the point.
There's poetry in everything she says. 
<p>
I wish there were time machines, so I could go to all the gigs I missed,
especially in the early eighties. But there aren't any such devices, as
far as I know.  So I look forward to the album of unreleased songs Suzanne
has promised us. And you can always dream of a special concert, just like
in the old days, especially  for us Undertowers... FolkCity is not a bad
idea. It still exists -- I was there earlier this year at the annual Fast
Folk Review. A great show, but there's no one like Suzanne there any more.
How could there be?  There's only one Suzanne Vega.
<p>
But not even such a dream concert could make up for all the concerts we've 
missed. Perhaps someone on the list (Brian?) remembers which songs she 
sang, what she would say, how she dressed (I know you wrote that down, 
Suzanne...). How did she change from, say 1979 to 1984? What were the 
audiences like?  I wish someone could make these gigs come alive again...

When I think about it, the 1995 Fast Folk Review was at the Bottom Line,
another classical Vega venue. And I remember there was some talk about
Gerde's Folk City closing down or being turned into something utterly
un-folk.  Whatever happened to it? I hope our New York friends know the
answer...

To all:
<br>
I'd been thinking all this is a little crazy: speculating on "what 
if's" concerning this concert by Suzanne.  But, I have to say, what the 
hell, it *would* be great to have a special UNDERTOW-only audition of 
rare, heck, even well known songs.  I'm in favor of the small venue 
scenario: much more conducive to performer-audience rapport and 
communication.  And I feel NYC might be the place, though I'd have to 
let Suzanne be the final judge.  I'd give most anything to hear a cool, 
acoustic guitar rendition of "Some Journey."  Perhaps we could talk 
Darol Anger into recreating that haunting violin solo.  That'd be worth 
the price of the trip from hotlanta!  And it would be nice to meet some 
other "'Tow-heads."  Maybe if we talk about it enough it'll happen; who 
knows?.....

Having been lucky enough to see Suzanne perform way back when, I can only
second what you have to say about the special atmosphere on those
occasions. In particular, I remember one show at the Speakeasy (where the
Fast Folk crowd performed back then), a tiny room with tiny tables, where
my girlfriend and I had managed to snag one of the front tables. The
little "stage" was only one step up, and it felt as if we had Suzanne
right across the table from us. What a contrast to the larger venues we 
were seeing her in just a year or two later!
<p>
However, Hugo, I am puzzled by your statement that Folk City is still in
operation. I wish it were. I was a regular there in the 70s and 80s. It's
been closed for years, and the space turned into a bar where the only
music is on the jukebox. (Actually, FC wasn't nearly large enough to hold
everyone on this list. The Bottom Line, where she also used to play, would
be more like it.) I think you're confusing it with the new place that the
Fast Folk cooperative has opened to fulfill the role that the Speakeasy
used to, but with more control. 
<p>
Located at 41 North Moore St. in Tribeca, it's the Fast Folk Cafe, "home
of the Fast Folk Musical Magazine." The magazine is a CD/zine combo,
presenting many fine new and lesser-known artists. (Back when it was on
LP, Suzanne was among those included.) For example, this Friday July 7th,
ten or more of NYC's best songwriters will be taped live for next month's
CD. The Cafe is an all-volunteer project and deserves your support if
you're in the area. Call for info at 212-274-1636.  By the way, my
girlfriend (yes, still the same one mentioned above), Lise, was told by
Suzanne at the Learning Annex session that she continues to be a supporter
of Fast Folk (she's one of the founding mothers of its original
incarnation) and that she helped out by appearing at the benefit opening
of the new club. 
<p>
P.S. - If you've never heard it, check out the song by the Roches, on 
       their _Another World_ album, "Face Down at Folk City."

I really didn't expect to get such a strong response to this concert idea.
 However, only one important response remains missing--Suzanne's!  
<p>
A lot of voting for venues--I can live w/out the Folk City idea--since it's
gone.  The Bottom Line or even Fast Folk would do nicely--but I'm sticking w/
the idea that it needs to be on Suzanne's home turf--New York City--we need
to be where the artist was inspired--we need to see the city that gave her
poetry it's edge.  
<p>
Heck--why don't we all try to cram into Tom's Diner and Suzanne can sit on
the counter w/ her guitar and sing.  Now, that would be hard core.
<p>
Anyway--keepin' the dream alive!!!
<p>
Wendy!!
<p>
P.S.  The website is wonderful--I spent three and 1/2 hours there the other
day printing the articles out to put in a book and read.  WooHooo---I have
some other old articles about Suzanne that appeared around Solitude Standing
days that I didn't see in there if anyone is interested--Eric or Hugo.
