</i></h3>
<pre>
I am at your halfway station darling and I've been waiting
for your train.
I am at your halfway station darling and I've been waiting
for your train.
But you've been too long darling and it looks like rain.

I have seen these strange little girls who come up to you
and they don't know when to stop.
I have watched your eye as it follows the line of the leg
right up to the top.
Now Betty Sue and Mary Jane have come around to play again,
but I am standing at your door and I do believe I'll tell
them to go home.

There's this black widow spider darling and she's been
walking on my hand.
There's this black widow spider darling and she's been walking
on my hand.
And we've had this little heart to heart and I think I
understand.

It's a funny situation, I mean what am I to do?
With Lisa in the upstairs room and Joan and Martha too.
I can't come down to breakfast 'cause the plates have all
been used.
And it's as crowded as a subway car and I think that you're
confused.
Now I would wait at your station but I do believe it's time
that I went home.

I am at Black Widow station darling and I've been waiting for
your train.
I am at Black Widow station darling and I've been waiting for
your train.
You've been to long darling and it looks like rain.
You've been to long darling and it looks like rain.
