In 1991, shortly after returning to music after a three year
hiatus spent working mostly in photograhy, I approached Suzanne
Vega with the idea of her producing an album of my songs.  She
and I met in 1980 playing an open mike at Folk City--at that time
the primary venue in New York for acoustic music.  Back in those
days we would play our new songs for each other and challenge
each other to go further and work harder at the craft of writing. 
So, it was natural for me to ask Suzanne to work with me in
recording my album.  She was already familiar with most of my
songs, and I felt that the musical chemistry between us might
lead to good results.
<p>
Nevertheless, I was apprehensive going into the studio.  Suzanne
and I had not worked together so closely since those days long
ago in Greenwich Village.  The outcome of our collaboration, I
hope you agree, was a happy one.  We worked with several members
of Suzanne's band as well as musicians I had been playing with,
all of whom shine throughout the album.  We were greatly aided by
Steve Rosenthal, the owner of the Magic Shop, who engineered the
recording, and whose good spirits never flagged during even the
most tedious moments.
<p>
The album was recorded during two sessions.  The songs from the
first session, THE MAGIC KINGDOM, OLD FACTORY TOWN, FEVER (LA
LUNE), and BURN BURN BURN, were produced by Suzanne with full
band arrangements.  The second session took place somewhat later
at the end of a week Suzanne had blocked out at the Magic Shop to
work out ideas for her 99.9 album.  Those songs were recorded
very simply--mostly guitar and vocals--with beautiful touches of
violin provided by Lisa Gutkin.  Suzanne was there throughout the
session, despite being exhausted from her own recording, and she
coached me through my vocals as well as contributing harmonies on
herself.
