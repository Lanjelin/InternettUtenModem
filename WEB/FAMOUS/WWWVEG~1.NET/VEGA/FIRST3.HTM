Subject: Hello?!<br>
<p>
Hello to you all!
<p>
I'm new in this mailinglist and i joined it because i found many 
interesting aspects to the songs of Suzanne at her site in the WWW.
<p>
Some of them matched my own interpretation of the lyrics while others 
were diffrent but none the less interesting.
<p>
I'm not a bonehard fan for suzanne but i like many of her songs! (BTW 
I'm not a fan for anyone, i don't want to be fanatic.) 
<p>
I've five CD's of her: SV,SS,DOTOH and 99.9F. I think of the DOTOH 
as the best one but the others aren't bad at all and well worth listening 
and buying. I didn't liked 99.9F at first. It was a cut to the style she 
performed earlier but after three or four times listening to the songs i 
found that they are simply an evolution of her way to make music.
<p>
In all the messages in this list i've missed a song that i like very much 
and wich is one of my favorite SuzyV songs "Gypsy". So i'm asking you 
real fans, how do you like it? Is it one of the songs you prefer or do 
think it's rubbish?
<p>
I've seen that Suzanne herself posts time after time to this list.
It is great to see that she acts here not as the big Star that she 
propably is but as a human beeing wich we all are.
So i have one question to her: Did you ever think that your line in that 
particular song,<p>
"We strangers know each other now as part of the whole design"
could come true in such a nice way?
<p>
So i don't want to bother you anyfurther with my scribled lines
<p>

Subject: Introduction<br>
<p>
Dear Suzanne and all Webmates,
<p>
I have been a big Suzanne Vega fan since the mid-80's. An unapologetic pop
fan, I must confess 
that the source of my introduction to Suzanne was the soundtrack to Pretty in
Pink. Since then, I 
have not failed to get all the albums available in Malaysia, where I am from,
and the U.S. I have 
just subscribed to the Internet a few weeks ago. Imagine my delight and
thrill (i.e. the tickling 
and the trembling) to find a lovely web page devoted to her!
<p>
Suzanne's lyrics has always touched me. I find her writing very incisive;
emotional without being 
frilly or sentimental. The music, shaped by Suzanne, and the people she works
with, beautifully 
complements her lyrics -- most astonishingly on her last release 99.9F, where
the razor-sharp 
lyrics met its sonic counterpart in Mitchell Froom's production. The lyrics
most close to my 
heart are the ones in which Suzanne deals with a recurring theme of
communication, and creative 
breakdown (Rusted Pipe, Language). As someone who is worried about words as
she is, and having 
English as my second language, I find that I always have a difficulty in
communicating what I 
feel, resulting in mis- or non-communication. The frustration of a creative
block is documented 
so well in Rusted Pipe.
<p>
My favorite Vega album is Suzanne Vega. Songs like Cracking, Freeze Tag,
Marlene on the Wall, and 
Small Blue Thing resonates with a raw innocence and urban wit. The
underappreciated Days of Open 
Hand is also full of haunting and melodic gems like the darkly sensual Room
Off the Street and 
the XTC-inspired Book of Dreams. The music on Days is careful and controlled,
much like Suzanne's 
newly polished, sophisticated lyrics. Solitude Standing as a whole album is a
musically less 
successful attempt at pop-rock (the sales will indicate otherwise), although
no self-respecting 
music fan can deny the power of Luka, or the lyrical masterpieces of Wooden
Horse and 
Ironbound/Fancy Poultry. The upwardly-immobile Portuguese ghetto is expressed
magnificently in 
images of fences,iron, blood and feathers, grass growing in cracks. Who has
ever compared 
prostitution with chicken before this?
<p>
Suzanne, your work is very much appreciated by all of us. We continue to wait
for Slice of Life 
with bated breath. And of course check out Caramel and Woman on the Tier.
Thanks for sharing your 
writing and vision.
<p>
Love,
<p>
Khairyl (pronounced Hi-Rail)

<p>
Dear Undertow,  
<p>
    This is my first letter to Undertow, so I thought I'd reveal 
my first impressions of Suzanne Vega.  I became a fan in 1987 as
a result of being captured by the song "luka" - a song that cited 
my childhood with haunting accuracy.  It wasn't long before I was
enthralled with the full body of her work:  Cracking, Small blue 
thing, Wooden horse.  How does this woman know so much about me?  
<p>
     As a musician myself, I acknowledged her musical talent as 
being unique and competent.  As a person who failed English, how- 
ever, I was shocked that words and poetry could be so meaningful 
and cool!  I quickly began to write my own verse.  Unfortunately, 
the ugly characteristics of my voice prevents me from expressing 
myself vocally and utilizing my musical talent.  So I'm confined 
to the printed page.  
<p>
    I will at some point post some of my poetry on Undertow.  It 
is dark and tragic but accurately reflects my existence - a state 
that dangles by an ever fraying thread.  That, however, is beyond 
the scope of this introductory note.  
<p>
                                A new Undertow friend,   Albert.

Subject: First letter to the newsgroup<br>
<p>
Well, everyone seems to write for the first time and tell about the first 
time they heard Suzanne, so it's my turn.
<p>
It was kind of strange. I'm mexican (BTW, are there any other mexicans in the
newsgroup?), born in Mexico City but lived in Tampico (just north of Veracruz
State) for 12 or 13 years, then moved to Mexico City again, just about a year
and a half ago. (Now I'm 18)
<p>
6 or 7 years ago I was in Tampico, accompanying my mother for shopping.  It
was night, hot -all the coastal stuff. We stopped to buy something in a lone
street when I heard something strange: a woman -singing?- without music.  It
came from a shop 150 mts. afar, and I liked it, though I couldn't even hear
clearly, less understand the lyrics (I was even less knowledgeable in English
those days) and I didn't tought of going and asking, so I literally made up
some verses that resembled the tune so I wouldn't forget it. I never heard
the song again, and no one could tell what it was -it seems Suzanne doesn't
have many fans here-.
<p>
About two years ago, just before I moved again, I went to vacation in Mexico
to see my family. I visited a cousin, and I found him complaining about a CD
he just got as pay for a debt. It was a selection, and I grabbed it. My
musical tastes are restrictive -I have about 40 CD's for the same four o five
people, including Suzanne- but he asked me if I wanted to hear something. I
perused the CD -being a selection it would be easier to find something known
to me- and ran across a Suzanne Vega, singing Tom's Diner. Both the name and
the title sounded interesting; I specially liked "Suzanne Vega", though I
never heard of her or the song. So we heard it. It was a remix, but I
recognized it inmediately:  15 minutes later I was hearing Solitude Standing,
and it took me a year to stop -just after buying "Suzanne Vega".
(It took me so long because I had to go to Tampico again and there 
wasn't a single CD of Suzanne.) 
<p>
My favorite song: There are about 10 draws, but if forced, I would choose 
                  "In Liverpool".
<p>
The only song I DON'T like: Institution Green. Don't like the singing, 
                            lyrics and music. I still wonder why.
<p>
Thanks for your attention.

i suppose in a way i don't belong with all the rest of you, as i just
recently became a suzanne fanne, but please forgive me...i was four when
her first album came out in '85. so anyway...
the first time i heard suzanne was when a friend of mine copied the "dead
man walking" soundtrack for me because she thought i would be interested
in the eddie vedder/nusrat fateh ali khan duet. i did like it, but what
really caught me was suzanne vega (woman on the tier [i'll see you
through]). absolutely honestly, the main reason i liked her right away was
the industrial beat that reminded me of nine inch nails, one of my other
favorite artists. her voice was amazing to me, as i'm used to singers who
have to scream to get the point across. with suzanne.....i don't
know...it's just very new and different to me. i looked around a little
for her CD, but i live in a town of 2500 people in the deep south where
the majority of the people voted alan jackson "artist of the year".
anyway...couldn't find much. so....i went online to look around and by
god, turns out suzanne isn't the beginning musician i thought her to be.
i'm just sorry i didn't get to know her earlier. but no regrets...i'll
just accept the situation and get her new CD asap...  nice talking with
(at?) you.

Hi & greetings from Spain
<p>
My name is Angel and I've just joined the list. I'm 26, work as a 
journalist and live in Valencia, beside the Mediterranian sea. I've been 
a fan of Suzanne since 1987, the year when "Luka" was a real big hit 
down here. The truth is that, after nearly four years without a single 
solitary piece of news about Suzanne, I was glad to find your list & the 
impressive veganet site, and to know about her new releases (haven't 
heard "Caramel" yet, though)... Anyway, I was leafing through the May 
issue of "Rolling Stone" and came accross this little note about 
Suzanne, alongside a photograph of her and the actress Janeane Garofalo:
<p>
>Motherhood has its ups and downs. Four years have passed since SV made <br>
>an album (a new one is due out this summer), but she's had more <br>
>pressing concerns. "For a while, singing was the only thing that would <br>
>get Ruby [her toddler] to sleep," says VEga. "I'm a better singer as a <br>
>result." At the North Hollywood video shoot for her song "Caramel", on <br>
>"The Truth About Cats and Dogs" soundtrack, the film's star Janeane <br>
>Garofalo was on hand to welcome her back. Vega returned the favor, <br>
>calling Garofalo "really down-to-earth and sweet".<br>
<p>
Y esto es todo, amigos.

Hi !

I'm a portuguese Suzanne Vega fan, and I'm delighted that I now have
internet access at home. The S.Vega site was, of course, one of the first to browse
and I was really happy to know about Suze's upcoming album, which I was expecting a long time ago.
I was also please to read the "Impressions of Portugal" article which is an interesting and really acurate
description of Lisbon, the capital of my country. <p>
Well, I just hope you people keep up the good work with this site, and I'm sure I'll visit it often.

 hi,
 <P>
 as this is my first post here I'd better tell you something about me.
 I'm Piers Kent, working in University College London until september when I
 change to being a student here.<BR>
 The first song I heard was Marlene when it was getting some good airplay here
 in britain (many years ago now). The first album I got was Solitude Standing,
 then Suzanne Vega, next 99.9 and finally Days of Open Hand.
 As for live performances... just the one from the 99.9 tour in Cardiff.
 <P>
 OK, I'll step back into lurk mode for the mo' and try to get the feel for this
 group. Looks like a good mix of countries too... (I see a snowdog@cs.mcgill.ca

 <P>
 Well, to provide a little bit of demographics for new subscribers, here's one "lurker's profile"...
 <P>
 I'm a regular middle-cass late-boomer who added SV to my favorites list when I heard "Marlena
 on the Wall". I was at that time a member of a pop band that was more or less trying to make a
 dent around NYC - our high point was probably the Brian Wilson tribute at Folk City. We got to
 share amps with some real popmeisters - smithereens, m. crenshaw, ben vaughan, dBs, etc....
 <P>
 But anyway... II was also trying to go to school and put down roots, so I was soon to be an
 ex-musician. But still a pretty serious music listener. At the time I was a major Elvis Costello,
 P furs, Police, Pretenders and XTC fan, plus had appreciation for crusty old folkie stuff like L.
 cohen, nick drake and Incredible String band.
 <P>
 I was pretty well enchanted by the Suze-waif and have been all along. Personal takes:
 <P>
 I think that the "queen and soldier" tune is a little hokey. Seems awful teenage.
 <P>
 Fave album: Solitude Standing but I like them all.
 Fave  tunes would be "night vision", "solitude standing", "ironbound"  and "in liverpool". 
 <P>
 I can tell from "In Liverpool" that Suzanne is a bit of a Chrissie Hynde fan since the feel of that
 song is very much in sympathy with "Pretenders II", one of my other fave albums.

Hi, I am not new to the list but I thought it was
time to jump out of the shadows and introduce
myself.  I'm 27 years old and I live in
Christchurch New Zealand.  I have been a fan
of Suzanne since I heard "Luka" and
consequently purchased "Solitude Standing".  I
also have SV, Live in London, Days... and 99.9
and San Juan Capistrano (thanks Paul).
<P>
My favourite songs (difficult choice) would be
Ironbound, Straight Lines, The Queen and the
Soldier, Luka, Room off the Street (Cuba), and
Blood Makes Noise.
<P>
I was originally drawn in by Suzanne's lyrics
and the images she created.  I felt compelled to
understand the songs and what was behind
them, to understand Suzanne.  The element of
mystery has always been important to me.  The
multiple meaning and levels of the lyrics make
them very personal to everyone.  
<P>
I have always wanted to understand people and
the environment that affects them.  Suzanne
seems to give glimpses of herself and other
people in her songs that intrigue me.
<P>
Now I have broken my silence hopefully I will
start to participate a little more, OK Rob?

 hi all!<BR>
 for a while i thought i wasn't subscribed because no one was posting, but 
 i'm sure of it now. :) well, i first started liking Suzanne's music when 
 i heard the song Luka on the radio and then on a music video channel. i 
 just started getting into acoustic guitar and female artists, so this was 
 good. i was young though. i think maybe 10? or younger? well, i'm 18 now 
 so if anyone know when it was released..<BR>
 i never bought one of her albums until i found a vinyl copy of Solitude 
 Standing. then i bought 99.9F on cd. i still want to get Days... and Book 
 of Dreams.. but i can't really find them anywhere.<BR>
 but, Suzanne was (and is) an inspiration in my own music. i'm a singer 
 songwriter too. it's kind of what i want to do ... for a living. i'm 
 pursuing it so something should happen!<BR>
 oh, and why i posted.. i saw a show on the Women's Television Network 
 here in Canada a while back and the had this whole half hour think on 
 Suzanne. it was basically her and this other guy.. i don't know his name, 
 but one of his eyebrows always seemed to be "up". they talked about her 
 music.  does this have anything to do with that D.A. Pennebaker thing? 
 well, i doubt it, but it could be a mini-documentary.<BR>
 thanks all for letting me write all this on my first post. <BR>

 Hi everyone...
 <P>
 My name is Jen.  This is my first post to this list, so if it's a little
 scary, please try to write that off as first-post-jitters.  :)  I've been
 reading Undertow for quite awhile now, but I was reluctant to jump into the
 conversation for a few reasons.  One being that until yesterday, I didn't
 even have all of Ms. Vega's albums (oh, by the way, that reminds me of
 something -- I usually call people Ms. and Miss whatever...is that kosher
 here?  I don't want to offend anyone or anything <smile>).  A dear friend of
 mine found Days Of Open Hand for me -- can you believe that?  I searched ALL
 over the place and NEVER could find it.  Anyway, that's not the point?  What
 was I saying?  (I have a tendency to go off on tangents at any time, so be
 warned.)  I alwso got the feeling that...hmmm...off-topic conversation isn't
 as welcome here as it is on, say, the Sarah McLachlan list, which I'm also a
 member of.  And since I've got that dear little problem with tangents, I
 didn't want people to be mad at me.  But, I've decided that the time has come
 to hop out of the corner and run screaming in to the land of Suzanne.  Wheee!
  I know you're excited.  :)
 <P>
 This post is getting long, so I'll just cut straight to the real reason I'm
 posting (well, the reason besides that I wanted to introduce myself).  A
 friend of mine -- the one who bought my Days Of Open Hand, acutally -- is
 wondering about a Suzanne song called Left Of Center.  He heard it played a
 LOT on the radio in the early 90s, 1990-1991, and never could find it.
  Finally, he looked it up in the little yellow book that every record store
 has, and it's listed as being on the album Suzanne Vega -- which it's not, as
 far as our copies of it go -- and on the soundtrack for Pretty In Pink.  So
 he and I were wondering what the deal is.  Why would they play a song from
 the mid-80s in heavy rotation five or so years after it came out?  Is it on
 another soundtrack?  And why is it listed as being on Suzanne Vega?
 <P>
 Thanks everyone for reading this, and I look forward to hearing from you!

 Hi ... I'm new to Undertow.  My name is Suzanne.  (That's my actual mom-given
 name.  I'm not a really weird and devoted groupee or anything.)  My husband
 is in law school and I am a writer, and we're pretty normal, I'd say.  The
 big excitement around here today was the special Olympic edition of Lucky
 Charms we had for breakfast.
 <P>
 I have also often wondered why there don't seem to be any videos available
 for purchase of Suzanne performing.  I also saw that Austin City Limits and
 taped it awhile ago, and she was so very funny and personable, I just loved
 it.  And while I was working in Poland I saw a concert on t.v. out of England
 they televised, where she was playing in an old church that is now a place
 for bands (it is probably famous and you all know it, but it was a new thing
 to me) but all the speaking was dubbed over in Polish and I was still a
 little wobbly in it at that point, so I never really got an idea of what she
 was like.  It is nice that she doesn't suffer from over-exposure, but since I
 have never made it to a live concert, I wouldn't mind being able to get a
 video.

Hello everyone,
<P>
I'm Erik Sinno, and I'm new on this mailing list. In fact, I heard a lot
about all of you, because one of my friend is David Algranti who made me
discover Suzanne Vega and this mailing list (I made him discover the
Internet, but I don't have it at home). As I'm writing from my mum's job
and computer the name "Helena Sinno" may appear on your screen (real user's
namr), it corresponds to me, Erik Sinno (anyway I'll always sign).
<P>
Just a little bit about me : I'm a French student in physics, living near
Paris, listening a lot at SV's music. I am a big fan of Mike Oldfield but I
like listening to all sorts of music. I love reading all sorts of books,
especially anglo-saxon literature, and comics like Calvin and Hobbes or Fox
Trot which I have problems to find in France.
<P>
I don't know a lot of SV's music, but David Algranti knows a lot and he
told me a lot. So I'll try to follow the conversation, but as I could see
their are lots of off-topic discussion which can be interesting.
<P>
Thanks for reading and see you soon.

Erik.

Okay, hello all!  While I'm new under this e-address, I'd previously posted
under joeys@wellsfargo.com, but was getting too messages at work, so
I subscribed through the ISP I use at home.
<P>
Became a fan of SV just before the second album: a friend loved the first
album and played a few tracks, at which point I got hooked.  When I took
a look at the album cover I realized I'd seen flyers of this person the first
time I vacationed in New York in the mid-80's.  I mentioned before that
I've sung SV's songs for friends and at science fiction conventions, and 
her songs have influenced some of my own songwriting.  I'm awaiting "Nine
Objects . . ." like everyone else, though a lot of my non-work time of late
has been spent rehearsing with a gay male a cappella quintet I joined
earlier this year (the person who started the group, Aurelio Font, is a former
member of a similar group, The Flirtations).  Thanks to everyone who
commented on the "off-topic" family values subject.

Haven't seen any multiple part versions of any SV songs, but a few
years ago I was working on an SATB version of "Tired of Sleeping" and
a multi-voice arrangement of "Gypsy."  Sadly, both have been put aside
for now in favor of other projects.

Hi I`m Mike(17) and I`ve listened to Suzanne Vega for a month for real 
(buying her album) although I loved their songs much before...
I have only Solitude Standing album and I`d like someone to consell
me which to buy next ( I wish I bought 2nd great album,but which).
I think I will buy it during my staying in London because I had 
problems with finding Suzanne`s albums here...
 The next thing I`d like to know are facts about Suazanne Vega-
how old she is, is she married..etc. And of couse I`d like to
know where to find her pics from I-net`s ftp site..
if anyone has a pic of her scanned I`d veery glad to receive it....
Thanks In Advance<BR>
Mike
