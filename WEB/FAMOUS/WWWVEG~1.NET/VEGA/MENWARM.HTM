Subj:	men in a war<br>
Date:	97-01-09 10:12:17 EST<br>
From:	JJENIK@aol.com<br>
<p>
in bruce's very careful and quite excellent selection of suzanne's songs, he
triggered an interpretation i had regarding men in a war. i've read often,
and believe that this song is mainly about posttraumatic stress, particularly
that of participants in war. but the last stanza (and she lay on her back/she
made sure she was hid/ ...) to me, has always  been a woman giving
birth/having an abortion or prostituting herself. 
<p>
another form of posttraumatic stress, I guess. Has anyone else had this
interpretation? 
<p>
thanks.

<p>
Not exactly, but close!  I've never seen this as an anti-war song or
even a study of those injured/affected by war.  I always thought the
"men in a war/if they've lost a limb" beginning was an analogy, or a set
up.  When we see someone who's lost a limb, often the reaction is
'that's so sad ... but he has to get on with his life.'
<p>
For me, the song uses this frame to help us think differently about ways
we have be injured, emotionally more than physically (though a physical
act could lead to this emotional trauma).  We have lost things as well
("a piece of your eyesight/or maybe your vision"), but our natural
defenses cope for this loss ("A piece of the scan/gets filled in by
hand") and we should continue on without regret ("so you just make do
with/whatever you've got") ... otherwise we will stagnate and perhaps
deteriorate ("you don't feel your will/you can't find your gut").
<p>
I've personally always found this song quite inspiring for its strong
anti-regret stance.

In response to jocelyn's thoughts on Men in a War....
<p>
Those lines in Men in aWar have jumped out at me before but I had 
always thought of them (without deliberately  drifting into potentially 
delicate areas) as a very succinct description of masturbation.
'she made sure she was hid'- since no-one wants to get caught 
masturbating,
 'not feeling the thing that she did '- you're usually 
pretending/wishing that it was someone else doing it so she 
wasn't feeling that SHE did it.
<p>
Having said that, in a live recording I heard of the song; Suzanne 
introduces it as a song about violence and someone in the audince 
suggested that it's also about sex and replied snappily that it isn't 
so maybe I'm wrong.
<p>
But I always thought that this fits in well with the rest of the 
song's talk of disjointedness and 'a piece of the scan getting filled 
in'; so we make up for ourselves what isn't there when we want it to 
be. 
I hope I used enough words there to show that I wasn't automatically 
reducing everything to sex :-)

Excuse me ??????????????????????????????????????<br>
Oh boy...<br>
Is this some kind of joke ??<br>
<p>
One of these days I was taking a look at what Undertow was about "since the
beginning" - at least before August ... and I found some weird things like
about a Suzanne song that "could possibily" be connected to pedophilia.....
<p>
I wonder how one can connect any of Suzanne's song with it !
<p>
>I hope I used enough words there to show that I wasn't automatically <br>

<p>
Oh Yeah... I'd never dream of it, definitely !
<p>
I was thinking how to introduce the subject "sex" on Suzanne songs but now I
began to have second thoughts about it...

<p>
Well I'm sure it's possible to make that interpretation too, but the real 
meaning
of the song is so clear that it just can't be missed. Unlike the case with most
of the other songs on that album.
<p>
Men in a war<br>
If they've lost a limb<br>
Still feel that limb<br>
As they did before<br>
<p>
I know how it is<br>
When something is gone<br>
<p>
If your nerve is cut<br>
If you're kept on the stretch<br>
You don't feel you will<br>
You can't find your gut<br>
<p>
The song is about losing things (anything) that are important to you. The
losses in the song are only physical. But they are used as a metaphor
for all kinds of losses.
<p>
The interesting thing is that each of the persons in the song seems to still
have what the other doesn't. A little bit of irony.

Subj:	two thoughts<br>
Date:	97-01-11 23:54:07 EST<br>
From:	wchase@silcom.com (Will Keightley)<br>
<p>
Hello, folks...
<p>
Just a couple thoughts on some recent threads in our electronic 
"tapestry":
<p>
Funny thing, I guess I never really knew what the lyric really was in 
"Men in a War" until now. I allus thought the line went,
<p>
She lay on her back<br>
She was sure she was _hit_<br>
She was mute and staring<br>
Not feeling _a_ thing...<br>
<p>
It made sense to me; I was caught up in the war metaphor. Often 
when one is severely wounded, it takes a while for the realization to 
sink in--sort of an immediate, short-lived denial that one's been 
shot, or stabbed, or maimed. Sometimes this denial can take on 
physiological dimensions, or settle back and encouch itself in 
the psyche. I imagined the emotional wound caused by the end of a 
relationship. The shock, the numbness, the lingering sensations of 
emotion emanating from a love that is now gone.
<p>
But that was then. Now, as I read the lyrics I feel somewhat foolish. 
My new impression is that the last verse has something to do 
with...abortion perhaps? I find the masturbation idea intriguing as 
well, merely because sometimes it's the wackiest interpretations 
that ring the truest for me. I liked my old interpretation. It made 
the song extra dynamic for me. Strange what a presumptuous ear and 
six years of laziness will do to one's perceptions! I think I'll 
still sing it my way (at top volume in my car, idling at stop lights 
under the curious gazes of drivers around me)
<p>
also...<br>
Chris Gerby posted his tracklist for his SV tape. I thought that was 
interesting. I happen to be extremely precise when I make audio 
tapes. There are only certain songs which work as "final cuts" on a 
compilation tape. I have to say that regardless of the previous 85 
minutes you've got assembled, Chris, your choice of "Pilgrimage" as 
the final track is right on the money. Of all of her songs, it's got 
the most graceful build and the most nerve-tingling finish. It's the 
best way to round out any SV session--my choice for final encore in 
every live performance. The whole "Days" album is perfect, easily my 
favorite of the whole discography (and I discovered them in 
chronological order!), but "Pilgrimage" especially so. 
<p>
That's all I wanted to say this time. Some day I'll tell you a story 
about "Small Blue Thing"

Well sorry Guida, but incest IS pedophilia and Suzanne recently made it
clear that she wrote Bad Wisdom thinking about incest.

<p>
Well, I don't want any miss understandings !
Pedophilia and Incest are two different words with obviously two different
meanings.
<p>
Sorry but as I learned it Incest ISN'T pedophilia.<br>
There's a big range of incestous relationships, in fact if I flirted or fell
in love with a close family member, that would be incest. It can be a
relation that both two people agree with, and it can be a relationship that
one is "forced to accept" it ! 
Because most of the times, and I should say, unfortunately a LOt of them,
the mother goes along with the "father's game".Because they are still family
it's not an easy thing to deal with. And I think that this was what Suzanne
was meaning. 
<p>
Pedophilia as you might know is when loony/freak grownups  want to have sex
or abuse sexually (sexually molest) children. Does the word Belgium ring a bell
for you ???<p>
The children were sexually abused and then killed. And they were NOT family !
<p>
And the situation is completly different.
<p>
Because you can frame a freak or prevert that stoled your child away, but if
this happens among the family most of the times the mothers don't want to
call the Police 'cause they know that her husband is going to beat her ! So
you kind of have to live with it.<p>
I happen to know something similar two streets below where I live.
<p>
So..... it's not the same thing !
