<title>China Doll</title>

<h3><i>China Doll</i></h3>

<pre>
A pistol shot at five o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
"No, I won't tell you a thing

"Yesterday I begged you
before I hit the ground -
all I leave behind me 
is only what I found

"If you can abide it 
let the hurdy-gurdy play -
Stranger ones have come by here
before they flew away

"I will not condemn you
nor yet would I deny...."
I would ask the same of you
but failing will not die....

Take up your china doll
it's only fractured -
and just a little nervous
from the fall
