Subj:	Ich bin mit der Ruckstromung befreundet!<br>
Date:	97-02-10 01:48:22 EST<br>
From:	bobking@gate.net (Can't eat no 'much obliges')<br>
<p>
So about a week ago I'm cruising home from work, filled with my usual
existential angst and rage, and decide to cool off by browsing the
one decent independent record store I've found so far in West Palm
Beach. It's one of those stores where you have a much better time if
you just browse with no fixed idea of what you're searching for, and
in fact as I'm thumbing through the "alternative" vinyl section, I
spy ...

<p>... could it be? ...
<p>
Yes!
<p>
A tan-yellow LP sleeve, with in large grey and then black letters the 
words: SUZANNE VEGA.
<p>
It's the first album, and the first time I can recall seeing the LP
version since the day I bought the cassette on Sept. 27, 1985, in
the now-defunct Record Bar in State College, Pa. Though I treasure
the tape beyond all reckoning, I remembered the album being neat
because it had a different photo of her on the back (by Matthew
Vega!) with the lyrics to "Cracking," and I was later sorry that I
didn't get that version too when I had the chance.
<p>
Oddly, this copy seemed to be in near-mint condition. I'm not sure 
how old this is, but it says "Printed in West Germany," which seems 
to put it back at least to 1990. (The catalog # is A&M 395 072-1 for 
those keeping track of the discography.) It also says "Distribution 
Polydor," which I believe is part of the Polygram empire, but it 
still may have been from before Polygram bought A&M.
<p>
And what's really priceless is the lyric sheet -- in French, German
and Italian. So "Mosse da Cavaliere" (Knight Moves) takes on a
certain Dantean quality, with all those rhyming triplets ("Guarda
mentre la regina/con una mossa falsa/si trasforma in pedina"), while
Marlene becomes almost Wagnerian: ("Marlene sieht von der Wand aus
zu/Tochter aus Elysium" ... OK, just kidding about that last part). 
<p>
However, I know enough French to realize that these are probably all
pretty rudimentary translations, reminiscent of my recent
computerized experiments with Spanish. For instance:
<p>
"Ca n'arrive qu'une fois<br>
Mais ca arrive<br>
Souvent"<br>
<p>
"It only happens one time<br>
But it happens<br>
often"<br>
<p>
Or how about:
<p>
"Aujourd'hui je suis<br>
Toute petite et toute bleue."<br>
<p>
Which as far as I can figure out translates to:
<p>
"Today I am<br>
really little and really blue."<br>
<p>
So I hope these translations are for comprehension only, not for 
singing.
<p>
Anyway, all this for $6.
<p>
By far, the best part was taking it home and listening to it. I've
never been one of those "vinyl is best" folks, but a
before-now-unplayed LP on a decent stereo sounds *vastly* better
than a cassette tape that's been played about 137,219 times over 11
years, especially when you're used to listening to it in your car.
Her voice is crystal-clear, I can make out the overdubs, the
instruments are actually distinguishable from each other ... makes
me think I should upgrade Solitude and Days to CD or something.
(Suzanne, those royalty checks will be in the mail soon).
<p>
This is all pretty pointless, but I'm just overjoyed with my find and 
had to share it and urge everyone else out there to keep your eyes 
peeled. By the way, anyone have any ideas why this LP would still be 
floating around in the record stores after all these years? It wasn't 
in the used section.
<p>
Oh, and my other discovery was the 4-CD box set of Laurie Anderson's
_United States Live_, about which the fairest thing to say is
probably ... well, I wouldn't *start* my collection with this one.
However, I challenge anyone else to find a context for the line
"Today I had to take a test in a Dairy Queen on another planet."

Hey Bob-a-ree-bop, 
<p>
Congratulations on your recent find.  The old-cassette-to-new-vinyl-or-CD
phenomenon can be pretty startling, as I found out when I replaced my tape
with a CD copy of Sting's "Dream of the Blue Turtles" and found out the
indistinguishable shout at the beginning of the title tune was one of the
musicians yelling "Wait!  Wait!  What key is this in? What key is this in?"
<p>
Does the subject line of this e-mail translate to "I am with the Undertow
befriended"?  VERY serious, as well as very mechanical... just doesn't have
the same vibe as "I am friend to the undertow."
<p>

<p>
You seem to have stumbled onto a rarity, the record store that does not chuck
all of its old stock after a few years.  Either this is due to sheer laziness
on the part of the owner or they purposely want to have rare recordings.
 <p>
 <<However, I challenge anyone else to find a context for the line
 "Today I had to take a test in a Dairy Queen on another planet.">>
<p>
Sure, how about this context -- the fourth book of Douglas Adams's
Hitchihiker's Trilogy, otherwise known as "The Restaurant At The End of the
Universe"?  It would seem to be a similar setting.
<p>
--U212, clearly in need of some sleep...

P.S.  I like your tag line, "Can't eat no 'much obliges'".  Isn't that the
eternal cry of the freelancer?!!

<p>
Congrats on your find - I don't "do vinyl" myself, but it sounds like
this one would be worthwhile just to look at.  And sadly, I can't recall
the exact date I purchased "Suzanne Vega" - around summer '86....  :)
<p>
>I remembered the album being neat<br>

<p>
If you want more cool early photos, check out the "Left of Center" CD
single from 1986, with pics of Suzanne on various NYC streets.  There
are also two good pictures on the "Solitude Standing" CD single.  
<p>
>I should upgrade Solitude and Days to CD or something.
<p>
By all means!  I always just assume that people are listening on CD
these days.  Your tapes and/or vinyl copies aren't worn out yet?  ;)

<p>
Could be just a leftover or something?  It does seem pretty unusual...
You're right though - gotta keep on the lookout.  I ran across a "Book
of Dreams" promo single from 1990 recently - used, but in good shape.
However, expect to pay quite a bit more than $6 for used CD singles!

<p>
Well, maybe it's not the kind of record you play *every day* (I guess I
haven't played mine in a couple of years), but it's one of the most
mesmerizing recordings I've ever heard. There's a book that goes with it too
(but you'll have to buy it separately) -- remember, Laurie Anderson is
performance art, not music in the ordinary sense.
<p>
Laurie Anderson has quite a few things in common with Suzanne, although
she's also very different in many respects. They both challenge your
ordinary points of views, makes you see things clearer. If you get the
chance to see her live -- do it!

Among those things they have in common is that they both went to Barnard
College in New York City and performed at the college's centennial
celebration at Carnegie Hall.  I second Hugo on going to see Laurie Anderson
live, she puts on very interesting multimedia shows.

<p>
Hey, I'm not Laurie-bashing at all; _Big Science_ happens to be the very
first album I ever bought. And there are all sorts of moments in _United
States_ that I'm enjoying immensely. However, it's probably not the best
intro to her for someone who doesn't know what she's about. It's a huge
hodgepodge of stuff over four CDs, some of which obviously was meant to
work more on a visual level (which you can't see) than musically. My
question while listening to it is "How the hell did she get away with
this?" 
<p>
I'd say _Big Science_ or _Mister Heartbreak_ are much better at offering
concise distillations of what she was doing in the early '80s, though
neither one contains, say, her Dolly Parton impersonation.  If you're
already a fan, of course, it's great to be able to hear the whole show the
way audiences experienced it back then. Too bad CD-ROMs weren't around
then. 
<p>
You're absolutely right about the similarities with Suzanne, especially in
Suzanne's more spoken-word moments ("It's a one-time thing ..."). My
initial reaction after listening to Suzanne's first album was "kind of a
folk-singing Laurie Anderson." (This was before Laurie started singing; 
she sounds nothing like SuzyV when she does.) There's also a similarity in
their sometimes wry observations, though Laurie's tended to be more
overtly cerebral.
<p>
The other link, of course, is that Laurie is living with Suzanne's great
musical role model, Lou Reed, who just dedicated his most recent album to
her (meaning Laurie, not Suzanne).

I suppose so, but I don't know a whole lot of German. I know the
verb goes at the end, and "freund" means friend, and "Ich bin" is
familiar from JFK in West Berlin. It does sound very wooden. Then
again, Suzanne's wording is kind of odd, too.

<p>
I think the latter. The place is literally stacked floor to ceiling
with boxes of old LPs, ranging from Perry Como to the Grassy Knoll
Gunmen. I haven't dug through more than a fraction of it, though
most of it seems to be stuff like old Uriah Heap and Pure Prairie
League records from the '70s. There's also this odd time lag -- they
have almost nothing that's current, but lots of things you would
have expected to have vanished from the shelves four years ago. I 
think I'll be back.
<p>
I am wondering if they've actually had Suzanne's record lying around 
for 11 years. When I walked out the clerk probably said "God, I never 
thought we'd unload that thing." Lucky for me, anyway.

Hi Bob,
<p>
Seems what you found is an import of the 'official' German Suzanne Vega album, at 
least that's what I thought it is, since I bought it in '87, together with "Solitude".
My copy has the same catalog number and I never saw it later in a shop. I kept it as a 
treasure, just played tape copies and lost them in car radios producing tape salad. 
(You're very lucky with your year-old original or your car must be a Cadillac :-)
<p>
On the sleeve there's a b/w picture of Suzanne openly looking into your eye, with the 
wind in her hair or couldn't find the comb in the morning. It's looks very fresh, like a 
cold blue February back-in-the-city morning; I don't miss no green apple.
<p>
She's wearing a black suit, probably the same as on the back side photo.
I love that picture! Sometimes it made me dream to walk those cobble-stone
New York streets with her one afternoon. And it still does. 
<p>
On the inner sleeve I see Suzanne's very young face reflected in a small oval mirror, 
painting her eyelid in the light of a single bulb with its connection cable above the 
white chalked wall, the kind to find in cheap apartments.
It has all the lyrics and the A&M logo with the record number.
<p>
The lyrics sheet: I found translations included in all 5 albums except 99.9F and the 
German ones are all, as you put it politely, >for comprehension only, not for singing<. 
As an exception, I like the Small Blue Thing lines:
<p>
"Mit den Knien an meinem Mund \ bin ich vollkommen rund."
<p>
The sheet then inspired me to try to keep the rhythm, even if it has a slightly different 
meaning. 
<p>
I am friend to the undertow<br>
I take you in, I don't let go<br>
And now I have you<br>
<p>
Der Strudel ist mir wohlvertraut<br>
Wirst angezogen, eingesaugt<br>
Jetzt hab ich dich<br>
<p>
There's a cemetery in Vienna, close to the Danube, for all the people who chose the 
river as their last bed and didn't flow down beyond that point, because of the undertow 
there. Until the 1930s a man was employed to take them out and give them a decent 
burial. In the 80s as an old man he saved it from being "integrated" into an industrial 
estate. He told some stories in a radio documentary. Many of the people there have no 
names and known relatives, but two of them are lovers who couldn't get together in 
life.
<p>
I believe right now if I could<br>
I would swallow you whole<br>
I would leave only bone and teeth<br>
We could see what was underneath<br>
And we would be free then...<br><p>

<p>
I personally love that line from the song.  My favourite line from the
first album -- it fits the melody perfectly and is a great subtle hook.
If I had to rephrase it, however, I might do something like this:
<p>
"Let me into the undertow"
<p>
"Saw my face with the undertow"
<p>
"I befriended the undertow"
<p>
The original is really the evocative phrasing.  Simple, gets the idea
across.  Plus it's tough to rewrite lyrics to a song you've already had a
preconception on.

Hmmmm....  Hadn't thought of that, but didn't Suzanne major in English
at Barnard?  So it's possible, I guess.  :)
<p>

<p>
I always read this line to mean "I am *similar* to the Undertow."  How is
the narrator like an undertow? -  "I take you in, I don't let go."  Perhaps
the word "friend" is used here in the sense of "kindred spirit."  She wants
to be like this undertow current that wears down, erodes "sand against the
stone, against the shoreline."  The process liberates "what was underneath,"
the *essence* - bones, teeth, the "edge of a knife," the "point of a needle."
Just my thoughts on it.

<p>
Hi all!
<p>
In case you're interested.
<p>
"Ich bin mit der Rueckstroemung befreundet!"  means:
<p>
"I am a friend _with_ the undertow"
<p>
Doesn't befriend mean to help someone or to care about him
or is it just another way of saying to be a friend?
And "to be similar to the undertow" would read in German:
<p>
"Ich bin der Rueckstroemung aehnlich"<br>
"Ich gleiche der Rueckstroemung"<br>
"Ich bin wie die Rueckstroemung"<br>
<p>
Those might get the original meaning better.
By the way, other possible translations for undertow would be
Sog, Strudel, Unterstroemung.
So go ahead and make your choice ;)

<p>
It was in a replay of a radio feature played last November on 'Toten-
sonntag' / 'Remembering Sunday' and unfortunately I didn't tape it.
If I remember well, it was produced by a Vienna radio station around 
1988, I think.
<p>
I try to get more information, but be prepared to wait weeks or months 
for results. The place itself is called 'Der Friedhof der Namenlosen' /
'The Garden of the Nameless' and you find it on the map on the SE edge of the 
city, near where the 'Donau-Oder-Canal' is leading into the Danube, very 
close to the Albern freight train station. 
<p>
***<br>
After World War I, with the seizure of the even-then long-outdated 
Danube monarchy, Vienna lost almost all of her eastern hinterland but 
gained many of its former inhabitants. Maybe it was that multicultural 
but to a large extent backwards-looking society that made her people 
develop a more relaxed, natural relationship toward death and the somber 
tones of life going with it. Whereas most modern industrial, forward-
looking societies try to ban the Thin Man from their daily presence, 
keeping him as something not to speak about, Viennese seemed to be less 
fearful, sometimes even flirting with him as a kind of neighbor. And if 
not, even as a stranger, he's tolerated in the cafe, somewhere at the
table in the corner. 
<p>
>From where he inspires the work of local artists, writers and songwriters; 
together with his sister Time. Where everything must be new and is old a 
day later, she's allowed to live in isolated pockets of the past, to
leave her tiny traces, like in old forgotten graveyards. 
<p>
Suzanne comes from a very different environment. She faces the Thin 
Man in a less 'Viennese' way. He is not her friend, but she is not
afraid of feeling him nearby sometimes. She listens to his whispers (almost as to 
the disturbed next-seat neighbor in the tube), she refuses to speak to
him directly (instead she speaks to us, the other passengers, of him in the
third person): she keeps the distance.
<p>
Bruce in his 'The Essential Suzanne Vega' essay says:<br>
>This song--with its hip beat, electric piano, and cool muted trumpets--<br>
>paints a portrait of the Grim Reaper himself and does so with a witty, <br>
>playful, and light touch. Again, it's hard to find many other pop music <br>
>composers who would even think of constructing a song around such a <br>
>concept.<br>
<p>
In Goethe's Faust, Mephisto first comes in as a black poodle, then he 
variedly changes his appearance. Not only HE is a person, he is the
ghost who negates life. He is not good, but is he evil? Mephisto has a lot of 
humor, he is very intelligent. In the end he is sent by the 'Old Man'. 
Although he thinks he's clever enough to trick him off, he has to play
his role in the world theater.
<p>
Suzanne's Thin Man<br>
He closely adapts to the environment. "Take a walk on the wild side" -- 
in New York it seems he has a cool Lou Reed kind of voice. 
<p>
To me 'Thin Man' is a song where "the feel" (Thanks, Christopher) 
outweighs the words. She's singing 'blue notes'? And I feel like the
black keys. All in between all defined feelings.
<p>
[Exactly -- this is a sort of classic blues, where there's a shift from the major key to the minor key achieved by singing the blue notes. - Ed.]
<p>
If Solitude were a person, she would be the ageless woman "in the slant 
of the late afternoon". But if Death were one, what kind of character is 
he? Is he the one that always reminds us what we have to lose and 
ultimately will lose? What would he think of himself? And if God is not 
a person, can Death be one?
<p>
I'm listening to the song over and over again.
