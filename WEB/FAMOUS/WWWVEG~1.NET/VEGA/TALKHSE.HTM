Hi all,
<p>
I'm back from New York and did I have a great time.  I could linger here and
tell you all the things I did, but I know you want to hear about the concert.
<p>
OK
<p>
We drive 3 hours out to the Hamptons--worth every minute--and get to this
place that basically looks like any small bar.  VERY SMALL!! They said it
seated 100 people, but that's only because people had to sit really really
close together in order to fit.  Worth it though.
<p>
We get there, and things don't go so well at first.  The guys at the door
aren't very helpful and my friend and I think we have to stand during the
entire concert.  Then, my friend remembers that the nice lady on the phone
said we would have a table.  I remind the guy at the door about this and he
checks the list.  Sure enough, we're on it. He takes us to our seats--front
row center.  I was less than two feet away from Suzanne--could have reached
out and grabbed a guitar pick off the mic--I didn't--was tempted--but I
didn't.
<p>
I was curious as to whether I'd see my fellow Undertower, Tim, at the concert
and as we talked about it, the guy next to me asked if I was on the mailing
list and introduced himself as Tim.  So, Tim and I sat next to each other in
the best seats in the house.
<p>
Play List:  OK--this is by memory and not in order, but I'll do my best:
<p>
Small Blue Thing<br>
Neighborhood Girls<br>
Marlene On The Wall<br>
Knight Moves<br>
The Queen and the Soldier<br>
Undertow<br>
Tom's Diner (as an encore--with audiance participation)<br>
Luka <br>
Wooden Horses (The Casper Hauser Song)<br>
Tired of Sleeping<br>
Rock in this Pocket<br>
In Liverpool<br>
Caramel ( a new song)(Very nice song!!!!)<br>
<p>
Forgive me if that isn't complete, I may have left something or a couple of
things off.
<p>
We were at the Thursday night show--yes, it was packed, but the thing was
that people would just walk up to the door and get in.  It wasn't sold out or
anything.  Could you imagine walking around, deciding to go into a bar, find
out there's a cover but it's Suzanne Vega--what luck!!!
<p>
She told lots of stories and was very witty!
<p>
She talked about Undertow and said she wanted to answer a couple of questions
about The Queen and the Soldier:
<p>
No, the queen is not wearing an IUD
and no, during the Oooooh ooooh oooh parts, they're aren't having sex.
<p>
Wish we all could have been there together.  Tim and I enjoyed it very much
and I suspect you'll be hearing his take on it soon.
<p>
Suzanne--<br>
It was a very nice evening and worth my entire trip to New York City!!!!
<p>
Wendy!

Eric wrote me a note for more particulars on my trip to NYC and the concert.
<p>
An overview of Wendy's trip to NYC
<p>
1st day--Saturday--Babysat in Conn. w/ my girlfriend (3 kids) we had fun.
<p>
2nd day--Sunday--Babysat half a day again.<br>
Then, off to Newport Conn. to the Tennis Hall of Fame to see the Chris Evert
wing as she was inducted last month.
<p>
3rd day--Monday--Schminky sitting again (Schminky is a made up word for
little kids)
<p>
4th day--Tuesday--Finally--NYC woohooo<br>
Took the train in and walked from Grand Central to NYU where I bought a
sweatshirt identical to one I'd had before that was stolen.
Then off to the new Starbucks on spring street where a friend of mine from CA
has been working for the summer
(Isn't this exciting folks)<br>
Then, tired of walking, we took the subway to catch the ferry to Statue of
Liberty and Ellis Island.  We had to rush, but it was fascinating.  I think
one could spend a whole day there.
<p>
5th day--Wednesday--off to P-Town--Province Town MA.--Gay--O--Rama. WooHOO!!!
<p>
6th day--Thursday--slept--then drove to the Hamptons for the Suzanne Vega
concert:
<p>
More detailed info about the concert:
<p>
Stories told:
She told the story about Millie and the girl that was going to beat her up
for calling her a Whore!<br>
She talked very briefly about Jerry Garcia--someone requested she sing
"Cassidy"--she said she really wanted to but because it's been so long since
she's sang it, she couldn't remember the chords and had wanted to sing China
Doll, but it just didn't work out.  <br>
She talked about the boy from Liverpool that she met at camp and wrote Gypsy
and In Liverpool for (Oh, and add Gypsy to the set list--sorry)<br>
And, I can't remember what else, but as I remember, I'll post.<br>
<p>
Back to my trip.
7th day--back to NYC<br>
Went to see Columbia and Barnard and ate at Tom's Reasturant.  Smells funny
in there but the food is good and cheap--you we're right Suzanne.
We had Grill Chesse Sandwiches and lots of French Fries w/ pickals--yum!!!
Walked the length of Central Park--watched all the joggers, byciclists, and
roller bladers<br>
Went to Time Square--and went WOW--so this is time square
Went up in the Empire State Building and went WOW--nice view
Went to the hot gay bar in town--supposedly and decided we were too tired to
pay the cover charge and stay to make it worth while--so we went to a bar
next doo where the bartender was snorting cocaine under the bar when he
thought no one was looking.
<p>
8th day<br>
slept in--got up and ate--slept some more--got up and ate
Then, off to the Bronx where my friend from CA had been staying for the
summer--my girlfriend dropped me off to spend a couple of days there because
she was leaving Sunday and I wasn't leaving till Monday.
<p>
9th day--Sunday<br>
Took a cheezy double decker bus tour around lower Manhattan.  Saw a lot--it
was worth it
Ate Pizza--finally--very greasy--yum!
Went to Hard Rock Cafe--I collect pins
<p>
Monday I went home.
<p>
I did everything I wanted to do and more and I had a great time!  I'd love to
go back!!
<p>
As far as Suzanne's comments about Undertow--she just explained that she was
part of this group and wanted to answer a couple of questions that came
up--(posted earlier)
<p>
"Caramel" was a song about someone thinking about a person they love.  Seemed
to have an addictive quality about it--like candy (caramel)
<p>
I felt an Elvis Costello influence in the melody--but maybe I'm wrong.  Also,
it was kind of like the Smithereans song she sang back up on--very
mellow--but very cool.  I liked it a lot--I liked how her voice sounded
singing it.  
<p>
What's so great about Suzanne's voice is that she sings (sometimes) about
these really harsh topics or sad topic but her voice is kind of a
whisper--not a scream--not angry--a whisper.  It's like she walks up to you
and in this whispery voice, in your ear, tells you this really sad, tramatic
story.  I think that adds impact to the lyrics that just being blantantly
angry can't do.
<p>
Caramel is a song of wanting, craving, another person more or less.  It's
very nice.
<p>

Dear Webmates;<br>

EDITOR'S NOTE : THIS IS A SNIPPET OF SUZANNE'S 9/7/95 UNDERTOW POST. (See "Correspondence" 
for the entire note.<br>
<p>

By the way -- my comments on the Steven Talkhouse gigs are:  I thought
Thursday's audience was great!  It was lively and excited -- Friday's was
good, too, but more subdued, more jaded?  I was tired also from the night
before.  I thought I was going to meet you, Wendy -- I thought you were the
woman at the soundcheck Friday.  But you came Thursday.  I should have known.
<p>
Enough for now.
<p>
Thanks again,<br>
yours truly,<br>
Suzanne Vega
