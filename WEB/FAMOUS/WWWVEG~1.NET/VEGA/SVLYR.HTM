<A NAME="cracking"><h2><b><i>Cracking</i></b></h2></a>       

 It's a one time thing<br>
It just happens<br>
A lot<br>
Walk with me<br>
And we will see<br>
What we have got<br>
Ah...<br>
<p>
My footsteps are ticking<br>
Like water dripping from a tree<br>
Walking a harline<br>
And stepping very carefully<br>
Ah...<br>
<p>
My heart is broken<br>
It is worn out at the knees<br>
Hearing muffled<br>
Seeing blind<br>
Soon it will hit the Deep Freeze<br>
<p>
And something is cracking<br>
I don't know where<br>
Ice on the sidewalk<br>
Brittle braches<br>
In the air<br>
<p>
The sun<br>
Is blinding<br>
Dizzy golden, dancing green<br>
Through the park in the afternoon<br>
Wondering where the hell<br>
I have been<br>
 Ah...<br>
<p>
<hr>
<A NAME="freeze"><h2><b><i>Freeze Tag</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
             We go to the playground<br>
             In the wintertime<br>
             The sun is fading fast<br>
             Upon the slides into the past<br>
             Upon the swings of indecision<br>
             In the wintertime<br>
<p>
             In the dimming diamonds<br>
             Scattering in the park<br>
             In the tickling<br>
             And the trembling<br>
             Of freeze tag<br>
             In the dark<br>
<p>
             We play that we're actors<br>
             On a movie screen<br>
             I will be Dietrich<br>
             And you can be Dean<br>
<p>
             You stand<br>
             With your hand<br>
             In your pocket<br>
             And lean against the wall<br>
             You will be Bogart<br>
             And I will be<br>
             Bacall<br>
<p>
             And we can only say yes now<br>
             To the sky, to the street, to the night<br>
<p>
             Slow fade now to black<br>
             Play me one more game<br>
             Of chivalry<br>
             You and me<br>
             Do you see<br>
             where I've been hiding<br>
             In this hide-and-seek?<br>
<p>
             We go to the playground<br>
             In the wintertime<br>
             The sun is fading fast<br>
             Upon the slides into the past<br>
             Upon the swings of indecision<br>
             In the wintertime<br>
             Wintertime<br>
             Wintertime<br>
<p>
             We can only say yes now<br>
             To the sky, to the street, to the night<br>
             We can only say yes now<br>
             To the sky, to the street, to the night<br>

<A NAME="marlene"><h2><b><i>Marlene On The Wall</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
              Even if I am in love with you<br>
             All this to say, what's it to you?<br>
             Observe the blood, the rose tattoo<br>
             Of the fingerprints on me from you<br>
<p>
             Other evidence has shown<br>
             That you and I are still alone<br>
             We skirt around the danger zone<br>
             And don't talk about it later<br>
<p>
             Marlene watches from the wall<br>
             Her mocking smile says it all<br>
             As the records the rise and fall<br>
             Of every soldier passing<br>
<p>
             But the only soldier now is me<br>
             I'm fighting things I cannot see<br>
             I think it's called my destiny<br>
             That I am changing<br>
<p>
             Marlene on the wall<br>
<p>
             I walk to your house in the afternoon<br>
             By the butcher shot with the sawdust strewn<br>
             "Don't give away the goods too soon"<br>
             Is waht she might have told me<br>
<p>
             Marlene watches from the wall<br>
             Her mocking smile says it all<br>
             As the records the rise and fall<br>
             Of every man who's been here<br>
<p>
             But the only one here now is me<br>
             I'm fighting things I cannot see<br>
             I think it's called my destiny<br>
             That I am changing<br>
<p>

<A NAME="small"><h2><b><i>Small Blue Thing</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
             Today I am<br>
             A small blue thing<br>
             Like a marble<br>
             Or an eye<br>
<p>
             With my knees against my mouth<br>
             I am perfectly round<br>
             I am watching you<br>
<p>
             I am cold against your skin<br>
             You are perfectly reflected<br>
             I am lost inside your pocket<br>
             I am lost against<br>
             Your fingers<br>
<p>
             I am falling down the stairs<br>
             I am skipping on the sidewalk<br>
             I am thrown against the sky<br>
<p>
             I am raining down in pieces<br>
             I am scattering like light<br>
             Scattering like light<br>
             Scattering like light<br>
<p>
             Today I am<br>
             A small blue thing<br>
             Made of china<br>
             Made of glass<br>
<p>
             I am cool and smooth and curious<br>
             I never blink<br>
             I am turning in your hand<br>
             Turning in your hand<br>
             Small blue thing<br>

<A NAME="straight"><h2><b><i>Straight Lines</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
    There's a sound<br>
             Across the alley<br>
             Of cold metal<br>
             Touching skin<br>
<p>
             And you can see<br>
             If you look in her window<br>
             That she has gone and cut<br>
             Her hair again<br>
<p>
             In straight lines<br>
             Straight lines<br>
<p>
             Those soft golden lights in the morning<br>
             Are now on her wooden floor<br>
             The wind has swept them through the apartment<br>
             She don't need them<br>
             Any more<br>
             Any more<br>
             Any more...<br>
<p>
             She's cut down<br>
             On her lovers<br>
             Though she still dreams<br>
             Of them at night<br>
<p>
             She's growing straight lines<br>
             Where once were flowers<br>
             She is streamlined<br>
             She is taking the shade down<br>
             From the light<br>
<p>
             To see the straight lines<br>
             Straight lines<br>
<p>
             She wants to cut through the circles<br>
             That she has lived in before<br>
             She wants to finally kill the delusions<br>
             She won't need them<br>
             Any more<br>
             Any more<br>
             Any more...<br>
<p>
             But there's a sound<br>
             Across the alley<br>
             Of cold metal<br>
             Too close to the bone<br>
<p>
             And you can see<br>
             If you look in her window<br>
             The face of a woman<br>
             Finally alone<br>
<p>
             Behind straight lines<br>
             Straight lines<br>

<A NAME="undertow"><h2><b><i>Undertow</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
    I believe right now if I could<br>
             I would swallow you whole<br>
             I would leave only bones and teeth<br>
             We could see what was underneath<br>
             And you would be free then<br>
<p>
             Once I thought only tears could make us free<br>
             Salt wearing down to the bone<br>
             Like sand against the stone<br>
             Against the shoreline<br>
<p>
             I am friend to the undertow<br>
             I take you in, I don't let go<br>
             And now I have you<br>
<p>
             I wanted to learn all the secrets<br>
             From the edge of a knife<br>
             From the point of a needle<br>
             From a diamond<br>
             From a bullet in flight<br>
             I would be free then<br>
<p>
             I am friend to the undertow<br>
             I take you in, I don't let go<br>
             And now I have you<br>
<p>
             I wanted to see how it would feel<br>
             To be that sleek<br>
             And instead I find this hunger's<br>
             Made me weak<br>
<p>
             I believe right now if I could<br>
             I would swallow you whole<br>
             I would leave only bones and teeth<br>
             We could see what was underneath<br>
             And you would be free then<br>

<A NAME="some"><h2><b><i>Some Journey</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
    If I had met you on some journey<br>
             Where would we be now<br>
             If we had met some eastbound train<br>
             Through some black sleeping town<br>
<p>
             Would you have worn your silken robes<br>
             All made of royal blue?<br>
             Would I have dressed in smoke and fire<br>
             For you to see through?<br>
<p>
             If we had met in a darkened room<br>
             Where people do not stay<br>
             But shadows touch and pass right through<br>
             And never see the day<br>
<p>
             Would you have taken me upstairs<br>
             And turned the lamplight low?<br>
             Would I have shown my secret self<br>
             And disappeared like the snow?<br>
<p>
             Oh, I could have played your little girl<br>
             Or I could have played your wife<br>
             I could have played your mistress<br>
             Running danger down through you life<br>
<p>
             I could have played your lady fair<br>
             All dressed in lace like the foam from the sea<br>
             I could have been your woman of the road<br>
             As long as you did not come back home to me<br>
<p>
             But as it is, we live in the city<br>
             And everything stays in place<br>
             Instead we meet on the open sidewalk<br>
             And it's well I know your face<br>
<p>
             We talk and talk, we tell the truth<br>
             There are no shadows here<br>
             But when I look into your eyes<br>
             I wonder what might have been here<br>
<p>
             Because if I had met you on some journey<br>
             Where would we be now?<br>

<A NAME="queen"><h2><b><i>The Queen And The Soldier</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
 
        The soldier came knocking upon the queen's door<br>
        He said, "I am not fighting for you any more"<br>
        The queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before<br>
        And slowly she let him inside.<br>
<p>
        He said, "I've watched your palace up here on the hill<br>
        And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill<br>
        But I am leaving tomorrow and you can do what you will<br>
        Only first I am asking you why."<br>
<p>
        Down in the long narrow hall he was led<br>
        Into her rooms with her tapestries red<br>
        And she never once took the crown from her head<br>
        She asked him there to sit down.<br>
<p>
        He said, "I see you now, and you are so very young<br>
        But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won<br>
        And I've got this intuition, says it's all for your fun<br>
        And now will you tell me why?"<br>
<p>
        The young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye<br>
        She said, "You won't understand, and you may as well not try"<br>
        But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry<br>
        But she closed herself up like a fan.<br>
<p>
        And  she said, "I've swallowed a secret burning thread<br>
        It cuts me inside, and often I've bled"<br>
        He laid his hand then on top of her head<br>
        And he bowed her down to the ground.<br>
<p>
        "Tell me how hungry are you? How weak you must feel<br>
        As you are living here alone, and you are never revealed<br>
        But I won't march again on your battlefield"<br>
        And he took her to the window to see.<br>
<p>
        And the sun, it was gold, though the sky, it was gray<br>
        And she wanted more than she ever could say<br>
        But she knew how it frightened her, and she turned away<br>
        And would not look at his face again.<br>
<p>
        And he said, "I want to live as an honest man<br>
        To get all I deserve and to give all I can<br>
        And to love a young woman who I don't understand<br>
        Your highness, your ways are very strange."<br>
<p>
        But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break<br>
        And she stood there, ashamed of the way her heart ached<br>
        She took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait<br>
        She would only be a moment inside.<br>
<p>
        Out in the distance her order was heard<br>
        And the soldier was killed, still waiting for her word<br>
        And while the queen went on strangeling in the solitude she preferred<br>
        The battle continued on<br>

<A NAME="knight"><h2><b><i>Knight Moves</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
    Watch while the queen<br>
             In one false move<br>
             Turns herself into a pawn<br>
<p>
             Sleepy and shaken<br>
             And watching while the blury night<br>
             Turns into a very clear dawn<br>
<p>
             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>
             Do you love many, can you love one,<br>
             Do you love me?<br>

             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>

             Do you love me?<br>
<p>
             One false move<br>
             And a secret prophecy<br>
             Well, if you hold it against her,<br>
             First hold it up and see<br>
             That it's one side stone<br>
             One side fire<br>
             Standing alone among all men's desire<br>
             They want to know<br>
<p>
             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>
             Do you love many, can you love one,<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
<p>
             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>
             Do you love many, can you love one,<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
<p>
             And if you wonder<br>
             What I am doing<br>
             As I am heading<br>
             For the sink<br>
             I am spitting out all the bitterness<br>
             Along with half of my last drink<br>
             I am thinking<br>
             Of your woman<br>
             Who is crying in the hall<br>
             It's like drinking gasoline<br>
             To quench a thirst<br>
             Until there's nothing there left at all<br>
<p>
             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>
             Do you love many, can you love one,<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
<p>
             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>
             Do you love many, can you love one,<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
<p>
             "Walk on the blind side"?<br>
             Was the answer to the joke<br>
             It's said there isn't a political bone<br>
             In her body<br>
<p>
             She would rather be a riddle<br>
             But she keeps challenging the future<br>
             With a profound lack of history<br>
<p>
             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>
             Do you love many, can you love one,<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
<p>
             Do you love any, do you love none,<br>
             Do you love many, can you love one,<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
<p>
             And watch while the queen<br>
             In one false move<br>
             Turns herself into a pawn<br>
<p>
             Sleepy and shaken<br>
             And watching while the blury night<br>
             Turns into a very clear dawn<br>
<p>
             Do you love me?<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
             Do you love me?<br>
             Do you love me?<br>

<A NAME="neigh"><h2><b><i>Neighborhood Girls</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
   "We had our<br>
             Neighborhood girl, she<br>
             Used to hang out, in front of<br>
             McKinsey's Bar, and we were<br>
             Interested in her, and her<br>
             Clientele...<br>
             We just wonder where she's gone..."<br>
             "Oh she's gone?"<br>
             "Yes, she's gone, gone, gone."<br>
<p>
             "I think you know your<br>
             Neighborhood girl, she<br>
             Lives on my street, now, with<br>
             Eyes of ice<br>
             I've seen her in the morning, when she is<br>
             Walking in the sun<br>
             And I always thought that she<br>
             Looked kind of nice<br>
<p>
             She spoke to me once<br>
             At a party, I think<br>
             And I thought at the time<br>
             That she had had too much to drink, because she<br>
             Said to me, `There's a backbone gone<br>
             And I've got to get it back<br>
             Before going on...'<br>
<p>
             And your neighborhood girl<br>
             Seems to have resigned<br>
             She was looking out at people<br>
             From the back of her mind<br>
             And before she went off<br>
             She spoke to me again<br>
             She came up and said<br>
<p>
             `You have the eyes of a friend<br>
             And there's a razor's edge<br>
             That I have lost somewhere<br>
             And I would like it back<br>
             So if you've seen it anywhere...<br>
             I've been out for a while<br>
             But I'll be back in a bit<br>
             I am just walking through the smoke<br>
             Finding out if this is it<br>
             Because I've got this feeling<br>
             That things are going grey<br>
             And I'd like to hear a straight line<br>
             To help me find my way...'<br>
<p>
             I looked at her<br>
             And I did not know waht to say.<br>
             She had long black hair."<br>
<p>
             "Must be a different<br>
             Neighborhood girl, cause<br>
             Ours had blonde hair, in front of<br>
             McKinsey's Bar<br>
             And we were interested in her<br>
             And her<br>
             Clientele...<br>
             We just wonder where she's gone..."<br>
             "Oh she's gone?"<br>
             "Yes, she's gone, gone, gone."<br>
