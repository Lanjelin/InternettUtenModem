<h4><a name="whois">1. WHO IS SUZANNE VEGA, AND WHAT HAS SHE DONE?</a></h4>
<i><b>Suzanne Vega</b></i> is an American singer/songwriter of rare poetic genius. Her
profound insight into the basics of human existence has earned her followers
of all ages and walks of life.<p>
  <img src="LILSV.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/lilsv.gif"><b>SUZANNE VEGA</b>, the eponymous debut album, was released in 1985 to universal
critical acclaim, and it became a big success in England and several other
European countries. The songs are representative of Suzanne's early mature
style. Poignant and pleasant, "Suzanne Vega" remains the favourite of many
of her fans.<p>
  <img src="LILSOL.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/lilsol.gif"><b>SOLITUDE STANDING</b>, released in 1987, spans ten years of Suzanne's songwriting: from the mellifluous beauty of Gypsy to the experimental minimalism
of In the Eye. The music to several of the songs was written together with
band members, and the arrangements are more rock oriented, with a markedly
percussive flavour. Luka, written from the point-of-view of an abused child,
became an unlikely chart success all over the world, and established Suzanne
as a leading name in popular music, opening the door for other gifted female
singer/songwriters like Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked and Shawn Colvin.<p>
  <img src="LILDAYS.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/lildays.gif"><b>DAYS OF OPEN HAND</b>, released in 1990, was co-produced by Suzanne, and marks
a development towards more melodic songs, and rich, experimental arrangements. 
As the title suggests, a main theme is "resolving the past and
looking to the future."  Much of the material is drawn from dreams -- you
are invited into a world of mysterious, evocative symbolism and deep,
complex emotion.<p>
  <img src="LIL99.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/lil99.gif"><b>99.9F&#176;</b>, released in 1992, is Suzanne's most playful album to date --
recorded quickly, it captures the creative, spontaneous atmosphere in the
studio. The songs are short, and the lyrics as concentrated as ever. With
Mitchell Froom as producer, Suzanne got the powerful, varied sound she had
wanted all along. While this may have shocked some of her old time fans,
99.9F&#176; met extraordinary critical acclaim, and attracted a new, younger
audience. 99.9F&#176;, according to one critic, is "a slice of perfection."<p>  
<img src="9OBJ.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/9obj.gif"><b>Nine Objects of Desire</b>, released in 1996, is Suzanne's most recent
album. It combines Suzanne's unique writing style with witty production and a Latin flavour not earlier heard in Suzanne's recordings. Nine Objects of Desire is a warm, intimate, poetic, yet catching album that is likely to appeal both to the old die-hard fans who recognizes themes and styles from earlier albums, and to the casual listener who appreciates a good tune.<p>

<h4><a name="whatis">2. WHAT IS SUZANNE DOING AT THE MOMENT?</a></h4>
 *Suzanne's <b>new album <i>Nine Objects of Desire</i> </b> out now! Unfortunately, UK citizens will have to wait a few months more, unless they buy the records from overseas...<p>
 *The <b>first single</b> from Suzanne's new album is <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#159" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/ncthrill.wav"><i>No Cheap Thrill</i></a>, also out now.<p>
 *Suzanne's song <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#92" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/caramel.wav"><i>Caramel</i></a> is used to promote the movie picture <i>The Truth About Dogs And Cats</i> and will also be on her forthcoming album.<p>
 *Suzanne sings on French singer/songwriter Kent's new album,
called <i>Nouba</i>. The song is called <i>Ainsi va L'Amour</i>.<p>
 *Suzanne sang last summer on a score written by Philip Glass, for a movie
called <i>Jenipapo</i>, directed by Brazilian director Monique Gardenberg.  The
lyrics were written by a Brazilian poet. There is no soundtrack at this time,
and the film is being shown at film festivals in North America.<p>
 *Suzanne has written a song called <a href="TIERS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/tiers.htm"><i>Woman on the Tier</i></a> for  a movie called <i>Dead Man Walking</i>, directed by Tim Robbins. The music is very aggressive -- like <i>Blood Makes Noise</i> but even harder. It's a from a book written by a nun who becomes a spiritual advisor to a killer on Death Row. <p>
 *Suzanne added vocals on <i>What's Wrong With The Man Upstairs</i> on David Massengill's album <b><i>The Return</i></b>. The album is
now available - and a <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS14.HTM#1480" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/upstairs.wav">sound clip</a> is also available on the Suzanne Vega Website.  For
more information, check out the <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#90" tppabs="http://www.plump.com/plump/">The Plump Records Website</a>.<p>
  *She has also written a foreword to an Amnesty International book called <b><i>Childhood Lost</i></b>, about the political abuses of children. Available in England.<p>
  * Suzanne has contributed
a recitation of <i>The Long Voyage</i> based on the poem <i>Silhouettes</i> by Oscar Wilde, to an album by French composer Hector Zazou called <b>Songs
from the Cold Seas</b> (Chansons des Mers Froides). Backing vocals by John Cale. The song has also been released as a single in the US.<p>
  *Furthermore, Suzanne has contributed a version of <i>Story of Isaac</i> to <b>Tower of Song</b>, an A&M tribute
album for Leonard Cohen.<p>
  *"Suzanne and Mitchell Froom were <b>married </b>on Friday March 17th in a 
civil ceremony at City Hall in New York," according to an official note from Suzanne's management. Mitchell is a musician and accomplished 
producer who first worked with Suzanne on 99.9F&#176;<p>
  *On 8 July 1994, Suzanne had a <b>baby girl</b> -- Ruby Maria Froom.<p>
  *A curiosity is that a band called Soul Coughing have named their debut
album <b>Ruby Vroom</b> after Suzanne's daughter. They basically thought it was a
pretty name. Suzanne didn't allow them to use Ruby's name as it is --
because she might want to do her own album one day -- so they substituted a
V for F.

Some of you may remember the English fanzine Undertow (not to be confused
with the mailing list with the same name). Three issues were published, but
it is unfortunately long since defunct. There have also been fanzine projects in Italy and Romania.

<h4><a name="whichalbum">6. WHICH LIVE ALBUM SHOULD I BUY?</a></h4>
To date, no official live album has been released worldwide. There are,
however, a few recordings that have been released in various parts of
the world:<p>
         <b>Live in London 1986</b>, recorded 27 April 1986, was released on
CD and LP in Australia and Japan. 6 tracks.<p>
         <b>Live at the Royal Albert Hall</b>, recorded 18 November 1986, was
released on video (VHS PAL) in the UK, and on LP, video, and laser disk
in Japan. 10 tracks.<p>
         <b>Making Noise</b>, recorded in San Juan Capistrano 17 February
1993, was released on a limited edition CD in Japan. 6 tracks.<p>

Some live tracks have also been released as B-sides of singles, and in
various other formats (notably on Coop/Fast Folk). See the <a href="DISCOG.HTM" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/discog.htm">discography</a>
for more info.<p>

In addition to these official, and nowadays quite rare, releases, there
are several unofficial recordings (bootlegs and pirate recordings).
Below is a listing of these with gradings (format:sound quality/cover
attractiveness; number of tracks). + for good, 0 for alright, and - for bad. N.B. Most of
these recordings are illegal in many countries.<p>
         Recorded in <b>Northampton, MA, 17 May 1984</b>: <i>Pretty Vegan</i>
(7":-/0; 4 tracks).<p>
         Recorded in <b>Italy, November 1984</b>: <i>Great Acoustics</i> (LP:0/+; 6+1 tracks).<p>
         Recorded in <b>Berlin, 13 October 1985</b>: <i>My Name is Suzanne Vega</i>
(LP:0/-; 11 tracks), <i>Little Big Woman</i> (CD:0/0; 4 last tracks)<p>
         Recorded in <b>Milan, 1 December 1987</b>: <i>On Stage</i> (2LP:-/+; 17 tracks, <b><i>not</i>

         The following are based on a radio show called "In Concert:
New Rock #93-22", recorded in <b>San Juan Capistrano, 17 February 1993</b>
(track list differs from Making Noise above): <i>In Concert</i> (CD:+/+; 9 tracks);
<i>Short But Sweet</i> (CD:+/0; 9 tracks); <i>Solitude Songs</i> (CD:0/0; 9 tracks, additional tracks see
above).<p>
         The following were recorded in <b>Z&uuml;rich 18 May 1993</b>. Track lists
differ slightly: <i>Dancing Girl</i> (CD:0/0; 19 tracks complete with
stories!); 100&#176; <i>Fahrenheit in Montreux</i> (CD:0/+; 18 tracks, no

<h4><a name="discog">7. IS THERE A DISCOGRAPHY OF SUZANNE VEGA?</a></h4>
<img src="HAND_NEX.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/hand_nex.gif">Yes, there are at least two. The most up to date discography is compiled by 
John Relph, and is available at:<p>
<pre>       <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS15.HTM#1562" tppabs="http://reality.sgi.com/employees/relph/music/vega.suzanne">http://reality.sgi.com/employees/relph/music/vega.suzanne</a></pre>
or through the <a href="#www">Suzanne Vega home page</a>. Check it out, there is more material
than you may think!<p>
   Although not quite up to date, the first edition of The Suzanne Vega Discography published by <a href="#hugo">myself</a> in
the December 1993 issue of <a href="#language">Language</a> may be a good reference work for the serious record collector. Back issues are still
available, and the work continues. Hopefully, there will be a second edition
in about a year's time.<p>
  John Relph and I are exchanging information and ideas, but
there will probably be two distinct discographies also in the future, each with
its own merit.<p>
  No one person can keep track of every Suzanne Vega records that comes out
in the world, so <i>your</i> help is appreciated. Please <a href="mailto:Hugo.Westerlund@ipm.ki.se">report</a> interesting
findings in <i>accurate</i> detail :-) 
<hr>

<h4><a name="rare">8. WHERE CAN I FIND RARE RECORDS?</a></h4>
There is no simple answer to this question. You should be able to find the official albums and perhaps the latest single in your local record store, but that's about it. Rare records are by definition -- rare. And record collecting is a time (and money) consuming hobby. But here are a few tips:<p>
  The best way to find records is often through the big collector's magazines: <i>Goldmine</i> in the USA and <i>Record Collector</i> in the UK, available at newsstands around the world. If you read them regularly, you will get a good overview of the collecting market, but don't expect to find everything you are looking for in a single issue -- hunting is part of the game.<p>
  In the larger cities, there are usually stores specialising in "rare" and "import" records (i.e. bootlegs). When in New York City, check out the area around Bleeker Street. In London, bootlegs are somewhat harder to find, but the second hand market is very large -- visit Camden Town, and Hanway Street off Tottenham Court Road.<p>
  You may also want to visit record fairs, at least the large, international ones.<p>
<hr>

<h4><a name="lyrics">9. HAS SUZANNE PUBLISHED HER LYRICS AND POETRY SOMEWHERE?</a></h4>
Yes. The most complete and up to date collection can be found in:<p>
<pre>       Vega, S. Murmurios urgentes. Urgent whispers. Lisbon: Assirio &         
       Alvim, 1994. ISBN: 972-37-0353-X.</pre>
This highly recommended book contains some early poems, songs from 1974
through 1992, plus three short stories. All these are printed both in
English and in Portuguese translation.
  The songs from the three first albums have also been published in the UK:<p>
<pre>       Vega, S. Bullet in Flight. Songs. London: Omnibus Press, 1990. ISBN:
       0-7119-2225-X.</pre>
Sheet music and music books have also been published -- see the <a href="BIBLIO.HTM" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/biblio.htm">bibliography</a>, previously published in the December
1994 issue of <a href="#language">Language</a>.
<hr>

<h4><a name="contact">10. IS THERE A WAY TO CONTACT SUZANNE VEGA?</a></h4>
Write to:<p>
<pre>       Suzanne Vega,
       c/o AGF Entertainment Ltd.,
       P.O. Box 2036,

Suzanne reads the <a href="#mailinglist">Undertow mailing list</a>, and contributes occasionally. If you
would like to ask her a question, post it to the list as a whole, and she
will answer if she can. Do <i>not</i> send mail personally to her, as she does not
have the time to answer personally. This way everyone will know the answer
-- some of which may even end up in this FAQ.
