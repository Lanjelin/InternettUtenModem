Subj:	MUSICAL INTERPRETATION PART 2: "SOLITUDE STANDING"<br>
Date:	97-02-03 09:24:40 EST<br>
From:	4dm@qlink.queensu.ca (Magenta)<br>
<p>
Last month I posted a query about Undertow's take on the meaning of
"Ironbound".  We got a lot of very interesting action going around here,
so I'll put forth another challenge since traffic around here has been
kind of slow.
<p>
WHAT'S EVERYONE'S TAKE ON THE MEANING OF "SOLITUDE STANDING"?
<p>
(My favourite song of Suzanne's)
<p>
Yes, it sounds like a trick question.  The meaning seems *so* obvious it
doesn't qualify as a challenge.  However, what I'm looking for now is
whether you guys want to pierce through the obvious meanings and get into
*how* the song works -- what's the diction, how's the formal mimesis of
the song, the aesthetic distance Suzanne puts between herself and the
persona of the song, etc.

Later today I'll give the song another listen, but I'm wondering if anyone

So, I guess we should all talk down to each other. I thoroughly detest
such an attitude. You don't have to discuss things in a complex lexicon.
However, a more complex lexicon permits the creation of more complex
and finer points of the object of study. The larger your vocabulary,
the greater your horizons.
<p>
In the appreciation of music, a larger, specialised lexicon is not a
specific necessity, except insofar as it enables you to understand
or express specific perceptions regarding the music.
<p>
For instance one can talk about modal chord progressions as a
compositional technique common to Anglophonic folk musics, and
then perhaps discuss why the Dorian mode seems to predominate,
as contrasted to the Mixolydian mode, which no one seems to use.
<p>
To say "Oh Don't talk all that Mixo-whatever stuff to me" isn't
going to make the mixolydian mode disappear, nor is it going to
make the Dorian mode any less affective ans manipulative of the
listener's attentions.
<p>
If you don't understand it, ask what is meant. Learn. In an
information based communication system, (like an electronic
email system such as this), learning is the best thing you can do.
<p>
Also, significant insights can be expressed without resorting to
specialised lexicons, as Buddha expressed by twirling a flower.
Any specific understanding requires a specific languages,
and any other understanding in another language is by necessity
a translation, and translation distorts.
<p>
Hence endless dusty volumes have been written about the twirling
flower, but none convey the fragrance. On the same coin, I
don't think the Buddha has email discussions of folk music
compositional strategies in mind on that fine afternoon.....
<p>
His insights were of a different nature, that day.
<p>
>what's the diction, how's the formal mimesis of<br>
>the song, the aesthetic distance Suzanne puts between herself and the<br>
>persona of the song, etc.<br>
<p>
is a perfectly reasonable proposal for discussion. One that
I am not terrifically interested in persuing, but I'll defend
anyone's right to pursue it.

<p>
"palm is split, with a flower with a flame"
<p>
I've always interpreted that line as a deliberately violent image - but the 
reality is that "solitude" - the person in the song - has a tattoo
<p>
maybe this is a silly interpretation!
<p>
I understand that song musically and in terms of images - very evocative - 
rather than literally i think 
<p>
I'd have to refer to the lyrics again properly to discuss in any detail 
- actually, I'd like to see the lyrics pasted on email when we have these

<p>
"Her" hand extended: "she" wants to take Suzanne's hand ? "She" needs
somebody ? "She" don't want to be alone anymore? Or just want to join
her loneliness ...<p>
Maybe it's only the contrast between the flower (soft touch, tender,
nice, gentle... a friendly sign, symbol of love) and the flame (violent,
destruction, it hurts, the pain...).

Don't know if anybody else noticed about that...
The Suzanne's image on the "Solitude..." CD cover ... her hands on the
cheeks ... resembles a famous painting of Edvard Munch, "The Cry" --
check this out for more info:<p>
http://www.oir.ucf.edu/wm/paint/auth/munch/... " The Cry, probably his
most familiar painting, is typical in its anguished expression of
isolation and fear. " 
<p>
Isolation?... Solitude?... The flame and the fear... Dressed in black.
And a silent cry for help with a flower in a split hand...
So it's something deeper here... it's only the top of an iceberg...

<p>
Oh...okay.  What I meant was that the theme and content of the song seem
to be apparent.  I was asking for comments about *how* Suzanne conveys
this.  For example, if you convey an idea in words and sentences, what
kinds of words and sentence structures do you use?  Fragmentary bits, or
elaborate Ciceronian sentences?  And how much do the melodies of "Solitude
Standing" reflect its theme?  What about the use of rhyme, the structure
of the song, etc?
<p>
Hope this clarifies things a bit.

<p>SOLITUDE STANDING
<p>
Solitude stands by the window<br>
She turns her head as I walk in the room<br>
I can see by her eyes she's been waiting<br>
Standing in the slant of the late afternoon<br>
<p>
And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
Solitude stands in the doorway<br>
I'm struck once again by her black silhouette<br>
By her long cool stare and her silence<br>
I suddenly remember each time we've met<br>
<p>
And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
And she says, "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"<br>
And she says, "I've come to lighten this dark heart"<br>
As she takes my wrist I feel her imprint of fear<br>
And I say, "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>
<p>
And I turn to the crowd as they're watching<br>
They're sitting all together in the dark in the warm<br>
And I wanted to be in there among them<br>
I see how their eyes are gathered into one<br>
<p>
And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
And she says, "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"<br>
And she says, "I've come to lighten this dark heart"<br>

<p>
You asked for it. Now you're in trouble.  ;-)
<p>
Ms Vega's lyrics below are poetic. I am no poet.
(I'm a painter) I find her lyrics (as with any good lyric
or poetry) evocative, and generally tend to form connexions
in my mind, sometimes, these connexions are images, sounds,
or entire texts, or people I know.
<p>
so, my responses follow the lyric.
<p>
>SOLITUDE STANDING
<p>
Title= northern romantic tradition of the figure ground
relationship in Northern European painting. Good book on
it - hard to find, but interesting. The figure is a heroic
and romantic figure set as a solitary individual in an
often bewildering and beautiful (later more threatening)
scene of nature. The Hudson Valley School painters took
on this tradition and made huge canvases of the  New York
Hudson River Valley, where there was always one tiny
figure obscured somewhere in the endless oak forests.
<p>
Hence: Standing= individual, Individual is one self selected
out of the many, thusly: alone in the world, therefore: Solitude.
<p>
By this logic Solitude MUST stand, and in this way, the
statement Solitude Standing is a bit of a redundancy.
<p>
>Solitude stands by the window<br>
>She turns her head as I walk in the room<br>
<p>
Statements of interiority. Inner workings relative to
the outer experience. The room has a window, Solitude
is standing by it. Is she looking out the window?
Or is she simply standing near it and is distracted
by Ms Vega's entrance?
<p>
>I can see by her eyes she's been waiting
<p>
Solitude has an attitude- what Solitude doesn't
understand is that there is nothing wrong with waiting;
it's just no great honour.
<p>
>Standing in the slant of the late afternoon
<p>
Image: Painting by Edward Hopper: Nude by a Window.
Image: Film Noir cliche- does the window have blinds?
Is that what forms the slant?
<p>
Also: memory of the song: Another Day by Roy Harper:
<p>
"I'm at the door,
she needs to score."
<p>
A song of lost love, and isolation.
<p>
><br>
>And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
>Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
Christian and Buddhist archetypes. Palm is split
(as in the process of crucifixion as depicted in
Western Art) the flower of Buddhist wisdom, the flame of
Christian faith. The monad (palm) is split with
flower (wisdom) and flame (faith).
<p>
Also reminds me of a great song by the Severed Heads-
"Mambo Fist Miasma" from the record "Dead Eyes Open".
<p>
"Wings of fire I go through houses<br>
Touching lips, holding hands<br>
Speaking in sheets of flame<br>
I go through the air to the circle of hands-<br>
The circle of hands, and the crowd below-<br>
Let me touch the flesh, let me warm the hearts"<br>
<p>
Interesting how Mambo Fist Miasma uses much of the
same imagery- hands, crowds below, warm....
<p>
The Severed Heads sound NOTHING like Ms Vega-
imagine Nine Inch Nails sans the adolescence and
angst.
<p>
>Solitude stands in the doorway<br>
>I'm struck once again by her black silhouette<br>
<p>
But it was Ms Vega who was entering the room, and
Solitude was by the window. This reinforces the interiority
of the lyric- solitude is not separate from Ms Vega. Ms Vega
and Solitude must therefore be the same.
<p>
>By her long cool stare and her silence<br>
>I suddenly remember each time we've met<br>
<p>
When one sees ones own solitude as another person,
the mind can choose to be Solitude or Union or
whatever- such is the working of the mind. It can
be seen as pathological projection or as the mind
working in control of the emotions. Thinking of my own
Zen practice where the mind itself is watched.
<p>

>And she says, "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"
<p>
Reminds me of alchemical incantations.
<p>
>And she says, "I've come to lighten this dark heart"
<p>
Reminds me of "Hope in a Darkened Heart" by Virginia Astley.
Excellent record. Has very happy chirpy songs with the
most dismal lyrics. Features David Sylvian on title track.
<p>
>As she takes my wrist I feel her imprint of fear<br>
>And I say, "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>
<p>
This is where Ms Vega grinds me. Ms Vega feels the imprint of
fear from her Solitude. She never thought of finding her
here. Where? In the interior? Or does it just "sound cool"?
<p>
>And I turn to the crowd as they're watching
<p>
What crowd? Why the definitive article- there has been no
previous mention, so is this The Crowd as a platonic object
or an existential force,
or was the previous stanza regarding the crowd edited out,
and she just forgot to change tense?
<p>
>They're sitting all together in the dark in the warm
<p>
Womb? Prenatal?
<p>
>And I wanted to be in there among them
<p>
Go back to the source of unconditional universal love
and nourishment?
<p>
>I see how their eyes are gathered into one
<p>
As before conception- all is one- in Qabbalistic terms,
<p>
It is from the undifferentiated Crown of God (Kether)
that the Tree of Life descends through the various
sephira until it is finally born in the materiality
and differentiations of Malkuth.
<p>
Or, in Buddhism, the koan:
<p>
 "What was your name before your mother was born?"
<p>
Asking for demonstration of essence.....
<p>
Placing the song in an interesting space. I like her
lyrics, and consider them poetic. Lyrics are an interesting
thing, because they have musical baggage that straight poetry
doesn't have to deal with or lean on.
<p>
A Romantic piece (in the artistic sense) of the internal workings
of the subject struggling with the psychological reality of
individuation (I am me- I am alone), and the spiritual
reality of ontological monism (The universe is one and all
distinctions are purely illusory).
<p>
Sometimes I wonder "why do I know all this crap?"  :-)

<p>
I've always assumed that Solitude is a representation of death, or the
'Death Figure.'  And IMHO, this song works much better than "Thin Man"
as a commentary on "brushes with death," as SV put it in the interview
with Vin Sclesa.  Of course, in "Thin Man," "He's desiring me, and I'm 
resisting him, saying 'Sorry pal - not ready.'"
<p>
>Image: Film Noir cliche- does the window have blinds?<br>
>Is that what forms the slant?<br>
<p>
Again, I'm aiming for a simple explanation here:  the sun angle on the
floor in the late afternoon forms the 'slant.'  A nice choice of phrasing,
BTW:  "standing in the slant of the late afternoon."  "Late afternoon" 
also works as a tie-in to twilight, dusk, coming of night, etc. - lots
of associations there with mortality.

<p>>>And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
>>Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
>Christian and Buddhist archetypes. <br>
<p>
How about heaven vs. hell?  (Christian archetype, I know).  Death is
inviting her ("hand extended"), or trying to lure her in.
<p>
>>Solitude stands in the doorway<br>
>Ms Vega<br>
>and Solitude must therefore be the same.<br>
<p>
Interesting, but I don't agree with this.  I prefer the explanation 
that it's just another instance or encounter she's had with this figure.
<p>
>>By her long cool stare and her silence<br>
>>I suddenly remember each time we've met<br>
>When one sees ones own solitude as another person,<br>
>the mind can choose to be Solitude or Union or<br>
>whatever- such is the working of the mind. <br>
<p>
Huh??  Seems to me she's recalling each time she's felt the presence
of death.
<p>
>>As she takes my wrist I feel her imprint of fear<br>
>>And I say, "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>
>This is where Ms Vega grinds me. Ms Vega feels the imprint of<br>
>fear from her Solitude. She never thought of finding her<br>
>here. Where? <br>
<p>
In whatever situation she's in when she's had that feeling - looking
through a window, in a doorway, i.e. 'at odd moments and in unexpected
places.'  How is this 'grinding'?  The phrase "imprint of fear" is one
of the most effective in the entire song - describes perfectly the cold
chill of sensing one's own mortality.  Sort of like the feeling of the 
"hand ... on my back" in "Thin Man."
<p>
>>And I turn to the crowd as they're watching<br>
>What crowd? <br>
<p>
In my interpretation, those who have 'gone' before.  
<p>
>>And I wanted to be in there among them<br>
>Go back to the source of unconditional universal love<br>
>and nourishment?<br>
<p>
Well, sort of.  The 'seductive desire' for death, if you will.  I may
be reading too much into it, but go back and read her comments about
"Thin Man" from the Vin Sclesa interview - very similar subjects, in
my view.
<p>
>A Romantic piece (in the artistic sense) of the internal workings<br>
>of the subject struggling with the psychological reality of<br>
>individuation<br>
<p>
Hmmmm....  An interesting viewpoint, but that's not what I get from it.
Who knows what 'Solitude Standing' is really about, but I prefer a more,
shall we say, straightforward approach to interpreting it.  But thanks
for providing some unique perspectives!

Ms Vega must be laughing her pants off at your last message (that is if she

through the thought process that you suggest then you're obviously the only

Superpower. If the Russians HAD attacked he'd probably have circled the

Suzanne wrote the song, recorded it and sat back waiting for the dollars to

Hiya folks!
<p>
I'm a list newbie here so forgive any blunders....
I've been trying to come up with my ideas for "Solitude Standing" (one of 
my favourite of Suzanne's songs!) After giving the video a run through again 
tonight I've picked up on the significance of each band member being featured
alone (solo??) and also the fact that there are occasional shots of Suzanne
twirling away in black clothing, all swirling skirts and self-absorption in 
that room alone. (A representation of Solitude herself?) It seems to be
less "story-oriented"than the one for "Marlene On The Wall" but there's
elements there for sure....<br>
Just MHO anyway.

<p>
>SOLITUDE STANDING
<p>
Title= northern romantic tradition of the figure ground
relationship in Northern European painting. Good book on
it - hard to find, but interesting. The figure is a heroic
and romantic figure set as a solitary individual in an
often bewildering and beautiful (later more threatening)
scene of nature. The Hudson Valley School painters took
on this tradition and made huge canvases of the  New York
Hudson River Valley, where there was always one tiny
figure obscured somewhere in the endless oak forests.
<p>
Hence: Standing= individual, Individual is one self selected
out of the many, thusly: alone in the world, therefore: Solitude.
<p>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<p>
I was aware of the tradition (the motif of a solitary figure) in painting - 
but never seen it defined as "Solitude Standing".  My guess is that Suzanne 
was thinking of this tradition - particular in the context of the title of 
the song - when she put some of the lyrics down.  It's interesting to 
associate the lyrics with paintings - (such as your example, Hoppers: Nude 
by a Window) because Suzanne's use of images in her lyrics is very visual 
in a painterly sense, - or cinematic -, may be more accurate (for example 
when Suzanne describes solitude personified as "I can see by her eyes she's 
been waiting Standing in the slant of the late afternoon" I imagine the 
effect is the slant of the light across the room through venetian blinds - 
but at the same time the scene is surreal and dramatic - as the phrase 
"slant of the afternoon" suggests.
<p>
Other images in the song are very vivid to me (though I'm not sure I 
understand them) - the refrain "turns to me her hand extended, palm is 
split with a flower, with a flame" has the same effect of a recurring image 
in a film (or video clip - a repeated image blinking in a loop effect).  
The use of words such as "imprint of fear" gives the whole thing a subtle 
nightmarish quality; and I guess it is surreal and nightmarish - because 
she is seeing herself as solitude personified and is confronting this.
<p>
Unlike HW, I'm not fussed that suddenly in the song we have a Suzanne 
turning to a crowd of people as it seems "consistent" with the nature of 
dream images.
<p>
"And I turn to the crowd as they're watching<br>
They're sitting all together in the dark in the warm<br>
And I wanted to be in there among them<br>
I see how their eyes are gathered into one"<br>
<p>
Suzanne is an excellent poet :) - and again these images (particularly the 
reference to the eyes of the crowd and how their eyes "gathered into one") 
are perfect surrealist motifs (if you like) and very cinematic - if anyone 
remembers the "dream sequence" Salvadore Dali directed for the Hitchcock 
film "Spellbound" - that's along the lines of how I picture some of the 
images in Suzannes songs.
<p>
One final thought - in writing about lyrics we often forget the other half 
of a song - the music the lyrics accompany - maybe because music is less 
easy to describe effectively (at least in a general terms rather than 
technical sense - and then you are not really describing the emotional 
effect of music anyway).  But one very powerful musical thing that happens 
in this song in my opinion occurs as the song moves into the folowing 
passage:<p>
"And she says, "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"<br>
And she says, "I've come to lighten this dark heart"<br>
As she takes my wrist I feel her imprint of fear<br>
And I say, "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>
<p>
- through that refrain the bass line becomes a descending progression and 
seemingly falls "through the floor" - the effect is to make the vocal hang 
hauntingly and chant-like in the air.  To my ears it's a very beautiful and 
powerful because of the contrast after the preceeding verses which build up 
a steady staccato rhythm made up of a call and response accent pattern on 
each alternate beat against the sound of Suzanne's accoustic guitar (I 
suggest you listen to it! - much better).  The effect is great; a very 
lovely piece of music - it makes you realise that, even at this point in 
her career Suzanne clearly understands so much about maximizing the effect 
of her soft vocal, how to achieve the right dynamics, and how to convey (or 
evoke) a subtle and dark mood (in this instance) in her music.  In her 
music it is apparent that Suzanne loves the surreal, the dark foreboding, 
contrasts, juxtapositions and contradictions, chant-like rhythms, 
descending bass-lines and wonderful poetic images.  Music sweet music.  And 
I love her for that.

From:	drutherf@gdc.com (Dave Rutherford)<br>
<p>
Heya all,
<p>
This thread has been very interesting. The interpretation of the
first vs. second verses as saying (the narrator) == Solitude is very
good; and correct, I think, but not in the sense stated. (I say
"the narrator" to make clear that I have no idea whether the
character in the song is Suzanne, although I suspect it might be.)
<p>
I see the three verses of the song as three photographs in a life.
The first two are relatively undifferentiated; I can come upon solitude,
or solitude can come upon me. Throughout the song, Solitude is just
an acquaintance; someone you run into and recognize from time to time.
Someone who, after time, becomes comforting, not because of any
intrinsic characteristics but merely out of familiarity. Solitude,
in this song, is just a personified projection of an emotional state.
(I also disagree with those who interpret Solitude as death. The
metaphor can't really be taken in that direction.)
<p>
The third verse is the most telling. What is the crowd? Where?
What gathers their eyes together into one? This is clearly not a
purposeless, random crowd, or they wouldn't all be looking at the
same thing. This seems, to me, to be (the narrator) expressing what it's
like to be onstage. (*I have already gone completely conjectural;
I don't really have any idea what anyone feels performing; disclaimer
et cetera*) But my interpretation here is that this is another moment,
another performance, she's on stage and all eyes are on her, but
even here, she is distanced from the group; Solitude visits in spite
of the multitudes.
<p>
Flower with a flame? Solitude is comforting, but embracing it (or her)
is ultimately destructive. (Perhaps you need to have the right sort
of personality to find comfort in being alone, but I know too that
such personalities exist.) To me, the flameflower is a symbol of this
dangerous attraction.
<p>
It may be remembered by some that I like straightforward interpertations
(Occam's Razor and all that :-) but I hope these opinions are not too
simpleminded to be of interest.
<p>
Cheers,<br>
   Dave

Yeah, those major folk music dollars, which she obviously *expected* to
roll in since her first album had gone quintuple-platinum, swept the
Grammys and placed her on the covers of Time, Newsweek, Rolling Stone and
Field & Stream on the very same day. Obviously you've uncovered the real

with one hand while counting the dollars with the other. The woman who

<p>
Hello i'm Manfred.
<p>
Manfred Strauss from Zweibruecken Germany.
<p>
I'm a listener of Suzanne for quite a while and i love most of her
songs.
<p>
So here is my opinion about the Song: <p>
> SOLITUDE STANDING<br>
<p>
First impression: "Who is solitude? A girl? A man? A symbole?" 
<p>
> Solitude stands by the window<br>
> She turns her head as I walk in the room<br>
> I can see by her eyes she's been waiting<br>
> Standing in the slant of the late afternoon<br>
<p>
"Ah. Solitude is obviously a woman she has a head and eyes so she can't
be a symbol. can she? 
<p>
> And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
> Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
"What is this? her palm is split ?! With a flower or a flame? Or with
both? Is it real or a tatoo?"
 <p>
> Solitude stands in the doorway<br>
> I'm struck once again by her black silhouette<br>
> By her long cool stare and her silence<br>
> I suddenly remember each time we've met<br>
<p>
"O.K. Suzy allready knows her. Solitude what a strange name for a
person." 
<p>
> And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
> Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
> <br>
> And she says, "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"<br>
> And she says, "I've come to lighten this dark heart"<br>
> As she takes my wrist I feel her imprint of fear<br>
> And I say, "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>
 <p>
Why fear if she's trying to help? Why shouldn't she be here?
Where the hell are we? 
<p>
> And I turn to the crowd as they're watching<br>
> They're sitting all together in the dark in the warm<br>
> And I wanted to be in there among them<br>
> I see how their eyes are gathered into one<br>
<p>
O.K. Suzanne is a singer. so she has appearances very often, this crowd
must be the audience! This explains the fear and doesn't it explain the
solitude?! Of course the solitude is a symbol! Why should we expect
solitude amongst the hubbub of a gig with all the hectic and nervous
people around.  
 <p>
> And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
> Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
><br>
> And she says, "I've come to set a twisted thing straight"<br>
> And she says, "I've come to lighten this dark heart"<br>
<p>
Ah  solitude holds both, the flower, the happy things and the flame, the
fear of failure. An artist needs to concentrate she shouldn't be
twisted, hectic or nervous. And she needs to be glad to express herself.
a dark heart won't help. Solitude will help her to gain those
concentration and selfconfidence she needs.
<p>
> As she takes my wrist I feel her imprint of fear<br>
> And I say, "I've never thought of finding you here"<br>
<p>
Well but the Solitude also makes her concious of her fears. And it is
still a surprise to have this quiet moments at a show! 
 <p>
> Solitude stands in the doorway<br>
> I'm struck once again by her black silhouette<br>
> By her long cool stare and her silence<br>
> I suddenly remember each time we've met<br>
> <br>
> And she turns to me with her hand extended<br>
> Palm is split with a flower with a flame<br>
<p>
But knowing all this won't help in anyway. It's  allways a struggle to
go out there and sing your soul away. To get the flower through the
flame!
<p>
BTW.: I think an artist always has their own interpetation of the song.
Otherwise it won't be possible to write or sing. But this is not the
only truth. Every listener has also an own interpretation which is for
them the right one. some are closer to the artists' own point of view
some are farther away but none of them is really wrong!

I have another interpretation of SS.
<p>
The narrator has a problem with her sexuality.  Solitude is the narrator's
inner life.  Solitude is making her choose between a flower or a flame
which can be taken as symbols of the sexes. And until the narrator can
choose, she'll never be part of the crowd.

<p>
Hi folks,
<p>
I may be in the minority here, but I've always thought this song is to be
taken at face value.  Solitude is just that, solitude, personified as a woman
with whom the narrator is having a conversation.  Perhaps not coincidentally,
Solitude is a woman's first name in Spanish -- Soledad.  (Other conceptually
similar first names:  Mercedes, which means Mercy, Caridad which means
Charity, Dolores which means (I think) Sadness.  Gosh, when one thinks about
it, very heavy names to lay upon a kid!)
<p>
The crowd is a concert audience, and the performer both wants to be on
display and hidden among the crowd.
<p>
The palm split by a flower by a flame -- that's a bit more esoteric, most
likely Buddhist imagery.  I'm thinking of statues of Buddha holding a lotus
flower.
<p>
"And she says 'I've come to set a twisted thing straight',<br>
And she says 'I've come to lighten this dark heart<br>
And she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear<br>
And I said 'I never thought of finding you here' " --<br>
. -- this is about the simultaneously healing and dangerous aspects of<br>
solitude; it's necessary to give one perspective, but too much can give one<br>
'stage fright' about life.<br>
<p>
But hey, what do I know?  Another random opinion...  And let's not forget the
tune really ROCKS!! (Sorry, Magenta, couldn't resist....)

<p>
Exactly.  I don't understand the feeling that this interpretation is
"too easy."  Some of the more esoteric readings are fascinating to hear,
though, and that's what this group is for, to a certain extent.  Who 
knows, maybe Suzanne did sit around and think about the imagery in terms
of the tradtion of Northern European painting....  :-)
<p>
I *do* agree that the opposing image of "solitude" vs. "the crowd" may
serve as a double entendre - sort of a 'found' metaphor for "the artist"
vs. "the audience" in addtion to the primary meaning. 
<p>
>the song overall evoked the desire<br>
>to control or choose the time of one's death (suicide) versus a random act. <br>
<p>
That's a good point.  The "I wanted to be in there among them" line works
in this context.

<p>
Completely agree that Solitude would be dressed. But take a gander at
the painting by Hopper. The woman standing by the window is stark
nikkid, but she seems so alone, so solitary (as much of his work
conveys) that what she's (not) wearing is largely irrelevent.
<p>
He did another one of a woman sitting on a bed next to a window,
and it communicates the same detached alienation that Hopper
(and Ms Vega) are so adept at describing.
<p>
(Interestingly, Hopper's wife, Jo, was the model in almost all of
his paintings, even into her old age. From what I've read their
relationship was less than optimal, although it lasted until
they died.)

Most of Suzanne's songs are not understandable for me and that's o.k. The

I have to agree with you there. This song is one of Suzanne's most simply
deciphered songs. I'm quite satisfied with a literal interpretation of it.
That doesn't mean I like it any less, of course. It's one of my favorites!  :)
<p>
And yes, the tune _is_ awesome. The rhythm is a bit too fast for walking
(I'm slow) but it somehow reminds me of a rapid heartbeat.

Hi all!
<p>
I had not barged (sp?) in before, because I have never seen the video
for Solitude Standing - can you believe that? :(

I agree with you, but I'm actually writing to make a correction a little off topic:

<p>
Actually, I think Soledad corresponds to the portuguese "saudade",
which is the emotion you feel when you miss somebody or something (is
there a word for it in english? other than "missing", I mean..)

Nope. It means Pain.

You bet! :)

Ok, I'll shut up! :) Best wishes:

"palm is split, with a flower with a flame"
<p>
I always pictured it this way: If you're on the verge of falling asleep --
or dreaming -- a hand held up with the fingers spread might look both like a
flower, with the fingers as petals, or as a flame with licking tongues. 
<p>
In this way, two symbols of different sides of Solitude -- the killing fire
and the life-bringing flower -- are merged into another powerful symbol, the
hand, that seems to hold a special fascination for Suzanne (cf. Days of Open
Hand). The hand in itself has this double nature -- it's both caring, like
the hand of a nurse or a healer, and dangerous like a murderer's hand (cf.
"give sb. a helping hand" versus "raise one's hand against sb."). An open
hand is also a sign that you come in peace. And finally, a hand has the
power to take you in its grip.
<p>
If you'd like to take this interpretation a bit further, you could say that
solitude, incubation, has a purifying quality that is associated with death
and re-birth, for instance during initiation rites when the old person,
perhaps the child, has to die to give way to something new, like a grown man
or woman. The flower is born out of the dead remnants of plants that lived
before, just like Phoenix rises anew from the ashes. Solitude, like Shiva,
is both destroyer and creator.
<p>
" And I turn to the crowd as they're watching<br>
They're sitting all together in the dark in the warm<br>
And I wanted to be in there among them<br>
I see how their eyes are gathered into one"<br>
<p>
To go on with this jungian line of interpretation, the crowd could be those
who have never known solitude, separation, and are thus undifferentiated,
united in primitive participation mystique. The subject feels the regressive
pull and wants once again to be in there among them, but Solitude, as a
Psychopompos (conductor of souls) has come to lighten the subject's dark
heart. The spark of consciousness that Solitude comes with is like the
flaming sword in the hand of the angel that drove Adam and Eve out of
Paradise and it forces the subject to carry on along the arduous path of
individuation.
<p>
To me, Solitude is not a malevolent figure. Scary, yes, but also comforting.
I like Solitude, just like I know Suzanne does. To know her is the very
essence of being alive, for better or worse.

<p>
An interesting interpretation, Hugo, and one I wouldn't have thought of.
<p>
I've always found this to be one of the most powerful images in
Suzanne's work. I tend to see it in the extra-vividly bright colors you
find in Hindu religious art. (It also  reminds me of some of the imagery
in a surreal Louis Malle film called "Black Moon.")
<p>
Having said that, I have to admit that I've long been bothered by the
lack of precision in the image. Knowing SV, it's probably a deliberate
ambiguity, but it still bugs me. Does "with a flower with a flame" mean
that the flame is IN the flower, or that the flower itself is burning,
or are the flower and flame separate elements, perhaps appearing in
succession or alternation?
<p>
I'd be curious for your (or other Undertowers') opinion.

Hi,
<p>	Well, I always thought of the 'flower with a flame' as the 
half-comfort that some people get from isolation - that they don't risk
pain from other people ('safety' is the flower), but at the same time
their isolation 'burns' them, as it also hurts to be alone. That old Roxy
music song (ok, maybe from someone earlier, I'm not sure) says that
'loneliness is a crowded room' which is what the S.S. song certainly seems
to say, that even (especially, in fact) in a crowd the 'narrator' in the
song sees how isolated they are, or wants to be.
	<p>Well, thats my burble for now.
greg.<p>
	p.s. I will post off a copy of the UK national lottery appearance
to Stuart Weitzman soon, who will make a few more for people who are
interested.

Hugo:  I thought your ideas on Solitude Standing were very interesting. In 
particular, your ideas on the shape of the hand:
<p>
Start cut------------- <br>
"palm is split, with a flower with a flame"<br>
<p>
I always pictured it this way: If you're on the verge of falling asleep --
or dreaming -- a hand held up with the fingers spread might look both like a
flower, with the fingers as petals, or as a flame with licking tongues. 
End cut--------------<p>
<p>
The flower/flame could also be the pattern of the lifelines on the palm of the 
hand. It's interesting how often Suzanne has written about how your body or 
parts of your body can seem inanimate or set apart from yourself and how 
inanimate things can seem alive (e.g. the doll in "As a Child").
