<p>
Suzanne Vega's <b>Days of Open Hand</b> is so guarded, so private, and so close to 
the chest that loudspeaker play seems an invasion of privacy.  This is
definite headphone music.  It roots and flourishes best when is is somewhere
inside your head, with no one and nothing else to invade the space.  
<p>
It's not that Vega has become more personal than past efforts - dazzling
glimmers of self-disclosure sparked even her first release in tracks like
"Small Blue Thing."  It's just that here the revelations are at once more
subtle and more vast.  And the dreamier, eerier images hold more impact
when floating between your ears than when bouncing off the empty corners
of your room.
<p>
"Rusted Pipe" describes the first sputters of a long, dark secret revealed.
"Predictions" lists mystic ways of telling the future while pointing to the
delicacy and fear of our existence in the moment.  As in Vega's best work,
the images here are both beautiful and ominous, like some darker side of
ourselves.  "Tired of Sleeping" is the groggy complaint of a small girl,
perhaps Vega herself, trapped in a dreamland.
<p>
The production also is murkier and more darkly subtle.  Vega and significant
other/keyboardist Anton Sanko pull away from some of the pop leanings of her
1987 release <b>Solitude Standing</b>, easing off on the backbeat and tossing in
rich Fairlight sounds and countless hidden samples.  Still, the sonics are
as vast and intricate as the material, with mixes and arrangements that
envelop the listener.  Unusual approaches include the Philip Glass string
arrangement on "Fifty-Fifty Chance" and the bouzouki solos that garnish
"Big Space."
<p> 
Vega's music here, some co-written by Sanko, lacks the pop hooks that pulled
a song about child abuse onto Top 40 radio ("Luka").  This time, the 
melodies are more confined, more repetitive, almost minimalistic.  Those
looking for accessible folk tunefulness may be frustrated, although they
may find something just as powerful in its place.  Vega has never had a
gift for melody.  Her strength has always come from her powerful poetic
images and the haunting musical backdrops she provides.  On this album,
she runs with her strengths.  "Those Whole Girls (Run in Grace)" has no 
more than five notes in its melody, sung in even, cool strokes.  Yet it
stands as one of the gems of the album for its stirring images and 
captivating sound.  
<p>
Of course, it doesn't always work.  "Institution Green" tries to find some
dark poetics in the act of going to vote.  While it raises some interesting
contrasts on the institutional, dehumanizing aspects of democracy, it ends
up sounding forced.  And "Book of Dreams" pushes Vega's penchant for 
repetition to the limit of endurance.  But overall, the music and lyrics
offer a wealth of riches for those willing to look.
<p>
<b>Days of Open Hand</b> presents an interesting dilemma for the music industry.  
It contains gorgeous music, strong lyrics, and rock-solid production, but it 
is almost unmarketable through the usual hype-ridden channels.  The privacy
and quiet urgency of its messages are far too subtle for radio acceptance.
Even the first single, "Book of Dreams," loses its poetic charm on the 
airwaves and becomes a sing-songish annoyance.  Music promoters and chart
moguls may be at a loss as to how to sell something with no clear-cut sound
bites, only quiet, personal, artful music.

<h3>review by Hester Riches</h3>
<p>
Unlike Vega's previous release, which featured at least one big pop hit (the unlikely Luka, a song about an abused childhood), this album doesn't have any likely AM radio material. The song In My Book of Dreams probably comes closest, as it's carried by a fairly catchy musical hook, but that hook is allowed to almost slip off before the end of the song.
<p>
For someone known primarily as a singer/songwriter, Suzanne Vega is the owner of a pretty slight voice. Some call it haunting, but her small, almost whispery tone barely carries in the songs of this recent album.  
<p>
Nevertheless, Days of Open Hand is still a winner.  The beauty is that what's lacking in her,voice is made up for in the instrumentals, especially in the extremely clever percussion arrangents.
<p>
There are all kinds of other voices speaking through, including an amazing hand-clap in Room Off the Street.  There'd be a big hit in here somewhere, if her voice only matched the passion of the lyrics and the r6ovement of the beat.
