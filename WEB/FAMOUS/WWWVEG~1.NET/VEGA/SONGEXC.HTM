<p>Of particular interest to the songwriters in the Village is
the Monday night songwriters exchange, which has been
going on for five years now at the Cornelia Street Cafe.
 <p>    Every Monday night, beginning at about 7 P.M.,
songwriters gather and sign up to sing a song they have
written the previous week. The rules of the workshop are
simple. You are asked to attend one Monday night
without participating, just to observe, if you are here for
the first time. After that you can sign up to sing every
Monday night if you like, as long as your song was
written, or at least revised in the previous week. Each
week someone volunteers to be the next week's host. The
workshop runs no later than 9:30, usually with two or
three sets in the evening.
<p>     There are many types of songwriters who meet here:
intellectual songwriters with intricate lyrics; jazz-
influenced guitar players with less complicated lyrics;
basic old-fashioned folk-song writers, and song-singers
with no music accompaniment at all. The cafe is a forum;
a place to hear what people are thinking about and being
influenced by; a place to meet other writers and talk and
listen to them. Some people come once or a few times
and never return; others come faithfully for years. If a
person comes consistently and works hard, they are not
overlooked.
    <p> It has been nearly two years now since I came to my
first Cornelia Street Monday night. At first the idea of
getting up and singing a newborn song to a group of other
possibly more talented and critical songwriters was
enough to keep me away for months  I felt sick when I
finally attempted it but it's not really like that. The
songwriters exchange is meant to be non-competitive;
you don't get criticism unless you specifically ask for it
(usually from your friends), although people will
comment if they particularly like a song. The worst that
can happen is no reaction at all. This is not a hoot; this is
not the place to come and try to impress the management
with a high-powered rendition of one of the latest top 40
hits. (The woman upstairs will pound like hell if you do.
She pounds anyway.) It is not  performance-oriented ,
but is aimed at providing an atmosphere in which to
perfect your craft of songwriting.
<p>     The cafe was started in 1977 by Robin Hirsch, who is
responsible for the performing at the cafe; Raphaela
Pivetta, who is responsible for the art; and Charles
McKenna. Robin Hirsch came here fourteen years ago
from London, with a background in English and Theater.
  <p>   Since its opening, the cafe has been a success. It is
open seven days a week, between 8 A.M. and 2 A.M. It's
a great place to work in small and atmospheric with
white brick walls, and it is an art space as well, which
means there are usually interesting paintings, sculptures,
drawings, or photographs for sale on the walls. It was
expanded recently, and now has a separate room for
special Sunday night performances and the Monday night
workshops.
    <p> As I write this, there is piano music in the background
from the radio, and people talking as they wait for this
Sunday night's performance to begin. In February, there
was a prose reading, a bawdy puppet show, comedy, and
the latest version of a new play.
  <p>   And there is food. Bread and butter with jam is a
dollar, a glass of wine is $1.25; there are quiches and
croissants and cafe au lait and mulled wine and fruit. Also
cheese, and soup... I could go on. It's a little expensive,
but very, very nice.
  <p>   Playing here on a Monday night won't help you get a
gig at Folk City or the Other End or the Bottom Line, but
it is an important part of this supportive
community important to the spirit and souls of people
who are trying to create and not just repeat what has been
done. The songs and singers are not always polished, and
the material is usually highly personal. I don't know of
any other place like it anywhere. It has the atmosphere of
the local meeting place of an old tribe or village, a
gathering place for those with a song in their veins that
they must express. And everyone is welcome.
