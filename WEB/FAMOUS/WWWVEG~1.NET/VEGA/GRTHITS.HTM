Good to be back on-line and to re-join the list.  Excellent thread going w/
'The Queen and the Soldier' comments.  
<p> 
Suzanne has said she wants to release a 'greatest hits' type album, "just the
tried and true" or words to that effect.  Many issues to think about here:<p>
1) what would a casual fan, who maybe knows of her only from 'Luka' or an
   occasional MTV video, etc., want to get when buying such a collection<p>
2) what would *we*, the 'diehard' Suzanne fans, want to see?<p>
3) what kinds of liner notes, special packaging, etc. would be cool to have?<p>
4) how about the sound quality?  Would A&M spend the $$ to re-master some of
   the earlier recordings (stuff from 'Solitude Standing' would benefit,<p>

   especially, IMHO)
<p> 
Having raised the questions, I'll put forth what *I'd* want.  Selection-wise,
I'd want all the singles, of course, plus maybe a bonus track or two (OK, 
this would be an exception to the 'tried and true' script) - here's a start:
<p> 
Marlene on the Wall<br>
Small Blue Thing<br>
Knight Moves<br>
Left of Center<br>
Tom's Diner<br>
Luka<br>
Solitude Standing<br>
Gypsy<br>
Tired of Sleeping<br>
Men in a War<br>
Book of Dreams<br>
99.9F o     <br>
Blood Makes Noise<br>
When Heroes Go Down<br>
 <p>
That's 14 tracks already; how about 1 or 2 more - maybe a cover tune like
'Cassidy' from the 'Deadicated' CD, or a live version.  Probably no room for
excellent non-hit tracks like 'Ironbound/Fancy Poultry' or 'Big Space'.
 <p>
On the liner notes, naturally I'd want a little more than track listing and
album.  How about the year it was written (a la the notes for 'Solitude   
Standing'), and a brief sentence or two by Suzanne that says something about
the context in which it was written, etc.  Doesn't have to reveal what she
thinks of the song or what it's about.  I'm going for something like the
comments by Neil Young on the 'Decade' compilation (handwritten, in his
case).
 <p>
For the packaging, how about some sort of collage - different pictures or  
images encompassing the past ten years.  I really like the 'Days of Open
Hand'
designs, myself.  The graphic artists could go wild on this one...
 <p>
Oh, yeah - the title.  Well, I'm sure Suzanne won't settle for something lame
like 'The Best of SV' or 'SV's Greatest Hits' - at least I hope not!  My
favorite title for such a compilation is 'Kate Bush - The Whole Story'.  Now
we know it's *not* the whole story, but it's an inventive title anyway.     
 <p>
That's about it.  With the above material it's nearly impossible to go wrong,
except if A&M skimps on the liner notes and packaging.  That would be a big
mistake; Suzanne and her work deserve the best!

Here's my list of songs for Suzanne Vega's Greatest Hits (to date)
album:
<p>
    Marlene on the Wall<br>
    The Queen and the Soldier<br>
    Left of Center<br>
    Gypsy (single version)<br>
    Luka<br>
    Solitude Standing<br>

    Blood Makes Noise<br>
    When Heroes Go Down<br>
    D.N.A. featuring Suzanne Vega: Tom's Diner (remix)<br>
<p>
That's the minimum.  Anything else is a bonus.

Only a few changes from Rob's list:
<p>
I agree with all choices except take out Knight Moves and add The Queen and
the Soldier instead
<p>
Also up for consideration:
<p>
Cracking<br>
Tom's Diner (Acappella only)<br>
In Liverpool<br>
<p>
I don't think A & M should remaster them at all.  I guess this is the tried
and true fan coming out in me but, I think for those of us who have listened
to Suzanne over the years, to hear the songs the way they were originally
recorded would bring back a lot of memories.  Sometimes when I listen to the
first album, I can feel almost exactly what it was like the summer I locked
myself in my room and listened to Suzanne Vega.  I'd want the greatest hits
album to take me through each SV memory going from one to the next--I feel as
if that could only happen if they were in the original form.  That's just me
though.

<p>
So why not just listen to the original rather than by the mythical "best 
of" album?  I wouldn't mind if they were remastered - just so we could 
have a little something different - since I already own the originals.  
<p>
Any of the songs suggested would go well on a "best of" album, excepting 
that awful DNA "Tom's Diner" remix.  I hated that.  Destroyed a truly 
wonderful little song.

Allow me to chime in with a couple of suggestions not covered yet, first of
which is "Neighborhood Girls." I suspect this is one of SV's personal
favorites; she's played it at every concert I've seen (ok, just three) and
every radio concert I've heard (ok, just two). But it's still a cool little
strange little song; I like in particular how we get launched into this
really compelling but weird tangent and then it all wraps up with 'hmm, gee,
that wasn't the girl I was talking about after all' (well, words to that
effect). 
<p>
Another is "Night Vision," which lord knows was no kind of hit, but it's such
a brilliant, concise piece with a mind-opening lyrical conceit.
<p>
And, finally, how can we forget the much-discussed "As Girls Go," which
actually was, I think, something of a (minor) radio hit...at least, it got
some play on the local alternative station here.. (And am I the only one who
hears an Elvis Costello allusion/homage inside that song: that bright, sharp
point at which she sings, in layered harmony, "more girl than girls are"?)

Hi all,
<p>
I'm not crazy over the idea of a "Greatest Hits" compilation.  One thing
that I love about Suzanne's albums is that they flow so evenly. Rarely do I
skip a song on her albums.  I'd much rather see her do a live album with her
choice of songs than a "Greatest Hits".
<p>
Did anyone tape the VH-1 A-Z segment with Suzanne's videos?  If so, I'd love
to trade for a copy. I have a decent collection of Suzanne on audio as well
as a few other bands.  I also have a lot of video to trade, but little as
far as Suzanne goes.

although suzanne did, in fact, make this comment, i'm troubled by the
greatest hits album concept as well. i guess i'm just not a greatest
hits album kind of listener. if i really want a greatest hits type of
cllection, i'll make a tape of the songs from the albums. to date, i've
made exactly zero such tapes (though i have made two or three samplers
for people to expose them to an artist or band). frankly, i view
greatest hits albums as commercial ploys, regardless of whether the
motivation is sales at the cash register or not.

I don't know enough about Elvis Costello to answer that, but I wouldn't 
be surprised. Suzanne covered EC's song "Beyond Belief" during the Days 
of Open Hand tour.
<p>
Some people here have expressed some displeasure over the idea of a "Best
Of" collection (strictly speaking, you could fit a "Suzanne Vega's
Greatest Hits" album on a 7-inch -- no knock at Suzanne, but as has been
noted here she's really not a singles artist). I'm sure that's because
such albums often turn out to be cheesy sales ploys, but they really don't
have to be. Done well, a collection can be valuable in giving a non-fan a
picture of what an artist is about, how he/she has developed over the
years, etc. I happen to like Kate Bush's _The Whole Story_ collection
better than either of the actual albums by her that I own (_The Sensual
World_ and _The Red Shoes_). I've been tempted (pun not intended) to buy
Squeeze's singles collection because there are a bunch of songs on it I 
like, but I'm not enthralled enough with the band in general to want to 
go delving into their albums.
<p>
And face it, someone who knows Suzanne only because of songs like "Luka" 
isn't really going to be amenable to running out and buying up her back
catalog right now. But they might if they get the Best Of album and
discover that she's done a lot of great songs they've never heard before. 
Also, some people only seem to buy new albums (even if the songs are 
old), as if anything else is passe.
<p>
That said, you really lose something when you just hit the highlights of a
band's career (Beatles compilations tend not to include songs like "I'm
Only Sleeping" and "Savoy Truffle"). But basically, this Best Of project
isn't really aimed at fanatics like us.
<p>
Is everybody here aware that she's also planning a second collection made 
up solely of 13 early, previously unreleased songs? That's the one I'm 
looking forward to. 
<p>
I think Suzanne really deserves to be commended, by the way, for saying
she wants to include only the "tried and true" songs on the Best Of album.
The alternative is all too typical -- call something Best Of or Greatest
Hits but include one or two unreleased/remixed tracks so that diehard fans
will have to buy it too. That's what Springsteen did by re-forming the E
Street Band for a couple of songs; that's what IRS did when it included
three odd tracks on its _Eponymous_ anthology of R.E.M. songs (and,
incidentally, when it re-released the early R.E.M. albums as $30 imports
with new bonus tracks). It's what almost everybody does and it basically
rips off the fans. Suzanne is showing a lot of consideration by giving
people a choice of what they want -- either the best of the past or a
glimpse at her unseen side. 
<p>
It's also interesting that she seems to intend to release all this stuff 
so soon after _Love Hotel_ comes out; I would think the label would be 
worried that she'd be competing with herself. Then again, it's odd how 
Suzanne prevails over corporate decision-makers when so many other 
musicians are unwilling or unable to. (I'm thinking especially of the way 
she convinced the label's lawyers not to sue DNA -- something that U2, 
the biggest band on earth, claimed they were unable to do with respect to 
Negativland. But that's another issue.)

Bob,<br>
As always, when you speak you have wisdom to impart.  Well said!
<p>
I agree with you that it is good of Suzanne to release a tried and true album
as well as songs unreleased from the early days.  
<p>
I had said something about not remastering the originals in order to bring
back memories for those of us who have been listening to SV for years.  Joe
said that it would be pointless to buy an album made in such a way and that I
should just listen to the originals.  But, I think there are two benefits to
this idea.
<p>
1.  As you said Bob--bring in the "Luka" fans and have them realize that
Suzanne is more than just Luka.
<p>
2.  It would be great to have one cd that I can put on and depending on what
song comes up--the memories for me change--several different summers of
listening are involved--my life was different during each summer that I
listened to Suzanne's music--it would be very sensory for me to move from one
place to the next all compiled on one cd.  Sure, I can put the old cd's on
and hit random and take my chances--but I don't have a multi-cd changer
(that's my cop out for the day).  The tried and true in their original forms
works for me.  The only variation I would make on this is not a remastering
but an acoustic version.  Suzanne and her guitar singing the singles--I love
the acoustic version she does of Luka (Grammys 1988 and VH-1 Folk Music Show
featuring Suzanne Vega).

Well, we've certainly gotten some discussion going here.  Let me clarify a
few things.

<p>
Well, when I made my list, I just went through the discography and picked out
all the singles that were released (except 'In Liverpool' - my mistake; add
that one too!).  For the uninitiated, I can't think of a much better 
representation of her abilities than these songs!  Maybe she'll include some
others like 'Neighborhood Girls', which someone else suggested.

<p>
Yes; this is precisely the purpose of such a collection.  For those of us
that already have everything that she's released, it's hard to look at it

from the other point of view!  And yes, of course I'm looking forward to
the 13 early songs collection, and the new album, more than the 'hits'.

<p>
Yup, again.  Even though I have a multi-CD changer, I don't put all her 
albums on together and hit 'shuffle' - hmmmm... maybe I should!  But it
would be nice to have a bit of everything on 1 disc.  I wouldn't mind an
acoustic version or versions either - that would make all of us run out and
buy it just to have them!  But, have you tried listening to the Solitude
Standing CD on headphones?  Way too trebly and way too much hiss...
<p>
Interesting thoughts; maybe Suzanne will drop in with her thoughts on why
she wants to do this project, and why the release will be so close to the
new album.  Or maybe she won't...either way, we've put our 2 cents in, 
for whatever it's worth.  :)
