There are songs which we think we could have written and there are
songs which we wish we had written. There are songs which recall for us
a time, a place, a person perhaps. Then there are songs which we can't
remember hearing for the first time. All are different kinds of songs
which, rare enough, can become classics for us. Then there are the
songwriters who write them. We may ask ourselves how they are written.
Or do they find them, discover them, or remember them for us? Suzanne
is one of those rare people touched by the gift for writing or
discovering or remembering, however you want to think of it. This is
her first published collection, and I think you'll find here some of
those songs which will be "classics" for you. I have.
