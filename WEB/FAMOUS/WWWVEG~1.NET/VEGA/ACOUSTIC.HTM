In the beginning of the great Singer-Songwriter Revival -- so the common
wisdom goes -- there was Suzanne Vega.  Along with another extremely
unlikely breakthrough artist of the late 80's, Tracy Chapman, Vega helped
clear a forgotten path from the coffeehouses to the major labels -- even to
pop radio.  Not even the most optimistic folkie could have guessed that one
of their progeny would turn a snappy tune about an abused child ("Luka")
and another about morning coffee at the local diner ("Tom's Diner") into
international hits.  Vega's success gave the acoustic guitar-slinging
masses hope that their voices could indeed be heard again.
<p>
Several years and albums later, Suzanne Vega holds her place as one of the
pop world's most unlikely stars -- and one of the hardest to pin down. 
<p>
Although she clearly helped crack open the industry doors to the
singer-songwriter army, no one sounds much like her; the arresting
combination of her little-girl vocal style, staccato melodies, and
enigmatic but poetically charged lyrics remains her own.  Last year's
release of _99.9F_ (all her albums are on A&M) propelled her further away
from the pack, highlighting the uniqueness of her contribution to the
singer-songwriter idiom and pointing toward lots more interesting music to
come.
<p>
"I've had a strange career," Vega commented on the phone from her New York
apartment in late fall, "because it's sort of been a process of growing up
in public, as it were.  The first album [_Suzanne Vega_] did much better
than anyone thought it would, and the second album [_Solitude Standing_]
was a big hit, so everyone took each album very seriously.  The third one
[_Days of Open Hand_] was taken the most seriously of all."
<p>
Serious in what way? I asked.  "Everyone felt that it had to be technically
clean and up to a certain standard, that the playing had to be good, and
that the sound had to be very pristine," she said.  "There wasn't any
feeling of, let's be radical or let's twist this. . . . Actually,
[coproducer] Lenny Kaye was the subversive element on the first and second
records, but even so, the overall quality of the sound was always really
good.  There's certainly nothing wrong with that, but on this album
[_99.9F_] that wasn't what we were going for.  We were going for deliberate
distortion and a more playful kind of feeling."  For Vega, making the album
was a liberating experience.  In her words, "It was like, finally you get
to go out and roll around in the dirt without always having to be cleaned
up for Sunday."
<p>
The songs on _99.9F_ spin on a kaleidoscope of acoustic guitar, percussion,
electric bass, and unusual keyboard effects, interspersed with some of the
quiet fingerpicking meditations that are more reminiscent of Vega's
previous albums.  The album's heavily rhythmic, sometimes psychedelic
quality was a surprise to Vega herself.  "I had intended to make this album
a straightforward acoustic album," she said.  "I wanted the acoustic guitar
to be the center of most of the songs, and I'd say it is the center on 10
out of the 12 songs -- there are two songs that have no acoustic guitar.  I
wanted them to be the kind of songs that I could sing alone, because I
found with _Days of Open Hand_ that I actually was starting to play less
and less guitar, and I was starting to experiment with the Fairlight [a
computer-based sampler, synthesizer, and recording system], which I didn't
really like as much as I thought I was going to."
<p>
For the new album, Vega was slated to work with renowned producer Mitchell
Froom, and before the recording sessions she listened to and enjoyed many
albums that he had produced -- mostly hard-hitting rock'n'roll by Crowded
House, Richard Thompson, and others.  She had some new material written
when they first met, but she felt inspired to rise to the challenge of
working with him, so she wrote a slew of new songs in the first week of
preproduction.
<p>
"I was aware that I had a reputation for being sort of ethereal -- wan and
frail and melancholy," she said, "and it was worrying me that it was all
going to sound like one color.  So I pushed myself a little bit to write
songs like 'When Heroes Go Down' and to use more major chords than I would
have normally, and mix them with minor and augmented chords.  I wanted to
have a balanced collection of songs."
<p>
Froom had definite ideas about how Vega's songs could be dressed up
differently than on her previous albums.  as she put it, "Mitchell likes
eccentricity, and when he works with an artist he'll find out what's
different about them and then bring those qualities out, rather than making
them conform to his idea."
<p>
Vega also wasn't working with her normal band for the sessions.  "My band
used to like a certain structure, and if I wrote a song with no bridge they
used to be annoyed at this and would want to have a bridge; whereas
Mitchell was very happy if things were uneven or not symmetrical or if
there weren't any bridge -- that was fine.  He has his own idea of the way
the music should flow.  So that may be another reason why these songs may
sound more innovative, because Mitchell sort of let them be as they were. 
<p>
He didn't clean them up or force them into any particular form."
<p>
Some of the results of their collaboration include "Fat Man and Dancing
Girl," a funky talking-singing tune with a distinctly Beatles-esque bridge
written by Froom; "When Heroes Go Down," a piece that Vega identifies as
Elvis Costello-inspired "acerbic pop"; and the Gulf War requiem "Song of
Sand," recorded with guitar, voice, and string quartet.  Vega said she and
Froom agreed to "take small details and blow them up and distort them,
which, in a way, is the way I write songs: I take small details of a
situation and I blow them up, and usually the situations themselves are
kind of distorted."
<p>
Even though the final mixes are a long way from a "straightforward acoustic
album," Vega said she and Froom tried not to bury the tunes in production. 
<p>
"We were really careful to keep the whole thing scaled down to my guitar
and my vocals, because Mitchell said he felt like I have a small voice and
there is no reason for me to be playing with a large drum kit and competing
against all this racket, competing with all the large, more anthemic types
of sounds."
<p>
Most of Vega's songs emerge from solitary sessions with her Martin 000-45,
with the exception of a few tunes like "Blood Makes Noise" or "Tom's Diner"
that "jump into my mind whole," she said, with no guitar part in sight. 
<p>
"What I really love is just to sit with the guitar in my arms and fool
around with it.  'In Liverpool' got started because I was trying to teach
myself an Elvis Costello song called 'Almost Blue,' and I had just taken
the first three chords, and then that gave me an idea and I started going
off on that."  Although Vega quickly pointed out that she plays on guitar
"whatever gives me the least trouble," her guitar parts are always
well-crafted, full of interesting voicings, and cleanly played.  Like
everything in her music, her guitar adds in just the necessary notes,
nothing more.
<p>
After 22 years of playing, she said, her guitar parts emerge spontaneously.
 "I guess at this point I've built up a vocabulary of stuff I like, so I
just kind of run around the fretboard doodling. . . . Usually it's just
finding a pattern and then repeating the pattern up and down the fretboard.
 I don't know enough about the technique or the theory of it to know really
what I'm doing, but I know what quality a chord will have.  I like the ones
that sound more mysterious, but lately I've been trying to mix those with
very straightforward happy chords or very straightforward sad ones."
<p>
Lately, Vega has also been trying to vary the guitar texture more, mixing
strummed songs with fingerstyle songs (for which she uses a thumbpick and
fingernails).  "The problem is that when I'm playing alone in my living
room, I hate strumming because there's no reason to strum, so I tend to get
more intimate and I fingerpick," she said.  "Then I go onstage and I find
that the things that tend to go across better are the strummed ones.  [They
are] less exhausting.  It's very satisfying to be able to punch some of
those songs out."  As examples, she mentioned strummers like "Neighborhood
Girls" (from _Suzanne Vega_), "When Heroes Go Down" and "Rock in This
Pocket" (both from _99.9F_).  When playing "As A Child" (_99.9F_) alone,
she said she does a "bizarre sort of Bo Diddley thing" that Froom vetoed in
the studio because all her strings were ringing out.  (David Hidalgo got
the nod for that part.)  "So I have to tighten up my Bo Diddley," she added
with a laugh.
<p>
I asked if she's ever experimented with alternate tunings.  "Other people
have suggested that I might want to, since I seem to like those kinds of
chords," she said.  "But I find it very distracting, and I find it
difficult enough to play the guitar the way it is.  If I change one string,
I'm lost -- I can't find my way back to the tonic root."
<p>
Unlike many songwriters, Vega writes melodies that aren't strictly bound to
her guitar progressions -- they have a life of their own (and in her
spoken-word tunes, she leaves the guitar harmony behind entirely).  "With
this last album I was attempting to sing more definite melodies," she said.
 "My pattern in the past has been to repeat something; if I like it I'll
just repeat it over and over again, without realizing that I can extend it.
 'In Liverpool,' for example, is a very different kind of melody for me,
because it's long -- it's a long phrase.  It has a different kind of
quality than the songs I usually write."
<p>
Central to the impact of Vega's songs is the precise matching of all their
components: the guitar, vocal, melody, and lyrics all share a minimalist,
sculpted quality.  I asked her if all these qualities developed naturally,
or if she consciously matched and shaped them along the way.  Vega
approached the question from the lyrical side.
<p>
"I prefer short words to long ones, because I find that's the quickest way
to get someone's attention," she said.  "if you say, 'My name is Luka/ I
live on the second floor,' you're drawn into this picture because it's such
specific, concrete information and the language is so simple.  But the
funny thing was that two years ago I found out that I was an asthmatic -- I
had never before been diagnosed as having asthma.  When I mentioned this to
my drummer, he laughed and said he figured there was a reason why I had
such short phrases!  I have short words, short phrases, and I don't stand
around holding the note our to using any vibrato, because I can't -- I have
no breath.  I can't breathe!  So I guess it's all developed in a way that
suits my style.  I mean it sounds kind of pathetic, but it isn't, really:
it's just making the best of your own limitations, which is kind of what a
style is.  Developing a style means finding out where your limits are and
making the best of them."
<p>
Vega elaborated on her approach to writing lyrics.  "I'm usually writing
about a very specific situation, and it seems to me that there is only one
set of words that will tell the whole story, and no other set of words will
do that.  So it's almost like a code, a way of giving a lot of information
in a short time.  Plus, there are certain rules that I'm guiding myself by.
 The words have to sound a certain way.  I like words that have a lot of
consonants in them, that have certain hard sounds in them, like t's and
k's.  'Luka' is a good word for me to sing; I like the way that word feels
as opposed to other kinds of names."
<p>
In addition to sounding a certain way when sung, Vega's lyrics are also
surprisingly forceful on paper.  She said, "Part of the rule for me is that
it has to read well.  Although it can't just read well; it has to sing well
first.  If it reads well but doesn't sing well, I just get rid of it."
<p>
The difference between reading words and hearing them sung is, Vega said,
"an emotional thing, really.  Something will ring true on the page when you
read it, and then you go to sing it and you feel really pretentious."  She
brought up the example of "When Heroes Go Down":  "I was wondering about
the word 'equivocate,' thinking, does this flip it over into some kind of
pretentious realm?  Then I found that when I sang it, it didn't.  It was
the word I meant, and it fit right there.  Even though it was a long word,
I felt that I shouldn't be afraid of using a long word once in a while; I
can just stick this in here rather than trying to find another word.  But
[that decision] usually has to do with the feeling behind it, and whether I
suspect myself of using jargon or taking the easy way out.  If I suspect
I've heard it before, or if I suspect I'm stealing from someone else, I try
not to."
<p>
As a writer and performer, Vega considers very carefully the effect of her
songs on the audience.  Far from being the navel-gazing songwriter, gushing
with confessions and personal details, she continually looks outside
herself in her songwriting and rigorously tests the results.
<p>
"I think some of [my music] is introspective, but I make sure to have the
songs relevant to everyone," she said.  "I tend not to like the kinds of
songs that are deliberately personal, and it really depends on how it's
done.  Leonard Cohen, for example; you listen to his music and you suspect
that a lot of it is very personal and right out of his life, but for some
reason the details that he puts in are universal ones. . . .
<p>
"It's important for me to acknowledge that you are writing for an audience,
you're not just writing a page in a diary.  You're writing for a bunch of
people who don't know you; they're not your friends, they don't know what
your life is like or who you're going out with, or maybe they don't even
care.  Most of those people are listening to you to see how you will relate
to them, and that's something I always remember.  They're not buying your
record because they're interested in your personal problems; they're buying
your record because they're interested in their own personal problems, and
they hope that you have something to say to them."
<p>
Looking ahead, Vega said that the creative outburst that resulted in her
last album has yet to run its course, and the collaboration with Froom may
continue.  In the meantime, she is heading out on tour in early '93 with a
band that will reflect what she called the "attitude change" of _99.9F_,
while continuing to play solo acoustic gigs to stay on top of her
repertoire.
<p>
Ever since the _Suzanne Vega_ album, Vega's producers, her record company,
and Vega herself have struggled with the tiresome label-that-music game,
studiously avoiding the 'f' word that was considered a commercial albatross
in the '80s.  Perhaps because of the expectation-defying _99.9F_, Vega
seems less concerned these days with being pigeonholed as a folksinger,
although she expresses frustration that female musicians are still lumped
in one category rather than judged on their individual merits.
<p>
"In terms of my own personal life, I think I've been influenced by a lot of
different people," she said, citing Elvis Costello, Lou Reed, and Chrissie
Hynde as kindred spirits.  "But I'm aware that I'm perceived as a woman,
singer-songwriter, acoustic guitar player, folksinger, for lack of a better
word.  And that's fine.  I don't care what people define me as, because I'm
always going to wiggle out of it.  No matter what anyone says, I'm just
going to do what I want anyway."
<p>
This much is clear:  Suzanne Vega will always want -- and need -- to write
songs.  "I feel called into it in a specific way," she said.  "I always
felt that I had something specific to say and a very particular way of
saying it.  The goal of it was not to be popular and successful, but to say
the thing as clearly and as accurately as I could."
