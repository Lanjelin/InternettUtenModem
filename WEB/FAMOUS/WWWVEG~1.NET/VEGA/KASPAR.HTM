Hey there! 
<p>
Did anyone else see the article on a new movie about the mystery of Kaspar
Hauser in the Arts and Leisure section of this Sunday's New York Times? The
reason I mention it is because the song "Wooden Horses" on Solitude
Standing is subtitled "Caspar Hauser's Song." I never knew or could find
out who Caspar Hauser was, but after reading this article I realized that
this is the same guy!
<p>
For those of you who don't know about him or didn't read the article,
Kaspar Hauser is a guy who mysteriously appeared in a German village at the
age of about 19 or so, completely wild, unable to speak, but able to scrawl
his name when given a piece of paper to write on. He was thought to be the
crown prince of Germany, switched at birth with another child so that the
line would die out and someone else could get the throne. There is an older
film about the whole thing--I don't remember what it's called, but it's
mentioned in the article--but the article was mainly about a new film that
a German filmmaker is working on now (or maybe is already done? I'm writing
this without the article at hand).
<p>
What I wonder and hope some of you in the group can answer, is if the
details mentioned in the song "Wooden Horses" are actually part of this
whole story, or were made up by Suzanne as part of the greater reality of
the song. I'm referring to the lines "I came out of the darkness/ holding
one thing/ a small, white wooden horse/ I'd been holding inside" and "I
want to be a rider like my father/ were the only words I could say."
<p>
Also, does anyone have a clue about what Suzanne's interest in this story
is, and how she got interested in it? It may be pretty minor, but I thought
it would be interesting to know.

Thanks for your most interesting posting, Ahree.

>There is an older film about the whole thing--I don't remember what it's called
<p>
*Every Man for Himself and God Against All* (directed by Werner Hertzog 1975)
also known by an alternate title as *The Mystery of Kasper Hauser*

<p>
(The following paragraph is part of an anonymous essay I came across on the net)<br>
<p>
"Hertzog relies on images of animals interwoven throughout the narrative to
create meaning.  Herzog uses these animals to reinforce Kasper Hauser's journey
from wildness to civilization.   Horses are a central animal in the film.  When
Kasper is first introduced, he is "chained in a cavern" playing with a toy
horse.  Because Kasper is confined in the cellar and restrained, he in essence
is an animal; He grunts and snorts.   Kasper is a part of the uncivilized animal
kingdom. The toy horse serves as the "archetypal symbol of loosed energy"  and
because Kasper is playing with it, he too becomes a symbol for wildness and
uncivilization.  Kasper's bond to this untamed world is reinforced as he speaks
his first word, "Ross", horse."
<p>

There is a reference to Kaspar Hauser in the book * An Anthropologist on Mars *
by Oliver Sacks where he compares a color-blind painter's fondness of dusk and
night to that of Kaspar Hauser.
<p>
Night Vision anyone?  The CD booklet for Solitude Standing says, Inspired by the
poem, "Juan Gris" by Paul Eluard..........

I am relatively new to this list so apologies for repeating anything that has
already been discussed.

Hi, Ahree. Welcome to the list. 
<p>
A few months ago, we've already talked about Kaspar Hauser, and you can find
pieces of even earlier discussions about it somewhere in the Web (in the
"message board" section I think). But I think that this mailing list should
be a real discussion and that we shouldn't bother wondering if what we want
to talk about has already been discussed. <p>
So here's what I know, from a German movie I saw called Caspar Hauser (It
was about 2 or 3 years ago, and maybe it's the one you read about) and from
what I recall about last discussion: Suzanne didn't make up anything: 
Caspar was locked and tied in a basement, with only a little window, and he
only had a small white wooden horse to play with. Then when he grew up, a
man helped him out. All this time Caspar was always sat down on the floor
and never talked to anyone, so when he came out, he couldn't talk nor walk.
For a few days, the man who helped him out carried him on his back and had
him repeat "I want to be a rider like my father" as an exercise. But it was
a strange movie and I didn't understand everything. So maybe "I want..." was
actually the only thing he could say when he came out. Then one strange
thing about Caspar was that when you put out the light he would
automatically fell asleep. I think that explains the "I know I have this
power". And he's a threat to the power so there are men after him "I'm
afraid I may be killed" (and he did get killed).

<p>

In his basement, Caspar became like a doll and you can find the same theme
in "As A Child", about feeling unreal. Suzanne said in some interview that
she used to look at her dolls and they seemed real to her, and then she
would look at herself and she didn't.

Nothing about Suzanne is minor.

Hi folks,
<p>
Wayne Lovett (any relation to Lyle, by any chance?!!) asked:<br>
<<Night Vision anyone?  The CD booklet for Solitude Standing says, Inspired<br>
by the
poem, "Juan Gris" by Paul Eluard..........>>
<p>
I happened to come across the poem a while back, in the sheet music for some
Francis Poulenc songs, but don't have the translation.  David Algranti, or
any of our French friends, would you kindly translate?  Here it is.  I'm
using an English keyboard, so the accent marks have been left out...
<p>
Juan Gris
<p>
De jour merci<br>
de nuit prends garde<br>
De douceur la moitie du monde<br>
L'autre montrait rigueur aveugle<br>
Aux veines se lisait un present sans merci<br>
Aux beautes des contours l'espace limite<br>
Dimentait tous les joints des objets familiers<br>
Table guitare et verre vide<br>
Sur un arpent de terre pleine<br>
De toile blanche d'air nocturne<br>
Table devait se soutenir<br>
Lampe rester pepin de l'ombre<br>
Journal delaissait sa moitie <br>
Deux fois le jour<br>
Deux fois la nuit <br>
De deux objets un double objet<br>
Un seul ensemble a tout jamais<br>

The film in question was made by Werner Herzog in, I think, the 70's. I 
forget the exact title and year. I can only assume that this film in some 
way sparked SV's interest, and inpsired the song. Sorry, that's all I can 
think of off the top o' my head on this.
<p>
This is my first posting since joining the list, so howdy gang! Hearing 
lots and lots of good comments on everyone's "other" musical favorites. 
When I have time I'll post my own. Also--I'll post an account of my first 
encounter w/ SV's music. I think that could be the next contender for the 
group discourse.
<p>
Anyway, ttfn<br>
