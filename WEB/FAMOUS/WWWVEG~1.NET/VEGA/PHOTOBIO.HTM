I was born April 9, 1954 in Portsmouth Virginia, and grew up in
nearby Williamsburg, the restored 18th Century capital of Virginia. 
After two years at the University of Virginia, where I studied urban
planning, I transferred to the Maryland Institute, an art school in
Baltimore.  I then transferred to Cooper Union in New York where I
studied with Joel Meyerowitz, one of the pioneers of color
photography.  Since art school I have worked as an architectural
photographer, and I've pursued various landscape/documentary photo
projects.
<p>                                    
In 1980 I began photographing the Lower East Side of Manhattan in
collaboration with fellow Cooper graduate Ed Fausty.  We worked for a
year documenting the streets and architecture of the neighborhood. 
The photographs were first exhibited in 1981 at the Henry Street
Settlement.  The Lower East Side project led to an invitation to
photograph the Wall Street area of Manhattan in conjunction with
several other photographers.  That work was first exhibited at
Federal Hall on Wall Street in 1983.
<p>                                    
During this time I began making photographs of Central Park on my own
and on assignment for the newly formed Central Park Conservancy.  My
photographs of the park were first exhibited at the Dairy in Central
Park.  This work led to a project sponsored by the New York City
Department of Parks and Recreation in which I photographed natural
park areas around the city.  These areas of wetlands and forest exist
in all the boroughs, and are surprisingly expansive.  In 1986 I
exhibited this work at the Urban Center Gallery in midtown Manhattan,
and the show subsequently travelled to other galleries around the
city.
<p>                                    
In 1985, while still photographing the parks of New York, I turned my
attention beyond the confines of the city and began photographing the
landscape of the former European East/West border, also known as the
Iron Curtain.  In making the photographs I travelled the heavily
fortified line between the Baltic and Adriatic Seas, as well as the
Berlin Wall.  This project was first shown at the International
Center of Photography in 1987.  In late 1989 I returned to Berlin to
photograph the wall just after its unexpected opening, and later I
photographed the border zone after the wall was removed.  Prints from
the East/West project have been collected by the Metropolitan Museum
of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.
<p>
Following the completion of the East/West project, I was asked by the
Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment to photograph the landscape
of Prospect Park, which has resulted in the current "Trail of the
Waters" exhibition.  The pictures include all four seasons and follow
the course of water through the park beginning with its source from a
manmade spring to various pools and creeks, and ending in the lake.
<p>
For the past several years I have been commuting between the U.S. and
the Netherlands.  In recent months, I have been photographing the
outskirts of Amsterdam exploring the uneasy border between city and
countryside. The working title of this project is "Amsterdam on
Edge."
