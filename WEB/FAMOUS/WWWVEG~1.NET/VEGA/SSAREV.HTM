Suzanne Vega's first disc, <b>Suzanne Vega</b>, showed great promise for her future
as a folk-rocker.  <b>Solitude Standing</b> fulfills that promise and then some, 
with a stronger, more self-assured sound, and a tone and texture that 
beautifully suit the artist and the times.
<p>
Vega's lyrics are still the kind to leave marketing executives wondering 
what they've gotten into:  "Luka" speaks through the eyes of an abused 
child; "Ironbound/Fancy Poultry" eerily compares inner-city children to the
"breasts and thighs and hearts" sold near their school; "Calypso" takes its
character and inspiration from Homer's Odyssey.
<p>
But thankfully, Vega's new band helps to pull these songs out of the "artsy"
coolness of her first release.  Each member pitches in on songwriting chores,
and the group together adds musical dimension and depth to Vega's multi-
dimensional lyrics.  Guitarist Marc Shulman especially shines throughout the
disc on his solos (most notably in "Luka") and in his rock-solid backing 
("Solitude Standing," and "In the Eye").
<p>
Despite the heavy backbeat that drives some of the songs, "solemn" is still
the operative word for Suzanne Vega and <b>Solitude Standing</b>.  Vega paints a
picture of inner city life, where people are trapped ("bound up in iron and
wire and fate"), defiant ("If you were to kill me now...I would still look
you in the eye"), or resigned to their confinement.  But this is not the
cliched, desolate cityscape of a bitter, black-clothed folk artist.  There
is still a delicate beauty in Vega's world - in the impressionistic "Night
Vision," and in the quiet acceptance of "Gypsy" - that adds a very personal
perspective to her music.
<p>
Sound quality is very good but not ideal.  Producers Steve Addabbo and
Lenny Kaye decided to record and mix this release on analog equipment, and
it shows slightly in the sharp-edged sound and the (very minimal) tape hiss.
Also, Vega's breathy, close-miked voice may be disturbing if you listen on
headphones (especially in the a cappella disc opener, "Tom's Diner").  When
she sings "I will burn myself into your memory," she isn't kidding.  But
the overall sound serves the music well:  the drums pack a punch; the guitars
and keyboards sigh and mingle beautifully with Vega's voice.
<p>
Final kudos go to the liner notes.  The package here looks like someone 
actually cared.  You get complete lyrics, full recording credits, and each
song is dated with the year in which it was written.
<p>
In <b>Solitude Standing</b>, Suzanne Vega has created another tough act to follow,
but one that promises even more for the future.  Best of all, it breathes
new life into a commodity that seemed to be fading in commercial music - 
intelligence.

   Suzanne Vega's strengths lie in her  ability to write subtle,  catchy
lyrics and  music while  packing the wallop  of a  mule kick  along with
them.    At first  listen Vega's  tunes sound  pleasant,  enjoyable  and
catchy.   And unless  you listen closely you'll never  notice that these
bright,  bouncy tunes  have a complexity that  matches their bounciness.
She writes of Death and Freedom in 'Undertow' from her 1985 debut LP, of
child  abuse  in  'Luka'  from her  recently  released  album  "Solitude
Standing", of heartbreak in 'Cracking' also from her 1985 record,  and a
17 year old boy who was shut away in a basement since infancy in 'Wooden
Horse (Caspar Hauser's Song)' from "Solitude Standing."
<p> 
   And her lyrics have a quality of jumping out at you, especially after
listening to her  songs more than once.   Lyrics are  provided with both
her 1985 self-titled release and 1987's "Solitude Standing."  And it's a
good thing that lyric sheets are included because Vega's writing demands
to be read as  well as heard.   Her voiced images  are reinforced by the
written word;   her music  emphasises her voice  and your  reading.   In
'Undertow' she writes  "I would leave only bones and  teeth/We could see
what was  underneath/And you  would be free  then,  free  then" equating
death and freedom in  the same breath.   In 'Cracking' "It's  a one time
thing/It just  happens/a lot/Walk with me/And  we will see/what  we have
got"  and "My  heart  is  broken/It is  worn  out  at the  knees/Hearing
muffled/Seeing blind/Soon  it will hit the  Deep Freeze" Vega  paints an
image of pain  and despair,  yet there's also acceptance  since "It just
happens/a lot."   In 'Luka'  "If you hear  something late  at night/Some
kind of trouble,  some kind of fight/ Just don't ask me what it was" and
"They only hit until  you cry/And after that you don't  ask why/You just
don't argue anymore" are hard hitting  lyrics,  but you can easily gloss
right over  them because  the beat is  as infectious  as the  lyrics are
poignant.
<p> 
   Vega has  smarts and she has  style.   She has a  slightly off-center
view of the world that has provided us with two wonderful albums full of
poetry to read AND listen to.    Rolling Stone Magazine called her music
'Uneasy Listening'.   In two words or less,  nothing describes her music
better.   Her music is haunting,   relaxing,  shocking,  subtle,  blunt,
melodic,  hard hitting and pleasant all at the same time.   Listening to
and reading Suzanne Vega can shake up the old brain cells.  She get it very well.
<p> 
   Both her  1985 LP and  the CD  of "Solitude Standing"  have excellent
sound and production.   Her debut album is  a little more sparse,  it is
mostly an acoustic album, with instrumentation than "Solitude Standing."
"Solitude" has a  much more noticable drum  mix and the CD  is virtually
flawless.
