Hello to you all!
<p>
I'm new in this mailinglist and i joined it because i found many 
interesting aspects to the songs of SuzyV at her site in the WWW.
<p>
Some of them matched my own interpretation of the lyrics while others 
were diffrent but none the less interesting.
<p>
I'm not a bonehard fan for suzanne but i like many of her songs! (BTW 
I'm not a fan for anyone, i don't want to be fanatic.) 
<p>
I've five CD's of her: SV,SS,DOTOH and 99.9F. I think of the DOTOH 
as the best one but the others aren't bad at all and well worth listening 
and buying. I didn't liked 99.9F at first. It was a cut to the style she 
performed earlier but after three or four times listening to the songs i 
found that they are simply an evolution of her way to make music.
<p>
In all the messages in this list i've missed a song that i like very much 
and wich is one of my favorite SuzyV songs "Gypsy". So i'm asking you 
real fans, how do you like it? Is it one of the songs you prefer or do 
think it's rubbish?
<p>
I've seen that Suzanne herself posts time after time to this list.
It is great to see that she acts here not as the big Star that she 
propably is but as a human beeing wich we all are.
So i have one question to her: Did you ever think that your line in that 
particular song,
"We strangers know each other now as part of the whole design"
could come true in such a nice way?
<p>
So i don't want to bother you anyfurther with my scribled lines
<p>

Rubbish??? No, not by a long shot, no. It's one of the songs I've loved most
in my life. But although I'm kind of known for analysing songs a lot, I
prefer not to write too much about Gypsy. I just want to let the song carry
me to a world of sweet dreams...
