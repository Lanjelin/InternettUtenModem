<p>
I am at your halfway station darling and I've been waiting<br>
for your train.<br>
I am at your halfway station darling and I've been waiting<br>
for your train.<br>
But you've been too long darling and it looks like rain.<br>
<p>
I have seen these strange little girls who come up to you<br>
and they don't know when to stop.<br>
I have watched your eye as it follows the line of the leg<br>
right up to the top.<br>
Now Betty Sue and Mary Jane have come around to play again,<br>
but I am standing at your door and I do believe I'll tell<br>
them to go home.<br>
<p>
There's this black widow spider darling and she's been<br>
walking on my hand.<br>
There's this black widow spider darling and she's been walking<br>
on my hand.<br>
And we've had this little heart to heart and I think I<br>
understand.<br>
<p>
It's a funny situation, I mean what am I to do?<br>
With Lisa in the upstairs room and Joan and Martha too.<br>
I can't come down to breakfast 'cause the plates have all<br>
been used.<br>
And it's as crowded as a subway car and I think that you're<br>
confused.<br>
Now I would wait at your station but I do believe it's time<br>
that I went home.<br>
<p>
I am at Black Widow station darling and I've been waiting for<br>
your train.<br>
I am at Black Widow station darling and I've been waiting for<br>
your train.<br>
You've been to long darling and it looks like rain.<br>
You've been to long darling and it looks like rain.<br>

<A NAME="blvdiers"><h2><b><i>The Boulevardiers</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
I like you <br>
and you like him <br>
and he likes me<br>
and we all love each other.<br>
We like to sit in the cafe <br>
and eat and drink and talk all day<br>
and watch the sun.<br>
We like to read the newspaper<br>
and talk about him and her<br>
and who is getting along with who these days,<br>
and when the sun goes down<br>
we walk along the cobblestone ground.<br>
<p>
He loves the city <br>
with the bricks and broken bottles<br>
and the pretty little flowers <br>
as they grow against the wall.<br>
He is dark, <br>
he is tall, <br>
he is the tallest one of all <br>
of us.<br>
You are bright and quick and fair<br>
and seems that you have lost some hair<br>
but this is all right.<br>
This is OK. We do not mind.<br>
We write and fight and sing <br>
and this is fine.<br>
<p>
We drink the wine <br>
if we get it free<br>
and if he buys you a coffee <br>
he can surely buy some for me<br>
and one day we will work real hard<br>
and get a job <br>
and not just sit here <br>
writing letters <br>
on this silly boulevard.<br>
And everyone will know our name<br>
and we'll be rich <br>
or we'll at least <br>
have some kind of fame.<br>
We'll be brave,<br>
we'll be bold,<br>
we'll come riding through <br>
like knights of old.<br>
<p>
The sun is like <br>
a lover's hand<br>
as it comes down <br>
and touches you<br>
touches me <br>
touches him<br>
touches you.<br>
And we have all got dirty feet<br>
from wearing sandals in the street,<br>
and we should all go home.<br>
But still you will <br>
insist insist<br>
until each last one has been kissed<br>
and each one is happy.<br>
And when the sun goes down<br>
we walk along the cobblestone ground.<br>
This is OK. We do not mind.<br>
We write and fight and sing<br>
and this is fine.<br>

<A NAME="brother"><h2><b><i>Brother Mine</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
Sonny boy, you need new sneakers<br>
Better go into town and get then Friday night<br>
Come to think of it, kid, you need just about everything<br>
But I think things are gonna be all right,<br>
Yes, I think things are gonna be all right.<br>
<p>
So you went and got yourself back into trouble<br>
Went and got yourself into another fight<br>
Come on here, let me see your eye, now it's all black and swollen<br>
But I think you're gonna be all right<br>
Yes, I think that you're gonna be all right.<br>
<p>
I don't know why you're such a troublemaker<br>
You'd think that maybe by now you'd see the light<br>
Getting yourself torn up, boy, and we don't have that much money<br>
But I think maybe things will be all right,<br>
Yes, I think maybe things will be all right.<br>
<p>
Now maybe I shouldn't yell<br>
'Cause I know you're just a kid<br>
But I can't always tell<br>
What's on your mind, half of the time, brother mine.<br>
<p>
Now I know that you're just my little brother<br>
And I don't expect you to get everything just right<br>
But I think you ought to use a little more sense than what you're using<br>
And maybe then things would be all right,<br>
Yes, and maybe then thing would be all right.<br>
<p>
I know that I sit and I worry too much<br>
Especially when you come home such a sight<br>
But I guess what you've got to do, boy, you go ahead and do it<br>
And I sure hope thing will be all right,<br>
Yes, I sure hope things will be all right.<br>
<p>
Now you come back here, you scruffy little brother<br>
Come on back here and let me kiss you goodnight<br>
'Cause I know if you were gone I'd miss the sound of laughter<br>
And that's gonna make everything all right,<br>
Yes, that's gonna make everything all right.<br>

<A NAME="caramel"><h2><b><i>Caramel</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
It won't do<br>
to dream of caramel<br>
to think of cinnamon<br>
and long for you.<br>
<p>
It won't do<br>
to stir a deep desire<br>
to fan a hidden fire<br>
that can never burn true.<br>
<p>
I know your name <br>
I know your skin<br>
I know the way<br>
These things begin<br>
<p>
But I don't know<br>
how I would live with myself<br>
What I'd forgive of myself<br>
If you don't go<br>
<p>
So goodbye<br>
Sweet appetite<br>
No single bite<br>
Could satisfy<br>
<p>
I know your name <br>
I know your skin<br>
I know the way<br>
These things begin<br>
<p>
But I don't know<br>
What I would give of myself<br>
how I would live with myself<br>
if you don't go.<br>
<p>
It won't do<br>
To dream of caramel<br>
To think of cinnamon<br>
And long for you.<br>

<A NAME="daniella"><h2><b><i>Daniella</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
Daniella, she sits by the tree in the playground<br>
sometimes we go there and the children all play<br>
But no one can tell me just where is Daniella<br>
when she looks in the distance that way<br>
<p>
Daniella, your hair is growing wild like a jungle<br>
like a garden of ivy that's been blown by the wind<br>
In the morning we brush it and tie it with a ribbon<br>
and in the evening it has flown loose again<br>
<p>
In the afternoon when the day seems forever<br>
and the night feels like never then she will sigh<br>
But no one can tell me just where is Daniella<br>
when her thoughts wander off to the sky<br>
<p>
Ilana's her friend, she runs fast like a squirrel<br>
she has big brown eyes and sometimes she cries<br>
But she stops very soon and they both play together<br>
making castles and strawberry pies<br>
<p>
And sometimes Daniella believes she's a sparrow<br>
she sits by the window and eats sunflower seeds<br>
She watches the rain and the birds on the rooftops<br>
often I wonder just what she sees<br>
<p>
In the afternoon when the day seems forever<br>
and the night feels like never then she will sigh<br>
Oh no one can tell me just where is Daniella<br>
when her thoughts wander off to the sky<br>

<A NAME="feather"><h2><b><i>Feather And Bone</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
you said, come with me<br>
and so I did<br>
I thought I could take<br>
all your sorrow<br>
I thought I could hold it all<br>
I never imagined<br>
your oceans<br>
so bitter<br>
the killing<br>
the falling<br>
the slaughter<br>
of feather and bone.<br>
<p>
I sat, still<br>
in the five o'clock light<br>
the sun came in through the crack<br>
the floor to your room<br>
was all splinters<br>
and, still,<br>
some are remaining<br>
through skin<br>
and through flesh<br>
cutting in patterns<br>
like diamonds<br>
like needles<br>
down to the bone.<br>
<p>
I had to know<br>
I had to see<br>
I can take it all<br>
but I will learn<br>
to be free<br>
<p>
I loved you<br>
more that you'll ever know<br>
even through broken windows<br>
through the blood as it<br>
ran down your fist<br>
even<br>
though it was my life<br>
and my truth<br>
and my hope<br>
and my window gone.<br>
<p>
and now<br>
if you think I'm<br>
coming back home<br>
first I should tell you a secret.<br>
I sleep with a sword near my hand<br>
each night<br>
sharpened with dreams<br>
of your body<br>
your murder<br>
your blood<br>
as it runs down<br>
my street.<br>

<A NAME="firstday"><h2><b><i>First Day Out</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
 Here I am at last, I've just jumped off the train<br>
I'm about to start my life as a wanderer in the rain<br>
I know so many people would give anything to be in my shoes<br>
Well, that's all right for them to say, but my shoes are soaked right through.<br>
<p>
I don't know what made me want to come all the way out here<br>
I guess when I was dreaming, my skies were always clear<br>
Now I'm here in a meadow with the rain streaming through my hair<br>
I guess this is what you call traveling freely, living without care.<br>
<p>
Here I am, all by myself, and I'll admit I'm scared<br>
All I've got is my guitar and a couple of dollars to spare<br>
And I know even that's not gonna last me long.<br>
<p>
I suppose I could pick myself up and carry myself back home<br>
But after what I put my folks through, I think I better stay alone.<br>
Anyhow, five years of aching are packed behind this plan<br>
Since I was ten, I've wanted to get out of the city and live out on the land.<br>
<p>
My parents thought I was crazy and I think now maybe they're right<br>
But I can still feel the freedom in following the eagle's flight.<br>
I just had to come and see what all the songs were about<br>
My hope is returning quickly and I don't think there's any doubt<br>
<p>
That I'd better start moving if I want to get somewhere<br>
I'll go on to the next town and see what I find there<br>
And stay a while until I go traveling on.<br>

<p>
If you had no name<br>
If you had no history<br>
If you had no books<br>
If you had no family<br>
<p>
If it were only you<br>
Naked on the grass<br>
Who would you be then?<br>
This is what he asked<br>
And I said I wasn't really sure<br>
But I would probably be<br>
Cold<br>

<A NAME="friends"><h2><b><i>Just Friends</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
We're friends, that's all we are <br>
and that's all we will become<br>
It's understood <br>
we're only friends<br>
And it's better that way <br>
for everyone concerned<br>
So if you brush against me <br>
when we're walking side by side<br>
I won't wonder what you're thinking <br>
'cause we've got nothing to hide<br>
And I know you didn't mean it that way<br>
'cause we're just friends<br>
<p>
We're friends, that's all we are <br>
and that's all we'll ever be<br>
Is friends<br>
And we can split the cheque<br>
But we'll never bring the conversation <br>
around to you and me<br>
If I see your hand upon me <br>
it's no reason for alarm<br>
I realize you must have seen<br>
something walking down my arm<br>
And I know you didn't mean it that way<br>
'cause we're just friends<br>
<p>
Oh I know, and you know<br>
that this is really the way <br>
that it ought to be<br>
'Cause if it was another way <br>
we'd have a lot of trouble<br>
and we'd end up in confusion<br>
and we'd lose a lot of sleep<br>
We both know better than to slip and go<br>
and get ourselves all tangled up again<br>
If we want to keep our peace of mind <br>
we've got to keep a little distance<br>
and just be friends<br>
<p>
Oh yeah, uh huh, oh
<p>
So I'll try to understand <br>
when I feel your arm around my back<br>
That you really meant to do something else<br>
but somehow you've gotten off the track<br>
'Cause I know you didn't mean it that way<br>
'cause we're just friends<br>
<p>
I know you didn't mean it that way<br>
oh I know, you didn't mean it that way<br>
yes I know, you didn't mean it that way<br>
'cause we're just friends<br>

<p>
Lightning struck a while ago<br>
And it's blazing much too fast<br>
But give it rain of waiting time<br>
And it will surely pass<br>
Blow over<br>
<p>
And it's happening so quickly<br>
As I feel the flaming time<br>
And I grope about the embers<br>
To relieve my stormy mind<br>
Blow over<br>
<p>
Shaken this has left me<br>
And laughing and undone<br>
With a blinding bolt of sleeplessness<br>
That's just begun<br>
And a windy crazy running<br>
Through the nights and through the days<br>
And a crackling<br>
Of the time burned away<br>
Burned away<br>
<p>
Now I feel it in my blood<br>
All hot and sharp and white<br>
With a whipcrack and a thunder<br>
And a flash of flooding light<br>
<p>
But there'll be a thick and smoky<br>
Silence in the air<br>
When the fire finally dies<br>
And I'm wondering who'll be left there<br>
<p>
In the ashes of the time<br>
Burned away<br>
Burned away<br>

If you want me<br>
You can find me<br>
Left of center<br>
Off of the strip<br>

In the outskirts<br>
In the fringes<br>
In the corner<br>
Out of the grip<br>
<p>
When they ask me<br>
"What are you looking at?"<br>
I always answer<br>
"Nothing much" (not much)<br>
I think they know that<br>
I'm looking at them<br>
I think they think<br>
I must be out of touch<br>
<p>
But I'm only<br>
In the outskirts<br>
And in the fringes<br>
On the edge<br>
And off the avenue<br>
And if you want me<br>
You can find me<br>
Left of center<br>
Wondering about you<br>
<p>
I think that somehow<br>
Somewhere inside of us<br>
We must be similar<br>
If not the same<br>
So I continue<br>
To be wanting you<br>
Left of center<br>
Against the grain<br>
<p>
If you want me<br>
You can find me<br>
Left of center<br>
Off of the strip<br>
In the outskirts<br>
In the fringes<br>
In the corner<br>
Out of the grip<br>

<A NAME="march"><h2><b><i>The Marching Dream</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
I have dreamed that many men<br>
Have marched across this field<br>
I have wished that I could take each man<br>
And hold him against the flame in my heart<br>
<p>
I had a dream that my face was old<br>
And all the children came to see<br>
First they laughed and then they ran<br>
And I slammed the door behind them<br>
<p>
And as the tears began to rise<br>
You climbed the stairs<br>
You came into my room<br>
Where I was waiting there<br>
<p>
Now I have dreamed of all men's arms<br>
But this time it was you<br>
I drew the curtains and it was dim<br>
And it was strange and it was new<br>
<p>
I have wished that I could hear<br>
Each secret told<br>
By lovers in the battle<br>
With each shade of red and gold<br>
<p>
I have wished that I could take each man<br>
And hold him to the flame<br>
And read the secret writing there<br>
And know each one by name<br>
<p>
I have dreamed that many men<br>
Have marched across this field<br>
I have wished that I could pour<br>
My life into each one<br>

Men will be men and they'll call me the governor<br>
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round<br>
Because this is my ship and I say it's my destiny<br>
And we'll all go up and go down, we go down, go down<br>

Andy's a saint or a savage, I forget<br>
Depends on the day and if he's eaten yet<br>
He's something to see when he's first out of bed<br>
Not that I'd know, I've just heard it said<br>

Said that men will be men and they'll call me the governor<br>

We know men will be men and they'll call me the governor<br>
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round<br>
Because this my ship and I say it's my destiny<br>

Come and sit with the whores and admire the view<br>
Drink down these beers, I think you've had a few<br>
Yes and don't look at me, I'm not selling today<br>

Say that men will be men and they'll call me the governor<br>

Go visit the king and then leave through the window<br>
Go hang with the gang and get lost in the fray<br>
<p>
Men will be men and they'll call me the governor<br>
I'll walk through the bar and I'll buy the next round<br>
Because this is my ship and I say it's my destiny<br>
And we'll all go up and go down, we go down, go down...<br>

<A NAME="nightsng"><h2><b><i>Night Song</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
It's 2 o'clock this morning<br>
every sane person is asleep<br>
I wonder where you are tonight<br>
and down whose hallways do you creep<br>
I know you, you're out somewhere<br>
you know you shouldn't be<br>
Anyhow, wherever you are, I know you're not thinking of me.<br>
<p>
So it's goodnight<br>
Maybe I'll see you in the morning<br>
Soldier of the night<br>
You try to combat the new day dawning<br>
Do you fear the light?<br>
Or do you fear the emptiness in your yawning?<br>
<p>
So you search for life by night<br>
Hidden from sight<br>
Safe within the night<br>
Lost in your crazy flight<br>
And looking for the fight<br>
That may prove you are someone<br>
But you can't stop the rising sun.<br>
<p>
When the sun comes up, the world can see your face<br>
You slink along the sidewalk, outnumbered and out of place<br>
All your boldness is gone, you stand there tongue-tied and shy<br>
<p>
And then it's goodnight<br>
You put on your criminal disguise<br>
Make sure your mask is tight<br>
Safe now from all accusing eyes<br>
You let loose in delight<br>
Attacking night walkers by surprise<br>
Protected by the night<br>
You feel you have the right<br>
To destroy all in your way<br>
With the anger built by day<br>
Now you have learned to kill<br>
And you do it just for spite<br>
The twisted rules of night<br>
Have caught you in its game<br>
Nobody knows your name<br>
But the day will come<br>
And you'll have no place to run<br>
<p>
Because you can't stop the rising sun.

We're all in one white field<br>
We thought there was no end<br>
Walking as the field went dry<br>
What did we do then?<br>
<p>
We're all in one white place<br>
Burning every leaf and bough<br>
Watching as the field goes dry<br>
And what do we do now?<br>
<p>
And what do we do now?

Smile no smile<br>
On this face today<br>
Jerk like a thing on a string<br>
And go join the parade<br>
<p>
Code will keep your privacy in<br>
It won't help to win friends<br>
Influence strangers<br>
Or otherwise be in the swim<br>
<p>
Mask will keep your features in check<br>
Cause face is the place<br>
Where the private goes public<br>
And steps through the gate<br>
<p>
Take your last kick now<br>
At any regime<br>
Smile no smile<br>
See if they see what you mean<br>

<p>
I am sitting by my window;<br>
I am thinking of my rent.<br>
I am looking through my pockets,<br>
and I'm wondering where it went.<br>
I am feeling like the Devil,<br>
maybe like the Devil's wife.<br>
I am singing for my supper.<br>
I am singing for my life.<br>
<p>
Things go up and things go down,<br>
and we have all these highs and lows,<br>
but are we even in the end,<br>
I don't think anybody knows,<br>
but when I look from my window<br>
I pretend that I'm in France.<br>
You know I never have been there<br>
but I might jump at the chance.<br>
<p>
Tell me what do you do <br>
with a troubled mind?<br>
Do you sing? Do you cry? <br>
Do you wait for a better time?<br>
Do you think about tomorrow <br>
when you're living in today?<br>
And can you stop this tide against you,<br>
make it go the other way?<br>
<p>
And when I look from my window<br>
I can hear the little bird sing;<br>
And I like to hear those little birds<br>
because then I know it's Spring.<br>
And Spring comes after Winter,<br>
surely all of this we know.<br>
And Spring is really coming,<br>
it's just so god damn slow.<br>
<p>
I am sitting by my window;<br>
I am thinking of my rent.<br>
I am looking through my pockets<br>

Tide came in<br>
And then went out<br>
And left behind<br>
In hollow places<br>
Cradled once<br>
And cooling twice<br>
You feel the sting of<br>
<p>
Salt water
<p>
Wave goes back <br>
And leaves the sand<br>
It's high and barren<br>
Dry and wasting<br>
Cradled once<br>
And cooling twice<br>
You feel the sting of<br>
<p>
Salt water
<p>
Taste this<br>
It's really raw<br>
It comes with the skin<br>
And the sand still on it<br>
And it comes with the shell<br>
And the flesh within it<br>
You can tell that it came<br>
From a seedy and watery place<br>
<p>
Taste this<br>
It's really good<br>
It will make your mouth<br>
Feel like something's in it<br>
And it's gotten and given<br>
From a cold black piece of the sea<br>
<p>
From a piece of the sea

Salt water

<A NAME="silver"><h2><b><i>The Silver Lady</i></b></h2></a>       
<p>
When I was a little girl<br>
Younger than nine or ten<br>
I once spoke to the Silver Lady<br>
But I never saw her again.<br>
<p>
To me she flew out of the sky<br>
She was born riding on the water<br>
Her hair blew all around her<br>
She was the crazy man's only daughter.<br>
<p>
I used to see her every day<br>
Riding her golden pony<br>
Only once did I hear her laugh<br>
And it echoed far and lonely.<br>
<p>
Once I watched the river run<br>
And I wandered too far from home<br>
There I met the Silver Lady<br>
She was crying, all alone.<br>
<p>
I said, "Lady, why are you crying?<br>
If I had wings like you<br>
I would be flying over this river<br>
And singing like only birds do."<br>
<p>
Well she threw back her head and she smiled at me<br>
Her tears, how they shone in the sun<br>
She said, "I have no wings to fly with<br>
If I did I would surely be gone.<br>
<p>
"My brothers have all gone far away<br>
To follow their hearts and be free<br>
But I am the youngest and my father is ageing<br>
And all he's got left is me.<br>
<p>
"I love my father dearly<br>
Madman though he may be<br>
It would break his heart if I should leave him<br>
But this life is killing me.<br>
<p>
"I feel the ocean pulling me<br>
The breezes come and tell me things<br>
I want to go with them wherever they go<br>
And see what the new morning brings."<br>
<p>
So she sadly turned away from me<br>
So I stumbled my way back home<br>
The next day I heard she had taken her horse<br>
And gone off to parts unknown.<br>
<p>
Her father stayed inside his lonely house<br>
And he never more came into town<br>
He could be seen roaming the riverside<br>
And they say that he jumped in and drowned.<br>
<p>
Long though I waited, she never returned<br>
But when I felt a silver breeze<br>
I knew she had sent it from wherever she was<br>
To tell us that now she was free.<br>

Too hot.  No air.<br>
Loud fan and a big tin can.<br>
Wait here.  Steer clear.<br>
They've gone to get your man.<br>
<p>
10 AM.<br>
Through gate 3 with picture ID.<br>
This old billfold<br>
Experiences security.<br>
<p>
I hear the click.  These men are hard.<br>
I'll see your face through bar and guard. <br>
You're new to me.  I'm new to you.<br>
I see your fate.  I'll see you <br>
You through.<br>
<p>
Ice within.<br>
And it's all cement in the government.<br>
Approved?  Then move<br>
To the plywood booth where the prisoner's sent.<br>
<p>
You read in red<br>
The letters on the door and you know what they're for.<br>
You feel unreal.<br>
And the rattling chain's coming over the floor.<br>
<p>
I hear the clock.  These walls are green.<br>
I see your face through tin and screen.<br>
You're new to me.  I'm new to you.<br>
I see your fate.  I'll see you<br>
You through.<br>
<p>
Too hot.  No air.<br>
Loud fan and a big tin can.<br>
Wait here.  Steer clear.<br>
They've gone to get your man.<br>
