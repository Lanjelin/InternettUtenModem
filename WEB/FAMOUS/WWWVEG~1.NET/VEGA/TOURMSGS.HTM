Hello everyone,
<p>
Does anyone know what kind of promotional activities A&M is planning for
the release of '9 Objects'?  I hope they come up with some creative stuff!
(We've already heard of some stations playing 'No Cheap Thrill,' so that's
a start.)  
<p>
I read that Warner Bros. is planning all sorts of events for REM's new one,
including playback parties in major markets, a call-in radio show with
band members, concert footage and video release parties at Tower Records
at midnight on the night before the release, in-store promotions, TV spots,
internet 'cybercasts', etc.  Of course, REM have become 'mega-stars.'
(REM's 'New Adventures in Hi-Fi' is also scheduled for release on Sept. 10,
but, for me, it will have to wait!).
<p>
OK, we know that A&M probably won't do all *that*, but let's hope they do
a good job of 'getting the word out.'  After all, it's been 4 years.  Will
Suzanne make any TV appearances?  What about international markets??  We all
know Suzanne has a rather large following in Europe, Japan, Australia, and
any other country I left out!  ;)  Let's have a worldwide party on Sept. 10!
<p>
-Rob

	NEW YORK-Always an artist who pushes herself to explore uncharted musical
territory, Suzanne Vega was presented with the ultimate challenge two years
ago, when her first child was born.<BR>
	Suddenly, she found herself with precious little time to devote to
songwriting, performing, and recording.  Eventually, however, she and her
husband/producer, Mitchell Froom, hit their stride and got down to the
business of recording her fifth studio album.<BR>
	The result of their efforts is "Nine Objects Of Desire," the follow-up to
Vega's acclaimed 1993 release "99.9' F." Due Sept. 10 on A&M Records, "Nine
Objects" is a sultry, exotic recording that features Froom's artful
production and inspired performances from drummers Pete Thomas and Jerry
Marotta, bassists Bruce Thomas and Sebastian Steinberg (of Soul Coughing
fame), and Froom and engineer Tchad Blake on various instruments.  The album
was recorded at the Magic Shop in New York and mixed at Sound Factory in Los
Angeles.<BR>
	Vega describes "Nine Objects" as "a sexier album than any other one I’ve
made" and a "less defiant" record than its predecessor, which emphasized
edgy, industrial sounds.  She adds that the new record is "not a retro
album," despite the lounge-like styling on the sleeve for "Caramel," her
single from the soundtrack to "The -Truth About Cats And Dogs," issued
earlier this year.<BR>
	"A lot of people are thinking that the whole album is going to be like
'Caramel' and it's going to be lounge music, but I don't think it is," says
Vega.  "It has a funkiness about it."<BR>
	A&M plans to aggressively promote "Nine Objects" to Vega's eclectic fan
base, which spans the triple-A, alternative folk, modern rock, and AC
formats.  The album's first single and video is "No Cheap Thrilll," an
uptempo, catchy cut.  The track goes to radio Aug. 14.
<P>
<i>(odd technical problems snipped)</i>
<P>
About the title:  "In every one of these songs there's an object of desire.
 It's either me desiring someone or someone desiring someone else or someone
desiring me.  And there are different types of desire, so I added them all up
and there were nine.  I thought of lying and calling it 'Seven Objects of
Desire' or calling it 'Twelve Songs About Desire', but then I thought it
would be more accurate to say it was nine."

Hi, Michael. Usually, the release dates are worldwide ones. So if there's a
big music store near you you should get the album at the same time as
everybody. If there's not such a big store near you, I suggest you just ask
your usual music store when they think they will get it. I don't think Eric
can help you, it all depends on the stores.

Make that (heavy sigh)
<P>
Starting in Baltimore and coming to Atlanta and heading back up to 
DC sounds like she's *not* coming to Florida. It's the classic 
sorta-coming-down-this-way-but-not-quite-far-enough tour syndrome.
<P>
And is that Atlanta date a *Tuesday*?
<P>
Oh well, this means one thing: road trip. (If the show starts at 8 
and I leave at, say, noon, I can make it). And develop some exotic 
disease to keep me out of work for a couple days. (Then again, if I 
leave Atlanta at midnight and get home at 8 a.m. .... The things you 
do for your favorite musicians.) "Gosh, boss, I think I had that 
Ebola virus, but then I took these pills that Rush Limbaugh 
recommended and it cleared right up! Only I have this sudden desire 
to vote for Dole."
<P>
Hey, David's coming all the way from France, right?
<P>
That's all right. I wasn't using this jugular vein anyway.
<P>
Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.
<P>
-- Bob, who's just depressed about something else and am probably
just projecting right now and in any case will not, under any
circumstances, allow this tour to pass through any adjoining or, if
necessary, non-adjoining states without managing to hook up with it 
at some point, even if I have to get there via a ValuJet plane during 
a week when the airline is having its Oxygen Canisters Fly Free 
promotion (uh oh, and that's not that Olympic guard across the aisle, 
is it? ...)
<P>
P.S. You know, Gainesville, FL, is only *five* hours south of Atlanta 
and sort of a Musical Hot Spot (tm) right now. Suzanne could play in 
the very town where Meringue and Big White Undies got their start.  And 
then there's always Yeehaw Junction nearby.
<P>
Just a suggestion.

Yeah, Eric, but this happens *all the time* and the harbingers are 
not good. They've already said it's going to be a brief tour, so I 
can't imagine she'll spend two weeks bopping up and down between D.C. 
and Florida when she has the rest of a continent to conquer.
<P>
I do intend to see her no matter what. But if it's real far away I
won't be able to drag along my non-Vega-fanatic friends, who would
probably raise all kinds of silly objections like "you want to drive
20 hours round trip for a _folk music concert_?????!!!!!" That would
be a shame, since I can think of a few who I think would really
enjoy seeing her.
<P>
It's funny you mention Miami -- it's a major city, but does anybody 
ever play down there? I know the huge national tours usually do, but 
I imagine that a lot of small-to-middlin' acts find that awfully far south 
to travel. The ones that show up here often end up in some kind of 
Gainesville-Orlando-Tampa Bay loop.
<P>
Oh well. I won't hold my breath either, but I'll cross my fingers.
<P>
-- Bob, making a brief foray out of Election Season Hell
<P>
P.S. I seem to remember a statistic that Florida residents are 4.9 
times more likely than the average American to buy all of a 
musician's CDs after seeing the musician on tour, especially if the 
musician is a white-but-raised-Puerto-Rican New York folk singer who 
has had a child in the past couple of years. I don't remember the 
source, but I'm sure it was reliable. Stats don't lie, do they?
<P>
Also, Floridians are 2.3 times more likely to hold standing ovations 
for songs containing the words "Queen," "and," and "Soldier." And 
only one-third as likely as Arizonans to call out for "Freebird."
<P>
Also, if the election were held today, 23 percent of registered 
Florida voters would vote for Ruby.

I also am curious as to what promo material will be used prior to or at 
release time of "9 Objects of Desire". I am a native Philadelphian now 
residing in Tampa, and have found quite a "Vega-less Vacuum" down south. 
I notice than when Suzanne tours, she does a northeast run, then goes to 
Europe.  I certainly hope she comes down this way once the entire tour 
schedule comes out.
<P>
I was at an Indigo Girls concert recently, and I wore my "Days of Open 
Hand" concert t-shirt.  You would not believe the number of people who 
asked me where I obtained the shirt and where they could get one.
<P>
I can't wait for the release of "9 Objects", and look forward to years of 
enjoyment listening to her insightful, soulful musings.

Hello everyone,  (international readers may want to skip this one!)
<P>
Well, I'm officially bummed by the recent annoucment of the remaining 
dates.  Seems there's a gaping hole in the U.S. that extends roughly from
Atlanta west along I-20 and I-10 all the way to L.A.  That's right, folks-
no dates anywhere near Texas or Louisiana.  Those in the Midwest get
Chicago, Detroit or St. Paul.  She's also going to Denver, and there are
plenty of stops on the West Coast, with 3 shows in southern Calif. alone.
She's even doing a few shows in Canada.
<P>
I would like to know why Suzanne and her management chose to limit the
tour to only these locations.  Are places like Dallas, Houston, Austin,
San Antonio, New Orleans, and the entire state of Florida, not considered
"major markets"?  She *is* going to Burlington, VT, though.  Incredible.  
(not to slight anyone in the Northeast, but you get Boston & Northampton 
too).  What were these decisions based on?  Cost, logistics, demographics,
results from the last tour, presumed fan base locations, album sales??
<P>
Anyone else want to campaign for more/different dates?  I know she wants
to limit the tour, be at home more often, etc, but maybe some re-shuffling,
a few more dates, or at least an explanation is in order here.  How about
a stop somewhere in TX or LA on the way back from the last scheduled
concert in Ventura, CA on 11/22?  Just an idea.  
<P>
Opinions anyone?,
<P>

Clinton on the phone was just a tired attempt to make up for it. For want
of a nail ... (If you're outside the US and don't get what I'm talking
about -- count yourself lucky).
<P>
Anyone else surprised the Democrats didn't use "Bad Wisdom" as their
convention theme song? I thought Gore was gonna do the macarena to "Wooden
Horse." Guess I was mislead. It was funny, however, to see Dole
lip-synching to "As Girls Go."

Actually, it's uncanny how closely Suzanne's tour mirrors President
Clinton's strategy to lock up enough electoral votes to win in November: 
<P>
Clinton cannot win without California and its 54 electoral votes, the most
of any state. Hence, he's visited that state at least two dozen times.
Suzanne oddly parallels that strategy with her numerous scheduled
California shows, on top of the one she just did.
<P>
She also goes after the Northwestern states of Oregon and Washington, with
their combined 18 electoral votes. They're solidly in the Democratic
column, so Clinton is counting on them too.
<P>
Suzanne has scheduled stops in New York (33 votes), which is leaning
Democratic, and Pennsylvania (23), which is up for grabs, and she's aiming
to get Georgia (13), which went for Clinton in '92. The District of
Columbia always votes Democrat, though of course it just counts for 3
votes.  Massachusetts (12) is, as always, in the liberal camp. 
<P>
Then observe her swing through the Midwest: Illinois (22 votes), Michigan
(18) and Minnesota (10). Just like Clinton's recent whistlestop tour. Is
Suzanne ditching the tour bus for a train?
<P>
Finally, Clinton needs at least one Western state to prevent a Dole sweep
in that region. Suzanne opts for Colorado, the state of Gary Hart and Pat
Schroeder, with its 8 electoral votes.
<P>
Unfortunately, this strategy leaves Suzanne with only 214 electoral votes,
far short of the 270 needed to win the White House, and would therefore
leave Jack "Gold Standard" Kemp a heartbeat away from the presidency.
<P>
Can America take that risk?
<P>
Clinton's strategy at this point is to pursue several other Midwestern and
Southern states -- Iowa, Missouri and, of course, Arkansas -- as well as
New Mexico and all of New England except for New Hampshire. However, just
by adding concerts in Florida (25) and Texas (32), Suzanne would rack up
271 votes, just barely eking out a victory and making presidential
history.
<P>
Um, I think I forget what my point was going to be. Anyone else think I
need to get a life?
<P>
Remember, Suzanne: It takes a village!

I'll guess that such decisions are based on perceived fan base
locations.  And except for the concentration of Northeast dates
(where's she's from, close to home), her tour itinerary is not all

Has she played there before? If so, did fans show up? Does she sell a
lot of albums there? Does she get played on the radio? [hell, strike

Morrisette would play everywhere every night :-)].

There is not a Boston Date scheduled, which is lame because on her last tour
for 99.9 she played a 21+ show and i couldn't get in. I could not make it to
newport this year either, BUT, because of the list I have scheduled the 11th
off and will be taking a greyhound down (entire time in Boston ~3 hours) and
back to Bangor ME @ midnight, just to see her. I *HOPE* she would at least
play a couple songs at her instore, I'm willing to take pictures for the WEB
page (even have access to a scanner) of course if she did play, Gypsy would
be incredible...although I still cannot get over how incredible her first
album is. I can't put words to it, maybe because I know Suzanne reads this.

Well, I do find this "let's do both coasts and few dates in the Midwest 
and that'll do it" mentality *very* odd.  The south central part of the
country isn't 'hip' enough?

Regarding Texas and Louisiana:<BR>

<P>
Yes, yes, don't know, sometimes.  I was at the shows in 1987 and '90 in 
Austin and she drew around 1500 people each time.  I know that she played
Dallas and Houston also on these tours.  In '93, I'm pretty sure she did
at least 2 shows in Texas.  I know she's cutting back on this tour, but
not even *one* show anywhere in the area?  Doesn't make sense to me at all.
Austin has (or at least had, last time I was there) some very cool radio
stations that played SV.  Even Houston too, where I think Sarah McLachlan
drew record crowds when she came through in '94-'95.  <sigh>
<P>
Still waiting for answers and hoping for more dates,

<p>
Hi Everyone - 
<p>
Suzanne's manager, Ron Fierstein, has read through the notes on Suzanne's
Fall tour destinations.  I forward his reply...
<p>
Eric<br>
========================================================<br>
<p>

I'm Ron Fierstein, Suzanne's manager.  I've taken note of some disappointment
expressed over the fact that Suzanne's Fall tour will be missing certain
portions of the country.  I think you deserve an explanation.
<p>
Actually, the reasons are all those obvious ones I've read you all postulate.
 This tour is meant to be an "album launch" tour.  As such, it is designed
specifically to reach Suzanne's top 14 or 15 sales markets, determined from
the Soundscan sales data we have on 99.9F.  It is not coincidental that many
of the tour markets are the same ones in which she will be doing promotional
activities (i.e., on-air radio and in-store appearances) during the weeks of
release.  The theory is to create a cumulative media profile for Suzanne in
those markets to help get the album off to a solid sales start during what is
a very competitive time of year at retail.  Regarding Canada, that is a
separate market from the US, and we have to do something to support the A&M
company there, thus the 3 shows in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
<p>
Some of the other markets we're doing, e.g., Burlington, Northhampton, and
even  Portland OR, are what I call "routing" shows.  That is, they help fill
in between dates in the target markets.  Because of problems with venue
availabilities, it's not always possible to book your "dream" tour on the
specific dates you might want, and you often find yourself waiting around in
an area for a day or two in order to make sure that the key shows are in the
right venues on the right nights.  It's financially sensible to fill those
dates with shows in secondary markets when possible.
<p>
As for the South, we run into several problems.  One is that none of those
markets have been particularly strong for Suzanne, either in terms of record
or ticket sales.  For example, from the point of view of record sales,
Minneapolis is Suzanne's #15 sales market on 99.9F, having sold about 5,000
units there to date.  Compare the sales numbers for the South:  Miami
(3,826), Tampa (2,067), New Orleans (2,118).  The Texas figures are somewhat
better -- Dallas (4,375), Houston (3,690), San Antonio (1,200), Austin
(1,542) -- but that leads to the other main issues:  time and logistics.
<p>
Given that Suzanne has only a limited time for this tour -- we had to
allocate time to other markets, e.g., Europe -- we obviously had to
prioritize.  Also, the expense of bringing this particular tour to markets in
which we could only play small venues, or to markets (e.g., Miami) that take
substantial time to get to and from, is just too problematic, i.e., we'd lose
too much money.  On this tour Suzanne will be appearing with a full band
consisting of Mitchell Froom (keyboards), Pete Thomas (drums), Steve Donnelly
(guitar) and Mike Visceglia (bass).  Even in our "big" markets, this tour
will break even at best.
 <p>
I know all this explanation is not much in the way of consolation.  You have
no idea how much Suzanne and I appreciate the effort some of you will
apparently be making to catch one or more of these shows.  I want you to know
that we are cognizant of your concerns and gripes, and that Suzanne and I
will consider how to address them in the future.  We certainly hope that this
album does well enough to enable Suzanne to do a more comprehensive tour next
year.
<p>
Thanks again on behalf of both of us for your continuing support.
<p>
With best regards,
<p>
Ron

three articles in the French press: 
<p>
-this week's "Le Nouvel Observateur": no photo, just a few lines where they
say  that Suzanne's new album is great and will feature bossa-nova, jazz and
hip-hop  rythms, that  the mood is a bit like the ones Angelo Badalamenti
(Twin Peaks,  Julie Cruise,  last Marianne Faithfull album) makes, and that
there will be some  oriental violins and  Hammond organ... they say that
Vega still shines. 
<p>
-this week's "Les Inrockuptibles" (rock magazine): a color picture where she
doesn't seem very comfortable. A few lines where they only say good things,
and  they say that there will be Pete and Bruce Thomas at drums/percussions
and   Tchad Blake at the guitar. They say that with the song 'Headshots' she
could  even make a  hit as big as 'Luka'. And they also say that after
coming in Paris  this fall  (October 4th from Eric) for an intimist concert
(does it mean  acoustic?) she will  make a big tour in the spring. (Maybe
she'll go to Florida  then, Bob). 
<p>
-This week's "L'Express". I don't have it but a friend will cut the page for
me:  he told me it was a full page article with a color photo of Suzanne on
a sofa   with a glass of champagne.
<p>
Just to let you know. <br>
Maybe you have a bookshop near you with international press. 
 <p>

Besides, I'm amazed about the album being released in January in the UK. 4
more months! I think it doesn't make sense at all because the stations, and
TV channels won't wait this long, and so the English will hear and see her
new material in September and when the album is released, they won't feel
they need it anymore.

Hello everyone,
<p>
I just read the note from Ron Fierstein on the tour.  I'd like to thank him
for providing this detailed explanation of the markets, logisitics, etc.
It really helped me to understand what goes into making the decisions.
(Thanks also to Eric for posting this.)
<p>
I may be prejudiced, but I do feel that the album sales "cut-off" from
#15 in Minneapolis of around 5,000 to Dallas (4,375) is cutting it
rather fine.  If you add up the Texas numbers, plus throw in N.O., it
comes to around 11,000.  Quite a substantial market to pass up, since
a concert in one TX venue would likely draw in fans from a large area.
<p>

I suppose I can't argue on this one.
<p>

<p>
You are correct, sir.  :(
<p>
>We certainly hope that this<br>

<p>
Yes, me too.  I'm sure there are quite a few others who feel the same way.
And I've got a few suggestions on markets and venues for that one, if it
happens!  ;)
<p>
>Thanks again on behalf of both of us for your continuing support.

We appreciate your time and effort as well.  Thanks again, Ron and Suzanne

<p>
In fact, Dallas and San Antonio are 270 miles apart. Granted Texas is a
large state. It is further to drive diagonally from the Gulf Coast north
west to the Panhandle than to drive from Dallas to Chicago. But concerts
in Dallas can attract people from within a 200 mile radius. I recently
saw Tori Amos in Dallas and helped a out a guy on the Net wanting directions
in Dallas after he arrived from Shreveport, LA, about 160 miles. Also
Dallas, Austin, Houston and San Antonio are within an hour of each other
by Southwest Airlines at reasonable prices, as is Little Rock, Oklahoma City,
and Tulsa. Neil Young is currently touring and if he comes to any of these
cities, I will certainly go. 
<p>
>Besides, how many fans who now own the album will actualy go to shows?
<p>
What is this contention based on? We regularly draw 55,000 for stadium 
acts like the Rolling Stones and 17,000 for other shows. The question of
how many people owning the album will go to the shows has nothing to do 
with this being Texas. I have seen Suzanne in Dallas twice and believe me
she has a strong fan base and played to very full venues. 
<p>
>Also, there must be deminshing returns; the farther you get from one city,
the <br> >less fans from that city will attend.
<p>
This may be true in some areas, but the Dallas/Fort Worth area is considered
a hub in the North Texas area and regularly attracts people from a wide
radius for entertainment and  shopping  and is a major travel hub because
of DFW Airport.
  <p>
>Also, consider the LA area in California. The population of the five

California is<br>

And in 1:200th the<br>

 <p>
And Manhattan has 7 million people living in the same amount of space 
as the DFW Airport. So acts play several nights in these cities but can still
sell out the same size show for one or two nights in Dallas. And  we have
a lower cost of living and somewhat slower lifestyle than LA or Manhattan.

<p>
In other words if you don't live on THE COAST, either east or west, you are
too rural to understand high brow entertainment like intelligent musicians
or theater. Your last sentence (with the big sky comes small artists) is 
so elitist that I can't comment on it using words proper in mixed company.

I didn't mean it as an insult, per se'. Just a fact. I have no special
affinity for the west coast; I was trying to make a point. If you live in a
place with fewer people, you're going to have to work harder to see the
artists you like. Especialy with someone like Ms. Vega, who doesn't exactly
demand the largest of crowds.

I was being a little dramatic for effect, but it still just isn't true that
Dallas is too small to attract the big concerts. We have well over 2 million
people in the immediate metropolitan area and several hundred thousand more in
surrounding areas to draw an audience from. Acts like Suzanne Vega DO draw
big audiences and sell out. We have never had a problem attracting the big
acts. Even Springsteen played here on his solo acoustic tour.  You are just
mistaken that Dallas cannot attract audiences for big name acts or smaller
acts like Suzanne, Natalie Merchant, Nanci Griffith, Lyle Lovett, Sheryl Crow,
and numerous others who play venues smaller than the 17,000 people acts. We 
have several venues in the DFW area for these type acts with capacities of
several hundred to 3,000 and they regularly sell out.

Hello everyone,
<p>
Well, the comments about Texas shows (or lack thereof) seem to have sparked
a little conversation.  If anyone still cares about this discussion, here
are a few more thoughts.
<p>

<p>
How so?  Yes, she can saturate Calif., and the L.A. area will always be a
prime market for introducing new material.  However, if your objective is
to promote the album on a nationwide or worldwide basis, you shouldn't 
simply ignore entire sections of the country, where you at least have a
foothold.  Again, Suzanne *has* drawn large, enthusiastic crowds at the
shows she's played in Dallas, Houston, Austin, etc. 
<p>
Max Headroom again:<br>

<p>
Sorry, this sweeping generalization of a place with "fewer people," and
"wide open spaces" just doesn't wash.  With regard to demographics, the 
alternative (ugh) radio station / coffeehouse folk-club / 3000-seat venue
scene is alive and well in DFW/Houston/Austin, and 'smaller' acts do play 
in them.  I can name several radio stations that I'm sure would be glad 
to host on-air appearances by Suzanne.   Stephen Wiener's last post 
summed it up quite nicely. 
<p>
I accept Ron Fierstein's explanation of mediocre album/ticket sales in
these markets, and the time/logistical constraints they're forced to
deal with.  However, as Eric posted earlier, not touring in these areas
can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy:  Suzanne doesn't tour because the
albums don't sell well, because she doesn't tour, etc.  I hope she will
do a more extensive tour next year, or at least some solo acoustic dates 
in the 'smaller' markets.  
<p>
