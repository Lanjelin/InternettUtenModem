"Portugal?" says my brother. "Isn't that a totally coastal country?" he
says, in that American way some people have of speaking.
<p>
Yes, it is totally coastal, I tell him. It's a total coast, with miles
of beach. It's a fishing country, where fishermen still sail every day,
and people cook sardines by leaning out of their windows, and grilling
them on the small and winding streets in the older parts of Lisbon. I
remember seeing the ocean in Portugal for the first time. It was at
night, and the hotel restaurant looked out over the water. I wanted to
know, what was the color? Blue or turquoise or green?
<p>
Have you never seen the ocean before? my host wanted to know. Of course
I had seen the ocean, but never this one. I looked out at the expanse
of the sea that night, and then the next morning, looking at the clear
gold light of the sun over so much water, I felt the weight of the
history. You feel this history in the sea; which, of course, is
eternal; and in the buildings. The light and the architecture combine
to make beautiful sweeping views, like an old painting - the towers and
clocks against the play of clouds and sea have a rich lovely color, so
different from the pale watery stark light of Germany or Northern
England. These buildings were alive during the centuries following the
8th century Moorish occupation, and are still alive today, although
some have very modern graffiti on them. For those who are interested in
this history, much of the old architecture is intact because Portugal
was untouched in the two World Wars.
<p>
But besides all these weighty historical feelings, I also felt all
possibilities open for the future, as though I were a kind of female
Henry the Navigator surveying the avenues of exploration upon the
horizon. I had the feeling if I looked hard enough perhaps I could see
my apartment in Manhattan, which looks over the Hudson River. Portugal
is not mummified, or kept behind glass, self-consciously historical and
prim; it is down to earth, sometimes dirty, and sometimes elegant, but
always alive and friendly.
<p>
I was invited in 1988 to visit the President Soares at the Palace,
which surprise me, as I am not used to invitations from high places.
Why? I wondered. Would my visit provoke any protest? Yes, they liked
him. No, they would not protest. He seemed to have the rare talent of
being able to please both the left and the right wing at the same
time - a liberal conservative of sorts. I was impressed. In my country,
all you ever heard was complaints against the government, especially in
New York, and I have never known a people to be happy with their
elected representatives.
<p>
Their President was gracious, but neither of us spoke the other one's
language. We smiled at each other a lot. I went with someone from the
record company, my boyfriend, and my manager. We sat down in a line and
spoke for a few minutes, had our pictures taken, and then we got up and
began to mill around the beautiful palace which looks something like a
museum. Formal circumstances, even as informal as these, always make me
uncomfortable, so I thought that I would initiate a movement to
conclude our visit, and marched forward confidently to the huge front
doors and tried to throw them open.
<p>
"Oh, Miss Vega, wouldn't you rather leave through the front door rather
than the second story window?" said the guard, running over to prevent
me from flinging myself off the balcony. It still makes me laugh to
think about it, but the President was kind, and I was pleased he took
the time to invite me.
<p>
We had a press conference that night, in a small club. I told the story
there, and it made the front row laugh. I had seen these same young
women at the airport the day before. My memories are that I was mobbed
when I arrived. The reality was probably that there were more like ten
people, but I remember the photographers, and the pictures they snapped
of my surprised face as we drove away in the car. They printed them
with gusto the next day in the newspapers.
<p>
I had lunch with some of the journalists during my visit, which I
loved, because the weather was soft and sunny, and we ate outdoors in a
restaurant with painted tiles near the entrance. There were leaves
overhead, and we ate fish and drank <i>vinho verde</i>. I told them I
felt I was a journalist in my songs, and they responded that they felt
they were artists.
<p>
Why did you write about the Portuguese women in your song Ironbound?
they wanted to know. Because I had seen some Portuguese women in the
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey, near where I live, and that
they looked very beautiful and womanly to me, and that it made me feel
that I was in a romantic and warm place far away, like Lisbon. When I
sing that line on stage, all eight thousand people in the audience in
Lisbon, or Oporto, or Cascais, cheer and scream and sing along happily.
They wave their arms and celebrate.
<p>
There was one Portuguese woman who sang and played the guitar to warm
up the audience for me a few times. Her name was Pilar, and she sang by
herself, with no band or other accompaniment. I remember mostly her
dark lustrous hair and her beautiful sad songs, and her voice that
sounded ripped from her, or torn out of her. One minute her voice was
caressing, and the next sad; she would croon, hiccup, cry and accuse.
It had an extraordinary effect on the audience, especially the men and
boys; they howled in response. It didn't seem to matter which words she
sang. They howled in response to the pure sound of her voice. I did
too, within myself.
<p>
I believe that the soul of Portugal, besides being the sea, is in the
songs. I went to a small club one night, where a woman was singing
unamplified in the center of the room, with her head thrown back, like
she was wailing or moaning. Everyone pressed in close to her. This was
<i>fado</i> singing, a kind of singing that began in the 16th century,
and continues today. The songs are about desire, fate, and human
passions, and are usually very sad. I understand why.
<p>
An imposing man followed her, and I heard whispers that this singer was
a judge in his daily life. Again I was impressed, as in the United
States you would never see a judge singing in a nightclub. Here it
seemed the most natural thing. Who should sing about fate and human
destiny if not a judge? As he sang, he turned around so the entire room
could see him; he seemed to look in my direction and his mouth opened
very wide (at me?); a tremendous sound of singing and wailing poured
out of him. I felt flattened against the wall and for a moment was
relieved that he was not my father, and that he had no cause to be
angry at me, as I would not want to provoke such wrath. Afterwards we
talked in a friendly way and he gave me one of his recordings.
<p>
The last image I have of Portugal was just before Christmas one year,
when I was in our tour bus, riding through the warm streets, looking at
the grocery stores with huge pieces of dried codfish hanging outside.
Some of these hanging fish are as big as a man. On one street corner in
front of all this fish was a man, in fact, waiting for the light to
change, and casually smoking a cigarette with his hand on his hip. He
was thin, and looked tired, and he needed a shave. Perhaps this would
not have made an impression, except that he was dressed as Santa Claus,
and his red pants hung low around his dark narrow hips. He made no
pretence of being jolly or fat or nice, and I admired him for it.
Beside this I remember the faces, which to me look like those of my
family, though not my own - the dark skin and the large dark eyes, the
round faces and the wide cheekbones of my brothers and sister I grew up
with.
