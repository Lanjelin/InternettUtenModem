...although I am not (by any means) an expert, I could only tell you
what I 
envision when reading the lyrics/listening to the CD.

I see a boy whose "small, white wooden horse" is source of hope and his

inner strenght-perhaps his soul.  In it, he uses his imagination as it 
becomes something that pulls him out of the 
darkness.  There is a lot of imagery between the darkness and 
light.  Perhaps, being in the darkness with the WHITE horse....?
Perhaps, there is much more behind the wooden horse: "...what was wood 
became alive." 
<p>
I sense confusion and doubt in the young boy's self-identity...perhaps 
wanting to be something other than ..a writer like my father..."


...anyone else?

I thought for sure somebody all-knowing would answer this, 
but they haven't so far.
<p>
Casper Hauser is a character in a foreign film made in
the seventies about a young boy who lived in a basement
for all of his life, and finally comes
out of the basement as a teenager---or around 20 or so.
the village he finds is more fascinated with him than
he is with them.  A few friends watched the movie
about three years ago, and thought it was deadly
boring.  but, their opinions, not mine.  
I can't remember the name of the film, but I can find
out later today.  let me know if someone's interested.

Subj:      Caspar Hauser's Song (Long Interpretation)<br>
<p>

I'm really glad someone asked about "Wooden Horse (Caspar
Hauser's Song)," as it's my all-time favorite Suzanne Vega
song and one that has never failed to move me since I first
heard it seven years ago. (This song, along with "Queen and 
the Soldier," literally had chills running up and down my 
spine the last time I saw her perform them, back in 1990 in 
Tampa. A cliche, but true.)
<p>
Hauser, from what little I've read, was a German boy in the 
19th century whose parents supposedly kept him locked alone in 
the basement until he was 17 or so, with only his toy wooden 
horse to keep him company. By itself it's a compelling story
with elements of bizarre cruelty (in a sense, this is the
second child-abuse song on the album, along with "Luka") and
questions about what it means to grow up without human contact.
Caspar certainly fits in well with the other wounded, skewed
survivors who populate much of the Vega canon; and, as she often
does, she tells it from the first person. She called it "a 
point of view I couldn't resist" when she performed the song in
Phoenix in '87.
<p>
But ask yourself this as a little creative exercise: If you
were to write a song about Caspar, how would you do it? Then
look at what Suzanne wrote. If you need a demonstration of
what a tremendously gifted artist she is (and no one on this
list should), I think this is it: What a lesser songwriter would
turn into a preachy ballad or weepy lamentation (imagine a guitar
strumming while someone sings "17 years of darkness/no bright sun 
above me/no friends to play with/no kind hands to love me"), she 
has turned into a chilling, mystical song that's both universal
and semi-autobiographical.
<p>
I think she sees herself in Caspar. Because of her song, I see
myself in him as well. I think the song is about, generally,
the wonder and fear of growing up and becoming a person -- and,
specifically, about her own wonder and fear of the artistic 
gift she carries.
<p>
Consider these lines: 
<p>
"I came out of the darkness" -- so did all of us: out of the 
womb, and out of the darkness of our earliest childhood, the
part we no longer remember.
<p>
"Holding one thing<br>
The small white wooden horse<br>
I'd been holding inside."<br>
<p>
   -- Wood is dead, inanimate. Caspar held it inside his basement,
a surrogate for the living friends he never had. Inside of _us_,
it's our potential, whatever gift we've been blessed with, dead
like a seed before it starts to germinate. In Suzanne it was
the artistic gift that was to start showing itself when she
began writing music.
<p>

"In the night the walls disappeared<br>
In the day they returned."<br>
<p>
   -- These, two of the most perfect lines you will find in any 
song, are loaded with meaning. This was literally true for Caspar;
at night he couldn't see his walls anymore. It's also true for us:
the night, when we dream or lie awake with our dreams, is when we
pass beyond the walls or limitations that surround us in the daylight
world. I think it's especially true for children, whose waking lives
are limited by the adults around them. Imagine the young Suzanne
Vega in bed, dreaming up stories, dreaming of who she would become.
<p>
" 'I want to be a rider like my father'<br>
Were the only words I could say."<br>
<p>
   -- Caspar's dream is to be a rider, with a living horse, and I
also sense the longing for the absent father. It's sort of 
interesting that "rider" sounds like "writer"; isn't Suzanne's
father a writer? (I mean the one who raised her.)
<p>
"Alive<br>
And I fell under<br>
A moving piece of sun<br>
Freedom"<br>
<p>
   -- Pretty obvious, I think: Caspar emerges into the outside world.
Suzanne discovers her ability to create. We discover whatever is
bright and alive in us. This is the song's one fleeting moment
of joy.
<p>
Then we go back to "I came out of the darkness/holding one thing",
but end it with:
<p>
"I know I have this power<br>
I'm afraid I may be killed."<br>
<p>
    -- This is kind of a bizarre couple of lines if the song is
still about Caspar; my first reaction was "huh"? What power? Has
Caspar's solitude turned him paranoid?
<p>
    I believe it refers partly to Suzanne's power, the creative gift
that allows her to form songs that take lives of their own and
live in other people. It sounds to me that she is both joyous 
and in awe of this gift. To some, the ability to create life where
none existed before belongs to God, or the gods; to have such a
gift is to risk divine retribution. To have a great treasure is
to fear that others will try to take it.
<p>    Maybe most of all, to know what a great power we have in being 
alive and human is to fear death, which can take it all away.
Maybe the worst thing is to know how precious life is when it
is about to end. Maybe Caspar, once he found the life he was
deprived of, feared he was about to lose it.
<p>
I've saved the chorus for last:
<p>
"And when I'm dead<br>
If you could tell them this<br>
That what was wood became alive<br>
What was wood became alive."<br>
<p>
   --- Rolling Stone sneered that these lines possibly referred to
Suzanne livening up her "wooden" songwriting style, but then again,
that magazine has never really seemed to have understood her 
(what can you say about a publication that knocked her for using 
the word "equivocate" in "When Heroes Go Down"?). But they might 
have blundered within a half-mile of the truth. For Suzanne, her 
songwriting, her artistic talent, _is_ what became alive; for all 
of us, it's whatever spark within us makes us uniquely human. This 
is the great secret, the great revelation she/Caspar wants to be 
remembered for after death. (And can anybody out there hear the words
"And when I'm dead" without feeling like somebody somewhere just 
stepped over their future grave?)
<p>
    Applied to Caspar literally, these lines again make him appear
to have gone a little daft in his basement captivity, as if he is
claiming that the toy horse literally became alive. Maybe he
just means that his wooden existence underground took life once
he joined the world. 
<p>
    But I get a sense of his solitude as a mystical experience: 
That horse did become alive, and if you don't understand, that's 
fine, but he wants you to know that it really happened. It _lived_.
I get the idea that he understands that only because he was
alone for so long; that's what made him able to see the life 
inside the wood.
<p>
    Maybe it's the same thing that sets Suzanne apart and 
lets her see things most people miss. She seems to be saying 
something like that in "Solitude Standing," where Suzanne wants
to be among the crowd in the dark, "gathered into one," but 
instead is with Solitude, who has her hand extended, who is there
to "set a twisted thing straight" and "lighten this dark heart."
Many see solitude as a curse, but sometimes it comes
bearing gifts. Having chosen a less-traveled path (or maybe, it
having chosen her), Suzanne is separate, in a sense, from the
mass; in these songs she seems acutely aware of that fact.
<p>
Sorry this is so long, and I hope I haven't annoyed anyone too much.
I really welcome anybody else's thoughts about this interpretation.
My goal is not to kill the song with a barrage of over-analysis, but
merely try to explain some fraction of what makes this song so
special to me. 
<p>
I could go on and on about how incredibly spare
the song is, how it manages to say so much with so few words (a
technique I know I should try to emulate), or about how that
incredible drumbeat makes me see this terrifying image of a
horse galloping out of the darkness -- but I won't.
<p>
Let me know what you think.

I always thought Caspar was a *real* person, who lived in Germany ca.
18th
century, who was locked away with just his wooden horse until he was
'freed' at the age of 17.

It is a true story, sorry for the misunderstanding.  I went
and read the movie box, and the movie is _based on_ the true
story.  The movie's called "Every Man For Himself and God 
Against All", and it's a German film, from the seventies, I do believe.
The back of the box basically says that he comes out of the basement 
with a note pinned on him that does more to mystify his situation than
explain it.  The townspeople are puzzled by his existence,
and try to teach him to get along in the upstairs world.
He doesn't even know how to eat "correctly", and they 
try to give him an education.  He learns to eat and drink
correctly, but won't accept or deal with (or something) the
education....
this is, of course, a memory of the interpretation of the film, 
which is an extrapolation of the real story.  (and they bitched about
equivocate!) :)
<p>
oh, and on the box they spelled it "Kaspar".  ?

The "long and boring" movie is a German one, titled "Kaspar hauser",

music
by 
Popol Vuh in that movie (although the best is in "Aguirre..."!)

Sorry, Rebecca, I guess it's seems like "I want to be a rider like my

Hi,
<p>
I thought I would add this little bit of information to the
various interpretations I read so far... (Thanks especially to
Bob -- wonderful mail!). It's one of my all time favourite
Suzanne Vega songs as well.
<p>
This is from "Language", the publication from the Suzanne Vega
Info Center (any other members out there?), the first issue of
February 1988.
<p>
"I was reading the biography of Caspar Hauser. He lived in
Germany in the early 1800's and because he was a heir to the
throne, he had been locked in a basement from the time he was
born until he was 17 and then suddenly set free. So his problem
was, how do you learn to be a human being? The book explains his
coming to power and it's a really tragic story because he's
murdered in the end, but I thought his perspective would have
been so interesting.
It's that stripped away thing again. In some ways he was so
stripped away, he was almost like an animal. He'd never seen the
sun and he could only say one sentence, which was "I want to be a
rider, like my father". And they had given him one toy to play
with in the whole 17 years, which was a small wooden horse. So I
was trying to see how you could take a story like that and turn
it into song form."
<p>
(Sounds, 6 december 1986).
<p>
The "Language" article continues with a summary of the biography.
If anybody is interested I could attempt to translate (parts of)
it, but it's quite long (4 typed A4-pages). The title of the Dutch
biography translates as "Kaspar Hauser: his live and his place in
history", written by Hans Peter van Manen (1985). There are more
books about him. It's such a sad, but fascinating, story...

Very nice work, Bob-- I hadn't seen that the first time around. I might
add
that I hear the song also as a sort of survival song, a tribute to the
beauty
and resourcefulness of the human spirit even under the most adverse
conditions. Most of us--perhaps thankfully--never get to test this
within
ourselves, but perhaps we could all benefit spiritually from the
knowledge of
the powers we have and don't use.

Nice job, Bob. Not to take anything away from your beautiful expansion
of 
the lyrics, but I thought you'd be interested in one of Suzanne's
comments 
on this song at the Learning Annex session that relates to the two 
passages I've excerpted above. She said that Caspar's father was a
member 
of the nobility, and that his imprisonment may have been meant to keep 
him from his rightful succession.  Hence, "I want to be a rider like my

father." Nobles rode, perhaps in a military role, while the common folk

walked. Hence also, "I know I have this power. I'm afraid I may be
killed." 
The power can be the political power that is his by right, and which
someone 
may deprive him of by murder if necessary. I have to admit, I wasn't
familiar

with this dimension of the C.H. story, which I was aware of long before

hearing the song. Still, food for thought. Keep up the good work.

Thanks for the kind comments, Moshe.

Yes, I too was fascinated to hear Suzanne's comments about this song in

the Learning Annex workshop, which I listened to right after I reposted

my interpretation. It was especially interesting that she said the 
rider/writer pun (if that's the right word for it) was deliberate: The 
real Caspar Hauser really did say "I want to be a rider like my
father," 
and Suzanne pointed out that her father is a writer, giving the line
extra 
meaning for her. To me, her comments reinforced the strong feeling I've

always gotten from the song -- that it's her intense identification
with 
the character that makes it special.
<p>

While I'm here, I just want to extend a big public thanks to Eric for 
taping that talk, which I found absolutely incredible. Especially 
enlightening were her descriptions of her early career, and the very 
specific reasons she has for not being overtly political in her songs
(it 
would make good fodder for someone doing a graduate thesis on 
Post-Vietnam Political Disillusionment as Reflected in Contemporary
Folk 
Music). I laughed several times, including when she described herself
as 
the only half-Puerto Rican, white, Buddhist folk singer she knows. And 
where else could you hear her relate Buddhist prayers to the type of 
guitar notes she favors? 
<p>
The workshop was much too wonderful to have been lost to history, so
I'm 
glad it wasn't. It was better than any conversation I have ever
imagined 
having with her. (I know you've done the same thing too. Admit it.)

My offer remains open for anyone who wants copies to send me blank
tapes, 
plus mailer and postage. But be warned: If I don't receive it this
week, 
I won't be able to get to them till the end of March.
