<p>
Well, I actually did make it (the singing gig fell through on short notice).<BR>
As follows:
<p>
1. Marlene on the Wall<BR>
2. Rock in This Pocket<BR>
3. Caramel<BR>
4. Small Blue Thing<BR>
5. Stockings<BR>
6. The Queen and the Soldier<BR>
7. World Before Columbus<BR>
8. No Cheap Thrill<BR>
9. Neighborhood Girls<BR>
10. Fat Man and Dancing Girl<BR>
11. Tired of Sleeping<BR>
12. Luka<BR>
13. Tom's Diner
<p>
Encore:<BR>
14. Gypsy
<p>
No "Blood Makes Noise" because of missing equipment (which was the problem
and reason the show was postponed), though SV laughingly suggested that 
sections of the audience do the electronic/percussion sounds vocally.
<p>
Loved hearing the new songs, especially "World Before Columbus."  This was the
first time I heard/saw "Marlene . . ." performed just with acoustic guitar and voice.
It was great!  Was strange, though, seeing SV in the daylight (a thought which
occurred to me half-way through her set).

I have to agree, that it was an awesome show!<BR>
I also especially liked World Before Columbus and No Cheap Thrill!
Although she might hate for thisu :) , we should mention, that she forgot
the lyrics to Tom's Diner. She seemed to take it real easy and made a joke
out of it! She was in general quite talkative!
<p>
Great show. Looking forward to the new album ...

random comments -- no real content, but good if you want more
atmosphere from the Berkely show :)
<p>
I hadn't seen Sarah or Paula live before.  I've got "Fumbling Towards
Extacy", but I searched three different stores in three different
cities here in Bay Area for a Paula Cole CD so I could recognize what
she was singing during the show.  Nobody had her album in stock.  She
didn't make much of an impression on me live, but I'm rarely
moved/impressed by something I hear live for the first time.  Suzanne
doing "Caramel" at the Steven Talkhouse last year on long island is the
only counter-example I can think of.
<p>
There was a VERY good vibe at the Berkely show.  Few people who had to
be noisy during quiet parts.  Paula was very energetic (maybe she
always is?); both Suzanne and Sarah were quick to laughter.  Sarah
especially seemed just giddy.
<p>
Suzanne didn't roll out any of her stock stories... she did apologize
for the postponement... said she'd been walking in Berkeley earlier in
the day and had come across what she thought was an abandonded baby
stroller; then found the stroller contained a baby and was standing
there saying something like "there's a baby in this stroller" before
she noticed his parents sitting in the car behind her, at which point
she walked off embarrassed...(no, i don't think there really was a
point, but at the time it didn't matter)...  said that in case we
wondered what she'd been doing for the three years she'd be gone, she'd
had a baby and finished an album.  didn't mention marriage or the fact
that the guy who was sitting at the piano is her husband :)
<p>
It was quite sunny -- Sarah hoped we'd brought sunscreen.  The vendors
didn't seem to have anything related to anyone but Sarah.  They sold a
lot of hats.  A lot of other folks spent the concert looking like they
were in a perpetual salute as the sun was just over the theatre...
<p>
Sarah did talk about how she thought of the two shows as an alternative
to the "cock rock" of lollapalooza.  She wants to have more women
singer/songwriters next year, and the show will be called "Lilith's
Fair" after the "first feminist", who was married to Adams (the
president ?) (I initially heard this as "Adam" and was very confused).

At our show she did say that Lilith was Adam's first wife before Eve
screwed everything up so I think she meant Adam.

<BR>
I have never read the bible and are not so hip on feminist issues
(sorry - I am not proud of it myself) so please let me ask - who
is this Lilith person?
<p>
About the concert - I personally have heard a Paula Cole CD and
a Sarah ML cd before and I liked Sarah better. But at the concert
I found Paula to be much more fun, energetic and musically interesting
than Sarah. To go one step further, I actually found Sarah a bit
boring. I mean, I surely recognize her talent and her great voice,
but for some reason she doesn't do a whole lot for me. Maybe I should
start reading her lyrics. To go to an extreme, she did a cover of
this song 'Unchained Melody', which I found simply annoying. Well
I don't like covers that much in the first place, but the U2 version
is just so much better (almost better than the original).<BR>
She (Sarah) also did a duet with Paula.<BR>
Sarah also announced, that she wants to do a 'girlypalooza' (her words!)
next year as an alternative to that 'cockrocker' (also her words)
Lollapalooza, which was taking place that Saturday somewhere else in the
Bay area. This year was kind of a test for this. Well, I am looking
forward for next years whatever-palooza! (Although I personally don't think
that leaving male performers out is getting the right message across, I am
looking forward to whatever happens!)
<p>
About Suzanne, she was with two other people and I can't remember who.
One on keyboard, well piano (was that Mitchell Froom?) and one on bass
guitar, which was Michael Viscageli (sp?). (I was looking at the webpage
for his correct name and found that there are no credits for any albums
except the new one. Wouldn't it be fare to include the credits also for
her older albums?) She was slipping on Toms diner, when they were
'kissing their hellos and ...' and joked around that she always found it
sort of strange them kissing and all and that's why she forgot how to
continue. At another part she said, that she was gone for a while and
that people always ask what she had done, while she was gone and she said
that she had done a baby and a new album while she was gone.
She then told a little story of what happened to her while she was walking
around in Berkeley. She saw a baby seat on the board walk and they were
joking, that somebody had thrown out their babysat. As they came closer,
they saw, that they threw out the baby with it and she was kind of puzzled,
what to do, walking around in Berkeley and finding a baby on the street.
What she didn't see though was the car with the parents in there. They were
separated by a tree. And when she finally realized the complete situation
she was just a little embarrassed and said 'hi' and went her way ...
<p>
Did I forget anything?
<p>
Well, I am not a very good story teller, but people ask about more details.

<p>
Yes she probably did mean Adam the first man. The Lilith myth has been
embraced by feminists because unlike Eve, who was created from Adam's
rib, Lilith was created from the dust in the same way as Adam, therefore
making them equal from the start.
<p>
The story goes that Adam needed it real bad, especially after seeing all
the animals doing it with their partners. He complained to God, who made
Lilith in the same way that he had been made. Adam came straight to the
point and tried to make Lilith "lie back and think of England" as we say
here downunder.
<p>
Well Lilith, asserting her equality with Adam, wouldn't have a bar of
it. In other words she didn't want to take things lying down. ("She only
comes when she's on top", who sang that?) Anyway, there was a bit of a
struggle and she invoked the Holy Name of God and flew away.
<p>
Adam complained to God again, who sent round the boys (angels) to get
her back. She wouldn't come back however, so God created Eve and the
rest is history. A bonus for Lilith was the fact that because she didn't
participate in the fall, she now lives forever.
<p>
Up to this point Lilith is your number one feminist role model. But
unfortunatly it's all down hill from there in terms of her mythological
reputation. You see Lilith hung out around the Red Sea, a known haunt
for demons who loved all that water. She was an easy lay and had lots of
demon children, all of them bastards.
<p>
Somewhere along the way she became jealous of human children (myths tend
to get mixed up together, with different cultures adding their own bits)
and was able to kill male babies up to 8 days old (when they were
circumcised) and females up to 20 days (I'm not sure the significance of
20 here). There is an ancient Jewish custom, perhaps still practiced
today, to protect newborns from Lilith by drawing a circle on the
child's wall, and writing the names of the angels on the door posts.
<p>
She also has the reputation for attacking men in their dreams when they
sleep alone, draining them of blood and other bodily fluids.
<p>
There is of course a number of versions of Lilith's story. Some
feminists say that patriachial societies have villianised her over time,
and they are now reclaiming her. I've read part of one cool version
where Lilith and Eve meet up outside the garden and become great friends
and sisters, learning from each other, which troubles Adam and even
influences God himself.
<p>
Lilith pops up a bit in literature. I know she makes an appearance in
Shaw's Methuslah play (is it "Back to Methuslah"?) and one of my all
time favourite novels is "Lilith" by George MacDonald, published in
1895, which sparked my interest in her. The novel uses the darker, blood
sucking, Lilith to explore the nature of evil and a Christian view of
redemption, yes even for Lilith herself. It's a great read if you can
find it.
<p>
While I can't pretend to be a card carrying feminist, I love the fact
that men and women have been created equal and abhor our male history of
domination that makes racial problems pale into insignificance.
<p>
So cheers, Lilith. Here's to your recent comeback. But please lose that
blood sucking stuff will ya - it makes me nervous.
<p>

This was pretty funny -- I think where she slipped was that she had the

this sort of confusion is especially bad in the Queen and the Soldier,
with the Queen standing in the hall, and the Soldier inside the castle...

Thanks for saying it first. I too, found Sarah boring. I know she means to carry
us away with those sentimental melodies--but me, I'm not really goin' there.
Her music strikes me as safe, rather "feel goodish" and she seemed painfully
eager to please her (Berkeley) audience. I was squirming in my seat throughout.
She's just not for me.  I too, found Paula a little more interesting.
<p>
But Suzanne,in my mind, is in a completely different class.  She is subtle,
complex, sees in funny ways, is on the inside of the outside of everything. Her
songs shift your vision. The street corner hasn't changed any, but everything
around starts to look a little different. Its daring art, what she's doing.  And
the funnest play.  Suzanne was great on Sunday.  Very at ease, in command, every
song came off beautifully--especially Tom's Diner, and especially after she
botched the words and used the goof to grab hold of the audience one notch more.

Yes, it was quite funny and she seemed at ease.<BR>
(And not to be too picky, but I believe verses were switched in "Gypsy"
but were smoothly handled.  I've done that when singing "Gypsy" as 
well and it's one of my favorites of hers.)

<p>
Allow me to take issue with this a bit, if you will.  I know that personal
tastes can differ, and those who saw her perform live are certainly entitled
to their preferences.  I have a different opinion of Sarah McLachlan.
<p>
Maybe she's boring in concert, but I have to say that I don't find either
of her albums 'Solace' or 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy' to stick to 'safe' or 
'feel good' topics.  Examples are many, but songs like 'Black' (dealing w/ 
greed and destruction of the environment), 'Possession' (self-explanatory),
'Fear' ("there's nothing I'd like better than to fall"), "Ice" ("you enter
into me, a lie upon your lips / offer what you can, I'll take all that I can
get, only a fool's here"), etc. are just a few that challenge conventionality
and push the boundaries.  Nothing 'safe' about those topics, IMHO.  Even her
most upbeat-sounding tune, 'Into the Fire' deals with coming to terms with
the past ("Mother teach me to walk again...") in a non-sentimental way.
<p>
>But Suzanne,in my mind, is in a completely different class.  She is subtle,<BR>

<p>
Oh, I definitely agree with you here, except for the 'different class' tag.
I think Sarah M. just approaches things from a perspective that's more direct,
perhaps, and a bit more emotional, but that *can* be every bit as complex as
Suzanne.  I always get something out of her music - it's very powerful.  I
don't think of it from a 'Sarah vs. Suzanne, who's better?' viewpoint, though.
<p>
>She's just not for me.
<p>
That's fine.  For me, she's still a quality artist.  Besides, anyone that
covers Joni Mitchell's "Blue" is OK in my book!  :)

Now Rob, you know I love Sarah too but I have to agree with the different

Well, I wasn't there but I do know what is meant by "different
class".
<p>
Sarah McLachlan has a much more mainstream (ie
suburban) approach to things but her appeal to me has
always been in the sheer sound of her voice. The sound of
"Vox" (the song that sounds like it really ought to be called
"Hawaii")  just grabbed me first time I heard it. It's a pretty
conventional new-age sounding track with a nice loud rock
drum track but the kicker is that her voice (with overdubs
galore) is just real purty!
<p>
But as far as her songwrtiting approach, nothing really
off-center like our Ms. Froom.

<p>
There's also a theory that the Bible hasn't been well translated, and that
Eve came out from Adam's side and not his rib (I think I heard that in
'Yentl'). Indeed, in French you use the very same word (with an accent on
one) for 'rib' and 'side'. <BR>
So the first woman, even as Eve, would have been created equal as man. 
<p>
I think Kate Bush's song 'Lily' might be about Lilith too, because she tells
about being protected by a circle, though that's Lily who tells her how to
protect herself so I don't know.

Not that anyone asked, but I'm feeling high school Bible class 
flashbacks all of a sudden.

Actually, there are *two* creation stories in Genesis, the first of 
which has man and woman being created equally. It's the "In the 
Beginning" part (at least in the usual English translations), when 
YHWH (the God of the Torah) is going around creating everything out 
of nothing by divine fiat. "Let there be light," etc. (Didn't get 
around to creating the sun for a few days, though). He creates man 
and woman simultaneously; I think the wording I remember is something 
like "male and female he created them." 
<p>
It's only the second story, I think in the next chapter,  that has
YHWH creating Adam first, out of clay or dirt, and then decides that
it is not good that man should be alone, and then makes Eve out of
Adam's rib. Since this story has often been used to imply that women
are inferior to men, it's amusing that it's never been used to imply
that men are inferior to dirt.
<p>
One theory on the existence of two somewhat contradictory creation 
stories is that the second one is the original, Hebrew one, and the 
first was added during the Babylonian captivity, when the Israelites 
were anxious to prove that their God could kick the butt of all the 
pagan deities.
<p>
Since we're discussing women's roles here, it's also interesting to
note Harold Bloom's theory (in _The Book of J_, which I think was a
minor bestseller in the late 1980s) that a woman, nicknamed J,
actually wrote the Torah, and that the original text is a classic
example of what has since become known as Jewish humor. Supposedly,
the muddled text we have now is the result of monkeying around by
three men, the Elohist, the Priest and the Redactor, who no doubt had 
different ideas of how women should behave.
<p>
I'm not even going to get into the probable censoring of women's 
roles in the New Testament, or the church's later nifty decision that 
Mary Magdelene must have been a prostitute (which is unsupported in 
the scripture).
<p>
Not sure this is relevant to discussing a Buddhist folksinger, but 
there you go.
