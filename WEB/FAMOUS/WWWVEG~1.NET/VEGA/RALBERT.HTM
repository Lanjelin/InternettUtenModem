<b>Tell me what happened when you played the Albert Hall in London. </b>

"Well, that's where D.A. Pennebaker had filmed Don't Look Back with Bob Dylan in 1965.
 And everyone was making such a big deal out of my appearance there, which made me feel
 that perhaps I wasn't up to all the expectations. I was tired and thought, What if I'm disappointing?
 I felt lost with all the film crews and the pomp and circumstance. Ron Fierstein, my manager, 
was really excited and going, This is the biggest gig of your career - of your life! And you don't
 want to hear that. You want to hear, Oh, everything will be fine. So I kept thinking, It's not such a
 big goddamn deal. I can walk out right now if I feel like it. But of course, I didn't. So there's pictures
 of me and the band stomping off the stage after the concert looking
 completely grim and upset. And the audience is going, Yea!"

The Albert Hall shows in 1986: It's a very prestigious venue,
 lots of history, the Bob Dylan connection, etc...
 Were you conscious of that on the night? 
<p>
"Oh yes, and I think it comes across like that too: it was a very reserved show.
 In the video of it I don't think they got rid of that sense of reservedness about it, even with editing. 
It's a very formal setting; it was a similar feeling when we played Carnegie Hall in New York. "

<b>How did you like playing the Royal Albert Hall? </b>
<p>
"It was probably the biggest gig I'd ever done in my life, so I was very relieved when it was over.
 The thing I came up against in the States was everybody said, Isn't that where Dylan played? Also
 because they were filming the second night I felt all this pressure to be perfect, and I'm not..."

<b>You didn't look like you were nervous...</b>
<p>
"That's because I was upset!" she says, collapsing with laughter and surprise.
 "See, I've been doing it long enough to control my emotions onstage, but there were a million
 things going on in my head."

 At the Albert Hall, November 18, 1986: "Psychologically,
 it was the big turning point for me, the point at which I first felt I'd become famous.
Everyone was running around like headless chickens and all I
 wanted to do was treat it like a normal concert." (Suzanne Vega)

 In England, in fact, Suzanne has become quite a major star, to the extent that a British tour
 last fall included two sold-out performances at London's fabled Albert Hall, and a half-hour BBC
 television show culled from footage of the concerts drew an estimated audience of over two and a 
half million viewers. "I spent a summer in England in 1979," she says, "and I was really inspired by the
 country's style. I remember wishing that I could somehow make an impact there. So in many ways, the
 response I've gotten in England has been very, very gratifying."
