<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
At the time of the following interview (December, 1986), Suzanne Vega's
first album (Suzanne Vega) had been out for some time; her second album
(Solitude Standing) was still being recorded. The single for "Marlene on
the Wall" was doing very well in Europe (especially Israel), but had pretty
much floundered in the US. A&M had just released a new single, "Gypsy;" a
different recording of this song eventually appeared on the Solitude
Standing album. Also, Suzanne Vega had recently written the lyrics for two
songs on Philip Glass' "Songs from Liquid Days." Other lyricists on the
album included David Byrne, Paul Simon, and a host of other very talented
and well known writers.

<p>
On December 5, before her concert at the Talbert Bullpen, a disk jockey
from WBNY and I interviewed Suzanne Vega. Thoughtful lyrics and unusual
melodies typify Vega's music - not a common formula for success in the
modern music scene. Yet, she has a large cult following in America, and an
even larger following abroad.
<p>
What follows is the conversation we had with this rising star.
<p>
G: You sing background on one of the Smithereens' songs. How did you get
linked up with the Smithereens?
<p>
SV: I knew Pat DiNizio from various connections. He was going out with a
friend of mine about three or four years ago. Later on, I ended up hiring
him when I was a receptionist and I needed an assistant. So, we worked in
the same office together for about six months, and we were both at that
point very anxious to quit our day jobs and pursue our careers. So, things
started to take off for us, I got tickled when he asked me to do backup
vocals. I had never done backup vocals before, and I wanted to work with
Don Dixon.
<p>
G: Was this before or after your contract with A&M.
<p>
SV: It was after. It was earlier this year.
<p>
G: Speaking of associations, you wrote the lyrics for "Lightning" for
Philip Glass. How did you come up with that? Did he come to you, or did you
offer?
<p>
SV: I'd never go to him. Looking at the list of people he already had,
there's no way I'd just pop up at this doorstep and say, "Hi, I write
songs." I think someone at A&M had told him about me and he came down to a
gig at Folk City - this may have even been before I recorded the album. So,
he saw the show and had asked me if I was interested in writing some
lyrics. As it turned out, I visited his house with a notebook full of
lyrics, and he picked out two that he thought would work well together.
<p>
G: With "Left of Center," you worked with Joe Jackson. How did that come
about?
<p>
SV: Well, it was almost a coincidence. He was in town - he's also on A&M -
and I think he was in town on the day that I was in town. I was on the tour
list when they were recording this, and I had to come in from Ohio, record
the whole session in one night, and then go back out again on the road. He
was going to be in town, so we met, I guess, at about 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, and we showed him the song. He had already heard it before, so
he fooled around with some ideas and we just worked together and it worked
very naturally.
<p>
G: At your last concert....
<p>
SV: My last concert was on Monday in England. I just got back from a
two-week tour of England and Ireland and Scotland.
<p>
G: What makes up your audience on your current tour? Are you just hopping
around as people invite you to their venue?
<p>
SV: Not exactly. We had decided to do some gigs in the Northeast because,
first of all, it was convenient and it was close to New York City, which is
where I'm from, and we wanted to do some warm-up dates before England, and
now we're doing some gigs afterwards. We're going to end up in New York
City next week.
<p>
G: How's your latest single "Gypsy," doing?
<p>
SV: It's hard to tell. I never in my whole life thought it would be
released as a single, and it made me laugh when they released it because I
wrote it when I was 18 for this guy that I knew, never dreaming that in
eight or nine years, it would be released as a single - especially in
England, which is where the guy was from. I think it entered at number 75
and went up to number 70 and it's kinda hanging out there. It was not
something that I thought would zip right up the charts. But, I was really
pleased with the production of it, because I think it's funny. I think it's
quite an eccentric production, which is good because that' what I wanted it
to be. I didn't want it to be all spruced up.
<p>
G: Turning to your next album; in your concert, you perform songs like
"Luca" (sic) and "Language." There seems to be a change in the content of
your songs. Do you expect to begin getting more involved with contemporary
issues which go away from the romantic side?
<p>
SV: Well, yes and no. I think a lot of people look at the first album and
they say a lot of these things are romantic songs. You look at a song like
"Cracking," and you hear the line "my heart is broken," so you think, "oh,
she had a fight with her boyfriend," but it's not what I had in mind at
all. Actually, what I think a lot of the songs are about on the first album
are more of identity - of a person finding their way in the world. I was
thinking about this a lot because I think a person's heart can be broken in
by a lot of things, not just romantic. You can be crushed by your
circumstances. The person walking through the park could be anyone. It
could be someone who's just lost their job. It could be someone who's
feeling just suppressed by their circumstances in general, which is more
what I had in mind.
<p>
Now, a lot of the songs, if you examine them, if you take them away from
the romantic, if you say "oh, she's a girl, and she's sorta like Joni
Mitchell, so she must be...." If you take it away from that, and you put it
in a different context, you'll see they fit in this other context.... If
you think of them as being about identity, or about characters. That's
something I'm always going to be fascinated with. I don't like writing
about political issues because I really don't think it's my place as a
songwriter to inflict my opinions on people -- especially since opinions
are so changing and I've seen people I know go through wide varieties of
opinions in their lifetime. I don't really feel that it's my job as a
songwriter to inflict my opinions on an audience. I also think that's the
kind of thing that will date you immediately if you insist on doing that.
<p>
I think it's my job as an artist to reveal what's there, to reveal a point
of view. That's why it was good to write from Luca's point of view, because
when I wrote the song, it was actually through the eyes of a nine-year old
boy, but it could also be through the eyes of a woman who's beaten by her
husband. It could be through the eyes of almost anyone if you take it away
from this normal context. If find a lot of the songs written that way.
"Small Blue Thing" could be written by a woman to a man or a woman to
another woman. There's a question, "What do the feminists think about
'Small Blue Thing'?" I think, "Why should they think anything?" It could be
a guy singing to another guy. It could be just about anything. I think I'm
more preoccupied with context and character than I am with, say, topical
issues. There's some deep part of me that is very cynical and says, "Just
because I stand on a stage and say war is wrong, doesn't mean anything."
Tell me Reagan's going to listen. I don't believe it.
<p>
G: Many of the songs that appear on your first album are very symbolic:
"Small Blue Thing," "The Queen and the Soldier," "Knight Moves." While the
symbolism makes them mean different things to different people -- depending
upon the context -- was there anything in particular that you had in mind
when you wrote, say, "Queen and the Soldier?"
<p>
SV: Well, I always have things in mind when I write -- I'm not always sure
what they are, and that's probably why I write the song. If I knew what I
was talking about, I would just say it. I would just write it on a piece of
paper, and put it up on the wall -- I wouldn't need to go around singing.
<p>
There's something, obviously, that goes on -- I write a song because I feel
I have to. I'm not one of these people who started writing songs because I
thought it would be a nice way to make money. I guess I started writing
when I was about 14, and it certainly wasn't something I thought, "Oh,
yeah, this is a good career choice. I wanna be a folk singer! This'll be
fun." I guess I write because I feel I have to, and I feel I have something
to say and the only way I can say it.... Sometimes, when I ask the audience
to ask me questions, I'll get strange questions like: "Well, what is the
Small Blue Thing?" or, "Why do you feel like a Small Blue Thing?" If I
could answer those questions, I wouldn't need to write the songs, I would
just explain what I meant.
<p>
"The Queen and the Soldier" is a strange song for me because it seems to
work on a variety of levels. I still haven't figured that one out yet. I
don't know what it means to me, yet. I feel a very strong sympathy with
both characters. Obviously, I like the soldier better than the queen; I
think most people do. I feel a very strong identification with both
characters. Some people want to know if that's my idea of romance, which it
certainly is not! I mean, I'm not crazy... in that way, anyway.
<p>
To me, that was a song about power. It was a song about power and the
misuse of power and how people hang on to it, no matter what, even if it
means that they are ultimately unhappy and suffering because of it. Yeah,
I'm sure I have something in mind, but I don't know what it is.
<p>
Q: What were your early influences in music?
<p>
SV: Well, I always listened to music, and I listened to a huge variety of
music when I was growing up. I guess I listened to the Beatles, and a lot
of jazz, and whatever my parents were listening to at the time. My father
played the guitar, and my mother would sing with him. That was always
interesting. I suppose I got the idea of being a singer from him, my
father. I guess he had written a song when I was about nine. So, somehow,
the idea was planted really early on, and I think when I was twelve, I
thought, "Wow, it'd really be cool if I could write songs," but I never
thought that I could.
<p>
I would fool around with ideas. And then, suddenly, I found that I could
write songs, write whole songs, that would come tumbling out and it was
that thing where I didn't understand what they were, necessarily, but the
idea would take hold and write itself, almost. At that time, I had wanted
to be a dancer. I had no intention of really pursuing song writing as a
career. I had really wanted to be a dancer, but slowly, I realized that the
reason I wanted to dance was because I loved music and that, actually, I
felt more community with the musicians than with other dancers.
<p>
G: What kind of music do you like to listen to now?
<p>
SV: Oh, tons of stuff. When I'm on the road, I listen to a lot of different
things. I listen to Peter Gabriel. I listen to the Psychedelic Furs. For a
while, I was listening heavily to the REM Murmur album. I've been listening
to Kate Bush because I think she's very unusual, musically. I'll pretty
much listen to whatever is around.
<p>
G: When do you expect your next album to come out?
<p>
SV: In April.
<p>
G: What do you have recorded so far?
<p>
SV: We have one version of "Luca," we have "Gypsy" and "Calypso." We may do
a live version of "Tom's Diner," although I'm not sure about that. I had
wanted to orchestrate it, but the more I think about it, the more I think
we'd better just keep it a cappella. We're going to go into the studio in
January.
<p>
G: Does your band have a name yet?
<p>
SV: They've taken to calling themselves the "Whack Pack." I don't know what
to make of that, but it's better than their last name, which I won't even
go into. It's too disgusting to mention.
<p>
G: What do you hope to be doing ten years from now?
<p>
SV: I'd like to do some more acting. I had done acting in school, and I
really loved it. I'd like to work more with the video, so that I am able to
expand a little more, because I think the videos I've done so far have
presented a certain side of me that's not playful. I think I'm probably a
lot more playful and more aggressive than I may seem on stage. I'd like to
get some dancing in there.
<p>
G: When you say acting, do you mean in video, or film?
<p>
SV: I'd like to do film. Or, maybe write something. I guess I have a secret
fantasy of writing a kind of theatrical piece with music to do with other
performers like Lou Reed, for example; I think that would be really cool if
I could somehow arrange a theatrical setting to work with other people.
That's an idea that I have.
