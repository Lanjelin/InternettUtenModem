<b>  SUZANNE VEGA: What's Your Problem?</b>
<p>
<b>  RELATIONSHIPS</b>
<p>
        <b>Raised in a politically active Puerto Rican family, in the tough
East Harlem district of New York City, Suzanne Vega exorcised her
reflections on urban life over three, highly successful albums. Yet her
cool detachment suggests Suzanne has as much difficulty with one area of
existence as her fans. As the waif-like one ushers her fourth LP,
<i>99.9F</i>, into the spotlight, <i>VOX</i> confronts Suzanne Vega about
her problem with ... relationships</b>
<p>
        "When I was 16, my family began practicing Buddhism. Some people
see Buddhism as selfish, but in our particular form the highest thing you
can chant for is someone else's happiness. I chanted for clear skin, and to
be thin, and to have a record contract. It took me four years to get clear
skin, five to become thinner than I was, and eight years to get the record
contract.
<p>
        Many adolescents are self-obsessed. I felt that I had to look out
for myself, because I didn't see that anyone else was going to. I was
probably self-absorbed, but I won't apologise for that.
<p>
        I write about things that are very close to me , so I need to have
the detachment, otherwise I'd just burst open - and that would be very
unattractive. But I'm not actually a detached person. People, when they get
romantically involved with me, don't seem to see me that way. Usually it's
the opposite. If I'm serious I tend to fall all the way. I don't stand
around playing funny games. Maybe one day I will write 'I love you' in a
song, but only when I can find a way of saying it that hasn't been said
before. I find it embarrassing, and there are much more interesting things
to write about. When I do write about men and relationships it tends to be
flirtatious and playful.
<p>
        My music is not really as detached as it seems. On a track like
'Rock In This Pocket', which is about King David, that's not about me and a
man, necessarily. It's about a small person and a large person, or a small
person against an institution. I wrote this song before the riots happened
in LA, but there's that sense of powerlessness and you want to get the
attention from someone ... and so you have a rock in your pocket and the
urge is to throw it. It's not necessarily against a man, especially not a
man whom I'm equal to. It's about someone in power, someone much bigger
than I am.
<p>
        The problem I have is a power problem, and it's not specific to
men. I don't have a problem with men. I like men. I don't like people
having power over me. It's not that I want to have power over other people
- I couldn't care less about that - but most of my songs are from a small
or a victimised point of view. I find it necessary to struggle against this
larger thing that's trying to confine me or define me. That would be
paranoid if it were a fantasy, but it's not a fantasy. It came from
circumstances in my own life, growing up in the part of New York that I
did.
<p>
        People have compared my childhood to Madonna's, but Madonna grew up
without her mother, and so she learned how to manipulate her father, or
other men around her, with her sexuality. But I didn't grow up under those
sort of  circumstances. In the places where I grew up, if you walked down
the street in a short skirt, you'd get 25 guys looking at you and shouting
things at you. You learnt to protect yourself against that kind of
sexuality; you don't exploit yourself in that way where I came from.
<p>
        I had not known my real father until four years ago. In the
beginning, meeting him again, it was very difficult for me to accept his
love. I still can't call him 'Dad'. I call him Richard. But there's
definitely a sense of a gap being filled in my life. I've been able to
relax within myself for the first time in I don't know how long. I'd always
struggled against myself, because I couldn't accept the fact that I was
white and I was not my stepfather's daughter. This always was something
that had caused me a lot of pain. I wanted to be like the rest of the
family I grew up with, because I loved them. But I always had the sense of
being apart from them, and being different in a way that wasn't good - so I
hated myself for a lot of my childhood.
<p>
        Low self-esteem is a tiny, genteel little phrase that describes a
huge, gigantic, horrible feeling. I just had the sense that I was never
right. A lot of people, even my family, feel that I'm too correct. It
doesn't strike me that way, but in some ways I regret not having more of
that 'just throw everything to the winds' sort of feeling. Eventually I'm
sure I'll lose all these inhibitions and things that have controlled me,
and maybe I'll hit some kind of wild adolescence in my 40s ...
<p>
        This year is probably the first time I've not been involved with
someone in about eight or nine years. Sure, I'd like to be in a ten-year
love affair with somebody; I don't think it takes the edge off your work.
<p>
        If you find coldness in my lyrics it's probably because I'm a
really reserved person. I feel very deeply and passionately about things,
but I don't like music where the person is bleeding all over the CD player.
'99.9F' is a song to a man whom I think would be equal to me. That's a very
overtly flirtatious song. Is that rare for me? I don't know. I feel that a
lot of women write songs about their relationships, why do I need to join
the list? I feel people miss the chord of what's interesting in my work.
There is something interesting, I know there is. I'll punch anyone in the
face who says there isn't!"
