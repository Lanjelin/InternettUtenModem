Hi Webmates,
<p>
I opened my mailbox today and got a very pleasant surprise in the form of
ELLE magazine.  They're getting to have good taste -- Tina Turner on the
cover last month, and lookee what I found today!!  There's also the photo
from the cover of the Caramel single, the one which you guys think looks like
the cover of the "Pulp Fiction" video.

How She Changed Her Tune<BR>
Edgy folksinger Suzanne Vega reemerges as a cool pop chanteuse
by Andrew Essex
<p>
	When unsuspecting listeners hear the richly nuanced pop and par	lor
jazz of Suzanne Vega's new album, Nine Objects of desire (A&M), they may
find it difficult to believe that this cool chanteuse is the same
waifish singer-songwriter behind "Luka," the harrowing 1987 ballad about
an abused child.  All they're likely to recognize are her dark lyrics
and insinuating voice.
<p>
	"I suppose my new songs are a bit more adventurous," Vega says
with characteristic nonchalance.  "'Caramel' is supposed to sound like a
bossa nova tune from the '60s. 'Birthday' is probably the heaviest thing
I've ever done.  Some of the stuff is based on the grooves.  There's one
love song ['World Before Columbus'], but we distorted the vocal to
distance it from the sort of things I used to do."
<p>
	Of course, the sort of things the thirty-seven-year-old Vega used
to do -- the gritty-elegy-with-the-powerful-message that elevated her
from the Greenwich Village folk scene of the mid-'80s -- succeeded in
transcending the image of the female singer-songwriter as bandanna-clad,
summer-of-love naif, and introduced a new generation to the music that
landed Joan Baez on the cover of Time in 1962.
<p>
	"I wanted to be a folksinger," Vega explains.  "When I was fourteen, I
used to listen to Woody Guthrie and write songs about living on freight
trains.  As I got older, I realized I didn't know a thing about freight trains -- I'm
from New York City." In 1992, after a two-year layoff, she released a fourth
album, the underrated 99.9 F (probably best known for the disquieting,
AIDS-influenced "Blood Makes Noise").  Vega's tales of the city blended folk
narratives with industrial noise and Latin rhythms (drawn from her childhood
in Spanish Harlem) and gave birth to post-modern folk.
<p>
		Though Vega isn't entirely comfortable with the "folk" label, she's
hardly disowning it: "Folk is part of American culture," she says.  "It's
mostly about storytelling, not acoustic guitars and tie-dye.  I wanted to be
a mix of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Lou Reed; they're all great
storytellers.  I learned by playing solo at folk festivals.  If you can win over a festival
audience, you can pretty much work anywhere."

<p>
Hmmm... I guess there a gazillion different interpretations
for Blood Makes Noise.  I guess AIDS fits, but did the interviewer
get this from Suzanne - or is this his interpretation? :)
<p>
My interpretation is complete different and doesn't fit all
the lyrics really either..  :)
<p>
What BMN always reminds me of is when I was a kid and I would
be lying in bed at night with my ear against the pillow.
Some nights, when it was quiet and I had my head resting just
right, I could hear (what I assume now was) blood beating
through a vessel in my ear or something.
<p>
It sounded like soldiers marching.  I remember it frightened
me at first but after a while it became comforting to hear
those soldiers marching.
<p>
That's what that song reminds me of.
<p>
Maybe I'm strange - or have a deformed head... :/

A gazillion?  The one about AIDS is the only one I've heard and believed
to be Suzanne's point of the song.

No, you're not strange, or we're two. <BR>
Wow, that's just what I thought about the song too. This vessel often keeps
me from sleeping too. <BR>
I think this song is about feeling too real, about realising that you
actually have a body, you know, when you hurt yourself or see how you're
getting old. I think there was something like that in Woody Allen's
'Interiors' (pretty pretentious movie though): Diane Keaton tells about how
she once saw herself from very far above and she could hear her blood rush
and all her veins beat and how it was really frightening. Sometimes when
it's real quiet, I like to try to hear my heart beat, and it works
sometimes. Anyway, I think 'Blood Makes Noise' is kind of the opposite song
of 'As A Child' or 'Wooden Horse', that are (partly) about feeling unreal
(Suzanne said somewhere that when she was a kid, she would look at her dolls
and they seemed to be alive and then she would look at herself and seemed
not to be alive).
<p>
I've got an other theory about this song but I don't like/believe in it: 
Some of you said that Bad Wisdom could be about incest. I disagree but if
that's what you think, then BMN could be the same: a girl trying to speak to
her doctor but she's scared of her father, and that's the same noise as in
'Blood Sings': the noise from the feeling of belonging to the same family,
except that in BS it's a kind, sad, melancholic song whereas in BMN it's a
threat song. 
<p>
Anyway, can anyone tell me why this song would be about AIDS? Just because
there's the word 'blood' in it? 
<p>

<p>
Well, though I have always looked at the AIDS aspect of the song--I seem
to remember SV being asked if it was about that and she said a writer
writes about her time and all that but that it could be about anything--I
think the fear aspect is what is important here.  Well, maybe she was
talking about Bad Wisdom and maybe I'm actually talking about Bad Wisdom.
<p>
Never Mind.  But I think that BMN and BW are sister songs in a way and
that while they could be about something specific they are also very
universal.  Therefore, I think everyone is right--it could be about incest
or the sound blood makes against a pillow--or AIDS or even an unexpected
pregnancy.
<p>
The sound I think she's trying to describe is that far away sound--where
you can only hear the inner workings of your body and everyone sounds as
if they are at the other end of a tunnel.  You get this feeling when you
are about to pass out--from fear or whatever.

I heard Suzanne say in an interview that Blood Makes Noise had
nothing to do with AIDS, but rather with the more general anxiety
about being sick and going to the doctor's.

<p>
Yes I think it's a very cool visual but some years ago I've read that "Small
Blue Thing" was about abortion - I also don't know if it was an opinion of
the guy who wrote it or if it was Vega's explanation. 
<p>
Whatever it was, I think that the artist's point of view is a lot of times
(if not the whole time) missunterpreted by public opinion !
<p>
Personally, I've never thought BMN as an AIDS thing. To me "BMN" was always
conected to "Bad Wisdom" ; I think that the Lyrics are sort of a complement
of each other.<BR>
However I also feel that it doesn't really mind if it's this or that, 'cause
that it's putting a "stamp" on a work of art. And a work of art looses it's
beauty when we can't no longer think it as "soldiers marching".

David, it would never(and I really mean never) happen to cross my mind that
"Bad Wisdom" was about incest. (?!?!?!?)<BR>
I'm wondering where the hell that whole ideas came from ...<BR>
More and more, I start to only believe on intuition.<BR>
Well, did you ever wonder about this -> " Knowledge stimulates uncertainty
and that uncertainty stimulates anxiety " ?<BR>
And that's why I've always thought "BMN" and "Bad Wisdom" to be the mirror
of one who has experimented the terrible feeling of an endless anxiety/anguish.
<p>
Am I too far ? :)

I totally agree with your take on Blood Makes Noise and Bad Wisdom. I've always
thought the doctor character in both are connected.
I've also read that Leonard Cohen thought the line, "I will pay for my life with
my body," is the most beautiful in the album. It sort of sums it all up.

No, it's hardly Suzanne's explanation -- she usually says that Small Blue
Thing is a love song and kind of a children's game. Like, what would it be
like if I was a small blue thing...
<p>
In my opinion, Guida, Bad Wisdom could very well be about incest -- or any
other bad experience that makes a child grow up quickly and painfully.

Hi Hugo !<BR>
Well, today (Saturday) it's my first week on the Undertow :)  And I must say - what a week !!  
One time I think that I could win on a sort of Trivial Pursuit all about Suzanne Vega, and the other
I feel very far from that.<BR>
Though, I'm amazed wiht all interpretations that were given here about
either "99.9º" or "Bad Wisdom" and now "Small Blue thing" I still think that
it all depends on your point of view .<BR>
I didn't make a judgement ;) I said what I think the song was all about to me.
<p>
On what concerns to "Small blue thing", I really don't think that I share
the "...kind of a children's game..." opinion .Even if that was what S.Vega
said. (?)I like so much that song, that even if it were about abortion I'd
would never think of it as that.
<p>
As I said before, we all put something of our own experience on eveything we
admire/contemplate !<BR>
And that is what 'enriches' a work of art. "I like to keep prespective"
Don't you think so?<BR>
When it comes to explanations, I always remember Woodie Allen and Dianne
Keaton on "Annie Hall" when they are on that line to enter in to the cinema
and there's this guy who "spits" his interpretation of the author's
intention about the movie. "If life was as simple as that" Woodie says when
he intruduces the guy to the author !:)

I completely agree with you here -- and I certainly didn't want to judge
your point of view. And I guess even Small Blue Thing could be about an
abortion -- if that's what you feel when you've had one. But to me it's a
far happier song than that. I don't think I'd skip on the sidewalk if I'd
just killed a baby...
<p>
The strengt of Suzanne's art, of course, is that there are no fixed
interpretations -- anyone can fit in their personal point of view. But it's
also fun to *discover* new points of view in the songs, either by listening
or, for instance, by reading this mailing list...

I have this slim little volume of SV song lyrics and some
commentary/interviews called "Bullet in Flight," published by Omnibus Press
(out of London) . . . anyway, in it, Suzanne says this about "Small Blue
Thing"
<p>
(p. 75) "I wasn't using a character in the first album as much as I was using
the voices of things. . .Like 'Small Blue Thing' . . . I was trying to write
and sing in the voice of a small blue thing."
<p>
So . . . I vote for Paul's interpretation of "Blood Makes Noise,"  even
though it's on a later album.  I have the same memories of my ear on the
pillow when I was a kid. . . and it makes me feel secure to think about 4
billion people also going to sleep and hearing their own heartbeats every
night.

<p>
Ah yes, this is what I've always said--see my essay: "The Minimalist
Styles of Raymond Carver and Suzanne Vega" in the About Suzanne section.
<p>
This is exactly what I've always loved about her music--the
specific/universal aspect of it.
<p>
I was wondering about "Caramel" today.  She said she starts with something
specific and works her way out from there--and for those who have read or
heard the Learning Annex Talk, you are familiar with the Small Blue Thing
example.  So I was wondering where Suzanne might have started with this
song.  It's about "Addiction" but I think that's where she ended up and
not started.  Do you think that she was eating a Caramel Candy and decided
it was really good and decided to have another and then another--and there
it is "Caramel"--but seriously--where do you guys think she started?

hello Suzanne fans!<BR>
Blood makes noise is one of my most favourite SV songs.and i must say i 
have spent many time in understanding it.My own opinion is that the song 
is about AIDS....but i have read your opinions about the song,and i must 
say there is a point in all your different opinions....you see this is 
the beuty of suzannes greatest songs....everyone can find everything 
inside it....every person can understand it in a different way,but still 
almost everyone enjoys it.<BR>
there is an interesting thing about her songs...they touch you 
inside.when i hear BMN,"pilgrimage","the queen and the soldier" or any 
other suzanne song it does something to me..something unique..and i am 
sure it does something unique to any other person.<BR>
You people should listen to suzanne music and respect each others unique 
opinions.I think it's kind of annoying when you are discussing the 
meanings of the songs....i think it kills the unique feeling...the 
unique atmosphere of suzannes music.....so listen to Suzannes music and 
have fun!

I bet suzanne simply heard a recording of a heart and was
inspired. The rhythm track is very similar to the actual sound
of a heart recorded from inside the bloodstream. It's an
amazing sound and musicians tend to be very audio
oriented as far as the imagination (audigination?).
<P>
But mental "illness" in lyrics is a big deal these days.
Seems like every song by Counting Crows and Freedy
Johnston (who I both like) deals with some unbalanced point
of view.
<P>
Many grunge and junior punkster types flaunt their lack of
sanity -whether real or put-on. It's big biz these days!
<P>
Suzanne seems more just your basic introspective type who
looks through many eyes in her songs. A good way to
practice compassion.

Gotta disagree with you here. You seldom learn from people who agree with
you. When some one has a different view or interpretation it forces you to
take another look at what you believe. Most of the time you won't change
around to agreeing with them but you will learn something new about
yourself.

*absolutely* (and yes I know I've put the earlier bit second). That's why
Suzanne's music is so brilliant. You can always listen to a new song as you
can listen to one of your favorites and try to hear it through someone
else's ears. Not many artists can write lyrical poetry like this and it is
definitely what I enjoy most about Suzanne.
<P>
When an artist tells what a song is about I feel um, err, I suppose
betrayed. I have to accept their meaning and it takes away the special gift
of the song that the artist have given to *me personally*.

        Which is not to say they're all in the same groove ... the sound of
a heart, then, gives us on the one hand "Blood Makes Noise", and on the
other, "Closer" ...
<P>
        Any chance of a Vega/Reznor duet anytime soon? "I'd buy that for a
dollar!"

Ah yes, in my champions of mental unhealth sample list I
forgot to add Trent Reznor!
<P>
That _would_ be an interesting team-up. NIN is one artist I
have tried to listen to but just don't "get". Some of it's kind of
catchy but it's toxic to me when I hear the words.
