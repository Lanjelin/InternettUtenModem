    Leonard Cohen reemerged last spring to paly Carnegie Hall. There he was,
on posters plastered across Manhattan, displaying all the bohemian
affectations of an era long gone. But the Cohenites came out for the night,
which was rather sweet, when you think about it. It's hard to know where they
live or who they are, but like the Japanese soldiers still hiding in Pacific
caves, there are some folkies left in this most self-conscious of cities.
<p>
    New York folkies haven't had a singer to swoon over for a long time, but
they do now. They have <b><i>Suzanne Vega</i></b>, whose self-titled A&M debut album is
causing palpitations in Folk City circles. They're calling the
twenty-six-year-old singer-songwriter the new early Bob Dylan, the new early
Joni Mitchell, and yes, the new early Leonard Cohen. Those who worry she will
be tainted by the folkie label are also calling her the new folk-style Laurie
Anderson, Lou Reed, Patti Smith. It's not old-style folk music, they argue,
it's proto-minimalist folk-rock. Several songs, they'll tell you, are prime
examples of a new musical form: "folk-rap fusion."
<p>
    Their concern is understandable. There is something terrifying about a
waif of a woman who strums an acoustic guitar and sings convfessional poetry
in a soft soprano. You prepare to be embarrassed at learning more about her
than you ever wanted to know.
<p>
    But Suzanne Vega does not embarrass. With wit, grace, intelligence, and
an honestly cruel edge, she skates past the pitfalls of folk music. Her
acoustic guitar is backed by synthesizers, electric guitar, drums. There is
no self-pitying vibrato in her gvoice, and while she is often found in the
stranglehold of love, she watches herself with irony and unflinching insight.
<p>
    Raised in Manhattan, Vega writes urban songs. This is not the pastoral
folk of the Sixties, or even the folk of the Village garrets. It's the folk
of the scummy Lower East Side. Her own life is directed by a form of
meditative Buddhism. It's reflected in her music, which is often chantlike
and circular in motion and sound. "I am cool and smooth and curious," she
sings, and it doesn't surprise us. That is what she sounds like. But
underneath her cool detachment lies a heat that comes from burrowing beyond
defenses to see what lies in her heart and her mind. What Vega finds there is
startling, distinctive, true.
<p>
    Does she ever stumble? Sometimes. If there's anything a folk singer likes
better than songs about the railroad, it's songs about queens, soldiers, and
the chivalry (or lack of it) between them. Vega's got one of these. There are
times--and this is one of them--when she inches perilously clsoe to coyness,
the hole into which many star folkies have fallen and disappeared. But these
moments are counterbalanced by Vega's edgy realism.
<p>
    Since the invention of the lute, the vagaries of love have possessed
singer-songwriters, but few have been as honest as Vega about their
obsessions. In "Undertow," a voracious ode to sex, she sings: "I believe
right now if I could/I would swallow you whole/I would leave only bones and
teeth/We could see what was underneath/And you would be free then."
<p>
    Suzanne Vega may find herself a pawn of love, but we sense it will not
maul her. It is 1985. If anybody's going to do some mauling, it will be Vega.
