<H1>Berlin/Prague 1990</H1>
Between 1985 and 1989 I made a number of photographic expeditions along the former
east/west border or Iron Curtain.  After the wall was opened I returned to Berlin to
photograph the aftermath of the partly dismanted border zone.  On the way to Berlin I
stopped in Amsterdam to visit my girlfriend (now wife), Renee Schoonbeek, and in Berlin I
met up with Suzanne Vega and her band during their European tour.  She performed in a
sport hall in the former East Berlin.  A few days later she played in Prague, and then later
in Budapest.  

<P>The following are excerpts from my journal made during that trip.  
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><H4>11-7-90  New York  JFK Airport</H4>
<P>
In the nine months since I was last in Germany, the DDR, or East Germany, has been
swallowed up willingly by West Germany. This dramatic event occurred quicker than most
people expected--thanks in no small part to Gorbachev's acquiescence. Voices of doubt
and anguish were heard, but the deed was done, and done with only a modest amount of
nationalistic hoopla. There is but one Germany today.
<P>
There is also only one Berlin now, and my task on this trip will be to acknowledge that fact
by photographing along what once was the Berlin wall. How much of the wall is still
standing I don't know.  Perhaps there are still some ruined sections of it. Undoubtedly, the
cleared strip that used to lie between the parallel walls remains, although the city is sure to
fill into these long abandoned areas in the near future.
<P>
<H4>11-9-90  Amsterdam</H4>
<P>
Was jet-lagged all day yesterday. Napped and walked around with Renee.  Saw her old
apartment in a beautiful neighborhood near the Vondelpark and the museums. We are
actually staying in an apartment in the Jordaan lent by a friend (Renee is in the process of
moving to a new place) that is in a rather run-down building with a precariously steep
stairway. The bedroom is in a garret above the main floor of the apartment and is reached
by a ladder. An art gallery on the ground floor is patronized by a steady stream of men
who stay for a few minutes and leave without apparently puchasing any paintings.
<P>
<H4>11-14-90  On the train between Hannover and Berlin</H4>
<P>
I am now more than halfway to Berlin on the train passing through Braunschweig.  This will
be my first crossing of the former borderline since it was erased by the reunion of
Germany. We crossed the old border just west of Helmstedt, a name synonomous in my
mind with the border. It was previosly a major autobahn and rail crossing into East
Germany. The concrete fence poles of the border were still there. but the metal fencing
material itself had been removed. A guard tower lay on its side, broken along the seams
of its precast concrete segments. Despite all the changes of the last year, the trip across
the East still gave me the sense of crossing a dark and forbidden zone. Berlin still seems
like a brightly colored bauble in a sea of murky water. 
<P>
<H4>11-15-90  Berlin</H4>
<P>
The next day I went to Checkpoint Charlie past the wall museum, which is still doing a
brisk business. At the former border crossing itself, numerous displays of Russian and
East German uniforms, pins, insignias, and other paraphernalia were for sale. The large
customs shed built a few years ago by the East Germans was still there, but nothing
impeded the traffic passing through. The no man's land that used to lie between the walls
is still just a swath of cleared land, muddy and desolate. The narrow roadway that was
once used by the East German guard vehicles now makes for a convenient path, and a
steady stream of bicycles passed by. <A>(Image of no man's land)</A>
<P>
I then walked to the Brandenburg Gate, which is under renovation, and down Unter den
Linden to the Freidrichstrasse Bahnhof, once the location of the main crossing point into
and out of East Berlin. The large glass building used for customs, with its tiny mirrored
compartments where westerners were scrutinized by blank-faced Vopos (Volkspolizei)
before being allowed in or out of the DDR, was empty. I walked by the U.S. consulate, still
there with its kitschy scenes of American life in glass cases out in front. I took the S-Bahn
to Prenzlauerberg to the street where Anamarie Michnevich (my friend from New York now
in Berlin) is living. I found the building, crumbling, like so many East Berlin buildings, and
walked through the dark hinterhof, or courtyard, and up the stairs to her door.  She wasn't
home, so I left a note on a pad of paper hanging on the door.  I hadn't called ahead
because she has no phone--still a scarce service in East Berlin. 
<P>
<H4>11-16-90  Berlin</H4>
<P>
Anamarie came by last night, and I drove with her to her apartment in Prenzlauerberg.
There are two rooms in the apartment--quite large--and a kitchen.  The windows face
southwest and look out toward Alexanderplatz and the back-to-the-future TV tower that
looms over everything in Berlin Mitte. Coal stoves heat the two rooms and reqire
occasional stoking. 
<P>
Originally, Anamarie had squatted the apartment. She had gone door to door in the
neighborhood asking about vacancies, and apparently some of the  tenants encouraged
her to just move in. In other part of East Berlin, militant squatters groups have taken over
buildings and parts of whole blocks. The other night the police were sent to a street in
Friedrichshain, and hundreds of squatters were rousted. Dozens were arrested and both
police and squatters were injured. Weapons and bricks were found in some of the
apartments. 
<P>
I returned from Anamarie's place in a taxi driven by an East Berliner who didn't know how
to get to the Kurfuerstendamm in West Berlin. I had to help him find his way. We talked the
whole way, which was most difficult for me with my meager German. He is an admirer of
George Bush.
<P>
<H4>11-18-90  Berlin</H4>
<P>
I walked to Treptower Park, the location of the Soviet war memorial and burial place for
thousands of Russians killed in the final push to take Berlin. The memorial is an enormous
monumental garden culminating in a statue of a war hero holding a sword. The statue is,
perhaps, 20 feet tall and stands on a pedestal at least as high. Along the side aisles of the
vast ceremonial space beneath the statue are bas-reliefs depicting the heroic deeds of he
Soviet army, and tell the story of the liberation of the German people from the Nazis--the
standard absolution of guilt awarded to the East Germans by their communist captors.
Carved into the sides of these sculptural elements are quotes from Joseph Stalin. The
stone used in the memorial was taken from the ruins of the Reich Chancellery. <A HREF="ROSPIC7.JPG" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/rospic7.jpg"><IMG SRC="ROSPIC7.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/rospic7.gif" ALIGN=top>(Image of memorial)</A>
<P>
<H4>11-19-90  Berlin</H4>
<P>
This morning there is a little sun outside--the first I've seen in a week. The house where I
am staying is slowly waking up. A friend of the person I am staying with arrived last night
from Hamburg to take part in today's demonstration against the police actions to evict
squatters from East Berlin buildings. I have mixed feelings about the situation.  I fear there
will be violence from some of the protesters, and the Berlin police have not shown
admirable restraint in the past. The squatters are comprised of an assortment of political
radicals mostly from the left, but they are sometimes pitted against right wing skinhead
groups. These people have been active in Berlin for years, but the removal of the wall,
rather than detracting from the counter-cultural appeal of Berlin, has given it new impetus.
<P> 
That evening I found Anamarie sanding the floors of her apartment. She was covered head
to toe in dust, but she made some coffee, and then gave me a lift to the Palast Hotel
opposite Marx-Engels Forum where Suzanne Vega is staying while in Berlin. I ran into
two of her band members in the lobby and then met Allen, her tour manager, who told me
that they had just arrived a couple of hours earlier. Outside in the street, fleets of police
cars and vans cruised by, presumably to head off the protesters somewhere over in West
Berlin. Suzanne came down to the lobby and we went for dinner at an excellent restaurant
near the Ku'damm. The restaurant was patronized by a rather theatrical looking crowd. 
Each group arriving would push aside the front door curtains, strike a pose, greet the
maitre d', and glide to their tables. We enjoyed the food and were immensely entertained
by the comings and goings of the guests, particularly one woman wearing a skin-tight
green jump suit.  
<P>
According to today's paper: Yesterday, a Russian soldier stationed in Potsdam
commandeered a tank and drove it into West Berlin down the Ku'damm. He damaged
several cars in the process and was pursued by numerous police and Russian military
vehicles. He was finally stopped when one of his pursuers jumped on the tank and threw a
coat over the driver's opening, which prevented him from seeing. Apparently, an argument
between the soldier and his girlfriend had precipitated the escapade.
<P>
<H4>11-20-90  Berlin</H4>
<P>
I met Suzanne at a press conference she was doing at the Cafe Einstein. The cafe, which
occupies several rooms of what was once a large villa on the Kurfuerstenstrasse, had been
rented for the morning and was filled with fifty or more journalists and photographers.
Suzanne walked in, posed for almost five minutes for the photographers, and took a seat
behind a long table set before French doors that looked out on a garden. The questions
were generally not very interesting. Suzanne dodged a few political questions--some
specifically about the late-breaking squatter/police activities--and a few awkward questions
about a death threat that had been recently directed toward her bass player while they
were in England. (Suzanne performed in a bullet-proof vest at one outdoor concert.) That
event, or non-event, has been blown out of proportion. After the conference Suzanne did
an on-camera interview with an Italian TV crew that is following her around for a few days.
<P>
From there we battled post-wall Berlin traffic, crossing the no man's land a couple of times
before finally stopping at a stretch of still-standing wall painted on by various artists. We
got out of our car and Suzanne, Anton, and I walked along the wall in a blinding drizzle for
the Italian camera crew. Back in the car we returned to the Palast Hotel for a short rest,
and then we boarded the tour bus and made our way through East Berlin to the hall where
Suzanne was scheduled to play that evening. It was a sports hall built around 1950.
Backstage was a book signed by various ice hockey teams, participants of political song
gatherings--including Pete Seeger--and more recently, a few rock acts including James
Brown and Grace Jones. Many of the earlier signers had wished success to the East
German communist state and to Erich Honecker in particular.
<P>
As show time neared it became obvious that a very large crowd would be on hand for the
concert. In the end it was 7,500 people and we were told that 1,500 had been turned
away. The crowd was tremendously enthusiastic and Suzanne and the band put on one of
the best shows I've seen them do. Afterwards, Suzanne was elated--Anton moped
because he had had equipment problems--Mike and Frank argued about Frank's
impromptu drum excursion at the end of "Casper Hauser"--and Marc seemed pretty happy
about the whole thing. 
<P>
<H4>11-21-90  Berlin</H4>
<P>
I bought a train ticket for Prague where I will be meeting up again with Suzanne's tour. 
She has gone to Minden in West Germany for a concert, but I stayed in Berlin. Near the
station I bought a copy of Jane Kramer's "Europeans," and I also picked up a paperback
copy of Rene Burri's "Die Deutschen," a photo book I've admired but had only seen before
in expensive hard cover. I then took a taxi to the Philharmonie and bought a ticket for a
concert that I plan to attend with Anamarie when I get back from Prague.  It's the Berlin
Philharmonic conducted by Seiji Ozawa with Mstislav Rostropovich on cello performing
three concertos including one by Alfred Schnittke, a contemporary Russian composer I've
been interested in for a while. 
<P>
<H4>11-22-90   Berlin-Prague</H4>
<P>
I took a taxi to the Lichtenberg Bahnhof, a rather remote station in East Berlin where the
trains leave for various southern destinations. Before reunification it must have been quite
a trek to the station, clearing customs at Friedrichstrasse and then taking the S-Bahn to
Lichtenberg--though it's doubtful that many westerners would have gone that way. Even
now with the wall down it is somewhat forbidding to pass through the dark streets of East
Berlin to reach this small dingy train station.
<P>
There didn't appear to be too many westerners travelling now. A woman sat in my
compartment on the train, but as soon as she realized I was a foreigner, she wordlessly
got up and left. At Dresden I caught a glimpse of the old center of the city ravaged by the
bombing and resulting firestorm during World War II. I could see the opera house and
church spires as my train crossed the Elbe River. As we pulled into the station, hundreds
of people began running and jostling one another for advantage in boarding the train. Old
women with plastic shopping bags and scruffy looking men pressed forward as the train
came to a stop.
<P>
Eight of us were now packed into one compartment. Almost immediately an argument
broke out because a young man in front of me would not take the seat closest to the
window to allow a couple to sit together. Someone else shifted to that seat, finally.
Throughout the rest of the trip, the compartment was filled with constant chatter in
Czech--or Slovak--usually in loud argumentative tones. The hall outside was filled with
standees, and people were constantly getting up and sitting back down. One man in
particular was unpleasant. There was some kind of problem with his ticket, and he and the
conductor almost came to blows. The man sat down across from me. He had oily and
scarred skin and his forearms were covered with tattoos.  There were needle marks on the
inside of his arms.
<P>
I did my best to pull within my shell as I pressed up against the train window. Outside, the
despoiled Czech landscape slipped by. Factories and fields co-mingled in a chaotic and
disturbing patchwork. High on the hillsides, pre-fab concrete housing blocks were stacked
randomly. Pipes carrying oil or chemicals were elevated over the fields, and everywhere
coal smoke poured from chimneys and smokestacks.
<P>
In Prague, I mistakenly (or so I thought at the time) got off the train at a suburban station
and had to walk into the city. There was nowhere in the station to exchange money, and I
was unaware of a subway line that would have quickly taken me to the center of town. I
got confused and started walking in the wrong direction.  A group of teenage boys were
walking down the street, and I heard them singing a familiar tune--dut dut duh dut--it was
Suzanne's song "Tom's Diner" (!). Eventually I saw the spires of central Prague--which had
been hidden behind the hills--and found my way to the main square.
<P>
I stood in the midst of hundreds--maybe thousands--of people and began to strategize how
I might find out which hotel Suzanne was staying in. I had stupidly neglected to write the name down. Amazingly, a voice called out--hey
Brian! It was Mike, Suzanne's bass player. He was touring the square with the other band
members. They told me how to find the hotel--a substantial distance away--but easy to
reach by subway. The hotel was situated in the middle of a neighborhood of concrete slab
housing and a few glass office buildings. The Interhotel, itself a glass skyscraper of about
20 stories, was a holdover from the communist days when tourists and business people
were able to stay only at expensive state-owned, secret-police-guarded hotels.
<P>
All of this--the hotel and the landscape I had just passed through on the train--stood in
profound contrast to the beauty of old Prague. Largely undamaged by the war, it
gracefully wears the architectural accretions of centuries. Not only the old medievel and
baroque buildings impressed me, but also the many Jugenstil and/or Art Nouveau buldings
scattered outside the oldest part of the city.
<P>
Last night we--Suzanne, the band, and crew--went to dinner at a restaurant across the
Vltava River beneath the Prague Castle. The restaurant was barely marked on the outside,
but inside it was full of people and the atmostphere was warm and convivial. We had
Prague ham served with an incongruous topping of whipped cream and horseradish. As everywhere in Prague, the
prices were extremely low--which is a shock after being in Germany where the dollar does
not go very far. I can only speculate how little the average person must earn here.
Afterwards we walked through the city, startlingly devoid of people, our footsteps ringing in
the streets.  It was quite magical--and then back to our hotel tower of banality.
<P>
<H4>11-23-90  Prague</H4>
<P>
Yesterday it rained most of the day so none of us went into the center of town to walk
around as planned. We rested in the hotel. In the lobby we ran into a white-haired man in
a tweed jacket--apparently one of the concert organizers--who informed us that 4,000
tickets had been sold--1,200 more than the hall is supposed to hold. I sat in the hotel
snack bar and read some of Jane Kramer's New Yorker essays collected in the book
"Europeans." At four we left for the hall, which was part of a complex of buildings including
another glass skyscraper hotel. The hall itself was spacious though a little bland. We later
learned that it had been the meeting hall for Czech communist party gatherings, and that
for concert audiences those memories are still quite fresh. It has been, of course, only a
year since the so-called "velvet revolution" swept the communists out of power, and Vaclav
Havel, the playwright, was elected president.
<P>
After the soundcheck we had a make-shift traditional Thanksgiving dinner prepared by the
English caterers traveling with the tour. We had turkey with mashed potatoes and gravy,
which was pretty good, although the fluourescent-lit room left a little to be desired. About a
half hour before show time I took a peek at the audience from the stage and was horrified
to see that the hall had indeed been drastically oversold. The standing room people were
standing or sitting in the aisles preventing the reserved ticket holders from getting to
their seats. The entrances to the hall were jammed and impassable.  Eventually, things
were worked out, though 1,200 (!) people had to find standing space in the hall.
<P>
As in East Berlin, the crowd was expectant and enthusiastic. Rarely in the States have I
seen this kind of response to Suzanne's music. Part of it I attribute to the newness of this
kind of pop concert in countries closed to the West for so many decades. But largely, I
think, the audiences were responding because the songs meant something to them. In
Czechoslovakia, in particular, music played an important role in the revolution--in keeping
alive hope and providing some means of expression against the state. It was an emotional
evening for me, as it had been in Berlin. The show ended with an especially effective drum
solo by Frank in "Casper Hauser," a song that seemed to take on added significance in
these eastern countries. "I fell under a moving piece of sun, freedom." In these moments I
could almost forget the profound difficulties that are faced all over eastern Europe--and
particulary by these brightly alive faces--the cream of Czechoslovak society--who must
rebuild their country.
<P>
After the show Suzanne faced the press in a brief and chaotic gathering backstage.
Suzanne was somewhat intimidated by the crowd of journalists and was not at her best in
answering questions. She was also exhausted. Later she kept saying how there were so
many things she would like to have said, but couldn't come up with them in the crush of
journalists and flashing cameras. 
<P>
Back at the hotel we wound down with a few drinks and watched the blatant prostitution
going on in the bar. About a dozen provocatively dressed women worked the crowd of
businessmen, going upstairs and returning shortly to pick up another customer. Today the
tour moves onto Vienna, and I return to Berlin.
<P>
<H4>11-26-90  Prague-Berlin</H4>
<P>
I walked around Prague all day on Friday. I crossed the Charles Bridge and walked
through the old Jewish cemetery with its layers and layers of graves and hundreds of
gravestones tilting every-which-way. I also attempted to spend my Czech money on either
books or records, but I had a hard time finding much that I really wanted. Suzanne's
albums were supposed to have been available in Prague, but I didn't see any. All the
stores seemed to have exactly the same books or records, and I assume they are still
state-owned. Were there private shops that sold western records? I finally bought three
CDs of Czech Philharmonic recordings for $4 a piece.
<P>
My train returned to the same remote station in East Berlin I had left from. Anamarie had
said she might pick me up there, but she was nowhere in sight. The station was crawling
with sinister types--drunks and skinheads--and the floor was littered with the bundled forms of
homeless people. I retreated back upstairs to the train platform and caught the next
S-Bahn to the Zoo Station in West Berlin.  
<P>
<H4>11-27-90  Berlin</H4>
<P>
On Monday I awoke to steady rain and decided to go the Zoo Bahnhof to buy my train
ticket back to Amsterdam a couple of days ahead of time. Signs on the doors stated that
the Deutsche Reichsbahn, the ex-DDR railroad, which still runs all the trains in and out of
Berlin, was on strike. After talking to someone in a travel agency, who said there was no
way of knowing how long the strike might last, I booked a flight from Berlin to Hannover
with a train connection to Amsterdam.  
<P>
Saturday morning I went by car with Anamarie and three friends of hers to see the Einstein
Tower by the expressionist architect Erich Mendelsohn. The tower, a solar observatory, is
located near Potsdam on the outskirts of Berlin. It was built around 1920. Before the wall
came down, the Einstein Tower was quite difficult to get to, and few foreigners have seen it
in many years. The tour was led by a bearded scientist who spoke clear and precise German
--not that I could follow all of it--and his sidekick fed slides into an old-fashioned projector one
by one.
<P>
After 30 minutes or so of this science background we were led to the tower, which stands on
a grassy plateau surrounded by a grove of trees. The tower is remarkable to see--even today
it is a radical design with its undulating surfaces and expressionistic lines. An office on the
ground floor contains the original furniture designed by Mendelsohn frozen in time.<br> <A HREF="ROSARC1.JPG" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/rosarc1.jpg"><IMG SRC="ROSARC1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.vega.net/vega/rosarc1.gif" ALIGN=TOP>(Image of Einstein Tower)</A>
<P>
The next day I set out on foot for the Lenin memorial on Lenin Platz, not far from
Anamarie's apartment. It's in the part of East Berlin that was cleared in the 50s to make
way for dozens of concrete housing blocks. The memorial is a large statue of Lenin done
in the familiar heavy-handed Soviet style, and the figure is posed in front of an immense apartment tower. I walked to to Karl Marx Allee and looked at the huge Stalinesque
apartment buildings built just after the war that line the boulevard. They look more like
Moscow than Berlin, but despite their pretentiousness, they have more
character than the newer apartment projects nearby.  
<P>
Walking on further, I reached the section of wall where Suzanne and I walked in the rain
for Italian television about a week ago. Workmen were removing a guard tower nearby,
and a toppled one I had seen earlier was no longer there. Everything is vanishing almost
before my eyes. I walked on and passed another guard tower still standing--the one that
Hans Haacke, a former art teacher of mine, had festooned with a glowing neon
Mercedes-Benz star.  Dismantled now.  A great Haacke piece I think. An old man walking
his dog looked at me with my camera and wondered aloud why I was taking photographs
when the wall isn't there any more.
<P>
Behind the Axel Springer publishing building on some buildings across the no man,s land
were various advertising billboards. One was a cigarette ad saying "Come Together" with
a white and black persons' smiling faces. Next to that was a political poster for the PDS,
the successor to the SED, the old communist party of East Germany. In the ad, a sassy,
very modern young woman sticks her tongue out in joyful exuberance. The slogan says
"Left is Lively." To the left of the billboards, grafitti on the wall reads "Keine Stasi Amnesty"
(no amnesty for the Stasi, the former secret police)--once controlled, of course, by the
SED--now transformed into the joie de vivre PDS.
<P>
Later that day I visited a friend who owns an art gallery in West Berlin.  We had an
enjoyable chat about Berlin and the changes that have taken place. Like many Berliners
he misses the old wall days, though he would never suggest that the events of the last
year should not have have happened. He is concerned about the influx of eastern Europeans
into Berlin, and it is expected that Russians will no longer have to acquire special visas to
leave the Soviet Union. This could result in even more disaffected and unsophisticated
people--peasants and factory workers--pouring into Berlin. Yesterday, I saw a man in the
street carrying a whole skinned goat over his shoulder.
<P>
<H4>12-2-90  Amsterdam</H4>
<P>
This morning I flew from Berlin to Hannover and took the train to Amsterdam. The
Reichsbahn strike is partially over according to the Herald Tribune, but I was glad to be out
of Berlin without once again entrusting my fate to the collapsing East German
infrastructure. 
<P>
On Friday in Amsterdam, Renee and I went to see an exhibit of eastern European
photography at the old stock exchange building on the Damrak--the Beurs van Berlage.
The building is named for it designer, the great dutch architect H.P. Berlage. 
<P>
The exhibit was quite fascinating.  Most of the photographs dealt with recent events in
eastern Europe, or with the lives of ordinary people in these countries over the past few
decades. Most of the photographers worked in a reportage style, which tended to
emphasize the bleakness of places and the poignancy of people's lives. Repeatedly,
tormented eyes stared out from gritty black and white prints. The best work, not
surprisingly, was Joseph Koudelka's images of Prague Spring 1968, many of which I have
seen before.
<P>
On Saturday I failed miserably to leave Europe. I was late to the train station in
Amsterdam, and when the next train to airport was cancelled due to mechanical problems,
I was stuck with having to make a hopeless journey to the airport knowing I wouldn't make
my flight. At the airport I bought a ticket for the next day--after paying a substantial
penalty--and then I somehow managed to lose my address book while trying to call Renee.

I took a cab back to Renee's apartment and waited forlornly on the street about an hour
until she came home.  She was laden with shopping bags full of clothes bought in the few
hours since my apparent departure.  Today I have been more successful in tearing myself
away from the continent, and I look forward to processing my film and making prints.
