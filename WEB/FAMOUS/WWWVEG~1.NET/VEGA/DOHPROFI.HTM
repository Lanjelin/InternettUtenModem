<p>
<br><p><body>Once in the realm of the pop charts, routinely, there were 
poets.  Songwriters whom you could
easily imagine not only reading and being inspired by some of the major 
linear poets, but thinkers who used
words within their music on purpose, rather than accidentally; to 
create images, truth, a voice, works of enduring
art.  I wrote an essay, sometime in the 70's, comparing these songpoets 
to print poets: If Bob Dylan were Allan
Ginsberg, and Joni Mitchell were Sara Teasdale, then Laura Nyro could 
have been Emily Dickenson (and vice-versa)
and Bruce Springsteen  Walt Whitman.  Lou Reed was Delmore Schwartz, of 
course, Paul Simon was Robert
Frost, and Loudon Wainwright was definitely my choice for e.e. 
cummings.  There was no Shakespeare, unfortunately,
but how about Leonard Cohen as Ezra Pound, Van Morrison as Dylan 
Thomas, Tom Waits as Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
and David Byrne as T.S. Eliot?</body>
<br>
<p><body>Lately I notice you can still play this game, but the cast of 
characters has been severely depleted up
at the high end of the songwriting-as-art community: John Cougar 
Mellancamp as Carl Sandburg, Natalie Merchant
as Edna St. Vincent Millay, Morrisey as Shelley, Robert Smith as Lord 
Byron, Christine Lavin as Judith Viorst.
The comparison that rings truest to me these days is Suzanne Vega as 
Sylvia Plath.</body>
<br>
<p><body>If the grumbling critics decrying her inablility to produce 
another <i>"Luka"</i> would instead devote
their attention to examining the body of work that she's created, 
Suzanne Vega's reputation would be placed
in its proper perspective, as that of the first true songpoet of the 
90's.  In fact, in the face of such immense pressure 
to simplify and trivialize and commercialize her soul and spirit, 
Vega's refusal to capitulate to commerce and
redundancy stands as perhaps her most remarkable achievement.</body>
<p><body>Vega herself never had any fear of losing her resolve or her 
voice.  Her respect for the language is
inborn, inherited from her father, a novelist, and nurtured by two 
brothers and a sister throughout a lifetime of
intense dinner table conversations.  "Everyone in my family is 
well-spoken and articulate," says Vega.  "You almost
have to be in our family.  My father was very precise about words, 
because he had been brought up in Puerto
Rico until he was 12 or 13; he came to New York and learned the 
language from scratch."</body>
<p><body>So the slings and arrows of critics hardly pierce her tower of 
words.  "I don't think I made any claims that
I don't fulfill," she says of her career thus far.  "I don't make any 
claims; I just write songs the best way I can.  I
have a lot of faith in my writing ability.  I feel like the songs are 
good, and that's the bottom line."  Which doesn't
mean she's immune to criticism.  "People are always giving me advice.  
'You should take voice lessons.  You should 
learn how to read music.  You should take guitar lessons.  You should 
write with more melodic lines.  You should
put more hooks in.  You should write about more mainstream things.'  I 
listen to what they say, and then I go off and
do what I do."</body>
<p><body>It's the depth of what Vega does, however, what she gives us 
on record, that brings to mind the tragic
spectre of the doomed Syvia Plath, who took her own life in 1963, at 
the age of 30, eventually becoming in the late
60's and 70's, a kind of sedentary female James Dean figure for a 
generation of sensitive and creative women.  Images
of alienation, solitude, decay, and despair abound in Vega's first 
three albums.  In <b>Days of Open Hand,</b> her
first-peson narrator sleeps all day, feels like she's missing certain 
vital parts, identifies with suicides and the institutionalized,
sees herself only on the printed page, and envies from afar "Those 
whole girls...with bloom to spare.  They know 
health...."  These are not exactly <i>up</i> tunes.  In fact, 
<i>"Luka,"</i> from her second album, possibly the most
depressing lyric to reach number one since <i>"Teen Angel,"</i> was for 
Vega something like a day at the beach,
musically at least.  It's as if fame has made her even more wary and 
self-conscious.</body>
<p><body>"I know I must be getting big," she jokes, "because all of a 
sudden, people are much more critical of what
I say or do or wear."  For the first 10 years of her career she never 
had to worry about that.  "When I was 16,
I would just go out and sing, and some people would listen and some 
people wouldn't," she recalls.  "And it they
didn't listen, Iwould laugh."</body>
<p><body>Although in person Vega is nowhere near as dire and solemn as 
her writing persona, she's deadly
serious about her purpose in life.  "I knew from the time I was four or 
five that I wanted to do something, and it
wasn't work in a library or be a school teacher or be a nurse," she 
says.  "It's almost something that you don't question;
you're born to it.  Maybe I'd gotten an example from my parents, who 
were struggling for a long time and are still
struggling.  I was inspired by Dylan, by his character more than his 
actual music; by what he represented.  He was
a person who wrote about what he felt, and this, to me, was more 
interesting than other people who are famous 
for a week or a year.  I don't want to be a flash or a fad that's going 
to come and go like that.  I would rather think
of myself in a more old-fashioned sense as a craftsperson.  Kurt Weill 
wasn't a folk star.  He wasn't the big thing
of 1935, or whenever it was.  He was just thought of as a person who 
worked hard at what he did, and who earned
a certain respect.  He didn't have to do videos.  He was a lyricist and 
he was respected for it.  In the long run,
I would rather not be this sensational celebrity-type."</body>
<p><body>While Vega is confident that her passion for the language will 
ultimately see her through whatever
dry spells fame and its attendant demons may inflict, her biggest 
problem and challenge remains translating her
singular vision from the guitar to the world.</body>
<p><body>     "When I first started working with musicians," she says, 
"I used to feel like, 'There's no way that
you're going to do anything to this song because it's my song.'  But I 
learned that the song is still there, no matter
what you do to it.  At first, I was really nervous about going on tour 
with a band, because I was so used to playing
by myself and having that freedom of dynamics.   Even though I'm not 
entirely comfortable on stage, it's something
that I have to do.  I still miss having that kind of solitary feeling I 
get with the audience when I'm up there by myself.
On the other hand, there's a lot more strength.  It's such a different 
feeling to hear all the music behind you and to 
hear everybody coming together in harmony.  I'd never felt anything 
like that before, to be in front of this sound that
was coming out of the stage."</body>
<p><body>For Suzanne Vega, clearly, the struggle is not over.  "I'm 
kind of passing between two worlds," she
reflects.  "I'm not a rock singer and I never will be.  But at the same 
time, I'm not a folk singer in the way that I
used to be years ago when I first started, when I had long hair and my 
flower dresses and my guitar.  I still feel
like I'm walking some weird line.  Like if I take one wrong step, I 
could just fall off."</body>
