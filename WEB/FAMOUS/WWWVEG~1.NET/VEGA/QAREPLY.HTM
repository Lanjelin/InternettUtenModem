Re Bob King's recent comments:  Pretty good for working on two hours of
sleep.
I also think the album is underrrated.  
<p>
The Boulevardier days were the best and worst of times.  We were broke and
stretched to the limit creatively and emotionally--though the strongest drug
we
were on was coffee.  It's the kind of experience you know you need to go
through
in order to reach another level.  Then it's over.  You pick up all the pieces
and go on.   Many of your friendships don't survive.   Success creates
barriers,
bitterness, jealousy.  Suzanne went on to a record deal with A&M.  I began
photographing along the former Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall.  When the
dust
cleared a few years later, our friendship was still intact.  Sometimes things
work out.

He [Brian] was actually rather modest in the answer to his questions -- he is the
"narrator" character of Tom's Diner;  (I was pretending to be him that
morning), and is one of the characters in the Boulevardiers -- 
<p>
"he loves the city with the bricks and broken bottles and the pretty little
flowers as they grow along the wall; he is dark, he is tall, he is the
tallest one of all of us." 
<p>
I think he was always annoyed that I didn't say "handsome".  His line in
Knight Moves is --"she doesn't have a political bone in her body", which he
said about me in a catty moment (there were many).
<p>
The real influence Brian had on me was getting me to listen to the Velvet
Underground -- I had just seen Lou Reed the year before I met Brian, and
though I coudn't forget it I hadn't really  explored the whole thing.  We
also listened to the Talking Heads and Television and Blondie and I think
Patti Smith, although that whole scene was dying out by that time.  We had
aspirations of being New Wavers.
<p>
Anyhow -- thanks again.  I'll stay in touch.
