             BOOK OF DREAMS

             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams

             I took your urgent whisper
             Stole the arc of a white wing
             Rode like foam on the river of pity
             Turned its tide to strength
             Healed the hole that ripped in living

             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams

             The spine is bound to last a life
             Tough enough to take the pounding
             Pages made of days of open hand

             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams

             Number every page in silver
             Underline in magic marker
             Take the name of every prisoner
             Yours is there my word of honor

             I took your urgent whisper
             Stole the arc of a white wing
             Rode like foam on the river of pity
             Healed the hole that ripped in living

             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams
             In my book of dreams
