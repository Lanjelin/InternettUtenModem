     While waiting for Suzanne's new album, I would like to discuss her
latest.  In my opinion the album is all about sex and sexuality,
encompassing their function, dysfunctions and deviations.
<p>
     For example 99.9 F and Rock In This Pocket are about impotence.
Suzanne's strength is her canny ability to juxtapose images and ideas.
99.9 F starts wittily "99.9 F degrees/ Stable now/ with rising 
possibilities"; While in Rock In This Pocket, the biblical language of
"knowing" a person is used to convey the consummation of the sexual act.
In both songs, one could feel the desperation of the characters trying
to prove their sexual puissance.
<p>
     In Liverpool is about sexual fantasies.  The narrator is fantasizing
about having sex with another person while doing it.  It is imaginatively
shrouded in the metaphor of the HUnchback of Notre Dame and the Boy in the
Belfry.  The listener is forced to use his or her imagination.
<p>
     Bad Wisdom is about pedophilia and As Girls Go is about transsexual-
ism.  While homosexuality/bisexuality is dealt with in Fat Man & Dancing
Girl.<p>

Really. "Rock In this Pocket" is my least-favorite Suzanne 
Vega song, since it's so obvious. Maybe if she hadn't included 
(Song of David) as part of the title. I do like the double-
meaning of "turn your attention/my way."

[stuff about pedophilia, etc., deleted]
<p>
Similarly, the Queen and the Soldier is about an off-duty GI 
wandering into a gay bar near the base, Marlene On the Wall is about 
bondage (how the hell do you think she STAYS on the wall?), Straight 
Lines is about pondering one's sexual orientation, and Undertow is 
about ... well, that "swallow you whole" line speaks for itself!
<p>
No, not really.
<p>
While SV's songs are certainly open to various interpretations, and 
there's certainly a sexual undertone to a lot of 99.9F, I don't buy a 
lot of your readings of some of these songs. For instance, I think In 
Liverpool is pretty clearly what she represents it as (especially in 
the diary entry included as part of the 99.9F limited edition) -- 
reminiscing about an old boyfriend from Liverpool when she happens to 
be in his city years later (the same one, in fact, that Gypsy is 
about). I don't get from the song that she (the narrator) is "doing 
it" during the song; if she can write in her diary at the same time 
then she's either really bored or has more dexterity than humans are 
commonly gifted with.
<p>
Also, she's never specified what Bad Wisdom is about. It could be 
about pedophilia, but also about teen pregnancy, AIDS, general 
turmoil of puberty, etc. 
<p>
Could the song 99.9 be about impotence? Maybe, but I'd need to hear 
more of an explanation of why you think so. I've always seen it as 
about the moment when sexual tension is beginning to grow, with the 
guy getting a bit flustered while Suzanne (or the narrator) kind of 
sits back and coolly dissects his mood. (I have a few "artist" 
friends who are constantly analyzing everything you do, say, think, 
look, gesture, etc., which makes them kind of fun to be around but 
can also make me a bit self conscious. Anyone else know what I mean? 
This song kind of reminds me of that.)
<p>
Also, I'd like to hear why you think Fat Man & Dancing Girl is about 
bisexuality. I've always imagined it to be about Suzanne and Mitchell 
meeting in the studio (with SV, of course, being the girl with the 
hand that's covering most of her mouth). It's a wonderful song that 
I'd like to write about more fully sometime, but I especially love 
the lines that really seem to encapsulate how Suzanne approaches her 
songwriting:
<p>
         Does she tell the truth?<br>
         Does she hide the lie?<br>
         Does she say it so no one can know?<br>
<p>
The song has such a great show-biz, studio-trickery, 
pay-no-attention-to-the-man-behind-the-curtain feel to it. Also 
some of the best (i.e., non-annoying) use of sampling I'm familiar 
with.
<p>
Anyway, this isn't to try to shoot you down, just to say I don't buy 
it. I'd at least like to hear more of an explanation, not just "this 
song is about such and such." Otherwise we could spin theories about 
why In The Eye is about O.J. Simpson, Book of Dreams is about Myst, 
Luka is about Newt Gingrich, etc.

I agree that there is a great deal of sexuality in 99.9. However, I don't 
really think the album is about sex anymore than it's about experimenting 
with industrial rock. I think the rhythms of the album and Suzanne's 
voice make any sexual innuedo that much more potent. There's a sharpness 
to her words when she's not even remotely approaching the subject of sex, 
and I think that comes from her use of short words and phrases and hard 
syllables. For this reason, I think, when she makes a reference which 
could be interpreted as sexual, it sort of jumps out at you. ANd while I 
really enjoy this quality of Suzanne's music, I think that it is not the 
primary quality and should not be interpreted as the primary meaning of 
her songs.

Wow, that is quite an overview of 99.9  While I agree that these elements 
exist in these songs and I think that is certainly a door that we have 
not gone through before--other than the transexualism of As Girls Go.  I 
have to disagree with the Bad Wisdom analysis.  I don't think its about 
pedophilia at all.  I'd like to actually see the arguement for that.  It 
does however fit in with the rest of your overview of the album in that I 
believe it is about AIDS or some other kind of disease that one can get 
from unprotected sex.  That is the Bad Wisdom in the song.  I mean she 
says:  Mother you've taught me the laws are so fine/If I'm good then I 
will be protected/I fallen through the crack/And there's no getting 
back/I will pay for my life with my body.  These lines I interpret as 
being about how people are treated who have diseases like AIDS.  One 
mistake and they pay for their life w/ their bodies.  Also, they reflect 
the way the Reagan Admin. refused to acknowledge that AIDS existed.
<p>
If this song were about pedophilia I don't think there would be the tone 
of sympathy for the narrator of the song.  At least I hope not.  This is 
obviously someone who has made a mistake and now is outcast by society 
because of ignorance.
<p>
I also remember Suzanne saying that it was particularly about AIDS, but 
as an artist she feels she writes about the time she is living in.  I 
believe that what she meant is that it could be about anyone who suffers 
from the ignorance of others and misinformation and also the tragedy of 
contracting a terminal disease.  But at the same time, AIDS is the most 
prevelent thing on everyone's mind.
<p>
But, as I said before I'd love to hear the pedophelia arguement.

As I said before, I too would like to see the analysis.  I'm a little 
more curios than my pal Bob King as I do buy into "some" of the imagery.  
I'd just like to see it explained.
<p>
That's what I love about this place.  We can toss around theories, look 
at the lyrics and comes up with new levels of meaning and new doors to 
explore the music through.
<p>
I remember Suzanne even talking about "Ironbound/Fancy Poultry" one time 
and this was a year or so after it was out and as she was talking she 
came up w/ a new level of meaning to the song and surprised herself.  I 
think it's possible to see many things in Suzanne's music whether she 
intended it to be there initially or not.  I think she'd say the same.

Well, sex may not be the primary issue--but it could be an issue of the 
music that is fascinating to explore.  While Suzanne is experimenting 
with a new sound on 99.9 I don't think it is primarily about 
experimenting with the new sound.  Lots of things are happening there.

I interpret the above lyrics as having to do with the poor girls who get

<p>
(excuse me for my bad English, I'm French)
<p>
WOW WOW WOW!<br>
Where are you guys going to ?<br>
pedophilia, incest, prostitution,...?<br>
Well maybe you're right.<br>
My opinion on Suzanne's songs is that she usually writes obvious songs and 
waits for people's ideas of what it's about (though she probably knows, while
writing a song, what other meanings it could seem to have).
<p>
I mean journalists ask her: "What do you mean by Small Blue Thing, and by 
Undertow ?"
<p>
And she says "well I really wondered what it would feel to be an Undertow, 
a Small Blue Thing"
Or they ask:"Why do you mean by Institution Green? Is this the green of the
dollars, is this about Greenpeace ?"
And she casually answers: "Well no, I went to vote and all the walls and 
curtains and everything was green"<p>
And so on.<p>
So I Like to trust my first feelings and for me Bad Wisdom is just about being 
a teenager (remember), when you start to get wise and you feel that your 
friends don't. And you lose illusions so you fall through the crack and there's 
no getting back. and you feel so miserable you wish you weren't so wise...
<p>
Another example is Blood Makes Noise. I have no idea of what it's really 
about but I like to think it's about feeling too real (kind of the opposite of in 
As a Child). Have you never felt like this? When you hurt yourself or when 
you see yourself getting old (and I'm only 20) ?
 <p>
Or in Straight Lines: I found out in one of the interviews on the web that, as a 
teen, she went in her room and cut her hair in straight lines!
<p>
I think this is the humor in Suzanne's art. It's not in the songs themselves 
but in what people will do of them. Like in Luka: she's in Luka's shoes, but 
luka puts himself in the shoes of the person downstairs. So everybody ask 
her: "Did you know a Luka?", whereas they should ask:"Were YOU a Luka?"
God she's so great!  
<p>
This is the poetry of simple things. Look around you, there is poetry in 
absolutely everything. This is what she writes about, and I think Brian Rose is 
kind of an excuse for Tom's Diner, I think this song describes her whole work.
<p>
Well I repeat this is only my opinion, and you may disagree.
Anyway if she ever says what such song is about, I will keep my first 
interpretation of it, because when I hear a song, I see movies in my head, 
movies guided by the words and not always the real meaning of the song, 
and this movie sticks in my head forever.

David, you've said it all! Really, I think you have, with this one
message, struck right to the heart of what Suzanne's work is all
about, and in a very direct, Vega-like fashion. You may have written
the last paragraph anyone has to write on this topic.
<p>
I almost feel like we should retire the list right now -- just stop 
spinning our theories, shut the whole thing down and go out and 
spread the Word. 
<p>
At the very least, your "poetry of simple things" line should be
quoted in every article written about Suzanne henceforth. (I'm 
reminded of a line from another gifted poet/songwriter, Cindy 
Wheeler: "This is the volatile stuff that comes from something 
small." She was referring to birdshit _and_ poetry.)
<p>
Thank you.

I was listening to Suzanne's "Learning Annex" talk yesterday, and she was 
saying that she wrote about things that are local rather than starting 
from larger topics such as: justice or love.  Like, w/ Small Blue Thing, 
she said she had a thought, "I feel like a Small Blue Thing" and then 
thought, "What a funny thought" and then she started thinking what a 
small blue thing felt like and so on and that's where the song came 
from.  I think w/ a song like small blue thing, it's left really open for 
interpretation.
<p>
Bad Wisdom is also capable of having lots of interpretations, but I think 
I don't necessarily agree that it is just about the woes of being a 
teenager.  One must really pay attemtion to the title:  "Bad Wisdom" and 
also some of the lyrics: "I will pay for my life w/ my body" in order to 
realize that there is something tragic in the song.  Like incest, 
prostetution, terminal illness (AIDS) or even teen pregnancy, or even 
drug addiction--perhaps of a teenager--perhaps of anyone.  I guess it 
really doesn't matter what "general" area the song covers--what 
matters--and this is what makes Suzanne a minimalist in some ways--is the 
feeling.  There is something tragic going on in this song because of a 
moment of "Bad Wisdom" and now perhaps the narrator view her/his life as 
being in jeopardy or over.

Wow, that's interesting.  I never really thought of the prostitution 
angle.  That could be prostitution in America too--especially like teen 
prostitution and runaways.  In that case, there might be some connection 
to Neighborhood Girls.  
<p>
That's what's great about Suzanne's music.  It leaves interpretation up 
for grabs.
