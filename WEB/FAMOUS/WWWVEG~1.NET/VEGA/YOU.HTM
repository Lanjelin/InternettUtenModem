<STRONG><EM>Goodbye bedsit blues, hello des New York res. Now installed in a huge loft
in a converted ice warehouse, cult heroine Suzanne Vega casts off the
mournful balladeer image with her playful new album. Adriaane Pielou
listens in.</EM></STRONG>
<P>
Suzanne Vega, queen of the mournful story-song about solitude and
suffering, hopes finally to shake off the timid waif tag with her playful
new album.
<P>
The queen of bedsit blues turns out to live in quite the hippest des  New
York res. A huge loft with its own roof garden in a converted ice warehouse
down near the Hudson in lower Manhattan, with long muslin curtains that
sway in the breeze, exposed brick walls, lots of cushions and plants, piles
of books everywhere, two cats, two white birds in a cage, and an eclectic
mix of paintings and sculpture, including a self-portrait.
<P>
That's what our photographer reported back, anyway. Suzanne Vega allowed
only the pictures to be done at her apartment. For our meeting she insisted
on the anonymity of her record company's office on W 21st Street.
<P>
A cult heroine since the unexpected success of her first album, back in
1985, she is clearly selective regarding what she reveals about herself.
Her songs may sound intimate, with her unadorned voice ("I like to think of
it as a pencil, plain and useful, ordinary") and habit of singing very
close to the mike. The uniformly unhappy things she writes about - most
famously, on her worldwide hit "Luka", about an abused boy who won't admit
his abuse - are always delicately and minutely observed. But you don't
actually learn much about Suzanne Vega the person from them.
<P>
"I don't feel it's appropriate people know that," she says several times
during our conversation. It is always about things I feel sure fans would
be fascinated by.
<P>
She is happy to discuss the meaning of her songs. What the title song of
her new album, 99.9 F, is about, for instance. "It's a flirting song, the
idea of being with a man and there's something off the normal happening.
Things could rise," she says in a measured, rather school-prefectish voice.
"Sort of a dirty joke, a tease, the idea a person is on the edge of
burning. A little like Peggy Lee's "Fever" but more specific. A little of
the beat, which is how I see myself."
<P>
Her song writing technique and what inspired that particular song also
prompt a long explanation. "I was in London and someone asked what the
weather had been like in New York; I said, oh, zero degrees, and then that
rang in my mind and I thought, wow, that's an interesting phrase, I'd like
to write a song called "Zero Degrees Fahrenheit". But I thought it was too
much like "Less Than Zero" which is Elvis Costello so I thought, well maybe
99.9..."
<P>
But a bald question such as, "How much have you earned from selling five
million records, Suzanne? is like pulling the wings off a butterfly. "I
won't tell you," she says stiffly. Why not? "Because I don't want to." Why
not I pursue.
<P>
"I feel that's a private thing. I mean I'm proud of the amount I've made
but I don't think it's part of my character. If I were to lose all of it
tomorrow I would still be myself, so... I don't feel it's a part of my
persona that I want everyone in England to read about," she replies, her
pale skin flushing slightly. She is also reticent about the songs she's
written that will never get on any album. "Some are just too personal or
it's like other people wouldn't understand... I'm aware it sounds kind of
stingy and mean but there are some things I don't think an audience wants
to hear. I don't feel it's right to blurt out my confessional private
secrets."
<P>
Her first album, Suzanne Vega, with its string of sad, melodic little
story-songs - "Marlene on the Wall" was about coping with loneliness
comforted by a Dietrich poster, "Small Blue Thing" about her being a marble
in someone's pocket - turned out to be a seminal success of the mid-80s.
Expected to sell only to the beard-and-sandals folk brigade in the
Greenwich Village bars she'd sung at since she was 15, instead it sold over
a million. It paved the way for record companies to sign up Tracy Chapman,
Tanita Tikaram, kd lang and other plangent-voiced women soloists with an
acoustic guitar and three-in-the-morning style of delivery.
<P>
Propelled by the worldwide success of the single "Luka", her second album,
Solitude Standing, sold over three million. That was followed by Days Of
Open Hand, which she produced herself, and which didn't do so spectacularly
- sales back around a million. So the new album, her fourth - "more
rock-ish, more playful and accessible" as she describes it - is obviously
going to be a decisive one. Which way it'll go, though, she couldn't say.
<P>
Reviews of her work are always mixed: "Heady, heartfelt art music"; "Vega
can't see the forest for the condensation on a quivering leaf." But the
songs she's been most successful with, "Luka" and "Tom's Diner" (about
sitting in a coffee shop watching the world shamble by(, were things she
wrote for herself with no thought of them being commercial. "So I've
accepted that if I do something just because I like it, it's likely to have
much more chance of hitting," she muses. "The whole thing goes up and down
anyway - sometimes you're wildly successful, sometimes you're not, so you
may as well have a good time."
<P>
In the meantime, though, she does hope the new album might finally lose her
that timid waif tag. You can see why she got it. She has a soft voice, she
sings about attempted suicide and people dying, and she's physically slight
- five foot six and just over seven stone. You can also see why she's
completely exasperated with it. Under that reserved manner she's really
rather tough. It's a wounded toughness, though, that seems to have been
gained during a turbulent childhood.
<P>
With her fair skin and reddish hair she is the lest likely looking Puerto
Rican you can imagine, but that's what she assumed she was as a child,
growing up on 112th street in a rough Hispanic neighbourhood. The man she
thought was her father - volatile Puerto Rican novelist Ed Vega -
constantly challenged the withdrawn, bookish Suzanne to be more rebellious.
When she wasn't agonising over that failure she was out in the mean streets
having to punch out bullies on behalf of her two little brothers and
sister.
<P>
One day, when Suzanne was nine, Ed Vega paused between political arguments
with her half-Swedish mother to reveal he was only her stepfather. The
shock hardened her shell. Suddenly her shaming lack of Latin fieriness made
sense, but as the only white girl in the area she'd become another kind of
misfit. Home was clearly no haven.
<P>
"The family I grew up in had its problems..." she says, after a long pause.
"But I don't talk about the... specific problems we had growing up because
I still see them all."
<P>
I ask why she feels so particularly passionately about child abuse. "Luka"
was so moving she received thousands of letters from people all over the
world telling her about their own, until then, repressed memories of abuse.
<P>
"That's actually the message behind a lot of my songs - that you must
protect those who are weaker than you," she says, looking at me piercingly.
"Violence between a man and a woman is bad enough. Violence between an
adult and a child is even worse because the child has no way of choosing.
The horror and disgust I feel about it spills over to political situations,
too, to what Amnesty talks about, people tortured for their beliefs, for no
other reason than that they are there. To me they're equally evil."
<P>
But perhaps the wounded feeling she transmits is a result of having spent
the first five weeks of her life in an incubator - something she discovered
only this June, when her mother called to wish her happy birthday.
<P>
"I was two and a half pounds when I was born, two months premature. My
sense of myself has always been as a very small person fighting against a
very large world that is maybe interested, maybe not interested," she
explains.
<P>
It wasn't until five years ago that she met her real father, Richard. On
impulse she decided to hire a private detective to track him down. He
turned out to be not the thin intellectual Suzanne had imagined, but a
large, jolly Californian who nevertheless delighted her by displaying a
number of characteristics she recognised in herself. "There's a singer
called Suzanne Vega," he told her after she first introduced herself. When
she sent him her early videos he was delighted to be able to fill in some
of the blanks and see what she'd been like in her 20s. "It's very
interesting having a father," she says thoughtfully. Now they talk
regularly on the phone, and he has entered her small circle of confidants.
<P>
"I find it as difficult as it ever was to make friends," she admits. "I
have acquaintances but I can't say I have lots of close friends. But I
never did." The closest are two women. One a designer whose clothes she
wears a lot, and the other a flute player from her year at New York's High
School for the Performing Arts - the Fame school, where she trained as a
dancer during the miserable years when she was trying to be an extrovert.
<P>
Once her teachers there had persuaded her to direct her talents elsewhere
she signed up for a year at Columbia University, following that with a
string of temporary jobs. She gave up the last, as a receptionist at a
typesetting firm, when her first album came out and A&M despatched her on
her first world tour.
<P>
At 33, she's now spent the best part of the last ten years touring. Not in
the States so much as Europe - she fills the Albert Hall - and Japan. She
copes with writing in her ubiquitous notebooks, reading a lot, looking out
of the hotel window and daydreaming. As a lifestyle, she says, it's
starting to wear thin. And it's no way to be if you want to have any kind
of family.
<P>
She split up with her last boyfriend - English a year ago. "When I started
doing all this, when I was 24, I thought by the time I was 33 it would have
been taken care of and I would be married. Instead, you take a bunch of
left turns and end up..." she trails off.
<P>
Being on her own does at least give her time to loll on her sofa for hours
on end, reading Wuthering Heights over and over again, a lot of Dickens,
endless glossy magazines. "I read tons of magazines. I crave them," she
says dreamily. "Elle, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Time, all of them. I like that
steady stream of information and fashion ideas and ways of presenting
yourself and make-up and all that stuff." A practising Buddhist, she chants
every day. Sometimes she has phases of going out a lot. You wouldn't think
she was a partying kind of person, but when she's in the mood she'll stay
out until eight in the morning. "When I do party I'm a really hearty
partier - always the first to arrive and the last to leave - and I make a
big pest of myself, I tell you. I like to dance and drink beer and Jack
Daniel's. The poor hostess is there yawning."
<P>
"And then I love walking home at night. I like knowing that I can take care
of myself in the street. I haven't had to prove it in a long time, but I
feel I can." She laughs, and taps the wooden desk. "But you should never
brag about that."
<P>
Does she get recognised in the street?
"Some days. It seems to be a thing that flashes on of its own will. Some
days I can walk around and see people turning around and going oh, it's
Suzanne Vega, and there's other days where I can't even get into my own
bank because they think I'm a messenger," she says ruefully.
<P>
Half an hour later she's off, to home and privacy. I watch her cross the
street. Not frail, not timid, but - sorry, Suzanne - rather vulnerable
looking for a street-fighting woman. Even a wealthy one.
