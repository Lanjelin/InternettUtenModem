On the 20th of December 1987 Suzanne Vega waved farewell to a packed house
at the Brighton Centre. This was the moment the curtain finally fell on the
*Solitude Standing* World Tour and represented the climax to what had been
the most successful year in her career to date.
<p>
Beyond any shadow of doubt 1987 was the year Suzanne found a place for
herself on the world's musical map. Her tour, which had begun the previous
April, at the Veteran's Memorial Theatre in Providence, Rhode Island was
certainly the most intensive and the most exhausting Suzanne and her band
had ever attempted. Save perhaps for the odd week's rest in-between
continents Suzanne could be found on the road for eight consecutive months
touring as far afield as the United States, Japan, Australia and ultimately
Europe.
<p>
The hard work paid off, of course, and Suzanne was handsomely rewarded.
*Solitude Standing*, her second album release for A&M, has at the last
count notched up some 2 1/2 million world-wide sales. In the UK and across
Europe she comfortably consolidated the success she had earned for herself
in the previous twelve months; the LPentering the UK charts as high as
number two. Most significantly, however, Suzanne enjoyed her first taste of
commercial success in her native America. The album peaked at number 11 in
the Billboard chart, whereas *Luka* became a surprise summer hit, reaching
number three in August when it was prevented from reaching the top spot
only by Los Lobos (*La Bamba*) and Madonna (*Who's That Girl?*).
<p>
In the light of all this, one could easily be fooled into thinking that
Suzanne's rise to stardom was a meteoric one. However, this is not the
case. As Terry Wogan succinctly put it when he talked to Suzanne on his TV
chat show back in May 1987, "So, you're not an overnight success.....it's
taken you ten years to become one of those!"
<p>
To begin at the beginning: Suzanne Nadine Vega was born on the 11th July
1959 in Santa Monica, a few miles north of Los Angeles on the Pacific
coast. At the age of two, Suzanne moved with her family to New York City
and apart from a brief return to California at the age of eleven, New York
has been her home ever since.
<p>
Originally settling on New York's East 109th Street before moving on to
West 105th on the outskirts of black and Spanish Harlem, Suzanne grew up as
the eldest of four children. Her German/Swedish mother works as a computer
systems analyst, and her Puerto Rican emigre step-father, Ed Vega,
variously tried his hand at being a teacher and a social worker before
finding his true vocation as a novelist and short-story writer. Hence while
both of Suzanne's parents went out to work she had the job of looking after
her two younger brothers and sister. Growing up in a tough and often
violent neighbourhood, Suzanne felt protective towards the other members of
her family and was no stranger to fist fights. A number of later songs can
be seen to mirror the harsh city way of life. As well as her immediate
environment a major turning-point in her life was the surprise discovery at
the age of nine that Ed Vega was not her real father. Her natural father
had left home when she was just six months old.
<p>
Amid the turmoil and chaos of city life, the household was always filled
with music. Both of Suzanne's parents play the guitar, and her mother also
plays the piano. One of Suzanne's earliest childhood memories is of her
father and her uncles sitting round the house playing and singing Leadbelly
and assorted Blues songs. In addition to these frequent live performances
Suzanne was allowed access to her parents' record collection which in part
was devoted to Jazz artists like Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto, but in the
main revealed tastes which leaned heavily towards Folk, with names like
Woody Guthrie, Cisco Houston, Pete Seeger and later sixties artists like
Simon & Garfunkel and inevitably Bob Dylan.
<p>
At the age of eleven she began teaching herself to play guitar and by the
time she was fourteen she was writing her first songs. These earliest songs
clearly illustrated Suzanne's grounding in the US Folk tradition. As
Suzanne herself later disclosed, "Discovering Folk music was another way of
finding a place that wasn't violent or noisy or threatening as so much of
New York living can be. I was attracted to Folk music for its simplicity,
its timeliness and a means of putting things together." By the age of
sixteen, Suzanne had written forty-five minutes worth of material, and her
first ever public performance was given in a church basement on 2nd January
1976.
<p>
Alongside her songwriting and growing interest in music a parallel
development at this time was Suzanne's love of dancing as an alternative
means of expression. She began studying to be a dancer as early as nine
years old, enrolling at the age of fourteen at Manhattan's High School of
Performing Arts (later to be immortalised as the setting for the *Fame*
movie and TV series). However, after a number of years of ballet classes it
began to dawn on Suzanne that she wasn't really likely to excel as a
dancer.
<p>
The next step was Barnard College where Suzanne studied and graduated with
a degree in English Literature. She found in her English studies that she
had far more freedom than she ever enjoyed in her dance classes where she
was constantly having to do as the choreographer instructed.
<p>
While her college friends were following the latest trends, going to
concerts by the likes of Patti Smith and the New York Dolls, and dressing
up to see the *Rocky Horror Show*, Suzanne remained obstinately
unfashionable, practising her guitar playing in her room and listening to
records by favourite artists Leonard Cohen, Laura Nyro and Paul Simon.
<p>
Suzanne had initially developed an interest in theatre whilst studying at
Barnard College. It was while helping out as a wardrobe mistress for a
series of medieval pageant plays that she found herself in Glastonbury
towards the end of 1979. This first visit to England allowed Suzanne to
experience the UK punk explosion at first hand. This was a far cry from the
experience back home where punk had been reduced to little more than a
fashion parade. In the UK the punk scene was very real; a genuine
spontaneous outburst by frustrated young people. Suzanne found she could
relate to the anger expressed and the energy given off by their music.
<p>
At almost the same time Suzanne attended her first ever rock concert, a
show by Lou Reed. She was fascinated to hear Lou singing songs that
mirrored life on the New York streets; songs that she could relate to and
identify with. Moreover the actual structure of Reed's songs seemed to
disobey all the rules which Suzanne had previously believed it was
important to adhere to. "For the first time it occurred to me that you
could write a song using only one chord and say anything you wanted to over
it. Before that I always felt that songs had to make sense, having some
kind of narrative, be somehow traditional in structure." The effect upon
Suzanne was dramatic. The next batch of songs were very different from
anything she had written previously, and included *Cracking* and
*Neighbourhood Girls*.
<p>
Having graduated from Barnard, Suzanne next ventured into New York's
Greenwich Vilage in search of a place to play and sing and an audience who
would receive her songs sympathetically. For four years Suzanne went round
the Village clubs-the coffee house circuit-looking for places to audition.
She had read in Anthony Scaduto's 1971 biography about the legendary Folk
City and how Dylan had made a name for himself there. Suzanne was initially
so in awe of the place that she shied away from Folk City, prefering
instead to play lesser-known venues like The Bitter End and Speakeasy.
Eventually Suzanne found the courage to approach Folk City. She made a tape
of herself performing several songs and left this with the management. They
invited Suzanne to play and in 1980 Suzanne gave her first paid performance
at Folk City.
<p>
At this point, Suzanne was not making enough money from her club
appearances to be able to concentrate on her singing and songwriting full
time. Hence, for a while, she continued to play the clubs and coffee houses
by night, whilst taking a variety of jobs by day in order to support
herself. Initially she worked as a credit clerk in the advertising
department of a publishing company, later moving on to become a
receptionist for a local typesetting firm.
<p>
After a couple of years playing the Greenwich Village circuit, Suzanne
found she was making quite a name for herself. Towards the end of 1981 a
group of musicians, including Suzanne, got together under the editorial
auspice of Jack Hardy to form *The Co-Op*, later to be known as *Fast Folk
Musical Magazine*. Their idea was to put out a magazine, together with
accompanying record once a month to showcase each of the artists who took
part. The inaugural issue appeared in February 1982 and marked Suzanne's
debut appearance on vinyl with the song *Cracking*. Suzanne continued
recording for *Fast Folk* at regular intervals until late 1984 when she
finally signed to A&M.
<p>
The story of Suzanne's deal with A&M begins in 1983. In February of that
year Suzanne was introduced by a mutual friend to Ron Fierstein-a lawyer
who was about to leave the firm at which he was practicing in order to form
AGF Entertainment and to manage his brother Harvey Fierstein (author of
*Torch Song Trilogy*, the musical *La cage Aux Folles* and other works).
Ron also wanted to find a musical artist to develop with himself as manager
and Steve Addabo as producer (Ron and Steve had gone through university
together in the sixties). At Suzanne's invitation, Ron and Steve went to
hear her play at Speakeasy. Ron takes up the story...
<p>
"I brought Steve and our wives down. We saw her and recognised that she was
a very special songwriter. We agreed to sign her, and Steve then set about
working with her in his living room studio to develop her sound (both live
and on record) beyong the solo/folk style she had used up to that point.
<p>
"He brought in Jon Gordon and he and Jon began backing Suzanne live. This
was the real turning point, for it was this new live line-up that changed
her image and showed the people what we already knew-that there was much
more depth to her music than had been apparent. The first demos we made
[*Cracking*, *Knight Moves* and *Undertow*] were not just solo guitar-they
included Jon Gordon and Sue Evans, and were essentially the same sound and
approach as were used on the first album.
<p>
"The labels weren't interested, mainly because the singer-songwriter
phenomenon had been dead for quite a while, and because despite the sound
on tape, they couldn't get beyond the 'folksinger' tag. But as the press
improved as a result of her new live presentation, we were finally able to
convince A&M that she was more of a female Peter Gabriel or Sting, than a
Joan Baez."
<p>
On September 28th, 1984 an article by Stephen Holden appeared in the *New
York Times*, in which Suzanne was described as "The freshest and clearest
new voice on the New York folk music scene." This glowing review actually
helped to close the deal with A&M, which was finally signed in November
1984.
<p>
The rest of the story is now, as they say, history. Suzanne went into the
recording studio to lay down the first tracks for her A&M debut whilst
Lenny Kaye, probably best known as one-time guitarist with the Patti Smith
Group, was recruited to co-produce with Steve Addabbo. The album, simply
entitled *Suzanne Vega*, was released in the United States in April 1985.
<p>
Although not a great success in the States, despite critical acclaim, it
nonetheless spent 27 weeks on the Billboard Hot One Hundred, selling over
250,000 copies.
<p>
More significantly, when the album was released in the UK and Europe not
only was it greeted with similar enthusiasm by a majority of critics but it
also went on to become a substantial commercial success, attaining double
gold status (600,000 copies) in the UK. This success was partly due to a
series of visits Suzanne made, when she toured with a four-piece band
initially in October 1985 (her British debut was at the London School of
Economics on 24th October) and again in April and November of 1986, the
latter seeing Suzanne play two sellout shows at the Royal Albert Hall.
<p>
Perhaps the ultimate recognition of her new-found star status came five
months earlier when on 20th June, 1986 Suzanne found herself performing as
part of the all-star Prince's Trust 10th Birthday Concert at Wembley Arena;
certainly this was a far cry from the humble church basement in New York
City where Suzanne first played as a teenager some ten years earlier.
<p>
What follows is a quick at-a-glance, easy reference listing of Suzanne's
A&M album and single releases here in the U.K., 1985 to the present. No
attention is paid here to all the various single formats such as 10" and
12" releases, cassette singles, CD singles etc. as these will be dealt with
and discussed at length, as will the various demos, promos and the
multitude of overseas variations, in future articles.<br>
