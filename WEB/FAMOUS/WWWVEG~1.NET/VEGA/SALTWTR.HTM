<pre>
Tide came in
And then went out
And left behind
In hollow places
Cradled once
And cooling twice
You feel the sting of

Salt water

Wave goes back 
And leaves the sand
It's high and barren
Dry and wasting
Cradled once
And cooling twice
You feel the sting of

Salt water

Taste this
It's really raw
It comes with the skin
And the sand still on it
And it comes with the shell
And the flesh within it
You can tell that it came
From a seedy and watery place

Taste this
It's really good
It will make your mouth
Feel like something's in it
And it's gotten and given
From a cold black piece of the sea

From a piece of the sea

Salt water
