Subj:	Lolita and Honeymoon suite...<br>
Date:	96-11-15 18:52:35 EST<br>
From:	janvier@videotron.ca (Guillaume lesage)<br>
<p>
Hi everybody,
<p>
When I listen to Lolita, it makes me remember of another Suzanne song
entitled Bad Wisdom.  In these two songs, there is something strange
hapening to a girl.  Suzanne said that bad wisdom was about incest. 
Sometimes I think that Lolita is the same girl in bad Wisdom.  Knowing
things much too soon, feeling misunderstood by peers etc.  And I think that
those two songs are about a dark side of sexuality.  I do not know wich,
Suzanne is keeping the key too far away from me to understand.  I cannot
read between the lines, there is something missing and I can not put my
finger on it. 
<p>
For Honeymoon Suite, I think there is nothing to bother about it.  Suzanne
is signing a kind of dream, Mitchel's one, and she says that she could not
understand it.  But there is a great musical texture in that song that
reflect this strange tale.  When your listening to it you do not feel very
steady.  It is the same feeling that I had when I first heard Institution
Green and Those Whole Girls.  I think there is nothing to understand in
Honneymoon Suite.  Suzanne relates the facts and I do not feel her to
understand this strange situation either.

Subj:	Honeymoon with Lolita<br>
Date:	96-11-15 15:38:33 EST<br>
From:	moeller@cis.ohio-state.edu (torsten moeller)<br>
<p>
Hi guys,
<p>
Let me try to explain a little, what I mean, when I say, that
her new album has no depth to it. Basically Ahren just summarized
fairly nicely. Her new songs (esp. Honeymoon Suite, also Lolita)
don't leave much room for interpretation, they don't let you 'in
on it'. She just tells you a story and you can say, 'oh that's
interesting' but you are not getting involved in it. 
Night Vision (probably my all time fav SV song) is just so full
of imagery, metaphers, interpretations, history, it's amazing!
I remember, that I was able to think days about that song and its
meanings and reflections and how it relates to my own life.
There was also a good discussion one or two years ago about that
song on this list. Another good example is The Queen and the 
Soldier. Every few month there is a new discussion about this 
song on this list and how people relate to it. It is just so
amazing to read all this! (And that's why I like this mailing
list so much)
<p>
But Honeymoon suite you can summarize in one sentence and that's
it, there we go, you can't always understand your significant other.
Over. Excuse me for being so harsh, it is simply boring!
<p>
I also don't oppose repetetive songwriting, that's what Rock'n'Roll
is all about, play the same 2, 3 chords over and over. She also proved,
that she can come up with really great chord progressions (say catchy),
but usually she puts more emphasis on the lyrics, if she doesn't so
much on the music itself (e.g. World Before Columbus, Queen & Soldier)
<p>
Lolita isn't that great of a song either, but a lot better, than 
Honeymoon suite. She is musically somewhat experimental and she uses
some more metaphers here ('token of blood and tenderness').
<p>
That should be it for now ...

Hi gang,
<p>
It's very interesting to see all these guys writing about their
interpretations of the meaning of Lolita.  How about some of us ladies
joining into the fray just about now?!!  After all, it's a song written by a
woman to a girl.
<p>
Several of you have speculated about the whole
leaving-home-and-working-as-a-musician angle.  I think the song is much more
literal than that, and Suzanne has said that it was meant as advice to a girl
about age 12 .  
<p>
Let me refresh your memory:  many girls are almost fully grown at the age of
13 or so, and they live for a few years with the rather unusual situation of
their bodies being much more advanced than their social skills and/or their
outlook on life.  All of a sudden everyone (including boys of the same age,
who are often much shorter than the girls) starts treating them differently
than before because they look mature even though they are not.  To me the
song "Lolita" is a reminder to a girl that there's a whole lifetime to be an
adult, so instead of trying to rush things along she should remain a child
for a while longer and not play adult games until she's capable of handling
them.  
<p>
Someone (possibly Louis-Philippe?) said something about Suzanne leaving home
at age 19 and starting to try to make a living as a musician.  Well, in the
United States it's very common for people to leave home at the age of 18 or
19, when they go to college, as did Suzanne.  (For the non-Americans,
undergraduate college in the USA is four years, usually from ages 17 or 18 to
21 or 22.)  I think she started trying to perform in clubs even before then.
 But I don't think that's the real subject of  the song at all. 
<p>
I'm fond of the song "Lolita," but I agree with those of you who say it's not
the best tune on the album.  At first the Santana stuff was a little jarring,
but now I like it.  It certainly is hypnotic, especially the synth work!

In a message dated 96-11-15 01:49:43 EST, you write:<br>
<<  : I assumed Lolita was sung from the perspective of an older Suzanne <br>
 : looking back at her younger self and offering the advice she wished <br>

 : feeling that the narrator and "Lolita" are the same person.<br>
 <p>
 My guess is that you are right. I think the same thing. But thinking about
 it, maybe Suzanne is giving the young musicians of today, or everybody that
 would like to do as she did, the advice she wish she had received. Maybe
 somebody asked her about some advice on that kind of life. The only problem
 is that when you leave home, you don't want to go back. Everybody have
 their illusions about life...<p>

She actually said that? Hmmm... Maybe then the song is about a youg girl
(herself) dreams. You said it was about a girl trying to grow faster, and
the advice was just to let things happen. I don't beleive that. "Don't be a
dog all your life", "Don't look for affection", etc... Life is not that
hard at 13 years old. Even if you try to be a grown up.

Subj:	My thoughts on Lolita<br>

From:	friends@Mlink.NET (Louis-Philippe de l'Etoile)<br>
<p>
: Or maybe Lolita is just an excuse for Suzanne to tell us where she has<br>
:been standing. <br>
<p>
This is also what I think. She left home when she was 19. I think she
started to play in music clubs after that. And this kind of life is surely
hard work.
<p>
So I'll go through the lyrics and try to give an explanation...
<p>
"Lolita, Almost grown, Lolita, Go on home"<br>
Lolita would be a younger Suzanne Vega, just after she left home. Suzanne
would now tell her to go back. Maybe because she had suffered for nothing.
Maybe she could have skipped all that suffering by doing the same thing she
did, but staying home.
<p>
"Hey girl, Don't be a dog all your life, Don't beg for, Some little chumb
of affection"<br>
Just what I said. Lolita would be living a dog's life, trying to catch
things, to earn some money to live. This kind of life doesn't get you any
kind of affection, so don't look for any.
<p>
"Don't try, To be somebody's wife, So young, You need a word of protection"<br>
I do not know how long has been Suzanne's mariage until now, and I do not
know if she had any boyfriend after she left how. Has she tried to get
maried? Please help me on that one. 
<p>
"Hey girl, I've been where you are standing, Leaning in the doorway, In
your mother's black dress"<br>
Another proof that Lolita is a young Suzanne Vega. Leaning in the doorway
would probably mean that Lolita is stepping out to her new life, just like
Suzanne, when she left home. The black dress is a way of saying that the
older life is now dead, the older life represented by the mother.
(protection, affection)
<p>
"So hungry, For the one understanding, Looking for a token of, Blood or
tenderness"<br>
Hungry and looking for tenderness. Hard life. Just repeating what was said
earlier.
<p>
"Lolita..."<br>
Pleading for one last time. Change your life. It could be easier.

Hi Simon - you are perfectly right about Lolita
<p>
If you read Suzanne's song-by-song "Net-interview" at the Vega-Web site she 
talks about this very thing.
<p>
It's weird - I heard a reviewer talk about this song as being about a 
"woman of the street" - (dear me) - just shows how "open" some peoples 
interpretations are!
<p>
The song is about being "on the brink" of (I guess) sexual awakening - 
wearing her mothers black dress I interpret as a reference to a young girl 
literally putting on the clothes of an adult - longing for all of the 
things she see's she needs to be "grown up"
<p>
It's a song about the age old classic "voyage from inocence to experience" 
 <p>
I see all this as Suzanne thinking (somewhat sentimentally or wistfully) "I 
wish I could warn this eager person to be wary of the stormy waters" 
<p>
Suzanne has said she "is" Lolita - or that at least the song is "to the 
Lolita in her"
<p>
It reminds me (sort of) of a young girl pondering at her face in the 
reflected waters - or an older woman looking at her own reflection in the 
mirror and seeing the young girl she was - and could have been if she'd had 
the benefit of foreknowledge
<p>
those waters of reflection are pretty deep! - and so is our Suzanne I 
reckon judging by the lyrics
<p>
:)
<p>
cheers

<p>
It seems most people don't like this track. Well actually it's far from
being my favorite neither, but I felt like somebody had to defend that song,
so I took the booklet and read the lyrics again and again.... and they are
definitely weak! but I don't want to believe that, so maybe we should
discuss that song and try to find good things out of it. So please help!
<p>
One thing we shouldn't forget is that Lolita is supposed to be an object of
desire, so this song has to be more than just a piece of advice. First what
I'd like to know is where the line "I've been where you are standing" is
ending. I mean is that "I" or lolita who is "leaning...", "in your
mother's...", "so hungry... tenderness". I mean maybe there's something very
pathetic in that song, maybe "I" is kind hypocrit and wants to turn Lolita
away from men or whatever so this "I" (Suzanne said it was herself so why do
I bother?) can keep Lolita by her side, for company... or whatever.
Or maybe Lolita is just an excuse for Suzanne to tell us where she has been
standing.
<p>
Come on, why don't we all elaborate our crazy theories like we did for Bad
Wisdom or Blood Makes Noise? Let's find all sort of cool meanings to that
song even if they're not true.
<p>
Like I like to say and it could apply to that song: OK it's not deep, but
only on the surface (no no, it doesn't mean anything).

OK: Lolita Persephone Henderson was an 11-year-old girl whom police found
dazed and bloodied outside the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas,
Texas, on November 22, 1963. She was from Groom, Texas, but had skipped
school and hopped the rails in her mother's black cocktail dress a week
earlier for a chance to see President John F. Kennedy. On arriving in
Dallas that morning she was approached in a Rexall's drug store by a shy,
balding young man who called himself "Lee." He bought her a root beer
float at a local diner (called Tom's), where he seemed nice at first but
soon began to scare her with his ravings about "the Cubans" and "the
Company" and "they're setting me up to be a patsy but no way, I'll show
them, they can't fool me." (She thought he was talking about Patsy Cline.)
Lolita asked Lee if he planned to see the president; he just smiled
cryptically and glanced at his watch. 
<p>
The low point of the morning came as Lee became more and more agitated,
finally grasping her by the back of her hair and forcing her to crawl on
all fours around the diner barking like a dog. Terrified, Lolita ran from
the diner, but Lee caught up with her after she collided with a woman
straightening her stockings in the doorway.
<p>
Lee escorted her to the book depository, muttering, "I can't screw
this up or Ruby's going to whack me."
<p>
"Ruby?" Lolita asked. "That's a pretty name for a girl."
<p>
Lee just smirked.
<p>
Lolita's other footnote in history came when she died this past summer
aboard that TWA jet that exploded out of New York. Coincidence? I think
not.
<p>
Anyway, that's what I think "Lolita" is about.

<p>
Indeed.
<p>
"My mother groaned! my father wept.<br>
Into the dangerous world I lept:<br>
Helpless, naked, piping loud:<br>
Like a fiend hid in a cloud.<br>
<p>
"Struggling in my father's hands:<br>
Striving against swadling bands:<br>
Bound and weary I thought best<br>
To sulk upon my mother's breast."<p>
                (William Blake: Infant Sorrow)
<p>
There's an interesting parallell between Lolita and As a Child, I think:
<p>
"Hey girl<br>
I've been where you are standing<br>
Leaning in the doorway<br>
In your mother's black dress"<br>
<p>
and:
<p>
"Hand on the doorknob<br>
Feel like a thing<br>
One foot on the sidewalk
Too much to prove"<br>
<p>
If you want to carry the "leaving home" analogy further, you can also
compare it with a song called First Day Out that Suzanne wrote when she was
fifteen, probabaly reflecting a true experience:
<p>
"Here I am at last, I've just jumped off the train
I'm about to start my life as a wanderer in the rain
I know so many people would give anything to be in my shoes
Well, that's all right for them to say, but my shoes are soaked right through.
<p>
"I don't know what made me want to come all the way out here
I guess when I was dreaming, my skies were always clear
Now I'm here in a meadow with the rain streaming through my hair
I guess this is what you call traveling freely, living without care.
<p>
"Here I am, all by myself, and I'll admit I'm scared
All I've got is my guitar and a couple of dollars to spare
And I know even that's not gonna last me long.
<p>
"I suppose I could pick myself up and carry myself back home
But after what I put my folks through, I think I better stay alone.
Anyhow, five years of aching are packed behind this plan
Since I was ten, I've wanted to get out of the city and live out on the land.
<p>
"My parents thought I was crazy and I think now maybe they're right
But I can still feel the freedom in following the eagle's flight.
I just had to come and see what all the songs were about
My hope is returning quickly and I don't think there's any doubt
<p>
"That I'd better start moving if I want to get somewhere
I'll go on to the next town and see what I find there
And stay a while until I go traveling on."
<p>
But, to me, it's about an even wider issue -- the question of learning to
have a life, just like Caspar Hauser, Victor "The Wild Child" or Genie -- or
just like anyone of us -- without having to "pay for [your] life with [your]
body":
<p>
"I came out of the darkness<br>
Holding one thing<br>
A small white wooden horse<br>
I'd been holdning inside"<br>
<p>
In the English music paper Sound, 6 December 1986, Suzanne says about Wooden
Horse (Caspar Hauser's Song):
<p>
"I was reading the biograohy of Kaspar Hauser. He lived in Germany in the
1800s and because he was [said to be] the heir to the throne [of Bavaria],
he had been locked in a basement from the time he was born until he was 17
and then suddenly set free. So his problem was, how do you learn to be a
human being? The book explains his coming to power and it's a really tragic
story because he's murdered in the end, but I thought his perspective would
have been so interesting.
<p>
"It's that stripped away thing again. In some ways he was so stripped away,
he was almost like an animal. He'd never seen the sun and he could only say
one sentence, which was I want to be a rider, like my father. And they had
given him one toy to play with the whole 17 years, which was a small wooden
horse. So I was trying to see how you could take a story like that and turn
it into a song."
<p>
About her own experiences when she learned that the man she'd though of as
her father, the Puerto Rican writer Ed Vega, was not her real father, and
that she was not at all Puerto Rican -- an identity that had meant a lot to
her, Suzanne says:
<p>
"Suddenly I felt that everything I had known was kind of stripped away,
which is a feeling I've had often and I think that's probably had a lot of
effect on my songwriting. Because every time I look at someone I think, You
could strip everything away. You could strip away their name, you could
strip away their beliefs, strip away who they think they are and you'd still
have a person there you have to address.
<p>
"So when I write, that's the part of the person I'm aiming for -- the part
that's stripped away."
<p>
This experience is the very background to Freezing, the song on Philipp
Glass' album Songs from Liquid Days, which to me is not incomprehensible at
all, as some earlier poster wrote. To me, this perspective is like the key
to Suzanne's work. She touches the very basis of human experience in a way
very few people are able to do.
<p>
Many people describe the strange attraction Genie, the thirteen year old
girl who was found in 1970 after having been confined to a potty chair for
all her life, had on everyone. I think this is because in her, we see that
stripped away part of ourselves, just like we do in Suzanne's songs. And
this part is the most important part of us, the part that nothing, not even
the worst environment imaginable could take away. Call it the Self, the
Buddha Nature or the Divine Spark. It tells us whence we come and whither we
are going. What we essentially are.
<p>
Suzanne is also talking about the part of the person that need so be held,
needs to be nurtured -- to be loved -- to be able to grow into a real living
person in the world. And if there isn't enough love and warmth, you will
either have to protect yourself by creating a hard crust, perhaps even by
renouncing the world and your own needs, like in anorexia -- or perish
altogether.
<p>
"If you had no name<br>
If you had no history<br>
If you had no books<br>
If you had no family<br>
<p>
"If it were only you<br>
Naked on the grass<br>
Who would you be then?<br>
This is what he asked<br>
And I said I wasn't really sure<br>
But I would probably be<br>
Cold<br>
<p>
"And now I'm freezing<br>
Freezing"
<p>
(It's interesting to note, I think, that anorexics, while mastering their
drive to eat, are almost constantly freezing [for biological reasons, to be
sure, but I also see a symbolic significance to it]. Genie and Victor, and
perhaps also Kaspar, who were even more stripped away, had even developed a
strange insensitivity to cold.)
<p>
By speaking to this stripped away thing, Suzanne gives a new sense of
importance to the inner world, makes it real in the form of a song, and so
finally the tale can begin, croaking and sighing at first. And maybe, if
there's someone to hear your small story, you won't have to pay for your
life with your body anymore.
