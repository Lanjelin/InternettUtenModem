<h1>Suzanne Vega - Intimate Details</h1>
   
<body>   


<b>Full name:</b> Suzanne Nadine Vega.<p>

<b>Born:</b> Santa Monica, California.<p>

<b>Lives:</b> New York.<p>

<b>Age:</b> 27.<p>

<b>Family:</b> Two brothers, one sister. We're all really close. As the eldest I
felt really protective of them. I guess I felt I had to be responsible, but
you can't be protective for too long.<p>

<b>Earliest childhood memory:</b> Sitting on a doorstep in New York thinking about
the fact that it was June, and my birthday was coming up and I was going to
be three years old.<p>

<b>Did you enjoy school?</b> Actually I did. I liked it a lot.<p>

<b>First job:</b> Besides baby sitting, I think it was walking dogs for people who
couldn't walk them during the day. My first proper job was as a summer camp
counsellor.<p>

<b>Favourite current records:</b> "So" (Peter Gabriel), "Talk Talk Talk"
(Psychedelic Furs), "The Whole Story" (Kate Bush).<p>

<b>First live performance:</b> It was january 2 1976 I think. I was 16 years old,
I think I was so nervous that no one would be able to hear me that I
practically shouted through the whole thing.<p>

<b>Do you think you're a shy person?</b> I think I have my moments of shyness but
I don't think I'm as shy as the press make me out to be. If I was really a
shy person I'd have never got on the stage - I'd still be a receptionist.<p>

Compared to most rock n'roll singers I'm shy but not compared to most other
people.
Your current world tour doesn't end until December. Don't you find it
tiring? I'm starting to feel the effects of it around now. But it does take
a lot out of you. If you're the Beastie Boys and you make a living out of
smashing things up and going out drinking, that's one thing, but if you're
trying to sing and write and play the guitar it's difficult.<p>

<b>Favourite item of clothing:</b> Right now it's my black leather jacket. I have
a bunch of them, but this new one is my favourite. I found it in a vintage
shop and it was the only one left, and it fitted me perfectly.<p>

<b>Favourite books/writers:</b> I like The Unbearable Lightness Of Being (Milan
Kundero) and Wuthering Heights. I like John Steinbeck.<p>

<b>Actors/Actresses:</b> Marlene Dietrich, just for the strength of her
personality. I like Mickey Rourke - not all of his films are that good but
he's a really interesting person.<p>

<b>Didn't you audition for Desperately Seeking Susan?</b> I was asked to read for
the part of Susan. They said they didn't think I was right for the part,
and I must say I agree with them when I found out they were looking for
Madonna!<p>

<b>What was it like being on Wogan?</b> I thought he was a nice guy but I think he
might have forgotten his questions, because he asked completely different
ones to the ones we rehearsed!<p>

<b>What's the worst thing about being successful?</b> You lose a certain amount of
privacy. People demand more from you; they see your face and think they
know you, and so they write to you, and ask you questions, and disrupt your
dinner to ask for an autograph. I always try to be polite because I know
what it's like to be a fan.<p>

<b>Phobias:</b> I am afraid to approach strangers in the street and ask for
directions or anything, to the point where I'll wander round lost for
hours. It's funny, because I talk to strangers every night on stage!<p>

<b>What's the best country you've visited?</b> I like England because I feel very
well received here. I feel very much at home here.<p>

<b>Have you ever considered living in England?</b> It's crossed my mind... but I
think I'd get homesick.
