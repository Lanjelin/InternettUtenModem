<A NAME="birth"><h2><b><i>Birth-day (love made real)</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
                    <b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
one thing I know<br>
this pain will go<br>
<p>
step through all that's left to feel<br>
I wait to meet my love made real<br>
<p>
don't move don't touch <br>
don't talk so much<br>
<p>
strip and find the place to kneel<br>
I wait to meet my love made real<br>
<p>
one thing I know
<p>
this day will go
<p>
don't touch don't talk crawl the wall<br>
she's the ticket to the future don't listen down the hall<br>
you can say your prayer to the head of this bed<br>
when it begins at your knees and goes right to your head<br>
<p>
birth-day
<p>
strap me down from wrist to heel<br>
I wait to meet my love made real<br>
<p>
one thing I know<br>
this day will go<br>
<p>
shake all over like an old sick dog<br>
there's a needle here needle there tremble in the fog<br>
it's a tight squeeze vice grip ice and fire<br>
she's a hot little treasure and the wave goes higher<br>
<p>
birth-day<br>
birth-day<br>

<A NAME="head"><h2><b><i>Headshots</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
<b>Lyrics by Suzanne Vega<br>
Music by Mitchell Froom and Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
The sign said "Headshots"<br>
And that was all,<br>
A picture of a boy<br>
And a number you could call,<br>
Two eyes in the shade<br>
A mouth so sad and small,<br>
It's strange the way a shadow<br>
Can fall across the wall, <br>
And make the difference <br>
In what you see<br>
Ah...
<p>
He's just a poster, but<br>
He's everywhere,<br>
A face under a street lamp<br>
Ripped and hanging in the air,<br>
Turn the corner<br>
And he's still there,<br>
Watching all the people<br>
Who are passing unaware,<br>
Is there a judgement<br>
In what he sees?<br>
Ah...
<p>
On a day<br>
As cold<br>
And gray<br>
As today...<br>
<p>
The sign says "Headshots"<br>
It's all I see,<br>
A boy becomes a picture<br>
Of guilt and sympathy,<br>
And so I think of you <br>
In memory<br>
Of the days we were together,<br>
And I knew that you loved me<br>
That was the difference<br>
In what we see,<br>
But that's history...<br>
Ah...

<A NAME="caramel"><h2><b><i>Caramel</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
<b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
It won't do<br>
to dream of caramel,<br>
to think of cinnamon<br>
and long for you.<br>
<p>
It won't do<br>
to stir a deep desire,<br>
to fan a hidden fire<br>
that can never burn true.<br>
<p>
I know your name,<br>
I know your skin,<br>
I know the way<br>
these things begin;<br>
<p>
But I don't know<br>
how I would live with myself,<br>
what I'd forgive of myself<br>
if you don't go.<br>
<p>
So goodbye,<br>
sweet appetite,<br>
no single bite<br>
could satisfy...<br>
<p>
I know your name,<br>
I know your skin,<br>
I know the way<br>
these things begin;<br>
<p>
But I don't know<br>
what I would give of myself,<br>
how I would live with myself<br>
if you don't go.<br>
<p>
It won't do<br>
to dream of caramel, <br>
to think of cinnamon<br>
and long<br>
for you.<br>

<A NAME="stocking"><h2><b><i>Stockings</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
<b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
I don't care for tights, she says<br>
and does not tell me why<br>
She hikes her skirt above her knee<br>
revealing one brown thigh
<p>
I see, I say, and wonder at<br>
her slender little fingers<br>
How cleverly they pull upon<br>
the threads of recent slumbers<br>
<p>
Do you know where friendship ends<br>
and passion does begin?<br>
It's between the binding of<br>
her stockings and her skin.<br>
(oh yeah)
<p>
She stayed up so late I thought<br>
she'd ask me to go dance<br>
But something in the way she laughed<br>
told me I had no chance
<p>
The fiction in her family<br>
was that she was never nice<br>
I'd say she was very<br>
I just did not see the price
<p>
Do you know where friendship ends<br>
and passion does begin?<br>
When the gin and tonic<br>
makes the room begin to spin.<br>
(oh yeah)
<p>
There may be attraction here<br>
but it will never flower<br>
So I'm assigned to read her mind, now<br>
in this witching hour
<p>
Here's no game for those who claim<br>
to be easily bruised<br>
But how can I complain<br>
when she's so easily amused?
<p>
Do you know where friendship ends<br>
and passion does begin?<br>
(When she does not show you<br>
the way out on the way in) --<br>
It's between the binding<br>
of her stockings and her skin.<br>
(oh yeah)

<A NAME="casual"><h2><b><i>Casual Match</i></b></h2></a> 
<p> 
<b>Lyrics by Suzanne Vega<br>
Music by Suzanne Vega & Mitchell Froom</b>
<p>
I only turned to see<br>
What hand had set this inner field alight<br>
Against the flame I see<br>
The outline of a man against a night<br>
<p>
Take back your sympathy<br>
I do not need to drink that bitter stuff<br>
I'd rather break the thread<br>
That bound us close, and say we called a bluff<br>
<p>
A casual match<br>
In a very dry field<br>
What could be<br>
The season's yield?<br>
<p>
My eyes have gone to coal<br>
It's nothing I would be concerned about<br>
Observe the moment<br>
When the heat of love becomes the chill of doubt<br>
<p>
A casual match<br>
In a very dry field<br>
Fire and ash<br>
Is the season's yield<br>
<p>
We look for a sign<br>
But it is not revealed<br>
Fire and ash is the<br>
Season's yield<br>

<A NAME="thin"><h2><b><i>Thin Man</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
<b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
He is not my friend, but he is with me<br>
Like a shadow is with a foot that falls<br>
His hand is on my back when I step from the sidewalk<br>
Or when I'm walking down these darkened halls<br>
<p>
He's the Thin Man<br>
With a date for me<br>
To arrive at some point<br>
I don't know when it will be<br>
<p>
I can feel his eyes when I don't expect him<br>
In the back seat of a taxi down Vestry Street<br>
His arm is around my waist and he pulls me down to him<br>
He whispers things into my ear that sound so sweet<br>
<p>
He's the Thin Man<br>
With a date for me<br>
To arrive at some point<br>
I don't know when it will be<br>
<p>
He is not my friend, but he is with me<br>
And he promises a peace I never knew<br>
I cannot give in, no, I must refuse him<br>
But could I really be the one to resist that kiss so true<br>
<p>
He's the Thin Man<br>
With a date for me<br>
To arrive at some point<br>
I don't know when it will be<br>

<p>
<b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
Ante up.  And don't be shy.<br>
Who is that man who is catching my eye?<br>
What's underneath all of the deadpan face?<br>
Sitting so pretty with a criminal grace?<br>
<p>
Lamebrain Pete wants to Spit in the Sea.<br>
He's got a cool hand but it isn't for me.<br>
Butcher Boy thinks he'll be splitting the pot.<br>
But I've seen what he's got and it isn't a lot.<br>
<p>
(When deuces are wild you can follow the queen.<br>
I'd go too except I know where she's been.)<br>
<p>
I'll see you, I'll call you, I'll raise you<br>
But it's no cheap thrill<br>
It will cost you, cost you, cost you<br>
Anything you have to pay.<br>
<p>
I limit the straddles, and you shuffle and deal.<br>
When will the dealer reveal how he feels?<br>
Is the lucky beginner just a five-card stud?<br>
Is this winning streak going to be nipped in the bud?<br>
<p>
I'll see you, I'll call you, I'll raise you<br>
But it's no cheap thrill<br>
It will cost you, cost you, cost you<br>
Anything you have to pay.<br>
<p>
I'll match you, I'll bet you, I'll play you,<br>
But it's no cheap thrill<br>
It will cost you, cost you, cost you<br>
Anything you have to pay.<br>

<A NAME="world"><h2><b><i>World Before Columbus</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
<b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
If your love were taken from me<br>
Every color would be black and white<br>
It would be as flat as the world before Columbus<br>
That's the day that I lose half my sight<br>
<p>
If your life were taken from me<br>
All the trees would freeze in this cold ground<br>
It would be as cruel as the world before Columbus<br>
Sail to the edge and I'd be there looking down<br>
<p>
Those men who lust for land<br>
And for riches strange and new<br>
Who love those trinkets of desire<br>
Oh they never will have you<br>
<p>
And they'll never know the gold<br>
Or the copper in your hair<br>
How could they weigh the worth<br>
Of you so rare<br>
<p>
If your love were taken from me<br>
Every light that's bright would soon go dim<br>
It would be as dark as the world before Columbus<br>
Down the waterfall and I'd swim over the brim<br>
<p>
Those men who lust for land<br>
And for riches strange and new<br>
Who love those trinkets of desire<br>
Oh they will never have you<br>
<p>
And they'll never know the gold<br>
Or the copper in your hair<br>
How could they weigh the worth<br>
Of you so rare<br>

Lolita<br>
Almost grown<br>
Lolita<br>
Go on home<br>
<p>
Hey girl<br>
Don't be a dog all your life<br>
Don't beg for <br>
Some little crumb of affection<br>
<p>
Don't try<br>
To be somebody's wife<br>
So young<br>
You need a word of protection<br>
<p>
Lolita<br>
Almost grown<br>
Lolita <br>
Go on home<br>
<p>
Hey girl<br>
I've been where you are standing<br>
Leaning in the doorway<br>
In your mother's black dress<br>
<p>
So hungry<br>
For the one understanding<br>
Looking for a token of <br>
Blood or tenderness<br>
<p>
Lolita<br>
Almost grown<br>
Lolita<br>
Go on home<br>
<p>
Lolita...

<A NAME="honey"><h2><b><i>Honeymoon Suite</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
<b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
the ceiling had a painting on it<br>
in our room in France<br>
so we were living underneath <br>
some angels in a dance<br>
<p>
my husband was not feeling well<br>
and so we went to bed<br>
he woke up complaining<br>
of an aching in his head<br>
<p>
he said a hundred people<br>
had come through our room that night<br>
that one by one the old and young<br>
asked if he was all right<br>
<p>
one by one the old and young<br>
lined up to touch his hand<br>
he spent the night explaining<br>
they had come to the wrong man<br>
<p>
the concierge was less than helpful<br>
when we asked her the next day<br>
with coffee and a magazine<br>
we went to the desk to pay<br>
<p>
"what happened in that room?" he asked<br>
"a death or something strange?"<br>
she smiled at him politely<br>
and returned to him his change<br>
<p>
well, what I'd like to know<br>
and this will be a mystery,<br>
is with all the people in that room<br>
why none appeared to me?<br>
<p>
when we sleep so close together that<br>
our hair becomes entwined<br>
I must have missed that moment<br>
in the gateway to his mind<br>

<b> Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
I like a tombstone cause it<br>
weathers well<br>
and if it stands or if it crumbles<br>
only time will tell<br>
<p>
if you carve my name in marble<br>
you must cut it deep<br>
there'll be no dancing on the gravestone<br>
you must let me sleep<br>
and time is burning burning burning<br>
it burns away<br>
<p>
I don't need to see the gates of <br>
famous men<br>
but I do try to see the kingdom<br>
every now and then<br>
<p>
if you ask me where it is it's on a <br>
humble map<br>
and I know that to enter in the doorway<br>
show your handicap<br>
and time is burning burning burning<br>
it burns away<br>

<A NAME="plum"><h2><b><i>My Favorite Plum</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
<b>Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
My favorite plum<br>
hangs so far from me<br>
See how it sleeps<br>
and hear how it calls to me<br>
See how the flesh<br>
presses the skin,<br>
It must be bursting<br>
with secrets within,<br>
I've seen the rest, yes<br>
and that is the one for me<br>
<p>
See how it shines<br>
it will be so sweet<br>
I've been so dry<br>
it would make my heart complete<br>
See how it lays<br>
languid and slow<br>
Never noticing<br>
me here below<br>
I've seen the best, yes<br>
and that is the one for me<br>
<p>
Maybe a girl will take it<br>
Maybe a boy will steal it<br>
Maybe a shake of the bough<br>
will wake it and make it fall<br>
<p>
My favorite plum<br>
lies in wait for me<br>
I'll be right here<br>
longing endlessly<br>
You'll say that I'm <br>
foolish to trust<br>
But it will be mine<br>
and I know that it must<br>
cause I've had the rest, yes<br>
and that is the one for me<br>
I've seen the best, yes<br>
and that is the one for me<br>
