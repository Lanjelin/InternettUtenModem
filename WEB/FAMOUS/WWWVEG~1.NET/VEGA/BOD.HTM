Suzanne, since you seem to be in a posting mood, I've got
a question about "Book of Dreams" that I've always wondered
about.  Care to comment?<p>

As long as we are talking about the meanings of some songs,
does anyone else think that "Book of Dreams" may be influenced/have
a reference to the Thomas Covenant books by Stephen R. Donaldson?
I was re-reading the series when "days of open hand" came out,
and couldn't help but wonder.  Specifically the following lines
are what made me think of it:<p>

I took your urgent whisper<br>
Stole the arc of a white ring<br>
Rode like foam on the river of pity<br>
Turned its tide to strength<br>
Healed the hole that ripping in living<p>


Minor spoilers about the books follow:<p>


For those of you unfamilar with the books in question, the main
character is transported or dreaming about an alternate world
where his white gold wedding ring gives him special powers,
but he refuses to believe in this alternate world and sits
around pitying himself because of his circumstances, but eventually 
turns that all to his advantage and "heals" the problems in this 
alternate world.  The white gold ring is also related to the
"arch of time" referenced in the book, which makes the
"arc of a white ring" line make it seem even more likely that
there is a connetion..<p>

The above segment of lyrics fit so well with the books that
I just can't help but wonder if there is a connection.<br>

I just reread Suzanne's lyrics from the sleeve of DOOH, and the line is 
actually:<p>

Stole the arc of a white wing<p>

so it seems that there isn't actually a reference to the Thomas Covenant 
books in this song.  I enjoyed hearing that interpretation, as well as 
others' interpretations of SV songs recently.  They only reinforce the 
notion that we all ascribe some personal meaning to Suzanne's songs and
find some way for them to be significant in the context of our own lives.<p>

I especially like this song, because the lyrics are brief and leave room 
for plenty of intepretation.  My interpretation is of the strength we all 
possess and can give to one another.  I envision Suzanne (as the singer) as
having had rough existence ("The spine is bound to last a life / Tough 
enough to take the pounding") and dreaming of finding strength from 
someone else ("I took your urgent whisper", "Yours is there my word of 
honor") to overcome the past and accomplishing great, even magical, things 
("Stole the arc of a white wing / Rode like foam on the river of pity / 
Turned its tide to strength / Healed the hole that ripped in living").  <p>

Am I _way_ out there?  I'd love to hear others' comments, as well!<p>

Matt, I've heard the same elements in the song, but interpreted them 
quite the other way around. To me, the narrator dreams of *giving* 
strength, not taking it. She takes the urgent whisper, and heals the hole 
that ripped in living. By way of synecdoche, I think she says that she 
takes the whole other person, and heals the hole in that person's existence.<p>

Indeed, the narrator may have had a rough existence, but that might be the
very reason her spine is so tough. Here's what Suzanne said in an
interview for the Sunday Times (UK) 17 April 90: "I've always been fond of
the image of the diamond and the bullet as having the qualities that I'd
like to have for myself. They're streamlined, compact, strong, powerful --
but small. They're concentrated and that's how they make their impact. I
also like the diamond because it comes from coal, from dirt, and
tremendous pressure turns it into the precious stone. So if you're under
great strain, instead of just cracking, you consolidate into this shiny,
very tough entity." <p>

Isn't this image beautiful and poetic? And I'd say that many, if not 
most, of Suzanne's songs have exactly this quality, and my image of the 
poet is indeed very similar.<p>

&#91; -- cut -- &#93;<p>

Last, but not least, nice to have you back on the list, Suzanne!<p>

Yours,<br>

Do you guys notice, that I have a response for everything--I think it's
because I'm overoppininated (sp?) or something.<p>

Book of Dreams:<p>

I have just a very simple interpretation of the song--the narrarator is
gathering strength from her dreams--not giving to or getting from another
person, in particular, but from the dreams.<p>

I mean this in a sense that a lot of times people, children especially, who
have rough lives, revert to a sort of dream world for protection.  I think
that SV is talking about just such dreams that protect or have protected her
from the "real world" say.  I certainly think that this is a theme that runs
throughout the whole album.<p>

The spine is bound to last a life<br>
Tough enough to take the pounding<br>
Pages made of days of open hand<p>

These lines refer to the essence of what I'm talking about.  Her
dreams--"Bood of Dreams" are always there to protect her--"the spine is bound
to last a life/Tough enough to take a pounding..."
Where the narrator may feel weak in her own life, her dreams are a place she
can go for solace and comfort.  I remember years ago hearing about
"Programming" your dreams.  That, by thinking about certain things before you
go to sleep, you can control them and program them.  I think this may have a
connection to that.  In the narrators dreams, she can "[ride] like foam on
the river of pity/[and] turn it's tide to strength..."<p>

The "pages [are] made of days of open hand..."  this line has always meant,
to me, someone trying to grasp some kind of meaning from life.  In the
narrators "book of dreams" each page is a movement towards that--each dream
pushes the narrator futher to some kind of understanding of life.  I'm kind
of getting away from my first interpretation about the dreams being there to
protect, but let me see if I can make this connection using earlier strains
that we've been discussing.<p>

The "real world" may represent some kind of pain and hostility--as we've
discussed earlier it is where we learn about the "darker side of humanity"
 in the narrators dreams, there is protection from that, her dreams are a
place where these kinds of things can be dealt w/ and perhaps defeated.  It
is the place, perhaps, where a line like: "It's a one time thing/It just
happens a lot" can find it's posative turn.  That is to say, where w/ in the
cracks of life, light comes in.<p>

If I'm making too much of a stretch, just throw me out the door.  But, I
think all these things connect on a certain level--I think artists evolve and
move forward--not linearly perhaps but the thread connects throught a body of
work--where the artist has been/is now/where she is going.  "Travel
arrival/years of an inch and a step toward a source/I'm comeing to you/I'll
be there in time..."<p>

Sorry I'm late in responding. I've been away for a while and found this 
amazing collection of interesting messages in my mailbox, and I feel I 
can't resist the temptation to comment on a few of them...

<p>
I love the idea of gathering streangt from dreams, both day and night 
dreams. Here I think she's talking about day dreams, and I definitely 
think there's a generous element in the song -- a wish to give something 
to other people.

That certainly happens a lot. But I don't think you should contrast the 
dream world with the "real world" -- the inner world is as real as the 
outer world, and when we forget this growing up, we lose the contact 
with our inner Self. Sometimes children who live under great pressure 
preserve and refine the inner world to an unusually high extent, but, 
unfortunately, this treasure must be kept hidden, and the contact with 
the outer world may be more or less broken -- that's why the dream world 
may seem so weird and disconneted from outer life.

<p>
Programming your dreams? Why would you do that? You can daydream instead. 
Why not let the dreams speak for themselves, so you may learn from their 
wisdom. Some people say that they can program themselves to remember 
their dreams, and that's something I envy.

I really think dreams have this functions -- they're like messages from 
the Unconscious, messages that speak of some deeper meaning in life. But 
we can't revert to a dream world all together -- we need both the inner 
and the outer world, and the cracking may open a breach between the two 
worlds. Often, this happens under great strain:
<p>
	And something is cracking<br>
	I don't know where<br>
	Ice on the sidewalk<br>
	Brittle branches<br>
	In the air<br>
<p>
	The sun<br>
	is blinding<br>
	Dizzy golden, dancing green<br>
	Through the park in the afternoon<br>
	Wondering where the hell<br>
	I have been<br>
<p>
Something is cracking -- obviously the narrator is cracking. But in this 
cracking, she suddenly notices the world outside her misery. First the 
ice and the brittle branches that are like her, frozen and cracking, but 
then she also sees the sun, the green colour, and she suddenly sees 
herself from the outside.
<p>
So I think the "one time thing" may refer both to some kind of repeated 
trauma, perhaps abuse, but also to the rare glimpses of a world beyond 
suffering.

Hugo,
<p>
I must say, I enjoy your interpretations very much--you always seem to take
things a step further than anyone else.  I especially like the bit about
"Cracking" and "Book of Dreams" and how the inner and outer worlds connect.
 That's somewhat of what I was getting at in a crude way.  I guess using "the
real world" instead of "outer world" made my point weak.  But, my point was
that the inner world is a place to gather strength and deal with things that
go on in the outer--stress, abuse, anything really.
<p>
I don't know if everyone has this experience, but it has been my dream
experience that whatever is going on in my life--whether related or not, will
somehow all end up in the same dream together--doesn't always make sense--but
I guess it's my minds way of working through stressful situations.
