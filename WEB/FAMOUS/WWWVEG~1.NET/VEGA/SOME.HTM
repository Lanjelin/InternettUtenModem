             SOME JOURNEY

             If I had met you on some journey
             Where would we be now
             If we had met some eastbound train
             Through some black sleeping town

             Would you have worn your silken robes
             All made of royal blue?
             Would I have dressed in smoke and fire
             For you to see through?

             If we had met in a darkened room
             Where people do not stay
             But shadows touch and pass right through
             And never see the day

             Would you have taken me upstairs
             And turned the lamplight low?
             Would I have shown my secret self
             And disappeared like the snow?

             Oh, I could have played your little girl
             Or I could have played your wife
             I could have played your mistress
             Running danger down through you life

             I could have played your lady fair
             All dressed in lace like the foam from the sea
             I could have been your woman of the road
             As long as you did not come back home to me

             But as it is, we live in the city
             And everything stays in place
             Instead we meet on the open sidewalk
             And it's well I know your face

             We talk and talk, we tell the truth
             There are no shadows here
             But when I look into your eyes
             I wonder what might have been here

             Because if I had met you on some journey
             Where would we be now?
