Hi undertow!
<P>
Just retured from night one of the Newport Folk Festival.  What a 
terrific concert.  All who played were great, especially Martin 
Sexton, Ani Difranco, Joan Armatrading and of course Suzanne.
<P>
Her set was very well received. She played songs from all albums 
except Days. :(  And she told a few short stories which were not quite 
anecdotes yet.  She said she is still working on them.  Here is the 
set list as best I can remember it.  Pardon any typos I am working 
from memory.
<P>
Marlene on the Wall<BR>
Rock in this pocket<BR>
Caramel<BR>
Small blue thing<BR>
World before Columbus <BR>
The Queen and the Soldier<BR>
Neighborhood girls<BR>
Blood makes noise<BR>
Luka<BR>
Tom's Diner<BR>
Gypsy (encore)
<P>
I think I missed one new song on the set list, somewhere around Small 
blue thing.  (My new song clips are on my computer at work or I could 
figure out what it was).  I fumbled the exact order in my head as I 
was heading from the photographers area to my seat so I am not sure 
where the other new song was.  I think I was a little overwhelmed 
taking pictures 10 feet away.  (I love this festival).  I will have a 
web page for the pictures as soon as I get them developed. Probably by 
the end of the week.  I shall let you know.
<P>
By the way, She was on stage with Mitchell on keyboards and a bass 
player who's name I cannot recall.
<P>
Well, I have to get some sleep so I can make it to tomorrow's show, 
with Lisa Loeb, Michelle Shocked, Bruce Cockburn, Indigo Girls and 
others.

The Ben & Jerry's Newport Folk Festival was last weekend in Rhode
Island, and Suzanne played on Saturday.  While I wasn't there (perhaps
someone on the list was???), the Friday Boston Globe mentioned Suzanne
in an article about the fest (I've edited in only those sections dealing
with SV):
<P>
>     Whatever the reason, it's working. ``We've never had such an advance
sale,'' says Wein. ``There's no question about it.<BR>
>     There won't be any tickets left at the box office by the time this
begins. We're lucky this year. We've got Ani DiFranco,<BR>
>     who's hot as a pistol. And Suzanne Vega is coming back after being away
a while. It amazes me to see how well we're<BR>
>     drawing this year.'' (Each show has a 10,000 capacity.)<BR>
><BR>
>     ``It definitely has an aura about it,'' says Vega, whose set will
include a few songs from a new disc, ``No Cheap Thrill'' (due<BR>
>     out Sept. 10). ``I play Newport when I can. I've played it twice before,
in 1991 and 1993. My happiest time was 1991<BR>
>     when I hung out for three days. It was just a great atmosphere. I even
met the Indigo Girls in line for the bathroom. I<BR>
>     thought that was very egalitarian.''<BR>
><BR>
>     Vega will perform her set tomorrow with husband/producer Mitchell Froom,
who's particularly excited. ``He hasn't played<BR>
>     Newport before,'' says Vega. ``And he's got his brother and his
brother's four children coming from Israel. They all wanted<BR>
>     to go to Newport, so there will be a gang of Frooms there.''<BR>
<BR>
I'm another new subscriber to the list, I would say that ''Gypsy" is my
favorite SV song - probably more for the sumptuous production of Mitch
Easter than anything else.  I would love hearing some more stuff of hers
produced by Mitch, but with a very fine producer already in the family I
suppose it'll never happen.  sigh.

Call me picky, but one of the years was 1992...... I flew over from England
to see Suzanne play....... it was my first visit to the USA, so it's a year
I'll never forget :) I'll post a setlist etc. tomorrow...... I'm still
trying to catch up on my sleep....... I had a blast at Newport but not much
sleep :) It was great to see Suzanne again but for me Indigo Girls stole
the show.
<P>
Take care all<BR>
Sharon
