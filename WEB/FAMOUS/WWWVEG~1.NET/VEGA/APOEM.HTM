<b>A Knife (for Suzanne)</b>
<p>

You slice, you dice<br>
a knife straight out<br>
of nasty infomercials.<br>
Serrated or smooth,<br>
you narrate with such precise<br>
intuition, you irritate<br>
and soothe. Cutting through metal,<br>
scraping skin, bone.<br>
<p>
You tone your words<br>
as if they were muscles.<br>
You expose the veins, marrow,<br>
you throw the fat. Your pose<br>
is that of a fragile waif. Little<br>
did they know.<br>
<p>
You may be dangling<br>
from a black leather string<br>
like designer jewellery,<br>
blunt, harmless-looking.<br>
But try to look away.<br>
<p>
Those are slices of our lives<br>
on a silver plate. Intricate<br>
sacs, a dried up blood orange, <br>
flawed yet triumphant. <br>
They are fragrant.<br>

Khairyl -- This is just tremendous. Thanks for sharing it with the
rest of us. I especially love the line "But try to look away" (it
sums up a great deal that I can't express) and that whole last
verse.
<p>
I've written poetry on a number of topics, but I think writing about 
Suzanne would be too daunting. I fear that her poetry would cut mine 
to ribbons.
