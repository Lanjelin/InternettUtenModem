       <i><h3>The Boulevardiers </h3></i>
<pre>
I like you 
and you like him 
and he likes me
and we all love each other.
We like to sit in the caf‚ 
and eat and drink and talk all day
and watch the sun.
We like to read the newspaper
and talk about him and her
and who is getting along with who these days,
and when the sun goes down
we walk along the cobblestone ground.

He loves the city 
with the bricks and broken bottles
and the pretty little flowers 
as they grow against the wall.
He is dark, 
he is tall, 
he is the tallest one of all 
of us.
You are bright and quick and fair
and seems that you have lost some hair
but this is all right.
This is OK. We do not mind.
We write and fight and sing 
and this is fine.

We drink the wine 
if we get it free
and if he buys you a coffee 
he can surely buy some for me
and one day we will work real hard
and get a job 
and not just sit here 
writing letters 
on this silly boulevard.
And everyone will know our name
and we'll be rich 
or we'll at least 
have some kind of fame.
We'll be brave,
we'll be bold,
we'll come riding through 
like knights of old.

The sun is like 
a lover's hand
as it comes down 
and touches you
touches me 
touches him
touches you.
And we have all got dirty feet
from wearing sandals in the street,
and we should all go home.
But still you will 
insist insist
until each last one has been kissed
and each one is happy.
And when the sun goes down
we walk along the cobblestone ground.
This is OK. We do not mind.
We write and fight and sing
and this is fine.
