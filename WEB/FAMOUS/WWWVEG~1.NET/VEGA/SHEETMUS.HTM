There's a great book of guitar tablature music by Cherry Lane Music (?
Cherry Orchard? Help me out here, folks!) that is very authentic. I have it
and love it. The songs are from the first two albums, and to my knowledge,
that's about all the sheet music there is. There may be sheet music for
individual songs, but I don't usually check for those so I wouldn't know.
(Except for Solitude Standing, which I also own. :-) )

If anyone knows otherwise, I'd love to know, too!

Subj:	Re: sheet music; Days controversy; NYC record shops report<br>
From:	Unique212@aol.com<br>
Date:	Thu, 24 Oct 1996 18:31:01 -0400<br>
<p>
Hi there folks,
<p>
There is sheet music for Solitude Standing, Days of open Hand, and 99.9Fo.
The first two are published by Cherry Lane Music, and there is a link over
to Cherry Lane on the Website. (If you don't live in the USA, it may be
cheaper to order it directly from Cherry Lane than to try at your local music
store. If you do live in the USA, it may still be simpler to order from
Cherry Lane than to find it locally.) Cherry Lane also publishes "The
Authentic Guitar Style of Suzanne Vega", a book which has tablature for
several songs from the first two albums and is superb, as well as completely
accurate (with only one or two slight exceptions). That's the one Ahree was
talking about.
<p>
The 99.9Fo book is published by WB Music, and while the piano parts seem to
be decent enough, the guitar parts are not particularly enlightening. The
voicings of the chords are often incorrect ("yeah, so we know it's a C chord,
but WHICH ONE IS IT?!!") There aren't even capo indications.
<p>
As for Nine Objects, I have no idea whether there will be a book. I really
hope they publish one! If there is, could the powers that be PLEASE take
enough care to make sure that it is of some use to guitar players? That is,
give capo indications ("capo at second fret") and make sure that the voicings
are accurately spelled out! If anyone is listening, thanks in advance.
<p>
I've been reading the stuff about Days and 99.9 and frankly I'm baffled.
Can't an artist change styles when it suits the song and the intention of
the material? It took me a few listenings to "get" Days, but when I think
about it, many of the songs on Days are the ones that pop up unbidden in my
mind while strolling around. And 99.9 is a work of genius. Don't allow the
'style' to throw you. What other sort of music could really capture the
feeling of blood making noise in one's head? And shouldn't a battle sound
clangy ("Rock in this Pocket")?
<p>
Oh yeah, the promised NYC record shops report:
Nine Objects is the CD of the Week at HMV, on sale for $11.99. It is Number
23 on Tower's Top 25. (Shawn Colvin's A Few Small Repairs is Number 21, for
those who care about such things.) The November Pulse! magazine has an
interesting article about SV and Mitchell Froom, and some photographs that
appear to have been taken at a festival over the summer (Newport perhaps?
One has a sign saying Dressing Room 4 -- Martin Sexton, Suzanne Vega.)

Well, I for one, am not good enough to play guitar from a piano sheet.
I've tried that, but it just doesn't sound right. So a good guitar tab
will be a good idea for the likes of me...<br>

There's another songbook, called "the Suzanne Vega Songbook" with
piano/vocal/chords arrangements for songs from the first two albums, plus
Left Of Center. The arrangements are very different from the Solitude
Standing songbook. And sorry folks, I believe it's an only European edition.

Hi there --<br>
This is directed at me personally, so I will respond accordingly.
<p>
For the record, I am a quite accomplished guitar player, and no I'm not
blowing my own horn, I'm stating a fact. I enjoy trying out guitars at music
stores and watching the headbangers' jaws drop -- "a chick is playing like
that?!!" go the balloons over their heads.
<p>
Why is it that guitarists have to get all huffy about their ability to swipe
notes off a recording, while such skills are not considered essential for
players of any other instruments? Could it be that they are masking their
inability to read music? A keyboard player would not settle for a score that
says in effect "play an A minor, wherever you like."  Why should a guitarist
put up with this inaccuracy and be made to feel they are more macho for it?
Or, more to the point, why do some guitarists think that those who use
accurate music scores are wusses?
<p>
U212<br>
who freely admits to not being macho!

What was being criticized was not the idea of relying on sheet music.
It was the idea of insisting that any regular sheet music will not
suffice for a guitar player. Swiping notes off a recording is
obviously sometimes a waste of time and it was not praised.
I use sheet music whenever I can.

As a guitarist whose spent many hours tabbing Joni Mitchell open tuned
puzzles, I really appreciate the fact that there are songbooks that tab
guitar styles accurately. Especially for someone who is innovative like
Suzanne or Joni, it is the closest you can get to studying with a teacher.
You can then develop your own style. I find nothing more annoying than
getting a watered down version of a complex song that is transcribed as G D C.  
I agree with Unique212 on this one

The point is not that perfectly accurate tabs of songs of this type
are not useful; it is rather that "asking" for perfect tabs and
complaining about non-perfect ones, if they luckily exist, is not
going to get a guitar player anywhere. I know players who are dying
to play certain guitar-based songs, but roll their eyes when handed
the piano tab versions. They complain 5 years later that they should
have taken the time to devise their version from these piano tabs and
shared it with others during open mics, etc. I suppose everyone has
different levels of attachment to perfection. The point is "personal
effort", or rather the lack of it.

For those who are accomplished guitarists, this may be feasible. However,
most of us who are attempting to teach ourselves guitar on our own don't yet
have the vocabulary with which to interpret songs accurately. Most
songbooks have the chords and capo-ing, but that only gets you started.
Trying to make it *sound* right is where the learning comes in -- strumming
pattern, hammer-ons, pull-offs, harmonics, thumps, bends. Even with
tablature, it's just a starting place. I agree that figuring out as much as
you can on your own is the best way to learn, but ya gotta start somewhere,
and it's certainly a big help if what you're learning from is accurate.
Throw alternate tunings in like Suzanne, Shawn, Joni Mitchell, etc use and
it's overwhelming. Like Joni says, it's like trying to learn how to type
and all the keys keep moving around!
<p>
BTW, I don't think your sarcasm was really called for considering a simple
request that published guitar tab simply be *accurate* for the paying
consumer...

Just wanted to chime in here. I too prefer tab guitar books. I'm not a
guitar whiz. But when I started playing guitar, I was able to play a
few of Suzanne's songs by using SVs authentic tab book. This actually
made learning to play a lot more fun instead of just playing little baby
beginner songs. If I had the skill to figure it all out, it wouldn't be
such a bad thing, but I would spend hours and hours of frustration to
little avail, I'm afraid. That's great for those who can figure it out,
though.

As far as I know SV doesn't use any alternative tunings. What songs does
she do w/ alternative tunings, anyone?
I have 2nd row seats for Suzanne in Seattle on Nov 14. Can't wait!
Suzanne, if you're reading, would you consider playing "Song of Sand" at
the Seattle show?? Just a little plug :)

<p>
Following a non-perfect guitar tab or a piano tab, and by using
it as a guide to devise your own method or to try to figure
out the way Suzanne Vega plays the song, is not a task that
requires a guitar player to be accomplished. What is being asked
in the very first message of this thread is to be handed the
way the song "is" played. I don't think the issue here is
how "good" a guitar player needs to be, but rather how
"unimaginative", "lazy", and "boring" he/she shouldn't be.
<p>
> you can on your own is the best way to learn, but ya gotta start somewhere,
Hmm, then that somewhere must be the perfect tablature...OK...

From:	Albert J. Horst (albert@teracorp.com)<br>
Date:	Fri, 25 Oct 1996 15:15:40 -0400 (EDT)<br>
<p>
From seeing Suzanne in concerts and on video, it is
obvious that she does not always play her songs the same
way they are presented in the Cherry Lane music books.
Two examples are Marlene on the Wall and Queen and the
Soldier - which I've seen her play fairly high on the
fret board, yet with the capo still on the 2nd position.
<p>
As for favorite albums, I feel all of Suzanne Vega's
albums have something to offer and should not be criticized
in black and white terms. I like to use percentages myself.
Suzanne Vega: 100%<br>
Solitude Standing: 100%<br>
Days of Open Hand: 100%<br>
99.9: 80%<br>
9OOD: 60%<br>
<p>
Yes, the trend of "my opinion" looks ominous, but it
does not imply that I like her any less! I do think her
older fans, like me, tend to view her latest work from a
different and common perspective than many newer fans.
Maybe I'm just nostalgic.

After having gotten the other songbooks mentioned I was pleased to have picked up
this one you indicate in early '95 when I was in England. Unfortunately, the sheet music for
"Marlene On The Wall" was yucky. The chords didn't seem right and the piano
part was just weird (though I admit I'm much worse on piano). When I mentioned
this here someone (thank you!) posted another tab version. I tried it out and it
seemed closer, but still not right. Oh, well. I'll keep trying. I attempted to
chart the chord/finger positions the last concert here in San Francisco, but I
kept getting interrupted by a woman who kept pestering me, asking what I
was writing (I _did_ tell her!). The Japanese laserdisc didn't have enough
close-ups for me, but I'm just a so-so guitarist.

That's my observation, too, though the Q & S version in the "Authentic Styles . . ."

Hi gang,
<p>
since "World before Columbus" is such a beautiful song, has any
of you worked out the Tab and/or chords for this song? If yes,
please send it, if not - here is what I think about it. I'm still
quite new to figureing out tabs and chords of songs, so if something's
wrong: don't flame me toooo hard ;-)
<p>
However, the intro is a picked Em7 chord:<br>
(somewhat simplified)<br>

b------3---------3-------<br>
g--------4-----4---------<br>
D----2-------2-----------<br>
A------------------------<br>
E-0-------(0)------------<br>
<p>
I'm not quite sure about the root notes in the verse:<br>
E G?? B e??<br>
The chords in the chorus (played by keyboard/piano) are IMHO:<br>

Hi there
<p>
You're right about the intro chord being an Em7, but it's not where you
think it is. In the video clip from the Paris interview, and in concert, the
chord SV plays is:
<p>
0 - 12 -12 - 0 - 0 - 0
<p>
which is the Em formation placed at the twelfth fret.
<p>
The chords at the first part of the verse are:
<p>
If your 		love were taken            from   me<br>
0-12-12-0-0-0      8 - 10 -10 - 9- 0- 0     7 - 9 - 9 -0 - 0 - 0    8-10-10- 9-0-0<br>
<p>
   Every             color would be    black and      white<br>
0-12-12-0-0-0     8-10-10-9-0-0     7-9-9-0-0-0    8-10-10-9-0-0   etc.<br>
<p>
The 8-10-10-9-0-0- chord may actually be 8-10-10-0-0-0- instead, I can't really tell.
<p>

Subj:	learning SV songs on the guitar<br>
Date:	96-11-25 17:18:22 EST<br>
From:	kanderso@wheatonma.edu (Kirk Anderson)<br>
<p>
Been playing guitar a long time now, but obviously
I still had a lot to learn.  It's only recently that
I've understood that, for instance, a capo is not just
for people with a weak first finger.  Since
I usually play electric, the value of favoring open strings eluded
me for years.  Now I'm playing either my acoustic
or my Rickenbacker most of the time--real motivation to
take a different approach.
<p>
Thanks to some fine transcription work, you can
do spot-on renditions of some Suzanne Vega songs, once
you wrap your fingers around a few new chords.
(There's tablature etc. at the site mentioned by
a recent posting.)  I've only worked on a few songs, but
that was enough to learn a lot, and I think I understand
now what gives so much of SV's music that particular 'open'
quality.  Here goes...
<p>
Unlike trad folk players (and rock/blues players, barring
the occasional Roger McGuinn or Peter Buck), SV avoids
playing chords 'straight' (C, G7, Am....)
<p>
The recent posting on "World Before Columbus" is a perfect example: that
open, airy quality is achieved by combining
open strings with fretted patterns which move up
and down the neck.  Suspended fourths and seconds are
everywhere ("Luka" moves mostly between Bsus4 and
Asus2, capoed up 2 frets).  "The Queen and the Soldier" and
"Small Blue Thing" as transcribed at the ftp site sound
*great*, and it was while playing them that I realized
there's a method here.  I had never really played chords
above the fourth fret, unless they were barre chords.
But I'll bet you acoustic types are saying 'duh!' by now....
<p>
Vega, btw, is a fine guitarist. Does she usually use fingerpicks?
My first visual impression of her was from a photo with that
gorgeous Guild jumbo, probably "Luka" -era.  Very provocative,
in a world of dreadnaughts.

Nope -- she uses a thumbpick and bare fingers (with some nail) for
fingerpicking, flatpick for strumming.  This is based on observation at
several concerts.   
<p>
She also uses a lot of chords that have no thirds at all, thus they are
neither major nor minor.  Many songs on the first album have such chords --
examples are Some Journey and Small Blue Thing.  
<p>
Glad to hear you got over your capo prejudice -- without them, many styles of
playing would be simply impossible!  I bet that Ricky really rings now.
<p>
She now plays small-bodied Taylors in concert, I think the 514 or 512 model
(mahogany and cedar or spruce), and used to play small-bodied Yamaha
electric/acoustics in recent shows.  The Taylors sound better.

I must agree with you. I've been playing acoustic guitar for one year now,
by learning the thing by myself. I first played songs I found on the
internet, then (three months ago) I discovered Suzanne Vega. Since then, I
have difficulties playing the old I've learn before. LIke you said, her
music is rich and has unusual chords that sound great!
<p>
You mentionned Luka. I luckily discovered the chords when I was playing
around with my guitar (these are also power chords). And I never thought
someone would dare to use them throughout a song (except for the E). As for
the capo, I think it's usefull when you want to higher your voice. 
<p>
Of course she uses fingerpicking! When she don't, it's mostly because she's
playing "Marlene on the Wall" and "Rock in this Pocket". Or maybe she is
not playing guitar on a song. 
<p>
I've started to take some guitar courses. My teacher is quite impress with
the fact that I want to learn everything about chord contruction and
combinations. I just want to learn it all to be able to make a sound as
beautifull as Suzanne. It's a her show that I discovered acoustic guitar
for the second time in my life. Since then, I fell in love with it!

Subj:	The Guitar Part in 50/50 Chance<br>
Date:	96-12-10 19:23:52 EST<br>
From:	Unique212@aol.com<br>
<p>
Hi folks,
<p>
A while back someone (David A, perhaps?) asked about the guitar line in 50/50
Chance.  If I remember correctly (from seeing SV perform it solo acoustic)
she is either playing the lowest three strings of the guitar all together on
every eighth note (a sort of choppy, staccato effect) or playing the same
three string in a very up-and-down pattern, like so, with one note per each
eighth note:
<p>
(String numbers) 6-5-4-5-6-5-4-5{new measure}-6-5-4-5-6-5-4-5  etc.
<p>
The chords are, according to the songbook for Days:  
<p>
Verse:<br>
Bm (2-2-0-x-x-x)     Bmadd4 (0-2-0-x-x-x)    Gsus2 (3-0-0-x-x-x)    G (3-2-0-x-x-x)
<p>

Chorus:<br>
Csus4 (x-3-3-0-x-x-)    Em (x-2-2-0-x-x-)      Eb (x-1-1-0-x-x-)    Eb(b5) (x-0-1-0-x-x-)
<p>

Interestingly enough, this type of three-string chord which just contains the
essential defining elements of the chord is called a "power chord" when
played at top volume by a heavy-metal guitarist!

P.J. Harvey makes heavy use of this type of chord as well.  The result is
a very 'dirty', rough effect, going more for rhythm instead of melody or
harmony.  Metallica's famous "chucka-chucka" riffs and most Nina
Gordon-penned Veruca Salt songs use these a lot as well for a punky sound.

Dear U212 (you're right, it does sound radioactive :-))
<p>
I am basically a Neanderthal when it comes to playing the acoustic guitar--my 
approach is to just bash away on it. Thus it was fascinating to read your 
analyses of Suzanne's guitar technique, e.g., your post of 12/10/96 on Suzanne's 
use of a "three-string power chord" on 50/50 Chance or your post of 11/25/96:  
<p>
She also uses a lot of chords that have no thirds at all, thus they are
neither major nor minor.  Many songs on the first album have such chords --
examples are Some Journey and Small Blue Thing. 
<p>
Would you or anyone else on the Undertow know what other composers might also 
frequently use these types of chord structures in their work? Or is Suzanne 
unique? Does one have to look outside the world of rock/pop to find these kinds 
of chords being used e.g. classical or jazz? Any thoughts on whether one can 
hear an evolution in the types of chords Suzanne uses? 
<p>
Many of Suzanne's songs seem to set up a interesting pattern of presenting, but 
not always resolving either musically (as with the chords that are neither 
major nor minor) nor lyrically, the subject at hand, of leaving some things 
hanging, of not committing to a definitive answer much less a "Hollywood" 
ending where all the loose ends of the song are tied-up. 
<p>
I wonder if Suzanne's preference for songs without "resolution" lyrically and 
musically (which is perhaps the biggest attraction her songs have for me) is 
also the reason why, according to Suzanne, she finds it difficult to write 
political or love songs. Both types of songs, almost by definition, typically 
force the writer to declare commitment to a political ideology or to an object 
of love, to make a statement. In both cases, the person in their commitment to 
the political cause or to their love, is in a position of almost unconditional 
acceptance, often to the point of being uncritical, of being "head over heels," 
of giving oneself over to the other, and of being open (and vulnerable) to 
dissappointment. 
<p>
Suzanne's music has never seemed to me to be music that was uncritical. It some 
ways, her music might be described as music for the cautious, or for people who 
are cynics with a soft spot. (Cynics, after all, are the true believers who've 
been disappointed a few too many times). 
<p>
Regards, Bruce.

There are a lot of suspensions in Beatles, Byrds, Who, Rolling Stones.
But I think they always get resolved (to major) and that's what makes
Suzanne Vega's praxis different.  The way that she plays them, using
both open strings and fretted notes halfway up the neck at the same
time, also adds to the effect.  I would not say she's the only artist
who does this, just because I don't listen to a lot of acoustic
music.  But check out Joni Mitchell and David Crosby, maybe.

<p>
I won't comment on the love songs part, but successful political songs
are as rare as hen's teeth and I think Suzanne Vega is one of many
many many artists who'd like to address political questions but
recognize that it's usually just not possible to pull it off.  There
are some artists who don't realize it, and write political songs that make you
cringe when you hear them.  And a very few who are occasionally up to
the feat.  Joe Jackson has succeeded here and there; Elvis Costello's
"Shipbuilding" (which he only co-wrote) might be an example.  Bob Dylan
called them "finger-pointing" songs, and it's the best description there
is.  He wrote a few good ones himself.  Sam Phillips explores terrain
that might be considered 'political', and wonderfully.  But the more
specific it gets, the greater the chances for failure --and that's
where Bruce's remark about 'resolution' comes in.

<p>
Good observations.  Songs that deal with mental health, relationships of
the individual to society, alienation, or that comment on and observe some 
aspect of urban life *can* have some 'resolution,' if they're forced to.
*But* what makes Suzanne's writing so unique is that she knows there is
rarely a simple solution to any of these situations.  Think about how much
*less* effective songs like "Luka" or "Cracking" or "Bad Wisdom" would be 
if they included a nice wrap-up of the particular individual's ultimate fate.
<p>
I think she's commented on writing love songs to the effect that "Yes, I
could write something like 'Baby, I love you so much,' but it's been done
before."  She finds other ways to express these sentiments.
<p>
>Suzanne's music has never seemed to me to be music that was uncritical. It some <br>

<p>
I'm not sure if I'd put it that way ("the cautious").  The characters in 
most of her songs, or the situations she deals with, often involve people
in power (or the 'system') vs. those on the fringes - David vs. Goliath,
for example.  Her characters, like those in "Ironbound," are fighters - 
they keep coming back (like 'weeds').  So I'd agree that her music appeals
to cynics, but maybe to those cynics who do not tolerate injustice.  Or
those who are just plain stubborn!   Hmmm... on second thought, perhaps
there's some idealism there as well?
<p>
Interesting stuff to think about,
<p>
