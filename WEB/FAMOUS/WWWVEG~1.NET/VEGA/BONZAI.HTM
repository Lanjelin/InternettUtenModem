<b>SUZANNE VEGA</b><br>
<b>NINE OBJECTS OF DESIRE</b><br>
A song-by-song conversation with Mr. Bonzai,

<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   The songs stand on their own, but sometimes it's nice to hear a few
words, a comment.  Could we go down the list?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Sure...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "Birth-day."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Do you want to know what it's about?  It's about the day that my
daughter was born.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   There's a line about "this pain."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  That's the first line and I wasn't sure about whether to open the
song with that, because sometimes you don't want to open with the pain.
But on the other hand, the song was about having faith that the thing that
you really desire will come, will be there, will come forth.  How else do
you put it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   In a surgical sense...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.  It's about having faith, but it wasn't only about my
daughter.  It was about the album, in a sense, because I had to go into it
with faith that it would come forth and that it would be there at the end,
and that it wouldn't fall apart in the middle.  And so it was all worth it,
and that's what that song is about.  It's about the process of birthing, in
the literal and metaphoric sense.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   I bet not many women have written songs about having a child...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I was looking for another song - I can see why, because you really
have to be careful about what information you put in.  You don't want to
put in really gory details - I don't anyway.  I think Sinead O'Connor has
one or two songs where she mentions pregnancy, but you don't want to start
using words like 'trimester' or you know... [laughs]<p>
	So I found it really difficult to figure out what you put in and what you
don't put in, and how do you show the intensity of the feeling without
grossing people out.  Actually, if you didn't know what the song was about,
you might think it was about drugs, sex...<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   It's kind of an aggressive song...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Well, let me tell you - It's an aggressive act, it's really hard
and if you want an edgy experience - People think about having a baby and
you think of the lullabies, and the teddy bears, and that's fine.  That
comes afterwards.  But in the middle of it, it's a deep struggle.  And it's
as edgy as anything you'll ever experience or one will ever experience -
not you personally [laughs].<p>
	It's amazing that everyone has experienced it, that people are born that
way.  It's astonishing.

<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>  "Headshots."<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  To me, that's a song about walking through Soho, which is near
where I live.  For a while, there was a poster that was all over Manhattan.
It just said Headshots and there was the number, and there was the face of
a boy.  It was just evocative, almost as a piece of art in itself.  It was
a photographer trying to get work, but I found that that face reminded me
of someone that I used to live with, and that provoked a lot of memories
and guilt, and so on and so forth.  That's how that song ended up being
written.  It's a reflective song.

<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "Caramel."<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Well, "Caramel" was intended to be one of those old fashioned
songs, like "Girl From Ipanema," or what Astrud Gilberto would sing.  I
used to really love that kind of music when I was a teenager, and so it's a
song about longing for something and wishing for something you know you
really shouldn't have.  Caramel is the metaphor for the thing you long for,
but you shouldn't really touch.

<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>  "Stockings."  There's a provocative little number...<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right, that is provocative.  Everyone is curious about that one.
"So, does your husband wonder what you're writing about?"<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   I thought you possibly could have been writing it for a man to
sing, and you decided to sing it.<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  That was part of what I was doing.  I was intentionally -
although it's based on a true infatuation from a while back, from years
ago, that never went anywhere.  But when I wrote the song I also wanted to
write it from a perspective that if a man wanted to cover it, it would
still read.  It would still make sense.  Say, if Evan Dando, who covered
"Luka," wanted to sing this one, it would still read from his perspective.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "Casual Match."  That's the kind of a match that you strike?<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  It's the match that you strike.  The metaphor is a field and if
you throw a match into it casually, then everything goes up in flames.  But
it's also casual match as in a match that's sort of about a fling that
doesn't turn out well.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "Thin Man."  Who is the Thin Man?<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Well, "Thin Man" is one of the songs that I mentioned to you
before, where the specter of death comes into it.  I think there was a
Jacques Brel song that said, and I'm paraphrasing, "My death is a young
woman with her arm around my waist who accompanies me around the city."  I
loved that line, and I loved the song, and it's a French song, so I
paraphrased it to be New York and to be the Thin Man who accompanies me
around the city.  So, he's the figure of death, as a suitor that you have
to resist to the very end.

<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, and it did.  That's like a challenge.  You're looking at
someone and it's a challenge to them.  The metaphor there is poker, and
it's sort of calling someone's bluff, and seeing if they're willing to go
the full way - knowing that if they do go the full way, that it will cost.

<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "World Before Columbus."  This struck me as just such a great love song.<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  It is a love song, and maybe I shouldn't tell you who the object
is there - but it was actually written for my daughter.  The idea of the
world before Columbus came because I have a cat at home, and this cat
scratched my eye -just playing, and it became infected and I had to wear an
eyepatch for about a week.  The thing I noticed was that the world was
really flat seeing the world that way.  It struck me as funny  and I was
writing it down and I said the world was as flat as the world before
Columbus.  I took that idea and said, well if this love was taken away from
me, that's how the world would feel to me.  That was the metaphor that I
was working with.

<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "Lolita."  You identify with Lolita in the song?<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Yes, it's like a letter to myself as I was when I was young, and
sort of a word of warning to young girls who are in there teens, who use
sex as their only means of identity.  It's so easy in this culture and this
society to feel that if you're not sexy, then you don't count, or you don't
exist.  I think in certain parts of the country that is how you are judged.
You're not judged on whether you're smart, whether you're useful, whether
you're good.  You're judged by "are you sexy" and I think its a problem.
It's a letter to those girls and to the girl that I had been.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "Honeymoon Suite."  There's a lovely song, and I wanted to ask if
you believe in ghosts, but we already sort of covered that.<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  I believe in ghosts and in angels, although those are not my
words for them.  I don't know what the words are for the things that I've
seen and felt, but I suppose ghosts and angels come close.  That's a song
about intimacy, a song about how you can be very close to somebody and
there are still those mysterious patches that you can't figure out.  You
can lay next to someone every night and still not quite have the last bit
covered, you know?  That's what that's about, trying to figure out how
someone else's psyche works.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   I imagine it's just the kind of thing you have to live with, no
matter how much you know somebody there's still going to be...<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  All you have to do is look at someone's dreams and you can see
there are huge areas of mystery that you'll never tap, and that's what
keeps things alive and keeps a relationship fascinating.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   "Tombstone."<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Yeah, well that's sort of a lighthearted [laughs] little ditty, a
meditation on death.  Boy, I'm afraid to tell you the story behind that
one. [sighs]<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   Don't be afraid.  Lie.<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  [laughs]  Well, let me tell you.  My parents, we had a cat -
sorry to keep bringing up cats - but we had a cat for 17 years and it died.
And my parents would be considered Bohemian in their own way.  They decided
to send Morris up the river.  They decided to let him go with dignity and
they wanted to give him a Viking funeral, so they put him in a shoebox and
set him on fire and sent him up the East River.  I remember hearing the
story, and I'm sort of used to these types of things happening by now, so I
didn't really pay much attention.  My sister called me a week later and
said, "Did you hear what they did to Morris?"  I said, yeah, they put him
in a shoebox, set it on fire and sent him up the river.  Then I realized
what it sounded like, and how odd it could be perceived.  So, I was
thinking to myself, when I die I would prefer a tombstone.  I started
thinking I like a tombstone because it weathers well, and it was sort of a
lighthearted look at what might be.  There you go.  I don't know if my
mother is going to appreciate this on the website, but there it was
floating up the East River and everybody saw it.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>  I think they have a parental control program.  Last, but certainly
not least, "My Favorite Plum."   You've seen the best...<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Well, it's a song that began as looking at a person and desiring
that person and then it just became more abstract from there.  The plum
became this obscure object of desire.  It started to mean everything I'd
ever wanted, that you long for and hope for, and you don't quite get it.
And the song - you're prepared to stand there under the tree and wait for
it forever if you have to.  The song is really about hoping and longing and
just being so utterly convinced that this is really the one for you.  It's
kind of an odd song in a way.  It's just very suspenseful.<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.B:</font>   The whole album is such an adventure.  Listening to it, I felt I
was walking with someone through their dreams and their life.  Also, I
think that with good poetry, you don't figure it out the first time.  I've
listened to the album now a number of times and you've helped me, and I'll
listen again and have a different idea.  So, this has been great.<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Well, thank you.  It's been helpful for me to do this, too.<p>

<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.Bonzai:</font> You started performing at what, 16?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red"><font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font></font> 16, yes.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.Bonzai:</font> Do you think that's a good for move an artist, to just get out
there and start doing it at such a young age?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red"><font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font></font> In fact it felt late to me, because I'd started writing songs when
I was about 14. I had been really interested in The Beatles and I was
reading their biography and they were all massively famous by the time they
were 18. So, I remember feeling that at 16 time was running out and I
better get out there if I wanted to do anything with myself. I think 16 is
a good time to start.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Mr.Bonzai:</font> Had you been warming up for a few years?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red"><font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font></font> Yes, by the time I was 16 I had about seventy-five, a hundred
songs, so I was a very ambitious teenager. I decided to go out and see what
I could do, and I was rejected in a lot of places because that was the 70s
and folk music wasn't exactly in vogue at that time. But it's good to be rejected, too, because then you can figure out where it is that you fit in, where you belong - and you build character.
