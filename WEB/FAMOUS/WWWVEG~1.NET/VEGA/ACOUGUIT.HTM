<p>In 1985, when Suzanne Vega released her self-titled debut 
album on A&M, pop radio
was dominated by artists like R.E.M., Elvis Costello, the Talking 
Heads, the Eurythmics, and
Frankie Goes to Hollywood - not a lot of folky acoustic guitar players 
in that group.  Vega's 
hushed yet powerful songs, such as <i>"Marlene on the Wall"</i> and 
<i>"Small Blue Thing,"</i>
seemed to come out of nowhere, making Vega the talk of college 
coffeehouses and a critical
success.  Her follow-up record, <b><i>Solitude Standing,</i></b> 
released in 1987, propelled
her into the mainstream, and the risk that A&M took in signing a 
folksinger paid off in a big way.
<i>"Luka,"</i> a song told from the vantage point of an abused child, 
went to No. 3 on the charts;
<i>"Tom's Diner,"</i> an a cappella number about a mundane stop at the 
coffee shop, eventually
went to No. 5 as a dance mix by DNA; and the album went gold.</body>
<p><body>The success of Vega's first two records paved the way for 
other singer-songwriters,
such as Tracy Chapman and Toni Childs, who might not otherwise have 
been signed by big
record labels.  The downside to the success of those first two albums 
was that it stifled Vega's
creative development and put a lot of pressure on her third album, 
<b><i>Days of Open Hand,</i></b>
which she coproduced with Anton Sanko and released in 1990.  "Everyone 
felt that it had to
be technically clean and up to a certain standard," she told Jeffrey 
Pepper Rodgers in a 1993
interview.  "There wasn't any feeling of, 'Let's be radical" or "Let's 
twist this.""</body>
<p><body><b><i>Days of Open Hand</i></b> was a commercial 
disappointment, and perhaps it was this end
to her winning streak, as it were, that gave Vega the freedom to take 
chances on her next record,
the psychedelic <b><i>99.9 F,</i></b> which includes such pop hits as 
<i>"Blood Makes Noise"</i>
and <i>"As Girls Go."</i>  "On this album, we were going for delibeate 
distortion and a more playful
kind of feeling," Vega said.  "It was like finally you get to go out 
and roll around in the dirt without
having to be cleaned up for Sunday."</body>
<p><body>The new attitude behind <b><i>99.9 F</i></b> came in part from 
producer Mitchell
Froom.  Vega had heard Froom's mostly rock 'n' roll recordings and 
appreciated the wide variety
of sounds he was capable of bringing out in different artists.  
"Mitchell likes eccentricity," Vega
explained, "and when he works with an artist, he'll find out what's 
different about them and then bring
those qualities out, rather than making them conform to his idea.  I 
wanted the last record to have
a lot of contrasts in it.  I was aware that (before <b><i>99.9 
F</i></b>) I had a reputation for being sort
of ethereal - wan and frail and melancholy - and it was worrying me 
that it was all going to sound
like one color.  So I pushed myself to write songs like <i>"When Heroes 
Go Down"</i> and to
use more major chords than I would have normally."</body>
<p><body>In Vega's words, her collaboration with Froom allowed her most 
creative impulses to
"come bursting out."  And that passion is obvious when you listen to 
the recording, an exhilarating
mix of acoustic guitar, Vega's otherworldly voice, and electric 
instruments that takes off in previously
uncharted directions without losing the thread of any of her songs.  
"We were careful to keep the
whole thing scaled down to my guitar and vocals," Vega said.</body>
<p><body>In fact, the core of almost every song written for <b><i>99.9 
F</i></b> came from Vega's
guitar.  "What I really love is just to sit with the guitar in my arms 
and fool around with it," she said.
Sometimes a particular rhythmic idea will inspire an idea for a song, 
or a series of chords will
jog something in her mind. " <i>'In Liverpool'</i> got started because 
I was trying to teach myself
an Elvis Costello song called <i>'Almost Blue,'</i>" she recalled.  "I 
had just played the first
three chords, and then that gave me an idea and I started going off on 
that."</body>
<p><body>The melodies in Vega's early songs tended to be made up of 
short phrases that she
would "repeat over and over again," and the lyrics were generally 
compact as well.  "I prefer
short words to long ones, because I find that's the quickest way to get 
someone's attention,"
she said.  "I'm usually writing about a very specific situation, and it 
seems to me that there is only
one set of words that will tell the whole story.  It's almost like a 
code, a way of giving a lot of information
in a short time."</body>
<p><body>With <b><i>99.9 F,</i></b> Vega began to write songs with 
longer musical phrases, and
she is hoping to keep that type of song in the mix of her next album, 
which will be in preproduction
this summer.  She finds that songs with shorter melody lines tend to 
turn out to be more pop, and
those with longer melodic themes work well for narrative ballads.  Vega 
hasn't yet written most of
the songs for the new record but said she's working on a couple of 
old-fashioned folk ballads.
"I hope they'll come through," she added.  "You can never tell what 
will fly until you get into the
studio."</body>
<p><body>Like <b><i>99.9 F,</i></b> the new record will feature a 
mixture of acoustic guitar
and electric instruments and effects.  Around the time of <b><i>Days of 
Open Hand,</i></b> Vega
was experimenting with a Fairlight ( a computer-based sampler, 
synthesizer, and recording
system), but she now prefers to let Froom and sound engineer Tchad 
Blake play with sounds and 
effects.  "I get mesmerized by the supidest mistakes (in the 
programming)," she explained.
"It's a relief to get back to the acoustic guitar after that.  I didn't 
even want to use all six strings
on my guitar after all the options of the Fairlight - I wanted to stick 
with three strings."</body>
<p><body>One of the biggest inspirations behind the new recording is 
bound to be Vega and 
Froom's new baby Ruby.  Froom (who's already had an album, <b><i>Ruby 
Vroom</i></b> by
the band Soul Coughing, named after her).  "She may make it onto the 
record," Vega said,
"but may not be recognizable as herself."</body>
<p><body>Parenthood has cetainly affected the way that Vega works.  
"Suddenly I have a lot
less time to concentrate," she said.  "I used to be able to get up in 
the middle of the night and
play my guitar.  Now I can't do that .  But I sing a lot more, to Ruby. 
 I make up little tunes, little
ditties.  she responds really well to that."</body>
<p><body>"I forbid all tossing around of ideas in the house," said 
Vega.  "When we go into preproduction,
we'll work from one to six in a rehearsal studio away form the house."  
She has basically kept
Froom in the dark about the new songs she's working on, although, she 
said, "Mitchell does hear
me singing to Ruby and will sometimes put a bass line behind the 
melody."</body>
