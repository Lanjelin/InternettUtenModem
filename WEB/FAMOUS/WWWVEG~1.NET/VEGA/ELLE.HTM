How She Changed Her Tune<br>
Edgy folksinger Suzanne Vega reemerges as a cool pop chanteuse<br>
by Andrew Essex<p>

	When unsuspecting listeners hear the richly nuanced pop and par	lor
jazz of Suzanne Vega's new album, Nine Objects of desire (A&M), they may
find it difficult to believe that this cool chanteuse is the same
waifish singer-song	writer behind "Luka," the harrowing 1987 ballad about
an abused child.  All they're likely to recognize are her dark lyrics
and insinuating voice.
<p>
	"I suppose my new songs are a bit more adventurous," Vega says
with char	acteristic nonchalance.  "'Caramel' is supposed to sound like a
bossa nova tune from the '60s. 'Birthday' is probably the heaviest thing
I've ever done.  Some of the stuff is based on the grooves.  There's one
love song ['World Before Columbus'], but we distorted the vocal to
distance it from the sort of things I used to do."
<p>
	Of course, the sort of things the thirty-seven-year-old Vega used
to do -- the gritty-elegy-with-the-powerful-message that elevated her
from the Greenwich Village folk scene of the mid-'80s -- succeeded in
transcending the image of the female singer-songwriter as bandanna-clad,
summer-of-love naif, and introduced a new generation to the music that
landed Joan Baez on the cover of Time in 1962.
<p>
	"I wanted to be a folksinger," Vega explains.  "When I was fourteen, I
used to listen to Woody Guthrie and write songs about living on freight trains.
As I got older, I realized I didn't know a thing about freight trains -- I'm
from New York City." In 1992, after a two-year layoff, she released a fourth
album, the underrated 99.9 F (probably best known for the disquieting,
AIDS-influenced "Blood Makes Noise").  Vega's tales of the city blended folk
narratives with industrial noise and Latin rhythms (drawn from her childhood in
Spanish Harlem) and gave birth to post-modern folk.
<p>
		Though Vega isn't entirely comfortable with the "folk" label, she's
hardly disowning it: "Folk is part of American culture," she says.  "It's
mostly about storytelling, not acoustic guitars and tie-dye.  I wanted to be a
mix of Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Lou Reed; they're all great storytellers.
I learned by playing solo at folk festivals.  If you can win over a festival
audience, you can pretty much work anywhere."
