<p>Don't let the deadpan vocals or innocent gaze fool you, Jeremy
Hellger wrote in the New York Review of Records [December
1992/January 1993], in introducing his assessment of 99.9 F,
the singer-songwriter Suzanne Vega's latest album. "Suzanne
Vega is a contained maelstrom looking for a place to uncork."
Widely regarded as one of the most brilliant songwriters of
her generation, Vega emerged  as a leading figure of the folk-
music revival of the early 1980s when, accompanying herself on
acoustic guitar, she sang what have been labeled contemporary
folk or neo-folk songs of her own creation in Greenwich
Village clubs. Since the release of her self-titled,
critically acclaimed 1985 debut album, she has given sold-out
concerts in many of the world's best-known halls. In
performances devoid of outward drama that nevertheless convey
deep emotion. Vega sings in a distinctive, clear vibratoless
voice that has been described as "a cool, dry sandpaper-
brushed near-whisper" and as "plaintive but disarmingly
powerful." Bearing the stamp of a masterful storyteller who
"observed the world with a clinically poetic eye." In the
words of Stephen Holden of the New York Times [April 29,
1987], her songs focus on city life and ordinary people and on
such subjects as childhood trauma, child abuse, spiritual or
physical illnesses, loneliness and love. Notably  succinct and
understated, often cerebral but also streetwise, her lyrics
invite multiple interpretations.
 <p>    With the release in 1987 of Solitude Standing, her second
album, and in particular, its hit single "Luka", Vega vaulted
to a position of prominence in the world of pop music.
Inspired in part by the British group DNA's highly successful
1991 remix of "Tom's Diner," another cut from Solitude
Standing, Vega ventured into musical territory she had never
before explored to create 99.9 F. Without turning her back on
her roots in folk music, with 99.9 F, she stretched the
boundaries of that genre still further to encompass what has
been variously dubbed industrial folk, technofolk, and
technofolk rock. Vega is said to have paved the way for such
singers as Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked, Edie Brickell,
Melissa Etheridge, and Shawn Colvin.
<p>     Weighing just two and a half pounds when she was born,
two months prematurely, on July 11, 1959 in Santa Monica,
California, Suzanne Vega spent the first weeks of her life in
an incubator. Her parents divorced before or shortly after her
first birthday and for many years she had no contact with her
father. In 1988, after learning of his whereabouts from a
detective whom she had hired to track him down, she visited
him in California, where he earns his livelihood by creating
artistic renderings of architectural blueprints. Vega's
mother, a computer program analyst of German-Swedish
extraction, remarried in 1960. About a year later she and her
second husband, Ed Vega, a Puerto-Rican-born writer and
teacher, moved with Suzanne to New York City. Growing up in
Hispanic neighborhoods with the three children born to her
mother and stepfather Suzanne Vega spoke Spanish as well as
English. At the age of nine, she learned that Ed Vega was not
her biological father, a discovery that troubled her greatly.
"It forced me to reexamine my whole identity." she explained
to Anthony Scaduto, who interviewed her for New York Newsday
[October 18,1987]. "I felt comfortable with my identity as
half Puerto Rican and was proud of it. And to suddenly find
out I was white... For a long time I denied I was not half
Puerto Rican." Despite that denial, for many years Vega
thought of herself as an outsider.
 <p>    According to an article by Stephen Holden in the New York
Times [September 18, 1984], the atmosphere in the Vega
household "encouraged all kinds of artistic creativity.
"Vega's parents often sang folk songs at home, some with
lyrics and music written by Ed Vega, who played the guitar.
Suzanne Vega began to pick out chords on the guitar at the age
of eleven. At twelve she began to set down her thoughts in a
journal and in poems that displayed what she has referred to
as her natural ability at rhyme. Two years later she started
writing what she has described as "horribly corny" songs. She
showed them to her stepfather, who she has said advised her
"not to use cliches and to be as honest as [she could]."
<p>     The musicians whose recordings Vega found especially
instructive and inspirational during her teens included Huddie
Ledbetter ["Leadbelly"], Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, Cisco
Houston, Odetta, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Laura Nyro, Paul
Simon, and Leonard Cohen. Vega has also spoken with admiration
of the vibratoless, jazz technique of the Brazilian singer
Astrud Gilberto and the works of the writer Carson McCullers
and the painter Edward Hopper. She has named as especially
inspiring to her during her early teens a biography of Bob
Dylan. "It seemed to me [Dylan] was one person who had
triumphed, who changed his life." she explained to Anthony
Scaduto. "So I said, `I'm going to do that'"
 <p>    Vega has said  that Buddhism, to which she and the other
members of her family turned in the middle 1970s, aided her
development as a person. "It gave me a sense of hope in
myself." she told Scaduto "I thought of myself as a really bad
person because there was something wrong with me, something
missing, a piece of me that was not there. Buddhism got me to
see my potential." She has cited the twice-daily chanting in
which she has engaged as a follower of Nichiren Shoshu
Buddhism as influential in her songwriting.
 <p>    As a student at the High School of Performing Arts, in
Manhattan, Vega studied modern dance. She told Eric Pooley for
New York [April 27, 1987] that her fellow students tended to
be "extroverted" and "hyperactive" and that she did not have
"the personality to compete." I learned to get people to
notice me by saying and doing nothing." she said. Vega gave
her first public vocal performances at informal gatherings at
local churches. After enrolling at Barnard College, in New
York City, she sang in West Side coffee houses and at folk
festivals held at Columbia University. In addition to
traditional folk songs, she sang songs she had written
herself. "It was excruciating, having people stare at me,
"Vega has admitted. "But I felt compelled to sing my songs.
There's something in me that says, "You may not like doing
this, but you have to do it, so quit fighting it."
<p>     By 1978 Vega had built up enough courage to sing in
Greenwich Village clubs frequented by folk-music devotees,
among them Gerde's Folk City, where Bob Dylan had made his
professional debut. Praise from other club performers boosted
Vega's confidence, and she relished the feeling of camaraderie
that emerged when she joined their songwriting discussions or
sessions in which they bounced ideas off one another. "For the
first time in my life, I found a scene I was happy in," she
disclosed to Anthony Scaduto. " I belonged there ... I fit
in."
<p>     In 1979 Vega attended a concert that proved to be pivotal
in the evolution of her career. The artist was Lou Reed, the
so-called godfather of American punk rock. "His performance
and his songs shocked me, disturbed me," Vega told Scaduto.
"He was the first performer I had ever seen who had
acknowledged the lifestyle I grew up in, difficult
neighborhoods and people who are violent. His performance kept
seeping into my mind and I bought a couple of his records. I
realized I could write songs about things I experienced. The
subways, the streets, lonely people, damaged people. I began
to see that I could be a contemporary folk singer, maybe
opening another chapter. Mix in some other influences like
jazz in the music and minimalism in the lyrics,... Fuse folk
and minimalism Lou Reed made the link in my mind." Through her
study of Reed's work she also realized, she has said, that
there is no need to tell "the whole story" in a song, or even
to "make logical sense."
<p>     After graduating from Barnard College, with a BA degree
in English, in 1982, Vega got a daytime job as a receptionist.
Her concert schedule grew increasingly crowded, and growing
numbers of people began coming to Greenwich Village nightspots
to hear her. In a review for the New York Times [September 28,
1984] of one of her sets at Folk City, Stephen Holden wrote,
"The freshest and clearest new voice on the New York folk-
music scene these days belongs to Suzanne Vega... [She] has
the pristine enunciation and ringing, acoustic guitar style
that make her an heir to the folk-pop tradition of Joan Baez,
Judy Collins, and Joni Mitchell. But the introverted, diamond-
hard imagery of her song lyrics, many of which describe New
York's street life with a photographic objectivity, and her
trancelike melodies that favor the whole-tone scale also
reflect new-wave and Eastern influences.
<p>     Earlier, while performing in 1981 at the Speakeasy,
another Greenwich Village club where songwriters gathered,
Vega had attracted the attention of Steve Addabbo and Ronald
K. Fierstein, who had just formed a musical management
partnership. [One source reported that the men approached her
after hearing a radio broadcast of a recording made as a
cooperative venture by Vega and other Village musicians.] With
Addabbo and Fierstein serving as her managers, during the next
year she completed the production of a demo tape. In 1983 she
landed a contract with A&M Records, which had turned her down
twice before. Two years later a collection of ten of her
songs, among them "Cracking", "Marlene on the Wall", "Small
Blue Thing", "The Queen and the Soldier", and "Neighborhood
Girls", was released as Suzanne Vega, her first album.
<p>     Critics greeted the album enthusiastically. "[Vega]
emerges as the strongest, most decisively shaped songwriting
personality to come along in years," John Rockwell wrote in a
New York Times [April 14, 1985] review, in which he called the
album "a major achievement". In New York Newsday [May 7,
1985], Wayne Robins described it as "one of 1985's most
satisfying debuts, a varied yet firmly reined tour de force
that puts in sharp focus Vega's multiple assets." "[Vega] is a
masterfully economical and literate lyricist whose piercing
images repeatedly strike an emotional bull's-eye." he
continued. "She's a gifted melodist and an instinctively
clever singer whose voice veers, when appropriate, from
aloofness to intimacy. Vega's strength is in lean, provocative
imagery and unlikely but dazzling metaphors."
<p>     In a review of Suzanne Vega for Esquire [November 1985],
Sarah Crighton wrote, "With wit, grace, intelligence, and an
honestly cruel edge, [Vega] skates past the pitfalls of folk
music. While she is often found in the stranglehold of love,
she watches herself with irony and unflinching insight.
Underneath her cool detachment lies a heat that comes from
burrowing beyond defenses to see what lies in her heart and
her mind. What Vega finds there is startling, distinctive,
true." Much to the surprise of A&M executives, who had
anticipated selling 30,000 albums, about 250,000 copies of
Suzanne Vega were sold in the United States and more than
500,000 abroad [In England, "Marlene on the Wall" became a hit
single]. In its November 1989 issue, Rolling Stone included
the album in its list of the one hundred best albums of the
1980s.
 <p>    Two months after the release of her first album, Vega
gave her first live performance with a band. By 1987 her
entourage for concert tours to Japan, Australia, and European
countries as well as cities in the United States had swelled
to more than a dozen people in addition to her four backup
musicians. At such prestigious sites as Royal Albert Hall, in
London, Carnegie Hall and Radio City Music Hall, in New York
City, and Constitution Hall, in Washington D.C., among many
other venues, over the years she has performed before
unusually varied audiences. In GQ [December 1987], for
example, Stephen Fried reported that those in attendance at
one of her concerts included "everyone from reticent women's-
college students to dyed-in-the-wool-blend professional
couples to mainstream rock and rollers."
 <p>    According to an article in Esquire [December 1987],
"Anyone who has ever heard Vega perform speaks most of the
focus and determination, the sheer power of will she brings to
the stage." In Jam Entertainment News [September 18. 1992],
Craig Michaels wrote that "in concert, she's simply
spellbinding, combining superb musicianship with a real flair
for entertaining - not just performing, mind you, but
entertaining." Reviewers of her concerts have often mentioned
her funny banter, avoidance of histrionics and rock-and-roll
flash, demure bearing, and highly distinctive voice. When Bill
DeMain asked her during an interview for the Performing
Songwriter [May/June 1984] how she had developed her singing
style, Vega responded that even as a youngster, she had
"preferred voices that were very direct ... very
straightforward," citing as examples those of Leonard Cohen,
Lou Reed, and Lotte Lenya. "So that's what I tried to do. I
just tried to make my voice come out in the simplest way
possible."
<p>     In 1986 Vega wrote the lyrics for two pieces in the
composer Philip Glass's orchestral song cycle Songs for Liquid
Days, and she contributed "Left of Center", a song about a
nonconforming teenager, to the soundtrack of John Hughes's
film Pretty in Pink. The concept for "Left of Center", Vega
told Bill DeMain, grew out of the title phrase itself. In
addition to random words and phrases, her observations of
people and events in urban settings, and her own experiences
and ruminations, she has said that her sources of inspiration
in songwriting include, nursery rhymes, children's street
games, bits of information she comes across and medical and
scientific textbooks. She has also said that early on she
chose to write in short phrases because she wanted "to do
something different that was more urban" and "to write like a
good writer, to the point and punchy in words that were
vivid". "Those shorter phrases seemed to hit harder," she
explained to Bill DeMain. "They were more satisfying to sing.
"She told DeMain that she believes that in developing her
writing style, she was also unconsciously accommodating her
asthma-related inability to hold long notes.
 <p>    By her own account, for much of the latter half of 1985
and at least part of 1986, Vega experienced writer's block,
which, in conversation with Vivian Goldman of the London
Observer [May 17, 198?], she attributed to a loss of
confidence. "Success threw me for a loop", she explained; "I
hadn't expected it." The release of Solitude Standing (1987),
her second album, provided ample evidence that Vega's creative
juices had resumed flowing vigorously. Offering a richer
musical accompaniment than its predecessor, it hit the pop
charts in Great Britain at number two and, in the United
States, reached number eleven on Billboard's album chart and
number six on its compact-disc chart. Ultimately, more than
three million copies of the album were purchased worldwide.
Critics as well as record buyers expressed admiration for
Solitude Standing. In a representative assessment, Eric Pooley
described it as "a thing of great beauty" and the songs, with
the exception of a couple of older ballads, as "modernist,
point-of-view pieces, pored-down character studies a world
away from the whiny, confessional songs of seventies singer-
songwriters." "Vega's work manages to be both detached and
passionate," he wrote, "coolly observed moments of deep
emotion or isolation."
<p>     In addition to the title song, Solitude Standing offered
such popular Vega works as "Wooden Horse (Caspar Hauser's
Song)," "Ironbound/Fancy Poultry", "Calypso", "Language",
"Gypsy", and what may be her best-known songs to date - "Luka"
and "Tom's Diner". In "Tom's Diner", she presented, in an a
capella prose poem, a succession of images described by a
patron who has come to the diner for breakfast. The song
inspired various musical groups to create their own
renditions, one of which, an unauthorized hip-hop dance remix
by the British rappers DNA, became a worldwide hit. In 1991
A&M released DNA's version, along with those of other groups
from around the world, in a collection entitled Tom's Diner.
"I was pleased that "Tom's Diner" did what it did, because
suddenly all these black kids in the neighborhood where I grew
up in New York were listening to my songs", Vega once
commended.
   <p>  Vega has said that she wrote "Luka" after pondering the
idea for the song for months. An elliptical tale of child
abuse set to a disarmingly cheerful melody (arranged for the
most part by the keyboardist Anton Sanko), it is a monologue
sung by the young, eponymous victim. The child attempts to
deny and rationalize his situation and to keep at bay the
suspicions of neighbors who may have seen his bruises or heard
sounds of violence emanating from his family's apartment. "I
didn't want "Luka" to be a self-pitying song about a boy
sitting on a stoop feeling miserable", Vega told Anthony
Scaduto. "That kid had a dignity, as kids do, and that's what
I wanted to come out. The strength, the backbone... All I
wanted to do was reveal his point of view. [The song is]
unresolved, frustrating, like it is in real life. By leaving
it ambiguous, it makes people think twice about it."
  <p>   During her conversation with Bill DeMain, Vega described
another aspect of her approach in writing "Luka": "The
audience in the song is the neighbor. So it was kind of
writing a play. First of all, how do you introduce the
character? You do that by saying, 'My name is Luka. I live on
the second floor.' And then you get the audience involved,
saying, "I live upstairs from you. So you've seen me before.'
You're incriminating the audience. You're pointing the finger
without really doing it. You're unfolding this story that
can't really be told and you're involving the audience in it
and that was what I wanted to do."
 <p>    Despite the seriousness and discomforting nature of its
subject matter, "Luka" became a hit single in many countries,
including the United States, where it received Grammy
nominations for record of the year and song of the year; Vega
herself was nominated in the category of the best female
vocalist. "Luka" also earned single-of-the-year and song-of-
the-year honors at the 1987 New York Music Awards (at which
Vega was also named artist of the year and best folk artist
and Solitude Standing named best pop album). In New York
Newsday [October 18, 1987], Wayne Robins credited the song's
popularity to its universality. Indeed, the black-and-white
"Luka" video, shows not a child but a woman, portrayed by
Vega, as the victim of abuse.
  <p>   Vega collaborated with Anton Sanko to produce her third
album, Days of Open Hand (1990). During its production she
tried to learn more about "the way songs work." she revealed
to Wayne Robins in New York Newsday [April 17, 1990]. "And I
found my voice would go as far as I could push it. I found all
new ranges, low parts, and high parts, I even sang with some
vibrato. It's a strange thing to feel the music in my body as
opposed to just in my mind. She has also been quoted as saying
that she intended the songs on the album to "give a sense of
resolving the past and looking to the future."
  <p>   While critical reaction to Days of Open Hand ranged from
glowing to dismissive, the reception accorded 99.9 F (1992),
Vega's most recent album, was overwhelmingly favorable.
Working for the first time with Mitchell Froom, who produced
99.9 F, Vega entered a new musical domain, "hopscotch[ing]
from industrial rock to girl-group pop to dreamy psychedelia,"
as Stephanie Zacharek reported in the Boston Phoenix
[September 11, 1992]. In a conversation with Laura Lee Davies
for the British magazine Time Out [August 12-19, 1992], Vega
explained her willingness to try what she termed "jumping off
musical cliffs". "I guess a lot of things in my life had
changed", she said. "Some long-term relationships had broken
up in the last year, and I was working without my usual band.
That added to the feeling of recklessness". She has also
attributed her openness to musical experimentation in
"relax[ing] ... and allow[ing] more of [her] personality to
come out."
    <p> Vega clearly illustrated the complexity of her
personality in 99.9 F. In his Jam Entertainment News Review,
Craig Michaels wrote that the twelve cuts on the album - which
include such highly praised songs as "Rock in this Pocket
(Song of David)", "Blood Makes Noise", "In Liverpool", "Fat
Man and Dancing Girl", "(If you were) In My Movie", "As Girls
Go", "Blood Sings" and the title song "run the gamut from
introspection to tribute to nightmarish absurdity", and Vega,
he added, "is successful in each of these poetic forays.""What
wasn't expected," Michaels continued, "and what contributes
heavily to this masterpiece, is the production lent the tunes
by Mitchell Froom. Not only did he obviously understand the
emotions Vega wishes to convey, he took each subtle nuance and
expounded upon it, making this a collection of twelve
brilliant little aural paintings. Much like [the Beatles']
Sgt. Pepper['s Lonely Hearts Club Band] this album is a
tribute to the intensely personal commitment and understanding
an artist and producer have to share to get things just right.
With 99.9 F, Suzanne Vega has delivered what most musicians
can only dream about - a slice of perfection". 99.9 F won a
New York Music Award as the best rock album of 1992.
  <p>   "I'm reserved," Suzanne Vega once said. "But I'm not
timid." "Her wispy visage and lean graceful frame often leave
the impression of a fragile being," Marcia B. Merson wrote in
BSide [April/May 1993]. "Yet, Suzanne is nothing near fragile
in body, mind or spirit." Gary Graff of the New York Daily
News [July 19, 1987] described Vega as "tough-minded,
outspoken, humorous, and direct." "She is surprisingly
articulate." according to Anthony Scaduto. "Interviewing many
pop music personalities is like driving through fog, but Vega
is direct, unambiguous, candid." Vega, who lives in a loft in
lower Manhattan, was romantically involved with the folk
singer Frank Christian and, some years later, with Anton
Sanko; her current companion is Mitchell Froom.
