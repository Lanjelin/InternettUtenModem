<p>
So, How many albums do you have?
<p>
Hi Suzanne, my name is Guillaume Lesage and I,m writing from Montreal.
<p>
I wanted to ask you if you ever thought of making a lulluby album for
childrens.  After your pregnancy, it would be very accurrate.
<p>
hi
<p>
What was the last album you listened to ?
<p>
Hi Suzanne, swell of you to take time out to talk to the little people 
<p>
Is there a person in your life who has dramatically changed your outlook
on life? Obviously Ruby and Mitchell, anyone else?
Hi Suzanne!!!!
<p>
Who are your musical influences?
<p>
I am a big fan of you
<p>
anyone home?
<p>
Hi Suzanne, my name is Guillaume Lesage and I,m writing
from Montreal.   any favorite Raffi songs? (just kidding) :)
<p>
Hi Suzanne...I am wondering about the chosen release date of "Nine
Objects of Desire".  Doesn't it seem strange that they are releasing it
the same week as two major releases and do you think it will hurt "Nine
Objects"?
<p>
How long did you work on this album? Was it too long?
<p>
Oh Francoise Hardy, it sounds French! :-)
<p>
Suzanne, do you ever get a writer's block and if yes, what do you do
about it?
<p>
Hi, Suzanne! I'm an italian fan. I'm waiting your last production
(tomorrow it comes, at the end...)I've heard some seconds of your new
songs downloading them from your web site. Seems like you wrote a mix of
easy-like songs and some rude, stronger tracks...more than in the past.
Is it right? 
<p>

Hi, my name is Keriann and this is very exciting for me to be "talking"
with you. I was wondering where you went when you left home at age 15
and why you left.
<p>
When you first started singing, how long did it take you to find "your
own" singing voice instead of trying to imitate others?
<p>
I  also read that you liked dancing on Les Negresses Vertes Music.  You
seem very interested in French culture.  Are you?
<p>
Hi Suzanne...I am wondering about the chosen release date
of "Nine Objects of Desire".  Doesn't it seem strange that they are
releasing it the same week as two major releases and do you think it
will hurt "Nine Objects"?
<p>
REM and Counting Crows
<p>
hello, it was quiet difficult to get here this java applet wouldn;t even
run on solaris 
<p>
Hello.. We are lonely back here in tech support.... Say Hi to us please?
<p>
Hi Suzanne,My name os David Mindel,Last year I Had to do  a yearwork
about you and your songs. First I didnt know you but now I love. I think
you got great songs My questions are: 1) How is Ruby doing, how old is
she,does she look like you?   2) The song bad wisdom is it about aids or
an unexpected pregnancy? Hope you'll answer me soon, thanks   David 
<p>
Would you say this album is packed with so-called 'experimental' music?
<p>
When you've played Toronto in the past, you've played Massey Hall, a
classic concert hall, and the Music Hall, a theatre converted into a
concert venue. This time you're playing in an old church. Why have you
decided to downscale your venues this time out to such small and
intimate places?
<p>
Hi Suzanne, I am wondering how you are writing songs. Are you building
the music around the words or the words around the music? How long does
it take for you to finish a song? Is it getting easier with the years?
<p>
Good answer :-)
<p>
Who are the guys?
<p>
I would like to know if wendy is wendy chapman?
<p>
I was concerned about releasing it in the fall with so many other
releases but the only alternative was waiting for January which I didn't
want to do.
<p>
What do you think sbout the prospects of doing live music over the net
such as real audio and house of blues's Liveconcerts.com site? Would you
ever like to see your music reach a worldwide audience live? 
<p>
January does seem like a bad time but perhaps just a few weeks from now?
<p>
Hi, my name is Keriann and this is very exciting
for me to be "talking" with you. I was wondering where you went when you
left home at age 15 and why you left.
<p>
a collective "Thank you" for not waitin until January!
<p>
How much do you think that videos have hurt or helped or not affected
you
<p>
hi suzy.  why the apple on the cover of the cd?
<p>
As for 99.9 F, will there be bonus track(s) on your last record
according to the country it is released? If so, where can I get 'Ten
Objects of desire' (or even more)?
<p>
REM and counting crows suck
<p>
suzy....what do you think about this whole internet craze?
<p>
Hi Suzanne...On your songwriting...do you come up with the "music" first
or the lyrics first ...or does it depend on each individual song..
<p>
Hi Suzanne, I was wondering about the apple... Is these some special
meaning about that?
<p>
Is there a place in the US where you love to play, or does a tour seem
like a blur of alot of the same places?
<p>
Hello Suzanne,I would like to first say Hello! I have been a fan of
yours for many years now (Since Solitude Standing) my question to you
is...Your music has changed from album to album... How would you decribe
the change in your current album to those in the past. Was your Child a
big influence???
<p>
I'm curious about your decision to change the band after "Days of open
hand". What about it?
<p>
Since Mitchell produces such a great set of people, do you ever feel
tempted to sit in, or try to arrange a collaboration? I'm thinking of
people like Neil Finn and Richard Thompson  (I love the solo to As Girls
Go) as examples of songwriters with similarities to yourself
<p>
Have you read any good books recently?
<p>
Hi Suzanne, Guillaume again...I want to know if you have ever made a
collaboration with Leonard Cohen (you two signing together I mean.)  If
yes, is there any recording of this.
<p>
Suzanne you say "that's where your audiance is. apparently."  Do you
agree with your manager that demographics are important or do you try
not to think about such things?
<p>
it's the third time we see wendy 
<p>
This whole fall will be packed with "major releases" -- that's just the
way it is until Christmas.
<p>
I was refurring to your poem "First day out", from which I got
theimpression that you were 15.  Would you explain. Sorry for the
mistake.
<p>
Why is it hard for folks to find the new single? Do you feel like
there's enough promo and support?
<p>
suzy...about the small venue thing.  it seems to be a trend.  dylan and
bowie both played this year in the same hall your playing in philly.
<p>
Hi Suzanne, I was wondering about the apple... Is these
some special meaning about that?
<p>
I live in Portugal (Lisbon) and i want to know when can i buy your CD in
Portugal
<p>
I have heard (on the mailinglist undertow) that you don't have your
America Online account anymore.Is this true? If yes, Did you give it up
because all the annoying fan mail? :)
<p>
Can you show my question pls
<p>
Do you generally have time to meet with fans after shows?  p.s. I will
be at Northampton, Mass :)
<p>
The "alternative" scene has recently moved closer to folk, with the
increased popularity of artists like Tracy Chapman and Jewel.  What do
you think of this trend, and what influence do you think it will have on
the music scene?
<p>
Are you catholic?
<p>
HELP ME
<p>
Hi! Any chance of seeing you in Finland on the forthcoming tour?
Please,  I really hope so!
<p>
That reminds me of my posted question, any thoughts on songs you would
do on a tribute album of songs you love?
<p>
If it's not the sin, what's the argument of "Nine objects.."? If there
is ONE...
<p>
In your song " The Queen & the soldier" Is there a special meaning to a
"secret burning thread"? If so, what is it???
<p>

<p>
Hi Suzanne, nice to do this. I'm from Amsterdam, Netherlands.  What is
the reason you are doin' this 
<p>
suzanne, I really want to know what do you think about all this internet
buisness thing.  You site, this chat, do you really enjoty it or it is
part of your work to promote an album.
<p>
What was your inspiration for "Calypso"?
<p>
thats fair
<p>
When do you come to the Netherlands?
<p>
While taking pictures of you at Newport I was going to call up to you
that "Undertow" loves you, would I have come off looking like a crazed
fan? :)
<p>
I guess we are many to wonder who are 'the guys behind me' you are
talking about to Wendy...
<p>
GOOD-evening  !  (please tell me Good-morning)
<p>
This is the simplest  question from JAPAN. Do you have a plan to held

<p>
Hi Suzanne. How do you feel about touring again ?
<p>

causes?  i was thinking about live aid, farm aid, the amnesty show, etc.
<p>
Please Show my Question
<p>
Your site is probably the best about a musician in the WWW; do you love
Internet? Do you use it often?
<p>
What is the Bad wisdom on your cover of 9 months
<p>
Did you watch much of anyone else at the Newport
Festival this year? 
<p>
I fell in love with your music while working in a factory, and the
"light rock" station played "Luka" 6 times a day during my 10 hour
shift.  Did the success of that song take you by surprise?
<p>
Hi. My name is Dan and I'm from Israel. I was wondering if there was a
chance that your european tour will include Israel. It has been a very
long time since we saw you.
<p>
You said that you wanted a plum for your album cover but they were out
of season.  If the apple means nothing to you, what does the plum
represent in your imjagination?
<p>
I love you
<p>
Will you be coming through Dallas,Tx at some point in the tour?
<p>
What a sad argument it is, Suzanne... You talk about death after an
experience of life...Ruby
<p>
Will "Woman on a Tier" ever show up on any of your Releases.... If so,
Which one????
<p>
Wendy chapman?
<p>
Suzanne...How do you think you have changed as a performer in the last
couple of years? What are your goals as a performer? and why do you do
it?
<p>
Have you seen the Web Site lately and what are your impressions of it?

<p>

<p>
Will you have the same band that you toured with on the 99.9 shows? 
<p>
Say thanx from me to the guy that wrote this nifty Java Applet. And
thanx to you for this session.
<p>
I wonder, from that list, it seems you do have all that. What is it that
you really want but don't have?
<p>
Is Ruby an Angelic little baby all of the time?  (My son Noah just hit
the Terrible two's)
<p>
Hello Suzanne! Will you be giving any concerts in The Netherlands?
<p>
What is the thing you Desire???
<p>
I don't understand the word "argument" that is being thrown around.  Do
you think that there is something you are trying to "argue" in "Nine
Objects" or "express"?
<p>
And what's out of reach in Suzanne life?
<p>
What's the meaning of the song Carame? Is it about Dietl
<p>
Do you feel a sensible difference between European and American public ?
<p>
you have often commented at concerts that crowds can be the sit down
type or the dance in the isles kind. Which concert mood do you prefer?
<p>
seems like lots of people would like to see you live but can't due to
geography.  how about a video from the tour? or a live CD? or letting
people tape at the show? :)
<p>
John Cooperider : I think the husband often thinks he is going to
die (or get killed) in the delivery room!
<p>
You seem to be a person who defies Stereotype....Does it bother you when
some tries to Catagorize your music??
<p>
jerry garcia thought there was some kind of energy that flowed between
the band and the crowd at shows.  ever feel that?
<p>
How did you do in highschool - I am especially interested in English and
Math?
<p>
Mariah Carey hasn't figured out how to move on stage either...
<p>
What do you think about Soul Coughing naming their album after Ruby,and
how well do you know them?
<p>
What inspired the song "Solitude Standing"?
<p>
What comes first, the lyrics or the music?
<p>
ever feel like the people dancing in the audience somehow add to the
whole experience? 
<p>
How would you describe yourself (not as a fruit hehe) in an emotional
sense.  Are you a very emotional person?
<p>
In THe song bad Wisdom we have trouble to understand the theme of the
song? Can you explain it PLease?
<p>
Do you plan to ever have another child?and if so what would you name
him/her?
<p>
Which instrument do you play to compose ? Only the guitar ?
<p>
Terrible in Algebra......not strange for you! You have always a
personals equation about problems..
<p>
Are you happy with the US tour dates as currently scheduled?  
<p>
Your album will be released tomorrow (today actually...) in France,
where I live, but not before January in UK which is 2 hours far from
here.  Have you been given by A&M any good reason which may console my
jealous English friends?
<p>
Maria McKee's 'Life is Sweet' reminded me a lot of '99.9F', as it plays
around with arrangements to folk and roots melodies. Do you feel a
tension between the simple beginnings of a song, say on acoustic guitar
or piano, and all the possibilities offered by the studio? Worried by
the thought of over-producing something?
<p>
From jimmy :    :)
<p>
Some of your singles have non-album or live tracks. About how many
performances do you have "in the can" that have not been released?  Do
you have recordings of songs you wish were released? 
<p>
How about a special fan-club album?
<p>
Do you feel Ruby has a musical perception....? If blood is not
water.....
<p>
Please it's late in Portugal and i want to know when the record is out
in Portugal
<p>
How are the anecdotes coming?
<p>
will you be signing autographs at the record appearances?  i'd love to
be able to say hi.  :) 
<p>
Do you like going on tours? Or do you find it just "part of the job"?
<p>
You sing of life experiences.....is there an experience you would like
to write a song for but have had difficulty Expressing it through
song????  If so, What experience???
<p>
can i take you to dinner when your in philly?
<p>
On "a wonderful energy" of performing ... I can relate, I am a musician
also...That feeling is better than anything ... even better than sex ! 
<p>
would'nt you say?
<p>
larryt  So you do not really enjoy touring?  Does that aspect of life as
a musician/parent take a real toll?
<p>
From Aribeiro :Please it's late in Portugal and i want to know when the
<p>
record is out in Portugal
<p>
Will Ruby come with you during the European tour ?  how
is ruby? does she like to sing?
<p>
What commercial expectations do you have of "Nine Objects"?
<p>
Do you need a babysitter?!?
<p>
Thanks Suzanne (don't need to respond) :-)
<p>
Just think of all the new tricks and abilities Ruby will learn while on
the road... Her options are limitless!  Heehee
<p>
From Dan :Do you like going on tours? Or do you find it just "part of
the job"?
<p>
Do you have a particular performance that you remember that was "right
on" ... that was like wow!!!  ?
<p>
What do you make of the UK release date?  What made A&M decide to
release it there months from now?
<p>
I'm sitting here wondering if this is working on my end.
<p>
What's the aspect of being an artist you like best?
Recording?  Composing?  etc.
<p>
Can I have your autograph?  
<p>
For Days of Open Hand, there was a lot of planning that went into set
design and all that.  Will there be any of that for this album?
<p>
what do you like best about touring....What type of audience do you
enjoy most???
<p>
What was the last book you read?
<p>
do you play the small clubs like 'tramps' in NYC?
<p>
I don't understand why the European part of your tour will be so short. 
<p>
I think you will only spend one night in Paris in October and I fear you
are already sold out.
<p>
I saw you on the Days tour in Michigan and you seemed to really enjoy
it?!   Seemed more at ease than when I saw you here in Connecticut for
99.9
<p>
Are there plans for another Latin Playboys CD?
<p>
I you were forced to choose a favorite song and album (from your works)
which would they be and why?
<p>
Please come to Belgium soon !
<p>
Thank you for taking time to chat with us... this is a real treat! Are
you going to do it again in the future?
<p>
Seems like I'm the only italian guy on line with you...I'm very proud
about it, but I feel ther's something wrong in it..
<p>
did you hear the new mickey hart cd he did with the mint julips? in case
your looking for some inspiration.....
<p>
Why do you want to make political songs ? Would you consider writing a
song about how much you love Al Gore?  Why do you find it hard to write
love & political sogs? is it because you feel too strongly about the
issus?
<p>
Do you hate when "private goes public"? Are you shy or very reserved?
<p>
What makes love songs so hard? Other performing artists think that these
songs are easy money.
<p>
You wrote a marvelous love song in "The Queen and the Soldier" btw,
tears my heart apart every time...
<p>
don't bother with political songs.  try writing about peace.
<p>
Would you like to come over for dinner sometime?
<p>
Do you expect Ruby to become a musician too?
<p>
How do you get paid? Per Album sale or does A&M give you 1 million up
front or how does that work? Certainly not by the hour? 
<p>
speaking of neighborhood. still like living in the city? 
<p>
Has Ruby shown any sign of a talent for music yet?  Are you the sort of
parent who would 'encourage' her to take piano lessons? :-)
<p>
is there anything we can do to help bring the people out to see the
shows.
<p>
I know that many are making great efforts to make it to a concert this
tour.  I know that I am travelling, and I just saw you at Newport!  
<p>
How much is living in New York connected to your music? Would you
consider moving  somewhere else? 
<p>
What type of set will you give ? More acoustic and intimate ?
<p>
Newport's audience really seemed to get into your set.  Did you feel it
went over well?
<p>
I think there is a great demand for a video compilation of all your
videos (at least among undertowers).  Any plans? If not - does it help
to push right now and here? :)
<p>
Are you doing this chat session as part of the promotion of "Nine
Objects", or since the Undertowers have prob all got the album already,
are you doing this just to talk to us? :)
<p>
What music were you listening to before you came here tonight?
<p>
food for thought.......i think you are one of those folks that are
really great to see live. most people don't know that about you.  you
might be one of those type of people that people have to see in order to
'get it'.  maybe you should do a tour with one someone with a huge
draw.  more folks would get to see you and probably become hooked...
<p>
will you ever perform with Sarah Mclachlan again? and what is your
relationship with her? 
<p>
If you had to pick a singer to do a duet with, who would it be?
<p>
I've found many people thinking that you, Tanita Tikaram and Tracy
Chapman are, more or less, the same artist.  I engage a battle with
them. You too? 
<p>
Would you like to play in a movie ?
<p>
you would have done great on the 'further' tour this past summer
<p>
Will that spring tour in europe include a show in Israel???
<p>
Touching Italy, I hope....
<p>
What do you listen to most at home (recent releases)?
<p>
My birthday is this month, just thought I would mention that a signed
copy of Nine Objects would go very well next to my new copy!  :) :) :)  
<p>
p.s. I am turning 30, a fairly traumatic b-day  btw
<p>
When you are touring, do you have some spare times to go and visit the
citys where you are playing?
<p>
the deadheads would love you. their looking for some new heros.
<p>
A big European tour. What a great idea !!
<p>
Do you accept dinner invitations from nice fans in Utah?
<p>
What do you think of your competition? Are they taking away your
market-share or are they colleagues that help in the popularization of
your kind of repertoire?
<p>
how do you feel about this chat thing?  like hearing from the fans?
<p>
I am a biologist....It's not so great....Drums are better, believe me!
<p>
A marine biologist!!!!    i''m going to start my masters in marine
affairs this january.  :)
<p>
i've been scuba diving for years.  in the last 10 years or coral reefs
are dying.  i'm trying to help save them.  could you help?
<p>
Woo! Once a month, a chat session. :)
<p>
feel like helping to save the coral reefs so that ruby will have
something to study when she grows up?
<p>
Are you chatting for more than an hour? Do you find the time to be a
tourist when you travel? ...And if you do where are your favorite
places?
<p>
Are you doing this chat session as part of the promotion of "Nine
Objects", or since the Undertowers have prob all got the album already,
are you doing this just to talk to us? :)
<p>
Do you love nature ? Or are you dependant from a big town ?
<p>
FYI remo makes a great live of drums for kids.  they are covered with
pictures of tropical sea life on them.
<p>
Do you think that your online experiences will ever be the inspiration
for a song???
<p>
During these years, has your work becomed more a "work" than a passion?
Or is it still a "passion" more than a work,for you?
<p>
Many musicians are coming out with cd-roms  do you have any plans to
release one
<p>
we love you suzanne!  :)  :)  :)
<p>
<pop> Coop opens the champagne!  Nine Objects is here!!!
<p>
Sure, Suzanne! A celebration with your friends....Yes, it is  :)
<p>
suzanne,i am certainly looking forward to hearing the latest album from
such an accomplished writer and musician.  Good luck with your tour and
family!
<p>
As for 'Private Goes Public', for instance, on '99.9 F', will there be
bonus tracks on '9 Objects Of Desire'?  
<p>
did your tour to europe include Portugal?Thank you !
<p>
hey I'm a biologist too and it's excellent! :P~~~  although drums are
quite kewl as well...
<p>
But why are you talking to us?  A lot of musicians would not do such a
thing.  You are the only artist that I know that is taking to fans after
a show!
<p>
Thanks you for this session!
<p>
Great job, Interport!   
<p>
Thank you Suzanne, It's been a pleasure!!!
<p>
thank you Suzanne
<p>
Thank you!
<p>
there is this great festival taking place in key west in december. it's
run by a group called 'reef relief'. you would be great there. might
give ruby a great chance to 'tune into' what's going on under the
