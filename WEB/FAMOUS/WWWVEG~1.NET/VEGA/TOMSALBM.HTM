I have several different Tom's Albums that I found in the stores.  I have the
American CD and Vinyl and also I have the British import on vinyl--no
difference--I just collect everything!  When it first came out, it was widely
available in stores--at least here in LA it was.  I bet it can be ordered,
however.

yep. bingo hand job was what r.e.m. (and some assorted friends including
billy bragg, peter holsapple and robyn hitchcock) called themselves for
two shows they did at the borderline in london following the release of
_out of time_ in 1991.

Minor trivia bit for those who might just be fanatical about musical
acts other than Suzanne; it turns out that "Bingo Hand Job" is in fact
REM in disguise.

Subj:	*Toms diner on Untamed Heart*<br>

**hi everyone**,<br>
<p>                        i have a simple question. on 'untamed heart',a film
starring christian slater around 1992, i know for a fact that 'tom's diner'
was played, right at he sttart of the movie, but it had a soundtrack/music
to it, and when i bought the 'solitude standing' cd, i was very suprised to
see THAT t-diner was just her voice.
<p>
        is the 'untamed heart' t-diner one of those mixes you all talk
about, or what? i remember that it got quite a bit of air-play where i am,
(Tasmania, Australia :)
<p>
        also, if there is a greatest hits i would definetly recommend the
one with the beat to it, tho as a fan, i probably find the other more
haunting etc (like that bit about 'sometime/before the rain began...') but
hey, theese are the concessions you make for a Top 40 Cd hey! also, i think
the other is very catchy too.
<p>
                        regards, david.

Dave,
<p>
The Untamed Heart "Tom's Diner" was the DNA version that we all talk about.
 I got a little chuckle when you said you bought the cd and it only had the
acappella version on it becuase I had a friend who did exactly the same thing
and then was angry because she's the type that only likes dance music and
found nothing on the album to suit her tastes.  She's also the type who
doesn't have the patience to listen closely to the music and be open to
something different--otherwise--like all of us, she might have found
something extreemly interesting in the lyrics of Suzanne Vega.

After the recent discussion about the Tom's Album I was so curious that I
bought it today. While many of the mixes are not my taste I love the album.
I find it to be creative and it is kind of a tangent to the Undertow covers
concept brought up earlier.
