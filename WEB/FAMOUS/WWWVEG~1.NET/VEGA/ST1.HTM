<h2>Suzanne Vega's Book of Dreams</h2>

<p>
     "All the mysteries of life come in A minor," Suzanne Vega said, curled up
on a couch in Hollywood.  It was a statement she first made to the guys in
her band who were urging her to use more chords in her songs.  Not wanting
to "antagonize" them, she's been working to stretch her songs lately,
harmonically and melodically, despite her faith in the omnipotence of A
minor.  It's a struggle that she's come up against frequently, wanting to
write the songs that move her, that express the mysteries of life as she
sees it, but still wanting to please other people.  "I'd like to be a poet,"
she said with a smile, "as long as I still get to mingle in society."<p>
     When she was on tour in Texas, she shocked a record company executive
by telling her she wanted to go shopping.  "I'm so glad you're a regular
girl!" the lady said happily.  From Suzanne's sometimes somber image and
serious songs, people wrongly assume she doesn't indulge in life's
lighter pleasures.  She admitted to drinking a milkshake right before
walking over, and even to eating meat on occasion.  "I have a reputation
for being pacifistic, vegetarian, Buddhist, and frail," she said, smiling,
"and it's not like that at all."<p>
     She wanted to be an artist since she was a kid, and studied dance
at New York's High School for the Performing Arts.  She soon realized,
though, that it was the music and not the movement that mattered most
to er, and refocused her energies on being a musician.  "I started to
realize it was the music that made me want to dance," she said.  "The whole
day depended on what the pianist was playing.  And I got along with the
guys who played piano better than anyone.  All my instincts were moving
me towards music, even though all my training was in dance.  When I was 17
I gave up dance for good."<p>
     From the very beginning, songwriting was not something she took
lightly, spending three years writing her first song.  She was inspired
by artists like Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez, both by their music
and by the spirit they represented.  "These people had a very mystic
significance to society.  It wasn't that they were just pop stars.  They
had an almost religious responsibility...I wanted to be one of these
people who had that responsibility.  I wanted to join them."<p>
     Her first effort in that direction was written for her brother Matthew
and called "Brother Mine," and began with the line "Sonny boy, you need new
sneakers, I guess we'd better go into town and get them Friday night."  She
taught herself to play the guitar by learning the chords to songs in sixties
songbooks, such as "The Girl From Ipanema."<p>
     But when people asked her to sing out loud, she would shrink with
terror, an experience that almost kept her from music permanently.  "I
just wilted.  'Sing out loud, are you crazy?'  I was very shy and with-
drawn.  I couldn't do it.  These big guys with their big stomachs singing,
'Barbara Allen.'  I wasn't into it."<p>
     But she couldn't deny the thrill she felt singing into a microphone
for the first time, an experience she described as "intoxicating."  She
realized that she could sing as softly as she liked and still be heard,
and it was a style of delivery that suited her songs.  After a few years
of failing to get any gigs, in time she fell in with the crowd at Folk
City in New York's Greenwich Village and began performing regularly.<p>
     Hearing Lou Reed transformed her ideas about Songwriting:  "I started
feeling I could be experimental.  You could write a song with no chorus
or melody.  All the restraints were off."  Besides writing songs, she spent
a lot of time thinking about her image, and devoutly documenting the
minutiae of her performances.  "I had this little notebook where I would
enter in where I played," she recalled, "the name of the gig, the songs
I played, how I did my hair, what I was wearing, how many people were in
the audience, what the response was, how much money I made.  I had a mailing
list, and I would design the flyers.  And I liked all of that, all the
business-like aspects of that."<p>
     In time she realized that music mattered more than all other concerns
and she devoted all of her energy to singing and songwriting.  She sang
her songs in a gentle, unforced manner, wanting to capture the easy spirit
of children spontaneously making up songs.  She relased her first album
in 1985, called <i>Suzanne Vega</i>.  It was one of the most warmly received
records of that year, featuring powerful, poetic songs like "Marlene On
The Wall" and "Freeze Tag" and pristine, acoustic-based production.  The
sound of the album was gently wrapped around the voice and guitar, warmly
and elegantly supporting the songs without overwhelming them.  It wasn't,
however, the sound that she had in mind, as she explains in the following
conversation.<p>
     Though much criticial attention was garnered on her first album,
it was a song from her second album called "Luka" that really introduced
her to the world.  She had written it years before but didn't feel it
was ready to record.  A dark song with a light, even happy melody, "Luka"
managed to touch on child abuse in the gentlest way possible, written
from the perspective of a child who has learned to not say too much.  Like
one of Randy Newman's character songs, it's powerful for what is left
unsaid.  The song became a Top Five hit and Suzanne an artist known the
world over.<p>
     Having such enormous commercial success with such an uncommercial
theme made life confusing for her.  When a song like "Luka" becomes a hit,
what does one write next?  "You start to think that you have some control
over this," she said.  "You write 'Luka' and it becomes a hit, and you
think, 'Maybe I could make a living at this.'"<p>
     At about the same time that album was released, an English dance
group called DNA released a bootleg remix of "Tom's Diner," the opening
and closing song from her second album.  This version added a mighty dance
rhythm under what was originally an a capella vocal, and the contrast of
the two jived brilliantly.  When Suzanne first heard it, she said she
wasn't sure whether DNA should be sued or congratulated.  She chose the
latter, and her record company, A&M, officially released the record along
with other bootleg recordings of the same song that started to emerge, sung
in many tongues and styles, from German disco to Jamaican reggae.<p>
     If any song was less commercial than "Luka," it would have to be "Tom's
Diner."  She said, "After 'Tom's Diner' and the freak thing that happened
with that, I just thought, 'I give up.  I'm not even gonna try anymore.
I'm just gonna do what feels right.'"<p>
     What felt right was to write the songs that wanted to be written,
ambitious works such as "Men In A War," which revolves around the idea of
a phantom limb, and "Predictions," a lexicon of fortune telling techniques.
She also wrote one called "Book of Dreams" which, unlike Jack Kerouac's
book of the same title, is not a collection of dreams that have passed,
but dreams of the future.  "Yes, the future," she said, "things to come.
That was a theme I found emerging from a lot of my songs.  Songs... about
leaving the past..."  These songs became the foundation for her third album,
<i>Days Of Open Hand</i>.<p>
     We met up with her months after the release of <i>Days of Open Hand</i>.  She
was in the midst of thinking about her next move, and wanting to musically
expand her writing.  We spoke for a long time, during which she delved 
deeply into her ideas about being a songwriter, and how to be selective
about the voices one listens to during the rush of creation.  Afterwards
we took a walk down Hollywood Boulevard, a constant circus of manic
humanity that she took in pensively from behind rose-colored shades, slipping
quickly and easily through the throng.<p>

     <b>SongTalk:</b>  <i>Bob Dylan said poets don't drive cars.  You don't drive, do
you?</i><p>
     <b>Suzanne Vega:</b>  [<i>Laughs</i>]  Well, that's because I grew up in New York
City where you don't really need one.  Although I was considering today
maybe I should learn.  Yeah.  For a sense of freedom.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>Do you think of yourself as a poet?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  That's always a tricky question because I love poetry and I would
love for my songs to be as poetry.  But the word 'poetry' has all these
strange connotations of preciousness and aloofness.  I love words and I
love what they do and I love poetry.  I'd like to be a poet.<p>
     I get my inspirations from things that are very ordinary and not
precious at all, like children's nursery rhymes, and games that kids play
in the street.  Things that I had played as a child; sing-song rhymes and
rhythms that you make up to amuse yourself while you're jumping rope, or if
you're teasing sombody else.  To me it's all one and the same.  As a child
we had things that we played, and that's where I first got a sense of
words, what they were about.<p>
     But I also use other things.  Medical textbooks, science textbooks.
Pieces of information.  Wherever I can get information.  Whatever rings
true to me is where I'll find it.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>Your songs are often very ambitious, sometimes concerning something
quite abstract, such as "Small Blue Thing."  Do you ever find that you
can't put across an idea in a song?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  It depends how you go for it.  I usually don't start out with
the idea of being abstract.  I usually, honestly, try to be as simple and
clear and as straight-forward as I can.  A lot of people say [<i>laughs</i>], "Oh
yeah?  Why don't you just say what you mean?"  I honestly am trying to say
what I mean, it's just that the things I'm writing tend to be really dense.
I think, because of my childhood experiences, that my perspective is<p>
somewhat unusual, maybe.  So I'm coming at it from a different perspective.
     So to me, "Today I am a small blue thing" is a very straight-forward
statement.  Whereas other people are saying, "If she loves the guy, why
doesn't she just say so?"<p>
     Sometimes I pull it off and I'll sing them for a while and they just
won't hit the mark for me.  To me, "Cracking" really hit the nail on the
head.  "Small Blue Thing" hit the nail on the head, and "Luka" hit the nail
on the head.  But other ones didn't.  "Marlene On The Wall" always seemed
a little wide of mark, somehow.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>That's surprising to hear, because it's such a great song.</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  [<i>Laughs</i>]  Well, it's accessible and people do like it, but for
me, personally, inside myself, I feel I had something in mind, and I kind
of did it, it was stylish, it was interesting, but I didn't feel it was
quite the bulls-eye that some of the others were.<p>
     The idea of using a poster as a reference point is a very pop idea.
It's a song about Marlene Dietrich.  You kind of get that from it, or it's
a song about a relationship.  As opposed to "Today I am a small blue thing"
in which some people think I'm speaking in code, or it's a riddle they have
to break.  It's more like "Let's pretend," like a kid's game.  If you were
a small blue thing, what would you be?  Well, you'd be like a marble or
an eye.  It's pretty straight-forward.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>It's a straight-forward way of expressing a feeling.  But that's
something people don't often manage to express in songs--</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b> [<i>Laughter</i>]  I love songwriting.  To me, there's all these elements
that are mixed into it, of magic, spells and prayers... as I said before,
children's games... science... I like to bring all these things together
so it's all one.  You can draw from any source.<p>
     <b>ST:</b> <i> Your song "Predictions" lists things with which you can tell
fortunes, and some of them I've never heard of, yet they have a magical
resonance.</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  To me they did, also.  That's why I left the song the way it was.
Some people don't like it because it's inconclusive:  "What happens?  Nothing
happens.  It's a list.  How can she sit there and sing a list?  I don't like
it."  [<i>Laughs</i>]  But to me, just the images as they are, are fine.  That's
what it is.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Each image has its own
beautiful space.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>Do you have literal meanings for all those images?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  In my mind, they were all clear.  I was looking up a word in
the thesaurus, and these were listed in the footnotes of a certain section.
Each one of those has its own name, some kind of 'ology' goes along with it.
Telling the future by mice.  There's a name for that.  [<i>Laughs</i>]  Telling
the future by dice has its own name, and by ashes and by the rays of the
sun... But there was something about the way that it was listed.<p>
     I rearranged it.  I didn't use all of them.  I only used the ones that
had that special resonance to me.  Then I rearranged it so it would sing
right.<p>
     People go, "Well, what's the fortune at the end?  She doesn't give
the fortune."  But that's not the point of the song.<p>
     Again, that was an experiement.  I don't know that I would sing that
for the rest of my life.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>That song is similar to a poem in that one needs to know the
title to understand it.  Do you write songs as poems, finishing the lyric
first before working on music?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  I'm still working on that.  I wouldn't say that I have one set
way of working.  It's usually that it comes together.  Usually I have an
idea.  With "Cracking" I knew that the title came first, and after that I
would try different lines and it just wasn't working, and sometimes it will
take months for the thing to line up correctly until it seems to fall right
in the right place.<p>
     "Luka" was that way, also.  It takes months of kind of fingering it
in my mind, while I'm walking around or doing something else, it's just
like a problem that my mind goes back to.  It wiggles.  It's like you're
trying to get the right angle, and once the angle comes, I can write the
song in two hours.  Like "Luka" took two hours.  It took months of thinking
about it and lining up the shot, in a sense.  Like if you're playing pool
and you want to clear the table, you line it all up, and then you just hit
it and everything clears.  It's very satisfying, but it takes months of
preparation.<p>
     <b>ST</b>:  <i>With "Luka," you had a character in mind?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  Yes, but I wasn't sure what the character would say.  I knew what
the character's problem was, but I didn't know how to get the listener
involved.  I wanted it to be from the point of view of a person who is
abused.  Now the problem that that person has is that they can't say it.
So how do you get the problem out if you can't say it?  How do you involve
the listener?  Well, you introduce yourself:  "My name is Luka."  And "I live
on the second floor, I live upstairs from you," and so therefore you're
engaging the listener.  "I think you've seen me before," so you start to
listen.  You're drawing the listener into this world with very simple,
basic information.  And it then proceeds to state the problem without ever
saying what the problem is.  That was my problem as a songwriter:  How do I
give this information without ever giving it?<p>
     It's easy to point a finger.  It's easy to say, "Child abuse must
stop" and everybody knows this.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>So much tension is created with the line "just don't ask me what
it was," that this person is holding a lot inside, and doesn't want to talk
about it.</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  Or can't talk about it.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>It's a technique that Randy Newman often uses, though few others
do, of using a character to make a point by what he doesn't say.</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  Yeah.  The listener has to work a lot.  It's true.  There's no
getting around that.  [<i>Laughs</i>]<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>Was Randy Newman an influence on your writing?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  For a long time, one of my favorite songs was "I Think It's Gonna
Rain Today" because it's not sentimental at all.  There's so much feeling
in it; he just gives you certain images.  It's a very moving song, but
it's not sentimental.  I think I was aware of a few other songs, but that one,
I remember feeling that I'd like to write like that.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>I was thinking more of his character songs.  Not a lot of songwriters
write in character, as you did in "Luka."</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  I guess I got that idea from studying poetry, and from T.S. Eliot.
"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."  If you just read it flat, it doesn't
make any sense.  When you realize that this character is revealing information,
then "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" makes sense if you look at it
through his eyes.  Whereas if you just read it flat as a poem, it just seems
to just lie there, it doesn't really do anything.  And once I realized that,
I started thinking about how you could use that, like a camera.  So it was
something I was playing with.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>Are there other poets besides Eliot who have influenced you?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>I'd say Sylvia Plath because of the way she uses language, the way
she puts words together.  She uses language almost sculpturally.  She'll
pick words for what they sound like as well as what they mean.  That was very
impressive to me.  It seems to pack more into it.  It's almost like code.<p>
     And, of course, Dylan.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>You think of him as a poet?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>The way that he used his images.  To me they work as well on the
page as when you listen to them.<p>
     I don't mind being a poet as long as I get to mingle in society.  I
don't like this idea that to be a poet you have to be aloof and you can't
walk in the street.  Poetry should be part of living.  Everything should be
all mixed together.<p>
     On one of the tours I was down in Texas and the woman from the record
company said to me, "What would you like to do?" because we had an afternoon
off, and I said, "Let's go shopping."  And she goes, "Oh, I'm so relieved
to find you're a regular girl.  I thought that you were a poet.  I thought
you'd be no fun, that you'd sit in your room and look out the window."  She
was relieved.<p>
     I think, yes, I probably am a poet, but I really feel the need to be
among people and to watch them and talk to them and be on a regular basis.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>Do you get a lot of song ideas from observing people?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  A lot of people say I'm very observational, but I'm really much
more involved than I pretend.  These are not just clinical observations
about people.  There is a direct connection between me and the person that
I am writing about.  There was a boy named Luka but he was not abused.  He's
probably shocked to death that I put him in this song.<p>
     [In] the things that I'm writing about, I'm revealing some facet of my
own life.  It's something that I've seen or been involved with.  It's not
just a question of reading a paper and saying, "That's a good topic.  I think
I'll write a Gulf War song."  That to me is too academic.  I think, in order
for it to ring true, you have to know what you're talking about.  It's not
enough just to <i>look</i> and say, "This is what I deduce."  You have to be
involved.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>Do songs gain more resonance if they are true?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  I think so, yeah.  To me it's really important that a snog be
true because you have to stand on stage every night and sing it.<p>
     And you have to force people to listen to it.  And if it's not true,
they're not going to want to listen to it.  You can fool yourself for a
while, but after a while you will lose the urge to sing it because it
won't have any resonance anymore.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>So with a song like "Marlene On The Wall," you actually had a
poster of Marlene Dietrich on your wall?</i><p>
     <b>SV:</b>  Yeah.  Oh, that was a truthful song.  The lines came out of my life.
But you want to be careful, too, because you don't want to get into "Oh, my
boyfriend left me..."  I have a problem with specifically confessional
songwriting.  I think you have to craft it in some way.  I don't think you
can come on stage and blurt out your innermost feelings.  My niece can blurt
out her innermost feelings.  She's four years old.  I wouldn't want to pay
$25 [<i>laughs</i>] to go see her do that.  You need to put it in a form.  Although
it is truthful, you have to give it some respect, or a certain kind of dignity,
by putting it into a kind of form.  Because these people are not my friends.
They're paying to see a show, some form of entertainment.  So I'm not gonna
sit there and talk to them like Ronee Blakely in Nashville.  [<i>Laughter</i>]<p>
     I had breakfast with Leonard Cohen once and I asked him, "What do you
think of confessional songwriting?  Is it better to be confessional or not
confessional?"  He said, "You do whatever you have to do to make the song work.
Whether it's confess or lie or make it up."  And that makes sense because
that's what his songs are.  Some of them are confessional; some of them you're
<i>sure</i> that he's lying.  [<i>Laughs</i>]<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>I understand that he is extremely business-like about his song-
writing; he carries a briefcase and works constantly on his songs every
day.  Is this how you approach your songs?</i><p>
     <b>SV: </b> I find that I do work on it everyday but it's in my mind.  I find
that it's more like a problem that's unsolved.  My mind will wander back to
it if I'm in a good frame of mind.  I'll say, "Well, that last line just
isn't working" or "That just doesn't seem to be the right thing," so my mind
will wander back to it, but it's not the formal thing of sitting with a
briefcase and working on my lyrics.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>Do you mean that your mind keeps working on songs even when you're
doing other activities?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Yeah.  Usually when I'm walking.  Walking from one place to
another.  Or sitting on a bus or thinking or talking.  My mind will keep
going back to that one song and go, "Well, those last two lines, I just don't
know..."  And it'll start fingering it and eventually the whole thing will
just fall into place.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>Lots of songwriters have said that their problems get solved
while driving--</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Yeah.  Your mind is occupied, so your other mind is left to play.
You really need that time to do that.  I was under a lot of pressure for
the third album, and everyone was kind of stomping around and going, "<i>Where's
the rest of the songs?</i>  We can't finish the album without the songs."  I
started to feel that I just wanted to get out.  I just wanted to go for a
walk or go anywhere.  And it looks as though I'm avoiding it.  And I'm not
avoiding it.  I'm just going to do my work in the way that's the best way
I can.  But it looks like I'm avoiding it, so everyone goes, "No, you can't
go to the health food store.  You must stay here and finish the song."
[<i>Laughs</i>]  But you need that time to approach it obliquely.  For some weird
reason, that's where the answers come from.  Sort of a left-handed approach.<p>
     <b>ST:</b>  <i>It would seem that your material would demand that kind of approach,
as opposed to songwriters working to write radio hits, that go to it everyday--</i>
     <b>SV:  </b>It's never worked for me.  [<i>Laughs</i>]  I've tried it a couple times,
and every time I write a song to be a hit, it doesn't even sing.  It doesn't
work for me.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b>Pete Seeger, who encouraged us to interview you, said that he
agreed with Woody<i> Guthrie that anytime you try to write songs commercially,
you can harm yourself artistically--</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>Well, you see, everyone knows that, and I knew that.  I knew that
when I was fourteen, and I knew that when I was 26.  But somehow you forget,
and you start thinking you can dablle in it just a little bit and twist it
just a little bit and aim it in this direction.  But for me, that kind of
stuff just doesn't work.  So I'm strict with myself now.  I'm only going to
do the things that are satisfying artistically.  Because I realize that my
own standards, when I'm left to my own devices, are very strict.  And I
have a whole system of rules for myself that are satisfying to me.  So for
a song to really ring true, it sort of has to go through this filtering
process within myself.  It's much stricter than what the record companies
expect.  [<i>Laugh</i>]<p>
     I realized that's really what's going to make it satisfying.  Not trying
to get a Top 40 hit.  I learned a lot in the last year, from the last tour
and the last album.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>What did you learn?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>[<i>Laugh</i>]  I learned that it's not good to try to force a hit.  I
mean, as a producer you have to be aware of these things because your record
company wants a single.  I feel that it's better to not go for the pop thing
if that's not what you're going to be.  I mean, for a while I was confused
cause "Luka" was a hit and I was never expecting it to be one.  So I became
popular, which made it pop.  So this made me confused.  Am I pop, am I folk?
And the journalists were doing the same thing.  Now I see that it's pop if
it's popular, and other than that, it doesn't matter.  I wrote "Luka" three
or four years before it became a hit.  I wrote "Tom's Diner" ten years ago.
It wasn't pop then, but now it's pop.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>You actually wrote "Luka" before your debut album.  Did you consider
putting it on your first album?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>No.  I needed some time for it to settle into the bag of songs.  I
needed some time to get used to it as a song.  A lot of people felt it was
catchy, and I used to feel insulted, because I'd say, "Catchy?  Obviously you
missed the point of the song."<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>And yet it is.  Musically, it is a catchy song.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>I guess it is.  I think because I was aiming at such a complex
subject that I was aiming for the simplest line to get there.  Simple melodies,
happy chords.  I felt I had to make it accessible because it was such a dark
subject.  So I went all out.  But I also tried to write in the language of a
child.  So that's probably why it worked, because it is so accessible.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>It's an upbeat song, and the melody is a happy one, as you said,
especially for that subject matter.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>I'd been listening to the Lou Reed <i>Berlin</i> album that Sunday when
I wrote the song.  And you can really draw a straight line between "Luka" and
that album.  That <i>Berlin</i> album is filled with references of domestic
violence and all kinds of violence.  The songs are all in major keys.  They're
all done on acoustic guitar.  So for me, ["Luka"] is like the extra song on
the <i>Berlin</i> album.  [<i>Laughs</i>]  To me.  Stylistically, it almost belonged
there.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>I never would have guessed.</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>No one ever draws that comparison.<p>
     <b>ST:  </b><i>Did the record company choose it to be the single?</i><p>
     <b>SV:  </b>I think when we produced it, everybody felt that it was going to be
the single.  I said, "Well, good luck.  Knock yourselves out."  Cause I had no
expectation for it.<p>
