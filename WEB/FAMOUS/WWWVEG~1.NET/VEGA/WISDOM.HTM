I know this was an old thread but I just got caught up on my mail, but I 
just wanted to get some feed back.  Now if what I am about to say is 
common knowledge I apoligize or if it is way off base.  when I first 
heard the song and now when i hear it, i always imagine a young lady who 
is coming to terms with a hidden memory of molestation from childhood.  I 
always thought it spoke of the taboo of the subject in the line "Mother 
the doctor he knows.....but he doesn't dare ask the right questions"  
then later in the song she(Vega) addresses the common disbelief of 
parents when their child tells them of the act -- "Mother your eyes have 
gone suddenly cold....once i did think that i'd find comfort there and 
instead you've gone hard and suspecting" <br>  
Like I said I may be reading a little to deep, but it's just what i hear 
when I listen to the song.<p>

Galen: That's an interesting interpretation, but I'm wondering what, in
that case, "bad wisdom" is referring to.<p>

In response to Galen's analysis of "Bad Wisdom":  I never really thought of
the song in those terms and am very impressed with your analysis.  I think
you certainly pulled out evidence from the song that would point in the
direction of a case of molestation.  Very interesting to look at the song in
a new light.<p>

I know that I once heard Suzanne interviewed about the song, and she
purposefully left the song ambiguous so that there could be many
interpretations of it.  I have always thought of it as being about the AIDS
crisis myself.<p>

"Bad Wisdom" points to the idea that one moments indiscretion: unsafe sex or
IV drug use could sentince one to death:  "What price to pay/For bad wisdom.<p>

Another theme is the governments inactivity regarding the crisis: "I've
fallen through the cracks/And there's no getting back"<p>

On a personal level is the misinformation associated w/ AIDS and how people
w/ HIV/AIDS are unjustly treated by society and family for fear of the
disease:  "Mother my friends are no longer my friends/And the games we once
played have no meaning."  also "Mother your eyes have gone suddenly cold..."<p>

But again, the song was left vague and could be about any disease or
situation where a person feels outside of the system or rejected because of
things beyond ones control.  AIDS/Molestation/Breast cancer/cancer in
general/any of these could be placed into the song and work.  <p>

It's a really great song, I'm glad you brought it up.<p>

I would say that "bad wisdom" would refer to having knowledge of a darker 
side of humanity, in a loss of innocence sort of way.  I guess it is like 
the story of Adam in Eve from the Bible, they ate from the tree of 
knowledge and the wisdom they recieved could be seen as "bad wisdom".

Fabulous come back to the "Bad Wisdom" part of the song.  I think you may
have something here that we may want to discuss further.  Having knowledge of
the darker side of humanity.  I certainly think that no matter what one's
interpretation of the song may be, I certainly think that "Bad Wisdom" could
be a loss of innocence through the knowledge of, as Galen so eloquently put
it, "the darker side of humanity." as well as, perhaps, one's own bad
judgement.  There is definately an unexplored level of the song being
scratched upon.<br>

Good interpretation Galen--I'm fascinated!<br>

an unplanned pregnancy is still what i think bad wisdom is depicting.  but
one can certainly interpret the lyrics on other levels just as
convincingly.<p>

I've always thought the song a fairly straightforward account of abuse 
(probably of a sexual sort), and the unexpected reaction of the 
narrator's mother when the accusations were made. However, discussions 
here have proved interesting -- abuse of any kind, or just some 
realization of the 'darker side of humanity', certainly fit the song. <p>

At any rate, that's always been my interpretation of the "price" for bad 
wisdom: a loss of innocence and belief in the rightness of what can 
happen to you.<p>

No, you're not rambling. Not at all. I'm convinced that almost all 
Suzanne's lyrics can be interpreted in this broad way. Her inspiration 
may have been a very precise situation, and you and me may also think of 
very precise situations in our own lives when we hear the song. But the 
song is something more than a simple account of a situation.<p>

Because of this, I always find it fascinating to hear different people's
personal interpretations. And although they may be very different at a
surface level -- molestation or AIDS -- there must be something they have
in common. And this something, I believe, is the very heart of the matter.
The existential dilemma underlying all the various manifestations.<p> 

So, listening to a song, I tend to remember certain feelings I've had or 
certain situations I've been in. But this is not a simple recall or 
reenaction of the original situation -- through the song, I can connect 
the petty, but often very painful, details of my own personal life to 
something bigger, and in this process it is as if my feelings are purified.<p>

Like Hugo I think Suzanne's songs are best left interpreted based on
each individual's experiences.  Thus, to you this particular song may
be about pregnancy; to another it may be a disease (AIDS?) or some
harsh memory from the past.  Suzanne likely intended to be vague enough 
to allow such individual responses, but I'm certain in her mind the 
subject was clear.  I, of course, have my opinion....<p>

I've interpreted "Bad Wisdom" to be about AIDS or, perhaps, a sexually-
transmitted disease.  Thus, the doctor examines her and reads the 
"strange information" but is afraid (embarrassed?) to "ask the right
question."  The disease has caused her friends to look differently at
her: "..my friends are no longer my friends."  She asks her mother why
the legal system has betrayed her: "..you've taught the laws are so 
fine if I'm *good* I'll be protected."  Yet, because she has crossed 
the line she has become an outcast: "..I've fallen through the crack 
and there's no getting back."  Society looks down on those who contract
AIDS and has no sympathy for their plight.<p>

Even her own mother now looks at her suspiciously and with disdain:
"..your eyes have gone suddenly cold...you've gone hard and suspect-
ing."  Did her daughter contract this disease by sharing a needle, or,
worse, is she a prostitute?  In the end she feels alone("I'm cut at the 
root like a weed") and the result is clear: "..like a woman in the 
street I will pay for my life with my body."  A *dear* price, indeed, 
to pay for "bad wisdom."<p>

But this is merely my angle; yours may be different.<p>

Nice thread Galen!  <p>

My two cents:<p>

I thought the interpretation of incest for this song was interesting, 
and certainly a good one.  For myself, I had always thought it referred 
to the more "mundane" problem of a very young woman becoming pregnant 
from an indiscreet discretion, so to speak.<p>

As for what the bad wisdom is, to me it seemed to be the wisdom that 
must come from such a life-changing occurence as this, whether it be 
from early pregancy or incest, it must be very traumatic and would 
certainly make a young girl grow up before her time.  This robbing of 
her childhood and brutal thrust into adulthood could bring lots of bad 
wisdom.  I think I'm getting this inference from "My friends are no 
longer my friends/and the games that they play have no meaning."<p>

I admire SV's wish to remain ambiguous on this song.  I've always 
believed that the listener should be the interpreter, if one is needed.<p>

Besides, it makes the discussion groups more interesting.   ;)<p>

<p>
This may very well be the case. But to me, that line doesn't refer to some
kind of punishment for living a life, rather, it makes me think of someone
who pays with her body in a desperate attempt to learn to have a life. It
may refer to someone who tries to buy love with sex in a futile search for
a meaning in life. But it could also refer to an anorexic who sacrifices
her body to rid herself of all earthly needs. In fact, it could refer to
any kind of psychosomatic illness, where the instinctive attempts to survive 
have gone astray.
<p>
If you read the lines preceding the discussed one, you find that the
reason for having to pay with her body is that "there's no one to hear my
small story". I think that this refers to the devaluation of the inner
world I was talking about in my earlier post tonight. If the inner world 
is not allowed to live, how could the body go on living? After all we are 
one whole person, of which the psyche and the soma are only aspects.
