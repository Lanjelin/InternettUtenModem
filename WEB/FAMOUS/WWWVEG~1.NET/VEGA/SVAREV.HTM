<b>ROLLING STONE - Review of "Suzanne Vega" for
 Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's</b>
<hr>
<p>
It wasn't until the release of her second album that Suzanne Vega achieved fame, scoring an unlikely Top
Forty hit with "Luka," a song about child abuse.  But the singer's 1985 album <i> Suzanne Vega, </i> had
already awakened listeners to a fresh new voice, reviving the folk-music genre after nearly two decades of
dormancy. For Vega, who was then twenty-five years old, the album was cause for uncertainty and isolation as
much as triumph.  "I felt a little bit like a novelty act," she says of her auspicious introduction.
<p>
Vega was certainly an anomaly during the mid-Eighties, softly strumming an acoustic guitar and singing
 introspective ballads while the rest of the music world was caught in bigger-is-better events like Live Aid
 and Brice Springsteen's <i> Born in the U.S.A. </i> mega-tour.  In retrospect, however, Vega's intimate
 first album proved to be a significant milestone in this decade, ushering in a flock of female folk singers,
 including Tracy Chapman,  Melissa Etheridge, Michelle Shocked, Tanita Tikaram and the Indigo Girls.  
<p>

Having taught herself guitar at the age of eleven, Vega began writing her own songs when she entered her teens.
After graduating from Barnard College in 1982, she began playing small coffeehouses in Greenwich Village - the
same area of New York City where nearly every Sixties folkie first tuned up his Gibson.  But Vega, a child of the Eighties,
hardly fit the protest-singer mold.  Even though she carried an acoustic guitar, her hero wasn't folk icon
Bob Dylan but punk godfather Lou Reed.  There are other differences as well.  After years on the Northeastern
club circuit, she had developed a direct, emotionally tempered style that she has said was inspired as much 
by novelist Carson McCullers and painter Edward Hopper as by romantic balladeers Leonard Cohen and 
Laura Nyro.
<p>
Weaving these diverse influences into a deeply moving album were producers Lenny Kaye (formerly Patti
Smith's guitarist) and Steve Addabbo (Vega's manager), who brought modern touches to Vega's straight-ahead
style, enhancing the singer's sparse sound with subtle electric guitars, graceful violons and even New Age
 synthesizers, all of which added gentle textures to her haunting material.
<p>
Vega's prowess with simile and metaphor dominates the entire album, perhaps most effectively on songs 
like "Undertow," "Freeze Tag," and "Straight Lines."  But Vega's sphinxlike wordplay reaches its apex on "Small Blue
 Thing," a ballad more reflective of an intangible feeling than a literal object.  "The song is actually pretty
straightforward - it's not a riddle," she says with a laugh.  "I never try and be tricky.  At the time, I felt like a small
 blue thing.  I never expected that people would think that it stood for something.  Some people even asked 
if ti's a fetus.  It's not that at all - it's a mood.
<p>
"The structures behind folk music are very elemental, sort of like water," Vega adds. "You go through your 
fads with wine and soft drinks and everything else, but water is the basic thing you always go back to."
<p>
Producers: Lenny Kaye and Steve Addabbo.  Executive Producer: Ronakd K. Fierstein.  Released: April 1985.  Highest Chart Position: Number Ninety-One

   Suzanne Vega's strengths lie in her  ability to write subtle,  catchy
lyrics and  music while  packing the wallop  of a  mule kick  along with
them.    At first  listen Vega's  tunes sound  pleasant,  enjoyable  and
catchy.   And unless  you listen closely you'll never  notice that these
bright,  bouncy tunes  have a complexity that  matches their bounciness.
She writes of Death and Freedom in 'Undertow' from her 1985 debut LP, of
child  abuse  in  'Luka'  from her  recently  released  album  "Solitude
Standing", of heartbreak in 'Cracking' also from her 1985 record,  and a
17 year old boy who was shut away in a basement since infancy in 'Wooden
Horse (Caspar Hauser's Song)' from "Solitude Standing."
<p> 
   And her lyrics have a quality of jumping out at you, especially after
listening to her  songs more than once.   Lyrics are  provided with both
her 1985 self-titled release and 1987's "Solitude Standing."  And it's a
good thing that lyric sheets are included because Vega's writing demands
to be read as  well as heard.   Her voiced images  are reinforced by the
written word;   her music  emphasises her voice  and your  reading.   In
'Undertow' she writes  "I would leave only bones and  teeth/We could see
what was  underneath/And you  would be free  then,  free  then" equating
death and freedom in  the same breath.   In 'Cracking' "It's  a one time
thing/It just  happens/a lot/Walk with me/And  we will see/what  we have
got"  and "My  heart  is  broken/It is  worn  out  at the  knees/Hearing
muffled/Seeing blind/Soon  it will hit the  Deep Freeze" Vega  paints an
image of pain  and despair,  yet there's also acceptance  since "It just
happens/a lot."   In 'Luka'  "If you hear  something late  at night/Some
kind of trouble,  some kind of fight/ Just don't ask me what it was" and
"They only hit until  you cry/And after that you don't  ask why/You just
don't argue anymore" are hard hitting  lyrics,  but you can easily gloss
right over  them because  the beat is  as infectious  as the  lyrics are
poignant.
<p> 
   Vega has  smarts and she has  style.   She has a  slightly off-center
view of the world that has provided us with two wonderful albums full of
poetry to read AND listen to.    Rolling Stone Magazine called her music
'Uneasy Listening'.   In two words or less,  nothing describes her music
better.   Her music is haunting,   relaxing,  shocking,  subtle,  blunt,
melodic,  hard hitting and pleasant all at the same time.   Listening to
and reading Suzanne Vega can shake up the old brain cells.  She get it very well.
<p> 
   Both her  1985 LP and  the CD  of "Solitude Standing"  have excellent
sound and production.   Her debut album is  a little more sparse,  it is
mostly an acoustic album, with instrumentation than "Solitude Standing."
"Solitude" has a  much more noticable drum  mix and the CD  is virtually
flawless.
