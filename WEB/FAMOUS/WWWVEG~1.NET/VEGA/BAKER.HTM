while randomly flipping through a book called 'the fermata' by nicholson 
baker, i stumbled across, yes, our very own suzanne. in chapter 13, a 
woman is listening to 'solitude standing' in her car...later on, the 
song resurfaces on a portable radio.  there are a couple lyric quotes, i  
think, too.  neat.

(Suzanne reference coming in this one... stay with me for a few sentences)...
Although I haven't read 'The Fermata'-- what I read about it in advance
didn't lure me in, shall we say--I'm otherwise a great admirer of Nicholson
Baker's work ("Room Temperature" is absolutely wonderful, as is "U&I" in an
odd sort of way). Anyway, when 'The Fermata' came out, he was interviewed for
'Entertainment Weekly.' This is the quote that closed the piece:
<p>
"I wrote 'Fermata' listening to Suzanne Vega, particularly her album 99.9Fo.
It affected my mood in just the right way. I found a kind of maniacal
intensity in her music that helped me as I typed. So if 'Fermata' is
attacked, maybe I can say i'm not responsible because I was under the spell
of Suzanne Vega."
<p>
This came in the article w/ no prelude, sort of out of the blue. Plus, you
should know that Baker is very funny in a dry way, so he was really sort of
more jokey there than it maybe sounds out of context. Anyway, at the time I
thought this was a really cool reference, because it showed how one person I
really admired really himself admired someone else I really admired. The
synchronicity or whatever of it was fulfilling somehow.
