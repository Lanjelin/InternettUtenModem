I volunteer as a DJ at the University radio station.... this morning I
popped into the station to have a look throught the new releases and what
do I find?
<p>
No Cheap Thrill CD single :)
<p>
I'll be playing it as will some of the other DJs.... we are a small
University station.... logically, if we have the single then the major
stations will also have it. So get your fingers to the phone and call you
local station and ask them to play it :) The more airplay it gets the more
people will find out about the new album.
<p>
I'll be at the Newport Folk festival this weekend with some of my friends
from the Indigo Girls mailing list.... I hope to see some of you there. I
saw Suzanne play at Newport back in 1992...... and I can't wait to get back
there again..... it's been almost three years since I last saw Suzanne play
live.
<p>
Eric, thanks for putting the sound clips on the website..... I couldn't
resist...... I just had to hear them. I'm certainly looking forward to the
new album..... the clips sound..... different!!! :)
<p>
Newport here I come!!!!

        OK, so what else is on the single besides the title track? Not that
it'll ever make it to $@#&* Australia, but I'd still like to know what I''m
missing ...

It's a great song. I've played it several times on my show 
(mid-5:30am, 103.7fm, for those of you in and around Seattle). It 
appears to be the first single. Reminiscent of 99.9 pop, but
maybe a tad smoother, the production's not as disjointed/choppy.
Which is not to say *better*, just different.

Almost everyday, I go to the Virgin Megastore and ask for 'No Cheap Thrill'
and they always tell me that they should have already received it but the
release (or shipping or whatever) had been postponed but that they should
have it in store very soon now. Today I asked in another store and the guy
looked in his listings and told me they should receive it very soon too (he
said by the end of the week). Anyway, that's not why I'm writing you. I'm
writing you because I could glance on his listings and I saw that the other
titles on the single woul be "Marlene", "Luka" and "Left Of Center" (Oh what
a surprise!). Well anyway I'll buy it for the cover at least, but I thought
She had worked on B-sides. Still I guess that it's yet another opportunity
for those who don't have the "Left Of Center" studio version (I got it on
the "When Heroes Go down" jewel box single, which also featured "Luka" and
"Marlene", just like "No Cheap Thrill").

Just by coincidence, I found it yesterday in a store here and of course
immediately bought it.  I didn't go to the store on purpose but when I
entered it I watched out for possible new Suzanne Vega disks among others
of course.

<p>
Maybe not.  I got Luka, Marlene and Tom's Diner on it (in that order).

<p>
Well, at least for me it's one new song since I haven't heard No Cheap
Thrill so far.  So far I couldn't be bothered enough for a visit to the
website to get the audio files...

Today my lucky star (planet Vega) striked again. First let me remind you
that I'll see her in NY, though my one-week trip to NY was planned long
before the show was. Then I'm going to see her in Salle Pleyel October 4th.
This hall is usually a classic music hall (where people like Chopin have
played) so I think they don't have the speakers for heavy drums and modern
sounds and so it may be an acoustic show (the tickets aren't on sale yet).  
<p>
And today, I went to Virgin and found the 'No Cheap Thrill' single (for the
French undertowers, it's 66F, and they have a lot of copies). I'm sorry I
told you recently that I had read it would feature 'Left Of Center'. The
tracks are Tom, Luka and Marlene (like someone said). The cover is pretty
cool, old fashioned, with the four playing cards symbols on the corners. She
looks like a pin-up on it. Then I went to a record fair (actually I went
there first but let me keep the best part for the end), and just when I came
in, I found a slim jewel box CD, with the cover of the new album, and it's a
promo copy of the whoooole album. Its catalog number is ADV540583 2. I
haven't checked the album artwork on the web (except for the cover) (and I
haven't listened to the slightest note of the new songs on the web neither),
but I guess that the other picture in the CD will be in the album too: it's
a bit like on the cover, but the apple doesn't hide Suzanne's head and...
well... she's damn beautiful on it. By the way do you think there's a
connection between the hand that covers her mouth on the 99.9 cover and the
apple that covers her eye on the new album cover? I guess she also covers
her eye to have more perspective. Anyway, what can I tell you? the longest
track lasts 3:38.
<p>
Now I'm gonna leave you because I'm going to lay on my bed and LISTEN to the
album. I wanted to tell you first so I can listen to it quietly without
thinking of what I'm going to tell you about it. I know the album is being
released in two days but I'm so glad I seem to be the first.... AHAHAHAHAHA! 
<p>
David
<p>
PS: a friend of mine heard two songs from the album on the radio (France
Inter, L'Inrockuptible), so it already has good airplay here (good for her).

Hi folks,
<p>
For once A&M got the first single right -- No Cheap Thrill is one of the
catchiest in an album full of catchy songs.  If it's not too early to make
such statements, I vote for A&M releasing Birth-Day (Love Made Real) as the
next single.  The song ROCKS!  
<p>
If the company is squeamish about the subject matter, let's remind them that
the band Live, which is made of four or five men, had an international smash
hit with a song called "Lightning Crashes" that contains the line "Lightning
crashes and a young mother cries/Her placenta falls to the floor."  Hey, if
they can be so blunt about it, can't a woman write from personal experience
(and much more elegantly) about the same event?  
<p>
Just a thought,
<p>
U212

Oh - but isn't "Caramel" by far the best song on the album?  I know it's
had it's sneak preview via the movie - but sheez - couldn't you just
listen to it over and over and over...  I know it's maybe not single
material, or anyone's favourite for beat/lyrics/meaning - but it is just
so so so good...?  Just takes you away...
