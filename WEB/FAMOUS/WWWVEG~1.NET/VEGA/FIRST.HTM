Subject: A decade of Suzanne!<p>
Greetings from the land of Opal (though, never fear, I am unscathed, 
despite my abrupt need to use an air-sick bag in a bumpy helicopter).<p>
This is sort of outdated by now, but I didn't want to pass up the 
opportunity to note that it's been officially 10 years, and I guess a 
month or two, since _Suzanne Vega_ hit the stores. I just want to take 
the chance to congratulate Suzanne on her first decade as a recorded 
entity -- and, certainly, wish her luck in the many, many subsequent 
decades that are sure to follow.<p>
I guess it's the classic question (not to Suzanne, to everyone else): do
you remember where you were when you first heard her? For me it was a few
minutes after midnight, September 25, 1985 -- my 20th birthday -- standing
in my dorm room on the third floor of Beam Hall at Penn State when "Small
Blue Thing" came out over the airwaves from WPSU. I remember it like I'm
still standing there. The world was blue-green for some reason. I think a
fan was going.  I'm not going to claim that the cosmos stopped or anything
but I think _I_ did; I'd read about Suzanne a few weeks earlier and was
asking myself "Is this it? Is this her? I have to get this." <p>
The next day a coworker at the student newspaper played a compilation tape
that included "Marlene on the Wall," which I didn't like quite as much but
kept me interested. <p>
A few days later I went hunting through record stores looking for it. I
finally found one that had one copy. Back then LPs were still a big deal
(I wish I'd bought it in vinyl but I had no way to play it) and the few 
cassettes this one store sold were locked behind glass; as the clerk 
unlocked the case to retrieve the tape she said "We've had a lot of 
people asking for this one." I took it home, listened to it, didn't get 
everything the first time but knew I'd found something wonderful, 
something that maybe I'd been looking for a long time without knowing 
what for.<p>
That whole year, certainly that whole semester, was colored by that album;
it's the soundtrack I hear when I think back to that time. (It helped that
it was only one of three albums I bought that entire year, being cash-poor
as I was). For instance, the next spring I really, really fell in love for
the first time (yes, call me a late bloomer) and wrote in my diary: "I
want to love a young woman who I don't understand. Your highness, your
ways are very strange."<p>
My enthusiasm was far from universally shared, however. I tried to 
explain to my roommate what Suzanne sounded like; the only thing I could 
come up with, "urban folk," drew this look of bemused compassion from 
him, sort of like "God, it must be terrible to be such a dork." One 
friend of mine used to discount any musical opinion I held by saying, 
"Yeah, but _you_ like Suzanne Vega." (This from a guy who thought Dream 
Academy was the next Pink Floyd.) If you're thinking that I really needed 
some new friends -- yeah, that's the conclusion I reached too.<p>
One remarkable thing about that album is that it became one of my 
favorites of all time the minute I heard it, and that it still is 10 years 
later. That's rare; most of my favorite albums are ones that took a while 
to grow on me (like, say, anything by R.E.M.). Others that immediately 
appealed to me faded after time, either because my tastes changed or 
because their appeal was all on the surface; that's certainly not true of 
_SV_.<p>
It also might be the only album that I still listen to regularly after so
many years just for the enjoyment of it. (In contrast, it's been a while
since I listened to, say, the White Album in its entirety. It's an
all-time masterpiece, of course, by any objective standard more pivotal to
musical history than Suzanne's debut, probably, but these days it's not
usually what I'm in the mood for). I'm still not tired of it; I'm still
discovering new things. My latest trick is to listen to it and _99.9F_
back to back and notice how similar they are. <p>
Am I babbling? Yes. I just wanted to thank Suzanne for the last decade, 
or at least the role she's played in it. (I won't hold her accountable 
for Newt Gingrich, never fear.)<p>
Most exciting of all -- the news she's heading back into the studio! Yes! 
I can hardly wait. <p>
-- Bob, no longer elusive, just incoherent<p>
P.S. I think I've been missing out on messages too. I didn't get anything 
for a couple of weeks, then this latest feud jumps out from nowhere. All 
I can say to the combatants -- shouldna lept in front o' the bairn, lad!<p>

I'm embarrassed to say, but for me it was studying for finals in 1986 with
*MTV* playing as background noise.  I was taking a break when "Marlene on
the Wall" came on.  The first few seconds of the song sent me scrambling
for a pen so that I could write down the artist at the end of the video --
that kind of immediate reaction had never happened to me before.  I soon
had her LP and listened to the album I don't know how many times on my
walkman (surely hundreds) over the next few years.<p>
The _Suzanne Vega_ album is still my favorite because (to me) the songs
seem entwined with a sad, detached abstraction -- a feeling like there's
something bigger behind the lyrics that language just can't express.<p>
>Most exciting of all -- the news she's heading back into the studio! Yes!<br>

Great news!<p>

Subject: First hearing Suzanne <p>



Hello everyone,<p>



There was a thread along these lines awhile back; sounds like a candidate

for archiving!  Someone in rec.music.rem is accumulating a similar list for

R.E.M, and it's really fascinating to read - quite a variety of experiences.<p>



I think I posted this sometime back, but here it is again:<p>



Around summer 1986, I was listening to a Sunday night program on the radio

in Austin, TX.  The incomparable dj, Jody Denberg, always featured an

eclectic mix of 'critic's choice' stuff - indie, 'alternative' (before it

was called that, etc.).  Towards the end of the program, he closed with 

quieter, acoustic-based material.  Driving home near midnight, I happened

to catch 'Small Blue Thing' - needless to say, I was blown away.  I think

what came through was the *intensity* of the music and lyrics through both

*repetition* and *sparseness* of arrangement - something that Suzanne does

very well on a consistent basis!  I think 'detached abstraction' is a good

way to put it, but it's more than that.<p>



Well, of course I went out and got the album, and since then, have seen

her twice in concert (missed the 1985 show at the Cactus Cafe - capacity

only around 100-150...damn...), bought everything I can get my hands on, etc.<p>



Looking forward to the new material, and the new 'old' material,<p>

Hello everyone,<p>



Just wanted to throw in my "first time" experience hearing Suzanne.  I can't

remember the year -- it probably was in '86 or '87.<p>



It was a weekend morning, and I had to wake up decently early, for one crazy

reason or another.  My radio alarm was set to WNEW-FM in New York.  At that

time, Pete Fornatelle (spelling's probably wrong), used to have his "mixed

bag" show where he played cool stuff, especially folk-rock artist.  <p>



Well, that morning, he played "undertow" and I was taken by Suzanne's

beautiful voice.  Been a fan ever since :).<p>

like it was yesterday. autumn of 1985. i was laying on the floor of my

bedroom listening to whrw (binghamton university's radio station). the

world was infinitely grey (funny how both bob and i associate colors

with these memories). someone played "the queen and the soldier" and i

was floored (ha ha). while listening, everything went blank and i felt

completely engulfed by the music and words.<p>



the next day, i found a cassette copy of the album which i still have

and listen to, even through the song titles are worn off. as with bob,

it became the soundtrack of my life, along with KaTe bush's hounds of

love, for tht year and the next few. every song *clicked*, though

"cracking," by far, was the one i identified with most closely. still

do, in fact.<p>

this is getting weirder. i didn't write that in my diary (didn't have a

diary to write in), but the same thing happened to me: fell in love for

the first time, associated those lines with the feelings i felt, and

integrated the album very much into that relationship. so much so that

i couldn't listen to the album for at least a year after said

relationship went sour. the fact that i could listen to it again was a

measure of my healing.<p>



as with bob, it's an album that i liked from the start and continue to

like to this day. <p>

	It was July '85 ... around my thirteenth birthday, believe it or not. Tuned

in MTV one afternoon, halfway through the Marlene on the Wall video, 

waited esctatically for the artist to show up in the lower-left corner in 

the screen, and I was hooked.  I had just heard Sting's "Dream of the 

Blue Turtles" album, and could see a definite parallel between "Marlene" 

and some of the songs on the second side of that album, especially 

"Consider Me Gone."  Could "derStingel" have been influenced by his A&M 

labelmate?  Think so...<p>

	I didn't really get into buying albums till I was a sophomore in high 

school.  ('87-'88)  Solitude Standing was, of course, a big album around 

this time, but while I liked "Luka" and the title cut, it didn't have the 

same spark of Marlene or Left of Centre.  (speaking of that last cut, I 

wish suzanne would team up with Joe Jackson again.  he's another artist 

who does whatever he wants in a unique, welcoming sort of manner, and his 

piano solo on LoC adds a lot to the track.)  Therefore, I picked up the 

debut LP in March of '88, and played it and Joni Mitchell's "Hissing of 

Summer Lawns" LP incessantly for about a year.  (To this day, those 2 LPs 

plus Solitude Standing are the albums I'd want to take with me on a 

desert island.)  <p>

	DoOH wasn't as striking as the first 2, but it had its moments, 

especially "predictions" with that Jaco-like fretless bass and Fairlight 

textures.  99.9F, however, kept a good balance going between the techno 

tracks, the pop, and the ol' fashioned folk.  However, that first album 

still holds a certain key in my heart of hearts.  It and only a few other 

albums (SS, several Mitchell LPs, and Rickie Lee Jones' "Pirates") has a 

certain special something, a sense of wonder, humanity, and social 

commentary unique in the digital age.  <p>

Well, my relationship wasn't all that Suzanne-related (sure sign of 

impending trouble, I guess). But when it was over and I was writing my 

ex-gf my 40-page postmortem, I was tempted to quote from "Neighborhood 

Girls": "I've been out for a while/but I'll back in a bit/I am just 

walking through the smoke/finding out if this is it." I didn't, however.<p>



In retrospect, I guess I'd have to say that "The Queen and the Soldier" 

isn't a very auspicious song to start out a relationship with. I think I

ended up being the Soldier that time. <p>

I guess I have to confess that my first Suzanne Vega song was Luka, but I 

was only twelve at the time.  I don't really remember how I got into her music

but I know that by my thirteenth birthday I had both her albums and was very 

excited that my birthday present was front row seat tickets to see her that 

very night! I hadn't even known she was playing.     <p>       

	So I entered my teenage years convinced that Ms. Vega had made 

eye contact with *ME* right during Tom's Diner, the show's opener. [Hey Suzanne,you remember the little kid in the cast, don't you?]  I still have the T-shirt

from that show (I think the ticket stub got lost in a move somwhere) though

needless to say it doesn't fit anymore.  If I ever have kids, they will be the

coolest dressed little tykes around.<p>

Hi folks!<p>



I probably had seen the video of 'Marlene on the Wall' on some chart show

back in 1985, but the first concious experience happened couple of years

later, in November 1987. I was sitting in a small cafe near the Central

Railway Station of Helsinki, Finland. It was 7 a.m., and I had just spent

a sleepless night in train, I was having my coffee, when I hear Suzanne's

song on the radio. No, it was not 'Tom's Diner', it was 'Ironbound/Fancy

Poultry'. That really hit the spot. Couple of weeks later I had bought the

first two albums and I have been her fan ever since.  I have seen Suzanne

in a Concert in Helsinki 1990, and I am looking forward to see her here

again in the future. <p>

i've been on this mailing list for<br>

hmm<br>

nearly two years now<br>

i guess<br>

but i've been fairly quiet<p>



the music hits me in such a personal<br>

place<br>

so as it is discussed and dissected<br>

i can watch<br>

but not participate<p>



the recent discussion regarding how<br>

and when<br>

someone was introduced to the music<br>

compels me to speak<br>

though<p>



it was 1986<br>

i was working in a record store<br>

opened the "pretty in pink" soundtrack to play in the store<br>

i fancied myself a smiths fan at the time<br>

and that was my motivation<p>



but i was struck by "left of center" and<br>

immediately went to the back of the store<br>

found the self-titled album<br>

put it on the turntable (remember those?)<br>

and was lost for several hours<br>

listening to the stories contained<br>

again and again<p>



today, i struggle with expression<br>

as i did then<br>

and often found that songs, stories or poems<br>

said things in eloquent ways<br>

that eluded me

<p>

with suzanne's music<br>

i had found a treasure box of words<br>

and stories<br>

that could speak for me<br>

if someone were to ask how i felt<br>

(often a dreadful question)<p>



as i continued working at the record store<br>

i often had to go retrieve the album from the racks<br>

as other, more "enlightened" employees had reshelved it <br>

(along with rem, joe jackson and the smiths) <br>

favoring instead, def leppard, michael jackson and the like <br>

for our in store play<p>



i didnt stay much longer there<br>

a wholly unpleasant place<br>

but my benefit from that job had been the discovery<br>

of this music<p>



i went about my life<br>

which at the time included<br>

an abusive relationship<br>

(i was in the middle of the second year of what<br>

would end up being five)<p>



i bought solitude standing as soon as it was released<br>

sat alone in my car to listen<br>

it was raining outside<br>

i forced myself to not look at the lyric sheet<br>

wanting to hear the pieces first <br>

before dissecting them in my mind<br>

tom's diner... another story.. i smiled at it's sweetness<br>

complex and yet simple... unique<p>



and then luka... <br>

well there it was... these words<br>

about a youngster, of course<br>

but echoing so closely<br>

my existence, my emotions (or lack of them)<br>

i was shocked<p>



i was used to her music exploring pieces of<br>

my brain and my existence<br>

but not so clearly<br>

in simple words<br>

explaining how i lived<br>

how i moved from day to day<p>



my initial reactions to the rest of the album<br>

are lost on me today<br>

although now, i also treasure gypsy, language<br>

and the rest of the album<p>



when her tour was due to hit san francisco in<br>

august of that year<br>

i clandestinely purchased tickets<br>

with my friend john<br>

the only person who didnt let me push him away<br>

as i was shrouded in this abusive relationship<p>



a few days before the concert<br>

my boyfriend found out about it <br>

and john attended the concert on his own<br>

my opportunity to be with others who <br>

listened to her music <br>

and maybe understood things the way i did, lost<p>



time went on<br>

i left california for the east coast<br>

days of open hand came out<br>

99.9 came out<br>

tired of sleeping... institution green<br>

in liverpool... there was always a song that<br>

spoke to me<p>



several months ago<br>

9 years after my introduction to her music<br>

i got on a train heading towards boston<br>

met my friend, peter,  at the station<br>

got in his car and off we went to vermont<br>

walked into a festival<br>

and i sat on a hill and listened to her sing and talk<p>



it's a good thing that peter doesnt often ask me how i feel<br>

i dont think i could have told him then<p>



-------<p>





it took me a long time this morning to put this <br>

experience into words<br>

i apologize for the length<br>

and i thank you for listening<p>
