Hi everyone
<P>
On Sun, 8 Sept 1996, Guida Fonseca reported:

<BR>
hmmmm!<BR>
This smells like a commonplace (sorry Suzanne!).<BR>
I'm Italian, but I'm not Catholic.<BR>
The first time I saw the album cover it was in Paris, in August, Bibliotheque
Publique d'Information. Michela, (my girlfriend, we met at a Suzanne concert -
thank you Suzanne!) wanted to "stay tuned" also for our short holiday time.
My first impression was I liked the cover: I liked the color and Suzanne,
well... she was damn beautiful on it (to use David's words).
Michela didn't like the cover, but she didn't tell me why.
Tonight I heard her to the phone, I told her of this biblical interpretation,
and I asked her if this was the reason she didn't like the cover.
She told me: "No, I don't like the cover 'couse looking at it I'm waiting for
William Tell shooting an arrow!"
<P>
With love<BR>
Paolo
<P>
P.S. I still like the album cover. I'm waiting to hear the songs, and
Michela too!

I can hear a lot of Beatles influence on this album. Do any of you think the
apple symbolizes Apple Records, you know, the Beatles' label?

Subj:	Most desirable objects. And The presentation of NOOD<br>

  In fact, the only thing I can complain about Suzanne new album is the
product presentation, the image printed on the CD (you know these drk
dots!) are really kitch!   Same for the little flower in the inside of the
booklet.  It reminds me the SUPERB televisual environment of THE Price IS
Right!  The picture on the back of the booklet should have been bigger! 
The white border at the back of the box is not really beautifull.   If I
take a quick look at 99.9 and Days of ... booklets, the art work is so
beautifull.  When you drop down to NOOD artwork.... :-(
<p>
With Suzanne two precedent album and with 99.9 limited edition, there was
meat on the bone.  There was interaction between the artwork and the songs.
(fatman & dancing girl and the beautifull dancing girl outfit, 50/50 chance
and the ahnd whit the bird skull on the blackboard...)
<p>
In retrospactive and to finish on a good note, the thing I like the most
about NOOD artwork is the cover picture.  It reminds me about René Magritte
paintings because of the apple (even if it was not supposed to figure
there) and the way it hides Suzanne face.  The picture is really catchy. 
When your in a music sore, the album seems to pop out when you look at a
wall full of differents cd's.   
<p>
P.S.  the artwork is not very good but I know that it is the music and the
lyrics that counts.

Even is the cover picture is really great, I do not like the artwork of
this SV album.  Sv fans have been very spoiled in that way for her Days
of... and 99.9 artwor were brilliant.  In these two albums, the booklet was
a complement for the music.  I'm thinking about the fatman &dancing girl
pictures in 99.9.  On the first page of it, there is this wood texture that
reminds me the ones in Days of....  The pages where the songs are printed
are not really beautifull and black becomes stained by our finger prints
(I'm so picky!)   And what to say about page 3 ( 3 if you except the cover
of the booklet.)  You can't do more kitch than this.  The little flower
reminjds me of The Price is Right showcase shodiwn set!  UUUUH!  In the
other hand, I really like the picture of Suzanne on the roof on pages 9 and
10.  The back of the booklet is really not my cup of tea and the picture of
suzanne should have been bigger.  But the worst of all is that white border
at the back of the CD case...  I feel very sorry to write this comment but
I think that this design is not as great as the two previous albums.
I hope you guys will not be too angry about this comment, it is the very
first time that I have something bad to say about a SV album.

        Hi all.<br>
        Here's my question: <br>
        Why is there a green apple on the cover of the new album: "Nine
Objects of Desire." Suzanne explains in her online interview why she didn't
put a plum on the cover (because that is the ""the object of desire to end
all objects -- the one thing you really want but don't have"), but why the
apple? Adam and Eve? Seduction? Temptation? Evil? and why green? Jealousy?
Envy? new life? And further more, why does the photo evoke the back cover of
kd lang's most recent album (though her food-of-choice is a pea)? <br>
        Any insight?

Maybe apples photograph well? And people know what they are.  Some fruits are
a bit obscure for the general public.  And maybe plums aren't photogenic.
 Hard to know where a plum starts and where it ends.  And bananas -- well, it
would be hard to coordinate bananas with many wardrobes.  Oranges -- kind of
bright, don't you think?  Reminds me of highway workers or chain gangs.  I
definitely think a green apple was the only way to go.  (As you pointed out,
the pea had been done.)

I hate to say it:
<p>
	But I thought that it had something to do with the 
"Apple of her Eye" .... *collective groans* :)
<p>
I mean, that does count as an object of desire... :)
