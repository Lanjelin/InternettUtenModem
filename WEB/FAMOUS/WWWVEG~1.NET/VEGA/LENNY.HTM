Subj:	How cool she is!!! :)<br>

hi everyone!<p>
        i only just found/stumbled across the suzanne vega home page...(and
hence only just subscribed to this list also)...but how cool it all is! and
seeing as this seems an appropriate place, i'd just like to say i thnk it's
all put together *really really well*, very interesting, and I'm sure that
some people could be turned into likely buyers of her product if they
happened to glance thru it. which is a good thing obviously! :)  Also, I am
in the middle of total exam pressure and it was just the nicest way to kick
back & relax for a moment.  
<p>
anyway, i read that interview with leonard cohen, whom someone once told me>
had that song from 'pump up the volume', 'everybody knows'. so i guess he's
pretty cool, that was a tough song! is he like *really* old or something?
like 60 +!!!? it sounds like he was making moves!! :))) though i'm sure that
i am mistaken :) 
<p>
but then i quickly read suzanne's OWN postings! this completly blew me away,
and that is sort of cool you'd have to admit. anyway, i just wanted to say
three things.
<p>    
i) she said;     >After that I want to put out two things -- one collection
called "Thirteen Early Songs" w songs like
>"Marching Dream", "Silver Lady", "Daniella", "Black Widow Station", and
some others that aren't
>known, like "Feather and Bone" and "Not Me" 
<p>
>I also want to put out a "Best of", but the kind I like is the kind you
hate -- I love records that
>collect an artist's singles throughout a period, with no odds and ends, no
filler, no experiments,
>just the tried and true. 
<p>
        and i think that's all great news! I only got her into with '99.9 F'
(all due to that one song..when heroes go down...what a cool video!!!!) and
i gotta admit I'd never heard of her before then, which seems weird now :)
<p>        anyway, i think both those cds are really cool ideas! i would
defintely be buying both of them, which would push my suzzane cds up to 6,
and 7 if you include the new one which she is making apparently! (which
would put her second only to Bob Dylan & above even the Femmes in my
collection i think, showing i have done my personal bit for her bank
account!!)...also, i know lots of ppl who really love the 'hits of suzanne
vega' ie. stuff like marlene on the wall, luka, undertow, 99.9 etc...talk
about a target group!  & I'm sure the same situtaion is reflected throughout
the cd-buying world :) heheh
<p>
ii) if S.Vega ever tours Australia again, i *beg* her to come to Hobart
again (yes she did come the first time! )...because no kidding i got into
her by accident, like the week after she came a couple of years ago!! which
is pretty ironic i guess.  :) i would also love to see her in the states,
(and in fact will), i bet it's *so cool* there.   
<p>    
iii) lastly, i just wanted to say that "marlene on the wall" is one of the
most beautiful songs i've heard, and that the whole first album is just
beautiful, even tho I got into her later stuff first. anyone who can have
written a song like 'Freeze Tag' deserves all the fame & fortune they can
get  :) thats one of my fav's.
<p>
        thats all everybody, sorry if this was too long, but like i say i
only just stumbled across it!! :))))<p>
                                regards all, david.
<p>
oh lastly i thought that was an excellent poem too..."By Myself', at age 9.
very touching, and even better, very inspiring! well, later everyone, and
the best of luck (and thanx) to suzanne vega as well!!. :)) hehh

Yes, both your messages made it, and you're right the web page is
quite a handsome site.  Doubly right on all your comments about Suz-
anne, too! 
<p>
When you post to a mailing list you will get bounced mail from those
members of the list whose addresses are skewed in some way or, perhaps,
no longer have their original internet service.
<p>
Re: Leonard Cohen.  Yes, he is definitely an old codger, but a legend-
ary poet and songwriter as well.  Well worth checking out his own 
material.  I still like his first album ("Songs of Leonard Cohen") the 
best, which contains "Suzanne" (!), perhaps his most famous.
<p>
Welcome to the list, which has been a bit quite of late, probably be-
cause school's out for the summer here in the states.  Keep checking
out the web site for new additions; I believe there'll be some neat
things happening there in the near future...

Speaking of the song "Suzanne"--does anybody think about our Suzanne when
they hear that song--as I do.  It's very interesting but that Suzanne seems
to possess a lot of SV's personality traits.  I realize the song was written
long before LC knew about SV--but I think it's very ironic.  What do you guys
think?

        Hey, I only glanced thru it and he seemed pretty cool, I think you
can pick up the dryness in the text. Loved  his reaction to the fishnet
stockings! :) Like, actually, now that I have thought about it, I do think
that i remeber (vaguely) an interview on the radio with S.Vega whilst she
was in Australia last, and she mentioned in passing meeting this guy who was
a famous musician that she had liked  etc and they had some wine etc...and
the thing was, (and this was pretty funny) after like 'worship from afar' in
her youth, he wasn't above the old-fashioned sleaze!!! :))))) But like she
wasn't bitching, it was just like the fact. And now, putting two and two
together
<p>        I think she was talking about L.Cohen, who i can just see me buying
now a cd of now :) Except i had always pictured them in a resturant, and his
score succeding, (shock-horror!) but there you go :)
<p>        Actually i think that interview was the turning point in my liking
for her! Cause she was being sort of ironic, which is always a nice trait in
famous ppl i think :) 
<p>        Yep, suzzane vega might just have the sexiest American accent I've
ever heard... and now she is married, good luck to her!!! (tho i hope she
doesn't record too many 'lovey-dovey, god i love the universe' songs, but i
know that probably sounds selfish. actually i wonder if she will?) 
<p>        But  anyway, looks like Leonard loses out tho, and he will have to
make do with those backing singers...heheh, poor leonard, the vicarious fame
he gets via this list & via her is  pretty funny tho, but i'm afraid my
respect (such as it is) for him still mainly comes from the fact Christian
Slater used him to open up the radio show :)))

Hey! A Leonard Cohen thread, I like it!
<p>
Yep, I can picture Suzanne as the "Suzanne" in Cohen's song.  Speaking
of which, has anyone seen the movie "McCabe & Mrs Miller?"  It came out
in the early 70's starring Warren Beatty & Julie Christie.  Anyhow, the
soundtrack was basically "Songs of Leonard Cohen" and really fits the
mood of the film.  It occurs to me that songs from "Suzanne Vega" could
almost fit as well for the soundtrack.  I always felt this album has 
a brittle imagery to it, much as does the movie (snow and cold preva-
lent throughout).   This dovetails kind of nicely with the talk here
about Leonard & Suzanne, as per the interview, IMHO.
<p>
Re: "Pump Up The Volume" I've read (elsewhere, I think) of the dissat-
isfaction some have with Concrete Blonde's version of "Everybody 
Knows."  Although not as good as the original, I kind of like it.  I 
like the soundtrack, too, although it has it's grating aspect at times.
<p>
If interested in other interpretations of Cohen try "Famous Blue Rain-
coat" by Jennifer Warnes.  She has a nice voice and does a great job
on various songs from the Cohen repertoire, especially the title song.
<p>
Nice to see some conversation here on the list again.

Hi everyone,
<p>
Just a comment on all the Leonard Cohen tribute albums.  I think it was Paul
who brought up Jennifer Warrens' "Famous Blue Raincoat" and I have to say,
I'm with him on that.  My favorite is "Bird on a Wire".  Talk about a
different feel.  When LC sings it, it's kind of depressing (in an interesting
way, though--don't get me wrong--I love it when he sings that song)  But,
when JW sings it, it's almost as if it's inspiring in some way.  That's
what's so great about LC's music.  Depending on who is singing it and how one
of LC's songs can take on different emotions and meanings.
<p>
I'm looking forward to the new tribute albums that SV makes an appearance on.
 That should be great!
<p>
Wendy!

Hi Paul and other Cohen(ettes),
<p>
There was another Leonard Cohen tribute album released about two years ago
named 'I'm Your Fan' by a french company (Oscar?) which featured 'Suzanne' 
performed by James (British pre-Manchester combo, who had an huge hit (on my 
side of the Atlantic at least) with Sit down). Other contributors were Nick 
Cave & the Bad Seeds (massacre version of 'Tower of Song'), House of Love,
R.E.M performs a really vile 'First we take Manhattan' - which is the only
track that despite the almost perfect handcraft of the original performer
is unlistenable as a cover.
<p>
Lloyd Cole, ex-commotions, did a version of Chelsea Hotel (about the infamous
dope-house-hotel in NYC - where Cohen and Janis Joplin became lovers) on this
<p>
album which in my humble opinion is one of the best cover versions i've ever 
heard (of course, i have not yet heard ms. Vega's version of Songs of Isaac).
Perhaps it's the sentimental masculine tone in Cohen's songs that attracts
him ("You said you prefered handsome men/but for me you would make an 
exception" [Chelsea Hotel]) - but together with Matthew Sweet (on
bass-guitar)
and Lou Reed's old backing band, the result feels maudlin in a truly honest
way.
<p>
On Lloyd Cole's visit in Stockholm last year, he played "Famous Blue Rain
Coat"
the song  Paul mentions in the included letter, on solo-guitar. Cole really
has the ability to chose songs (Being Boring (the Pet shop boys), Rent
(ditto)
Vicious (Lou Reed) Children of the Revolution (Marc Bolan), Mystery Train 
(Dylan)). And according to Suzanne Vega, Mr & Mrs Cole play with their child
in
Central Park on Sundays.
<p>

And to answer to the slanderings towards the Esquire - if more Americans read
it they would at least look decent. I'd pick Esquire (or even Foreign
Affairs!)
before SPIN or any other american publications any day.
<p>


Best regards,
<p>

Well, as an added bit of gossip, Mr. Cohen ain't doing that badly himself,
either.   He's about 59 or so, and his significant other is/was Rebecca de
Mornay, at least according to a British music magazine from 1994.

Subj:	Story of Isaac / Song of Tower<br>
Date:	96-01-07 18:02:54 EST<br>
From:	rwalters@zeh2.lafayette.unocal.COM (Rob Walters)<br>
To:	undertow@law.emory.edu<br>

Hello everyone,
<p>
Has anyone listened to the Leonard Cohen tribute album "Song of Tower", and
Suzanne's contribution 'Story of Isaac' yet?  Haven't heard much discussion
about it, so here's my humble opinion.  Some context for the discussion:
1) I've never heard Leonard Cohen's original versions of most of the songs,
so I'm by no means an authority on their history; 2) I much preferred Jennifer
Warnes' tribute from 1986 called "Famous Blue Raincoat" on Cypress Records over
the Song of Tower compilation.  (Is it just me, or is the number of tribute 
albums being released lately kind of getting out of hand?)
<p>
Even if I weren't a Suzanne fan, I believe I'd still say that her performance,
and the arrangement, on 'Story of Isaac' is a quite a few notches above the
other selections.  It's quite a song to begin with, almost transcendental
in the combination of melody, harmonies and lyrics.  Her clear, "up-front" 
vocals and her acoustic guitar work only reinforce this atmosphere.  I think
sometimes an understated, "quiet" voice like Suzanne's is necessary to allow
the power of the lyrics to come through - much as she does with her own songs.
I don't know how anyone can listen to this song - especially the final verse
and ending- "the peacock spreads his fan" and not get chills down their spine! 
<p>
Some overall observations:  Unfortunately, some 'big names' on this record
have really mangled Cohen's great songs.  How?  Over-production, 'over-singing'
and artist-to-song matching that, in some cases, I don't understand.  Besides
'Story of Isaac', I like the version of 'Sisters of Mercy' by Sting and the
Chieftains, plus a couple others, but most of it just doesn't cut it for me.
<p>
I really hope Suzanne considers performing 'Story of Isaac' on her next tour,
<p>
-Rob

Greetings everyone,
<p>
I agree with Rob that Suzanne's cover on the "Tower of Song" tribute is one
of the albums' highlights, along with Peter Gabriel's version of "Suzanne."
 I found the album worth the purchase for those two covers alone.  There are
a few other nice ones as well, but like Rob I found the rest of the album a
little lacking -- a shame, really, because Cohen can write fascinating
material, and since I don't really love his voice I was looking forward to
this album.  A bit disappointing, all things considered (maybe I should have
been tipped off by the album's artwork ... pretty dismal!).  But those two
covers in particular are certainly worth hearing.
<p>
Best to all, and thanks to those who wrote about "Just Passing Through!"<br>
