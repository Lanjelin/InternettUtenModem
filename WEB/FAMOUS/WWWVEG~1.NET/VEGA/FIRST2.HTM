Is that a thistle I see there Stef or am I being Rimmer? And we all

	I'm not new to this email lark; I just have the knack of 
retaining awkwardness in any given situation.<p>
	Well, the first time I heard SV I hated the music (boo, hiss).
My brother played it to send himself to sleep, and that really annoyed
me because *I* was trying to get to sleep myself, sharing the same 
room with him,. But a few years later I borrowed another brother's SV 
tape, having found that I liked her music; so thanks to both of
those brothers mine I got into the music.<p>
	No deep experiences with music have I had, but it did get
me through my first year exams at Uni (it got me to sit still night 
after night and helped me get into the work I was doing); and I 
suppose we all would regard the music itself as a kind of friend, 
someone we can call on when we need them (someone to be with when we
 need to be alone) or when we'd like to see them - or, to carry it to 
breaking point, someone we're glad to 'see' when they turn up 
unexpected, on the radio.	<p>
	I like SV's music, and I like to talk about it, but I'm not
musically-minded enough, or deeply into words, to *really* appreciate 
it. That's probably why I bask in the reflected smarts of all you 
others out there! <p>

Hi,<p>
I've been reading all of these wonderful posts about how everyone
heard Suzanne the first time.  I'm going to be the one to admit the
first time was Luca.  It was on the radio and it stopped me in my
tracks.  The combination of a strong female vocal, a powerful song,
and a folk feel is so powerful and so rare I was thrilled.  I'm really
looking forward to the next album.  I do hope it returns to more of
the folk feel of the first album.<p>
BTW, has anyone noticed how much like Suzanne Vega the new Lisa Loeb
single sounds, Do You Sleep, sounds.  I mean the opening which the
tight strong vocals, not the wimpy rock chorus.<p>

Subject: First time hearing Suzanne<p>
Greetings all,<p>
I'm brand new to the list, so it seems fitting that the first thread I
encounter concerns the first time we heard Suzanne's music.<p>
I was a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania, when I received a
cassette from a friend at Harvard who had just seen two folk singers playing
in a Cambridge coffeehouse.  They turned out to be Suzanne Vega and Christine
Lavin, and the tape was a copy of Suzanne's first album.  Like many on this
list, I was hooked on Suzanne's music and vision from the first song, and had
the pleasure of seeing her at the Chestnut Cabaret in Philadelphia just
before moving to Chicago in the summer of '87.<p>
A year later, in the first months after starting a TV and music production
company and initiating a documentary on rape and sexual assault called "Why
Am I Hiding," I was reviewing the footage we shot and also beginning to think
about the music score I was going to write for the show.  As I pulled out the
tapes and the script, I popped the first album into the CD player and heard
"Cracking," and immediately felt that in this song and in "Straight Lines"
Suzanne had already written the music score for this program and its brave
survivors.  I made a request to Suzanne through her manager Ron Fierstein,
and they generously agreed to donate the songs to the documentary, which was
shown nationally and which had been used to help literally millions of people
across the country.  It remains a wonderful and thrilling feeling to know
that we were able to team up, even in a small way, to bring comfort and
support to the millions of abuse survivors in the country.<p>
As a footnote, the agreement to use Suzanne's music helped lay the groundwork
for a documentary we just completed on a day in the life of touring
musicians.  The show, which is called "Just Passing Through," features Julia
Fordham, October Project and Shawn Colvin -- and Shawn is managed by Ron
Fierstein, too, so that helped in getting the ball rolling.  I'm guessing
that there may be some fans of these three artists on this list, so if anyone
wants information about when this show might be broadcast in your area, I
will be happy to let you know.<p>

At any rate, Suzanne's work has always had a special place in my heart, and
her intelligence and willingness to take musical and lyrical risks make her a
very special artist, indeed.  And a sparkling performer in concert -- I am
always refreshed and warmed by her humor and wit in her live shows.<p>
Thanks for the chance to reminisce -- <p>

Subject: Re: A decade of Suzanne!<p>
Bob et al,<p>
I'm going to reveal some things in this message that I probably should 
keep to myself, but Bob's eloquent confessional about his first 
experiences with Suzanne has inspired me.<p>
My first experience was a visual one.  It was 1987 and i kept hearing her 
name mentioned but I didn't know who everyone was talking about.  One 
night, I set the VCR to tape a late night video show to catch the new U2 
video and Janet Jackson videos.  When I sat down the next day to watch 
them, I FF through the ones I didn't want to watch to get to the ones I 
did.  On one of these FF trips, I saw this interesting Black and White 
video with this androgynous face looking very shy and introverted 
singing.  I had to stop and watch.  I had to stop and listen.  It was the 
Luka video.  <p>
I proceeded to watch that video many many times that day--crying 
sometimes because of the content.  Interested intellectually that 
something that personal and profound would be "popular".  By the next day 
I had the tape and a few days after that I had the first abum too.  I 
remeber that summer vividly.  When I listen to both albums, especially 
together, I go back to that summer and the time I spent alone in my room 
learning about writing--where writing comes from--what writing is about 
(the personal that is universal)  I think if I've learned anything about 
writing from Suzanne, it is that!  She said onece, "I write about that 
part of myself that is common to everyone."  (I'm probably paraphrasing) 
I took that to heart and I can see it in the subject matter that she 
works with.  (This will come into play in the topic I hope you'll all 
explore with me later)<p>
Also, I learned about my sexuality.  I guess I had a crush on 
Suzanne--because she caused so many emotions and awakings in me, I 
couldn't help but have a little crush.  After a couple of years, I 
accepted that I have feelings for womyn that go far beyond anything I'd 
ever known.  Six years later I "came out" as  lesbian!  But it started w/ 
my little crush on Suzanne that I didin't understand.  (I share this 
because it is the end of our National Coming Out Week festivities here at 
USC--Happy coming Out week to all "Family" and to anyone who used 
National Coming Out Day yesterday as an opportunity to "come 
out"--congratulations)<p>

That is my confession!<p>

It's 1985. I'm in my final year of high school, attending a miserable,
Dickensian hellhole of a South African boarding school. My staple diet
for the last several years has been buttered toast (no other food was
edible), humiliation (a boarding school staple), angst (that whole
puberty thing was a real bitch) and thrash metal (Satan is, like, really
cool, DUDE!).<p>
Now, at this point, commercial (American-style) radio had only recently
entered the enlightened Republic of South Africa. The two commercial
stations (Capital Radio 604 and 702 - yes, we are talking AM here)
concentrated on the top 40/dance genre, which left us with the truly
bizarre situation of the state run radio playing alternative music, as
they could not possibly compete with the commercial powers.<p>
So, it's late at night. I'm hidden under the covers of a hideously
uncomfortable bed with a clandestine '60s vintage transistor radio
handed down from my brother, listening to Radio 5. It's a foggy, cold,
winter night. That's the first time I heard _Marlene on the Wall_
(followed by, believe it or not, Deep Purple's _Smoke on the Water_; for
a couple of years there, the state radio station was the most bizarre
and wonderful station I've ever heard).<p>
Unlike most others here, this wasn't an immediate life changing
experience. I liked the song a lot (which was truly amazing, since at
that point in my life, my idea of a good band was something with several
umlauts in the name and a really, really fast guitarist), but I didn't
rush out and buy the album. I remembered the name (who can forget a name
like Vega?), and I remember being mildly amazed when I discovered that
that odd _Left of Center_ song that was getting so much airplay was by
the same woman, but for the most part, Suzanne just sat there quietly in
my subconscious.<p>

About two years later, I'm in America (Utah, to be precise) attending
college. I start hanging out with a couple of hippies. They introduce me
to... well... a lot of things. But among them was a re-introduction to
Ms. Vega. I still wouldn't call myself a true fan yet, but now I own the
albums (_Suzanne Vega_ & _Solitude Standing_), even if my favorite bands are
still from gloomy Scandinavian countries and have names like
"Destruction" and "HellSpawn" (with gratuitous umlauts, of course).<p>
Now it's 1991. I'm getting married to a lovely young lady who just
happens to be a Vega freak. The albums get a lot of airplay now (even
though we are both to be very disappointed in _Days_ - still my least
favorite album). I'm really excited when I find _Suzanne Vega_ on CD.
I'm becoming a fan. My musical tastes are shifting - I find myself
listening to reggae, zydeco, industrial, folk, funk; almost anything
goes.<p>
Now it's 1993. Suzanne is coming to town on the _99.9_ tour. I'm not too
excited, even though I like the album; I don't think it would make a
good live show. My lovely wife will hear none of it, and we're off to
the show.<p>
Wow.<p>
Hot damn!<p>
WOW!<p>
After nearly ten years of listening to Suzanne on and off, it took the
live show to make me a freak. Probably the single best show of my life.
No words can do it justice - if they could, we wouldn't need Suzanne to
sing them for us. All I can say is - come back, come back soon, come
back often!<p>
So Suzanne wasn't a bolt of lightning for me. It was a very slow,
organic sort of thing that mouldered away in the back of my mind for
years before growing into the full grown Vega-obsession I have now. A
sort of thread through my life through ten very long years since I was
that miserable and angry boy hiding under the covers in the dark.<p>
But all I have to do is listen to _Marlene on the Wall_ and I'm back
there again.<p>

twas luka.  always was curious to hear more, but never bought any of the
albums. heard first two albums through a friend; immediately needed to buy
them, buy more. at that point it was pre-99.9 diasappointed with Days of...
devoured 99.9 when it came out.  her music filled a void; you can only
listen to that sting album so many times a day.<p>
  what appealed initially was her voice, (combined with her songwriting
style.) I like how she enunciates her words and sounds as if she's right
there in the room with you (a post-production effect, I guess). I read the
interview in Songwriter(?) magazine in which she appeared on the cover
(post 99.9) and she elaborated on her strengths and her weaknesses (short
phrases to compensate for melodies).  Particularly soothing is her vocal
style, in that she doesn't sing full voice most of the time. <p>
 Favorite album: Solitude Standing.  Question: last line in "night vision":
"I can only give you night vision." I know what night vision is...I think,
but how is it being used in that line? I can't say I usually grapple over
lyrics, as it's the music and the artist's voice that grabs my attention
from the start. one more thing about WhyILikeSVega: nontraditional
subjects.<p>

I was a sophomore in college when I first heard Suzanne - her first
(and still my favorite probably).  I was able to play her albums a lot
on my radio shows [college and regular ol' commercial FM].  And I got
to see her in a tiny venue - Memorial Chapel, Union College, in
upstate New York, which seats maybe 500?  I was in the second row with
my best friend from college who happened to be the person who arranged
for the concert...<p>

I can't really remember the "first" time I picked up on Suzanne's mu-
sic; however, I *do* remember first buying it.  We lived in Philadel-
phia at the time and I know I must have read about her, perhaps in 
Rolling Stone (which gave her first album a great review).  We (my
ex and my 3 yr old) were at Sam Goody's and "Solitude Standing" had
first come out.  I think "Luka" was starting to get airplay, but
had not made any "waves" just yet.  I'd probably heard it played on
WXPN or WHFS out of D.C.  There were two teenage girls looking over
her tapes (I seem to recall Suzanne attracted teen and "bohemian" 
girls); after they left I reached out and grabbed the first album
(well, cassette that is or was), rather than the new one.<p>
When we got to the car I popped it into the tape player and it began
a long stretch of "heavy" rotation in our car.  It became the sound-
track to our weekend trips to my brother's home on the Eastern Shore
of Maryland or to my parents near Richmond.  It was great to be driving 
at night across the great, long stretches of open highway with "Some 
Journey," "Small Blue Thing," "Undertow" and the rest blasting while my 
family slept.  Just me and Suzanne heading south with no cares in the 
world.  Soon I began lifting favorites (favorites? how about *all* of 
them!) to add to my own home-made compilation tapes.  I enjoyed 
juxtaposing Suzanne with, say, Bruce Cockburn or World Party.  Still 
do...<p>
Those songs still bring back fond memories and I can't listen to
"Some Journey" now without remembering all those "journeys" taken
with the songs from that first album ringing in my ears.  Thanks for
being along for the ride, Suzanne...<p>

Hi everybody,<p>
	My first introduction to Suzanne Vega I don't in fact remember, but I just
heard about it from my uncle.  He was picking my up from school one day when
Iwas five or six, and listening to Suzanne Vega's first album on headphones,
and

I wanted to know what he was listening to, so he put them on my head right as

she was singing "I am friend to the undertow I am take you in I don't let

go..." and I was scared (I was very easily scared when I was little) and

threw

the headphones of my ears, or something.<p>

	Well, a different uncle gave my mom the same album on CD, and at the time we

had no CD player.  One night maybe a month later a friend came over with her

portable CD player and hooked our speakers up to it.  I came out of my violin

lessons into the dining room to the beginning of "The Queen and the Solider"

and I loved it instantly.<p>

Subject: Uk singles<p>



Hi folks,<p>



I've been quiet for awhile so I think it's time for me to come out of

lurking. Someone asked about UK CD singles for Blood Makes Noise. Well in

order for sales of a single in the UK to be counted for a chart position

the single can only be released on four formats/styles. When heroes Go Down

and 99.9F were released as two CDs (1 jewel case, and 1 digipak), 1 tape

and a 7" vinyl single. However Blood makes Noise was as follows:<br>

1) jewel case CD<br>

2)tape<br>

3)7" vinyl<br>

4) 12" vinyl<p>



ie. the 12" vinyl was released in place of the digipak CD.<p>



There was also a promo CD in a jewel case, a promo CD in a slip in envelope

and a promo 12" vinyl (made in the EEC). The 12" vinyl promo had the house

version, master mix club, reggae hip hop, and dance hall version. There was

also two different American 12" vinyl promos. These are the ones that I

have.... there are probably more.<p>



In the past you could release a single on as many formats as you liked and

some people used to release a 7" vinyl, 7" vinyl picture disc, 12" vinyl,

12" vinyl picture disc, tape CD jewel case, CD digipak. Die hard collectors

would buy all formats and the single would then sail into the chart. So to

make things fairer the four format rule was introduced.<p>



As for the first time I heard Suzanne it was way back in 1987 when I was

only 16 years old. Being in the sixth form we had the priviledge of a

radio. One day Marlene On The Wall came on and I was immediately interested

but the DJ didn't say who was singing. A couple of days later Luka was

played and again the DJ didn't say who was singing. I asked if anyone else

who was in the room knew who it was and luckily for me one guy did. He

taped the Solitude Standing album (I do now own a legal copy..... several

in fact) for me and I was just blown away. That weekend I gathered my

savings together and bought the first album. Then after that I began

picking things up at record fairs... so today my collection is quiet large.

<p>

I was truly in awe of Suzanne for a long time and basically refused to

listen to other artists or recognise that they could be as talented as

Suzanne but my ears have been opened now.  So for my desert island discs I

would have to choose:<p>



1) Suzanne Vega- Suzanne Vega or Solitude Standing (tough decision)<br>

2) Indigo Girls- Nomads* Indians* Saints (I first heard them at the 1992<br>

Newport Folk Festival. I was there to see Suzanne and they played the next

day. I'm a huge fan of theirs now so.... a VERY BIG THANK YOU Suzanne.)

3) Shawn Colvin- Fat City<br>

4) Nanci Griffith- Storms<br>

5) Mary Chapin Carpenter- Shooting Straight In The Dark<br>

6) Lou Reed- Berlin<br>

7) Caroline Aiken- any of her albums... they're all great<br>

8) kristen Hall- any of her albums... they're all great (and yes I do mean

Hall and not Hersh but Kristen Hersh is great too)<br>

9) James Hall- My Love Sex & Spirit<br>

10) Melissa Etheridge- Yes I Am<br>

11) Aimee Mann- Whatever<p>



I saw Nanci Griffith in concert on Sunday and she again had Frank Christian

as her support act. Frank played guitar on Suzanne's first album... have a

look in the credits. He was also one of the original co-op/Fast Folk Music

Magazine people with Suzanne. he's an amazing guitar player.<p>

reading all the posts, I get the idea that most people listen to artists 

whose content/style is very close to SV's. As far as I'm concerned, 

liking SV doesn't conflict with liking, say, Pixies. For what it's worth, 
here goes my top 10 (in no particular order)<p>
Cowboy Junkies -  The Trinity Session<br>
Pixies - Doolittle<br>
John Coltrane - Soul Trane<br>
Handel - Water Music<br>
Madredeus - Os dias da madredeus (portuguese band, doubt you get it outside)<br>
REM - Life's Rich Pageant<br>

ick Cave & the Bad Seeds - Live Seeds<br>

U2 - Achtung Baby<br>

Lou Reed - New York<br>

Suzanne Vega - Suzanne Vega<br>



As to when I first heard Suzanne, I must confess it was when `Luka' was 

released - back in Portugal there was the added 'publicity' that 

Ironbound spoke of 'Portuguese women' (It seems Suzanne was inspired by 

Newark, where there is a large Portuguese comunity). Anyway, later I 

bought the record and read the lyrics. I was surprised.<p>



Also, most of my friends thought that Suzanne was this folkie singer, 

neglecting to notice that the lyrics were somewhat unexpected - except 

when they heard 'Neighborhood Girls', which they classified as Suzanne's 

Lou Reed song (that was a compliment, by the way). Knowing that Reed 

_was_ an influence on Suzanne, I wonder if she set out to deliberately 

write a Lou Reed-ish kind of song.<p>

Hi there everyone,<p>



I know the messages on the subject of the first time we heard SV has been

going for some time.   I have been trying to remember when, how,  what was I

doing at the time and what was the song.   It has really depressed me that I

can't remember. <p>



It is so unlike me as groups/singer that are special to me I can almost

remember the time I first heard them !!! For example REO Speedwagon  I first

herd on the radio on a cold November morning at 7:05 singing One Lonely
Night.   I just pulled the cover over my head and fell asleep --- end result
I was late for college .   Then there is Barclay James Harvest, Runrig, Suzy
Bogges .......... I think I have mad my point.    In a strange way this
makes SV special which of course she is as her music is so magical but we
all know that.<p>
I have found this line really great and some of the stories really moving <p>
Anyway bye for now<p>

Hi again.  I noticed that people are sharing their experiences of hearing
Suzanne for the first time....  I first heard her in late 1985 or early 1986
when a friend of mine played the first album for me while at her house.  It
was love at first sound.  I went out and bought the album that very night
and have been listening ever since.  We were both on the tennis team
together in high school and were doubles partners...and we used to sing all
the songs from the first album while we were playing tennis everyday.<p>

... also for me, to step from anonymity. I feel like something of a 
late bloomer in this company of 1985/86-ers. My first time of hearing
Suzanne was quite a bit later and I feel a bit guilty here because I
don't remember when exactly that was. Probably something like 1989
and it was either Luka or Book of Dreams on the radio. Place Prague,
still in Czechoslovakia soon to be reduced to Czech Republic. I
wasn't smitten or anything like that, I just liked the songs, mostly
music actually because I couldn't quite follow the texts. It took
me some time before I learned the name of the singer, hmm, Suzanne
Vega, cool name! And the story could have ended right there if Suzanne
hadn't come to Prague for a concert (ah, those dates again, my best
guess is 1990/91) and if my American friend Tracy who was teaching
English in Prague then didn't happen to have an additional ticket
for the show. So there I went, no big expectations, tickets rather
cheap so what the hell... and so I stepped into one of the biggest
surprises of my life! Apart from the music which was amazing, I also 
fell in love with this wonderful woman onstage - I still can't explain
what exactly it was which drew me to her but it was very real. Mind
you, it wasn't an entirely satisfying relationship - apart from the
one-way only communication (is that still communication?) we got into
right in the beginning, she also made the unfortunate blunder of
calling my language Czechoslovakian... I felt very hurt for about
10 seconds before the next song started and everything else was
forgotten. The next day, after a rather sleepless night, I ran into
a music store and bought Days of Open Hand on vinyl and spent a lot
of time in my room listening to it over and over again, just Suzanne and I.
I got very very close to sending her a tape of a Czech group called
Nerez which I felt (and still do)  had a very strong musical connection
to Suzanne's music. Alas, I didn't and it bugs me still when I happen
to think about it again, like right now. She probably wouldn't have
gotten it anyway but I'd feel much better (sigh).
<p>
To make the confession complete, I must admit that to these days,
Days of Open Hand is my favourite album as far as Suzanne's music
goes which I gather puts me into a major minority on this list but
I DON'T CARE!! And who knows, maybe this letter will bring some similarly
inclined souls in the open - come on, don't hide! :-)

PS. I forgot to mention that the next concert happened for me here
in Vancouver, I think 1993, in Commodore which is a former ballroom
place and totally amazing concert site - the biggest advantage being
that you can get REALLY close to the stage and happily frolic around
on the wooden floor which seems to happily frolic with you. As great 
as it was, the first time was the first time!

Hello everyone, As Wendy stated earlier I've been lurking around but never
actually posted any messages.  When the discussion of Days Of Open Hand
started I knew It was time to post.  I began listening to Vega in 87 after I
heard Luka.  I bought the Solitude Standing and fell in love...that
voice...so ethereal and sensual.( I don't know what she whispers during the
music breake between verses in Iroundbound, but till this day it still sends
chills up and down my back.)  <p>
     I then bought Suzanne Vega and my love affair continued...so simple yet
so strong.  Her angelic voice shining on Undertow.  And the I must turn my
stereo all the way up during the intrumental finale of Some Journey...I can't
begin to express how that makes me feel.<p>
     Then, with great anticipation, I purchased Days of Open Hand when It was
first released.  A Masterpiece!  This is truly her best album to date.  The
whole idea behind the album...the future...and creativity.  Rusted Pipe is my
favorite song.  I see it as her final confrontation with her struggle of
creativity.  Language spoke of her frustrations, but here she faces her
fears.  "Now the time has come to speake...."  The reason I love this album
so much is that I too had had problems expressing myself...yet listning to
this album put it all in perspective.  The production was also
exceptional...the music blended beautifully with her voice.  Pilgramage was a
perfect example of how her own voice used as backup created a very
pleasureable effect.  Let's not forget 50/50 Chance, where Glass' somber
string arrangement went perfect with Suzanne's chilling and disturbing
lyrics.  Men In A War is folk rock at its best.  Like Suzanne said her
self..."Songs to inspire waking hours and dreams alike"<p>
    I had the pleasure of catching the Tour of Open Hand, here in Miami.  I
had front row left and enjoyed myself .  She played almost every song from
Days...That night closed yet another chapter in this wonderful novel she is
continiually writing for us.<p>
    Unfortunately, she has not returned to S. Fla and I have had to travel a
distance(mainly New York) to see her in concert.  I had the rare opportunity
to catch a sort of workshop she did at the Doral Inn in Manhattan.  She is so
funny, witty and refreshingly real.  Well I've said enough...for now.
 Days.... is her best, I know she'll continiue to record great records but
I'll always treasure this one.<p>

Thanks for listening.<br>

Hi all,<p>

I was a very late bloomer in respect to my first encounter with Suzanne's music.
It was in 1989 (yes, I know you're all in shock).  I entered a coffee shop,
ordered a tea from a very nice lady, sat down and started drinking and
reading a book.  From where I was sitting, I couldn't see the lady (there
was a separation).  There was no music.  After about ten minutes, I start
hearing a voice singing "I am sitting in the morning at the dinner on the
corner..."  I was stunned.  Since the song has no instrumentation and I had
never heard it before (nor Suzanne) I immediate assumed it was the "coffee
lady" who was singing.  WOW!!  I thought - This "coffe lady" has the most
warm, beautiful voice I have EVER heard!!  I got up and approached her to
listen to this "heavenly voice" closer, only to find out the obvious. Yes,
she was playing the first track from Solitude Standing on the stereo. I did
feel very silly!  The rest is history.

This is amazing!!!!  Finally, I can glorify SuzieV without side-long looks
from others.  The majority of my friends are either head-bangers or 'just not
into that music stuff'.  I am truly enjoying the interaction of this group.  
<p>
I would have spoken up sooner, but between my job as a sr. systems analyst at
a major airline and co-founder of a software development company, (with a Nov
1 product roll-out date) I have just not had the time to keep up or write.
 That has changed, obviously.
<p>
Now it is apparent from the last paragraph that I am not exactly the art-zie
type.  You might even suspect that I am a heavy left-brainer.  That's not the
case.  I enjoy originality and talent.  Both of which Suzanne has.  I am a
very aural person and suzanne's sound is soothes something deep down in my
souls.  I'm afraid lyrics just don't do much for me.  I have always held the
opinion that if I wanted words I would open a book of poetry.  (This coming
from someone who doesn't watch much football because of the opinion 'If I'm
not playing, it must not be important'.   That should give you an idea of my
mind set, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.)
<p>
I joined this list a few months back.  On the very day I was reminiscing
about the first time I heard SV, I received the note titled 'A Decade of
Suzanne', which detailed the first time of a gentleman whose name eludes me.
 I felt at home.  I felt like I had made a dozen new friends.  I enjoyed the
notes that followed.  In that spirit I would like to share my own story.
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
If memory serves, it was way back in '82-'83.  Whenever her first album.  I
would check the my CD but all my jewel cases are stack in the closet.
 Anyway, I was in Brady, Texas visiting my girlfriend / first true love.  I
lived in Dallas (and still do) and could only see her twice out of the
month...    when I could save up enough gas money.  We were laying in each
others arms on her parents sofa.  I shall leave out the details.  The
television was on.  We had just finished watching a movie on HBO when the
video for 'Marlene on the Wall' came on.  The first few strums of the
acoustic guitar caught my attention.  I looked up and saw a fairly attractive
woman with a beautiful voice.  In fact, I think the only think I noticed was
the blend of voice and guitar.  The video played out and I was mesmerized.
 My lovers repeated attempts to attract my attention failed.  I think she was
more concerned that I was watching another woman rather than thinking I was
ignoring her.
<p>
Ever had one of those times in your life when everything seems perfect?  It
was a peaceful spring day in a small Texas town.  The windows were open and a
breeze with every scent in the world was blowing pass us.  It was bliss.
 Suzanne in my ears.  My lover at my lips and the whole world a distant
dream.  I was at peace.
<p>

I thank both of the women who took me there.
