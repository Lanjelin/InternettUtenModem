Subj:	Pulp Fiction's Vincent Vega is Suzanne's cousin<BR>

 The Criterion laser disc of Pulp Fiction was released yesterday. It has
 about 1 1/2 hours of supplementary material, including some deleted scenes.
 The scene where Vincent Vega (John Travolta) picks up Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) to go to dinner
 at Jackrabbit Slim's was originally longer. It included the following:
 <p>
 Mia:     What's your name?<BR>
 Vincent: Vincent Vega.<BR>
 Mia:     Any relation to Suzanne Vega?<BR>
 Vincent: Suzanne Vega's my cousin.   <BR>
 Mia:     Suzanne Vega the folk singer is your cousin?<BR>
 Vincent: Suzanne Vega is my cousin. If she's become a folk singer, I sure as
 hell don't know nuthin about it. <BR>

Remember this little talk here about how Suzanne looked like Pulp Fiction's
Uma Thurman on the Caramel single cover? (in my opinion, Tarentino made UMA
look like Suzanne). And someone posted recently that in the long version of
the movie, Travolta's character says Suzanne Vega is her cousin. And Uma
playing in The Truth About Cats And Dogs with Suzanne music... 
<p>
Well I've just read today that Uma is starting a movie about the life of...
Marlene Dietrich, and she plays Marlene's role. The movie is being shot by
Pedro Almodovar (great Spanish movie-maker). She will probably look more
like Suzanne in her 'Marlene On the Wall' video (which I find almost
hilarious) than Marlene herself. 
<p>
That makes one more Suzanne/Uma connection, isn't that getting kind of weird?

That is interesting...
<p>
They're also both native NuJork kids raised by
boho-multicultural-60's type parents and have some
connection to Bhuddism. These factoids I have gathered
from a Vanity Fair feature and from that vega.net website.

Well I resent that, but if you're talking about who makes you think of
Suzanne, here's my little fantasy: <BR>
I think Suzanne would make a really really great Dana Scully (X-Files), you
know: shyly sexy pale-skined doctor who keeps from getting even slightly
sentimental and who always manage to keep a lot (too much sometimes)
perspective whatever happens... even though being experimented on by aliens
isn't quite the same kind of adventure as having a cup of coffee at Tom's
Diner.

        I don't know if anyone here has read Harlan Ellison's (as yet
unproduced) screenplay of "I, ROBOT", but when I did I realized Suzanne
would be the ONLY choice for the character of Susan Calvin. Well, I think
so, anyway.

I would love to see Suzanne in the role of Cheryl Taggart in 
ATLAS SHRUGGED.

I don't think so ; the character of Dana Scully is very far from SV's
personality, who is not as sexy as Dana, but SV is certainly nicer and
sweeter. Anyway, maybe I haven't seen enough X-Files episodes...
<p>
Just a little word : I am really really really jealous of the those who saw
Suzanne recently ! However, I hope it was great.
<p>

Bye,
Erik.

Hey, guys --
<p>
	A bunch of people sent me e-mail asking who Cheryl Taggart was
in ATLAS SHRUGGED.
<p>
	She was NOT the heroine. That was Dagny Taggart. Cheryl Taggart
was the woman who married Dagny's brother, James. She goes through an 
intense period of self-realization when she discovered that basically
her husband has lying to her through an intensely-orchestrated series
of "revelations". Though his lies and humanities' indifference to them 
eventually drives her to suicide, Cheryl still stands out as one of 
the more heroic characters in the book. 
<p>
	Cheryl and Suzanne have the same kind of understated intensity
to me. The first time I read the book after having heard and seen 
Suzanne, I immediately visualized her as Cheryl.
