Subj:	Taratata review<br>
Date:	97-02-03 18:53:15 EST<br>
From:	algranti@club-internet.fr (David Algranti)<br>
<p>
I'm just back from the taping of Taratata. 
<p>
I went there with David B. and Nael, both from the list. Waiting in the line
we noticed there was 75 people from some Phil Collins fan-club, so we
thought that our 3-men-fan-club should yell very loud. 
<p>
First came the hostess, cool Alexandra Kazan. Then Phil Collins came in,
acclaimed by a (requested) standing ovation. He sang a song, then chatted a
bit with Alexandra, then chose a rerun of Annie Lennox performance. Then chat. 
<p>
THEN SUZANNE came and played Luka with her band. Great version and Suzanne
looked great. She was very well dressed, with a short dress that looked like
a cooking smock (really it was cool, but I'm not good at describing
clothes), a mid-long leather jacket and... tall leather high-heeled boots!
Really cool. Then she joined Alexandra and Phil. She was not very
comfortable but had the public laugh a few times, mostly because she would
often answer Alex's questions by "yes" or "no", though very politely. The
public wasn't making fun of Suzanne at all, but more of Alex who didn't ask
very interesting questions. She said that her voice had changed since she
had Ruby, but right now she had a cold so it sounded like her old voice.
She told what are the 9 objects. She said that the first time she met Phil
was at the Prince's Trust Concert, and that once she saw him in Japan but he didn't
see her. 

<p>Then she chose to see a rerun of Lou reed performing "Take a Walk On The
Wild Side" in a previous Taratata, and said she had met him a few times.
Alex seemed to wait for a funny anecdote or comment, but Suzanne hadn't
anything to say, so she just said he was the first person she had ever seen
in concert. 
<p>
After that, they chatted a little (with Phil), but nothing worth reporting
here. Except maybe that she said that the idea of 'The Thin Man' had been
partly inspired by a Jacques Brel's song. then blah blah
<p>
Then Phil and her went to sing a song that Suzanne had chosen, with
Suzanne's whole band (plus a second fat bearded man, I mean besides Pete
Thomas): Waterloo Sunset, by the Kinks. That was really great, they both
sang the whole song together. She wasn't playing guitar and had to read the
lyrics (Phil too). I wish they would include that song to the tour set. 
<p>
Then they went back to chat and Phil said they had rehearsed all day but he
did it wrong. Alex gently replied that nobody had noticed, and turned to
Suzanne: "did he do it bad?" and Suzanne ironically said "Noooooooo". Blah
blah, then she left (wait, wait she's gonna come back). 
<p>
Then came (burp!) East 17 / chat / duet with Phil... 
<p>
Then Suzanne came back and sang Headshots. Great! good whistling at the end
too. 
<p>
Then Phil... The End. 
<p>
I think she made the right move making that show. I guess that a lot of
people will watch the show for Phil, then see Suzanne sing Luka and think
"oh, yeah i remember that girl" (and they'll see how beautiful she is, the
filming of that show is always outstanding (not that she needs good filming
to be beautiful)), then they'll see the duet and think "wow she's somebody",
and then they will carefully watch Headshots and run buy the single (cause
it really needs to be released as a single), and the album too, and then buy
tickets for her shows in France (Alex told the dates but forgot the one in
Lyons). The show in Paris is March 17, and Taratata will be broadcast March
13. That's a bit tight, but Im sure it will help a lot. 
<p>
Me I saw three songs, plus interviews live for free. Actually I lost a buck
in the chocolate-bar machine but i'm sure you don't want to know. 
<p>
I hope you'll hear Waterloo Sunset sometime. Taratata has released two
compilations of duets so far. Maybe if they release a third one, it will
include this song (cross your fingers). 
<p>
David.

<p>
Hi Folks,
<p>
I'm back on the list!!
<p>
For all the people in the UK, Time Out magazine has a two page
article/interview with Suzanne.... so get it while you can. I'll type it up
for the list/web site tomorrow.
<p>
Suzanne's appearance on the National Lottery was a wise move...... 16
million viewers!!! Unfortunately, Suzanne didn't bring me any luck..... I
didn't win anything.
<p>
Glad to be back<br>
Sharon
<p>
PS. I will be at the Norwich, Cambridge and Nottingham shows if anyone
wants to meet..... drop me an e-mail by Friday afternoon because I hit the
road Saturday morning :)

Subj:	Fwd: First '97 gig @ UEA Norwich England<br>
Date:	97-02-08 20:01:46 EST<br>
From:	sm@sys.uea.ac.uk (Shaun McCullagh)<br>
<p>
Was jolly good. Three Encores, lots of stuff from all the albums.
<p>
Some really excellent stuff from 99.9F, really brought the album to life.
<p>
Last number was 'Men in War', seemed appropriate considering the incredibly
punishing tour schedule which I just looked at on the site.
<p>
I don't how Suzanne can find the stamina....
<p>
The least I can do do is go and see them again in Cambridge tomorrow.
<p>
Nice to AIl at the the gig.
<p>
Cheers

Subj:	Norwich & Cambridge Concerts<br>
Date:	97-02-10 19:41:58 EST<br>
From:	rob@collins.dungeon.com (Robert Collinson)<br>
<p>
Hello everyone,
<p>
Well, what a great week-end I've just had !
<p>
Saw Suzanne in concert on Saturday at Norwich University and on Sunday 
at Cambridge Corn Exchange.
<p>
Luckily for me, both venues are less than 70 miles from where I live.
<p>
It's thanks to the e-mail from VegaNet we received last December about the
tour dates, that I managed to get such good tickets. For the Norwich
concert (an all standing venue) I had tickets numbered 00001 and 00002
and for Cambridge I had front row seats!
<p>
I tend to keep the tickets for all the concerts I've been to over the years
(not just Suzanne's) and have built up a bit of a collection. So I was
disappointed to find that on entering the Norwich venue the security
person was taking and keeping the whole ticket ! :(   When I asked her if I
could at least have part of it she said "No, but I will be handing them out
at the end of the show". Then she noticed the number and said "Oh you
want number 1 back do you ? I'll put it in my top pocket and if you see me
after, I'll give it back" :)) 
<p>
Anyway, my ticket is the only souvenir I'll have of the event as I didn't
see any merchandise on sale.  
 <p>
After having a quick drink at the bar, I took up position directly in front
of the microphone stand but a few feet back. I never thought I'd see
Suzanne at Norwich UEA again. It's quite a small hall and my favorite 
place for seeing bands live. The last time she played here was in 
November 1986 a few days after the Royal Albert Hall shows in London. 
The only other time I think she played in Norwich was at Saint Andrews
Hall (an old church) on the very day that 'days of open Hand'  was
released. Part of that show was televised live on a program called
'Rock Steady' and I remember that a then virtually unknown
Lenny Kravitz also played a short set before Suzanne!
<p>
I really enjoyed the Norwich concert. I won't list what was played in case
it spoils things for those who are going to the other shows. It was nice
for me to be able to bear in mind that I had it all to look forward to
again the following evening. Suzanne didn't tell many 'stories' this night.
She had a little trouble with a person shouting out stupid comments but
dealt with him well. She suggested he was probably a "Scottish person
who had had too much to drink". At the end of the gig Suzanne realized
that some of us would be going to the Cambridge show and joked that we 
could have a lift in the tour bus if we wanted ! Then she remembered it
only had 14 seats ! 
<p>
I was surprised by the number of other people collecting tickets on the
way out !
<p>
Sunday night at Cambridge and the show seemed even better. It started half
an hour earlier at 20:30. The sound was louder but then the venue was a
lot bigger and I was at the front. It was the same set but I think a couple
of songs were in different positions. Suzanne invited the seated audience
to dance and  'do their own thing'  if they wanted. A child's voice could
be heard at the start of the concert. It was coming from a balcony box high
above the stage to Suzanne's left. She acknowledged this by saying 
"I recognize that voice!" She was much more talkative tonight and
commented on the previous night at Norwich. She justified the Scottish 
reference by revealing that her Grandfather was of Scottish descent.
This show really rocked!  The absolute highlight for me was when at the 
climax of 'In Liverpool' , Suzanne came and stood directly in front of me,
and as she strummed furiously on her guitar, she gave me a lovely smile!
<p>
Anyway, sorry to ramble on like this. Hope you enjoy(ed) the show as much
as I did. 
<p>
Bye for now,
<p>
                  Robert

Subj:	Friday's Live Session + Concert today<br>
Date:	97-02-11 04:52:58 EST<br>
From:	n.saber@ic.ac.uk (Nikoo R Saber)<br>
<p>
Hey Undertowers,
<p>
As promised, I did tape Suzanne's live session on Virgin Radio, 105.8FM London,
last Friday. I have to say it didn't live up to my expectations. Don't get me
wrong now; Suzanne's live version of "No Cheap Thrill" was as powerful and
exhilarating as ever. But unfortunately it turned out that her performance was
just a starter (sort of an 'opening act', you might say) for another band
playing live after her... The Bee Gees!!! I presumed that with all the
advertisement and hype for her session, it would last quite a bit, but all I
got on tape was probably less than 10 minutes, with only one song performed.
The interviewer/DJ said that they were going to have another (meaning ONE
other?!) song from SV in about an hours time (probably towards the end of the
BGs' show), but he didn't specify whether she was going to do it live or that
it was an album version, and anyway, I was going out by then, so I couldn't
have taped it. Disappointment! When are the radio DJs (over here at least, I'm
not sure about elsewhere) realize what a great performer Suzanne is, and give
her the coverage  and air-play that she so rightfully deserves?!
<p>
On to my 'subject of the week', SV's concert tonight in London! I've decided to
go to the venue and try my luck, since I haven't found anything through the box
office as of now. Who knows, maybe someone will feel sorry for this Undertower
and give her a ticket! :-(  Keep you posted!
<p>
Suzanne, if you're by any chance reading this, a backstage pass would be more
than welcome, too! Thanx!
<p>
Catch y'all later,
<p>
Nikoo

Subj:	Norwich & Cambridge<br>
Date:	Fri, 14 Feb 1997 11:35:34 +0500 <br>
From:	Sharon Jennings (rcxsj@unix.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk)<br>
<p>
What can I say........ I'm chuffed!!
<p>
Both gigs were good but Cambridge was slightly better....... Suzanne was
extremely funny and the sound was better. They managed to bring dust
down from the rafters both nights..... so you can imagine how much they
rocked!!  The extended music bits of the new songs worked very well but it was the
old favourites that brought a tear to my eye and reminded me of that day
back in 1987 when I first heard Suzanne. Not sure yet about the
arrangement of "Luka" though..... I missed seeing Marc Shulman flailing around
during the guitar solo :)
<p>
I arrived early at Norwich and got a spot right in front of Suzanne.
There was a drunk heckler and she dealt with him very swiftly. Glad to see
that Suzanne still has her sharp sense of humour :)
<p>
Cambridge was a better venue and the audience was there to listen and
not to chat all the way through. Quite a few people knew the new songs which
is a good thing. They must have bought the album as an import..... but that
is not good news for when it's released here in a few weeks because only UK
sales will count towards a chart position.
<p>
I braved the cold after the Cambridge gig to wait for Suzanne to emerge.
She said that she was going to post a pre-tour message to the list but
that her computer is on the blink ie. it's knackered :) She is hoping to get
another one soon from Apple and will post something then. She told me to
say hi to everyone, so here goes: "Hi".
<p>
The 370 miles (I know that this is short on an American scale but on a
British scale it's quite a journey) round trip was worth it and I'm
looking forward to the Nottingham gig next month.
<p>
Not quite sure what to think of the support act Richard Julian. He was
doing fine until he started singing like Jimmy Somerville...... maybe
his voice will grow on me with time. At times his guitar style reminded me
of Shawn Colvin and I did like his song "Charlie Lewis".
<p>
No merchandise!!!!! Amnesty International were present though and I
ended up donating the price of a t-shirt to them...... maybe that was the plan  :)
<p>
Highlight of the trip: being overtaken at 2.30am by a milk float!!! on the A52.
<p>
Suzanne was interviewed by Richard and Judy on the "This Morning" TV
show yesterday (Tuesday). I'm transcribe the interview and post it soon.....
she then went on to sing "No Cheap Thrill".
<p>
I missed the Virgin radio thingy on Friday..... oh well.
<p>
I can post the set lists if anyone wants them..... I don't want to spoil
anything for those of you who are going to gigs in the next few weeks in
Europe.
<p>
I picked up the CD and tape singles for "No Cheap Thrill" yesterday.....
if anyone abroad wants a copy then e-mail me. The CD is two pounds and the 
tape is one pound (one pound is approximately one and a half US
dollars). Tracks are the album versions of "No Cheap Thrill", "Marlene On The
Wall", "Luka" and "Tom's Diner".
<p>
For Suzanne: Knackered is quite a handy word, though it should not be
used in polite company   :)
<p>
Oh, I'm knackered - translates as tired.
My computer is knackered - translates as broken
Oh damn, I'm really knackered now! - translates as being in trouble
<p>
Take care all<br>

Subj.:	London ramblings....quite long<br>
Date:	Thu, 13 Feb 97 17:53:00 +0000 <br>
From:	Lee Allen (lallen@galileo.co.uk)<br>
<p>
[Note to non-British readers:  "chuffed" means extremely well pleased.  Ed.]
<p>
Hello Undertowers,
<p>
I've appreciated others reports on Mrs. Froom's appearances, so I 
thought I'd do the decent thing and relate my own London experience.
We (that is me and my wife ) got there with loads of time to spare 
and managed to find one of the 'Gold dust' parking spaces near to the 
Empire - well chuffed :) The weather wasn't too conducive to queuing 
so we sought refuge in a the Firkin (just next door) and felt obliged 
to sample the excellent wares. An hour and a half later, the rain had 
eased so we went for the queue. On the way we noticed that there was a 
BBC truck parked by the Empire - future broadcast maybe - anyone know 
anything more about this ? Forty minutes can go by very quickly 
watching the exploits of the west London Ticket touts. A film crew 
were working the queue, they weren't having a good time of it - it 
seemed everyone they chose couldn't speak English very well, or didn't 
know Suzanne very well at all. Finally the doors opened and in we 
swept single mindedly - stage front, stage front, stage front! YES!! 
STAGE FRONT! About six or seven people to the right of the microphone 
as you look at the stage. I'd been to see Suzanne 3 times before and 
always had had crap seats in the upper circle, I'd often wondered what 
you had to do to get tickets at the very front - now I know - be 
lucky! I was impressed by the supporting act - Richard Julian, his 
guitar work was cool, and his songwriting ability clearly wasn't 
lacking. Richard went off, the lights came up, press photographers 
arrived, more press photographers arrived....yet more press 
photographers arrived, the latest arrivals looking very bemused at the 
now crowded photographers pit and venue. One photographer exclaimed - 
"Shit, she's not that popular is she?". One photographer arrived so 
late that there was no room for him in the pit, but as compensation 
was allowed to sit on the stage, and stay for the whole concert rather 
than the usual first three songs.<p>
An age later the house lights were dimmed, and Suzanne sauntered on 
stage with the band. She looked supremely confident and relaxed, 
working the press photographers like a pro' which of course is what 
she is. It was quite interesting to watch her "Cat walk"-ish efforts 
to please them. 
<p>
Other notable events:-
<p>
New shoes - "Black with a big shiny buckle"
<p>
Ruby - Somewhere in one of the upper balconies complaining 
vociferously about Suzanne's anecdotal interludes.
<p>
Bad lighting - Suzanne requests to the lighting director to stop 
shining the light into the upper circle because it was 
blinding the punters.
<p>
Dancing - She gets more comfortable with this side of her 
performance with every tour.
<p>
English slang- Knackered means what!!!!! 
<p>
Smiles - She looked really happy and fired off a particularly 
dazzling smile in my direction.
<p>
Use of hands - Managing to raise her hands over her head without,
to quote herself, "Looking like an asshole"
<p>
The bells... - "The bells of the cathedral" line [in Tom's Diner] still catches people
by surprise, leaving Suzanne with a "Oh no not again" look on her face.
<p>
Holy Grail - I may not have got the set list, but I did get the one
remaining press photographer to pass me Suzanne's drinking water - I was gasping!
<p>
Rude bit - Suzanne's explaination of her visit to the 
Richard & Judy show, lead to some profanity that would
be unuseable by the BBC recording team. Ooops.
Suzanne seemed quite apologetic at her lapse.
<p>
Well that's all I can think of for the moment. If you were there I was 
the tall 'rhythmically challenged' flat topped guy at front right.
<p>
Sorry for the length.....

Subj:	SAW SUZY IN LONDON CONCERT! <br>
Date:	97-02-12 10:24:28 EST<br>
From:	n.saber@ic.ac.uk (Nikoo R Saber)<br>
<p>
Hi Undertowers,
<p>
Well, I'm the living proof that perseverance pays off, BIG TIME! I finally
decided to take a risk and go to the concert venue yesterday evening and try my
luck at finding tickets. It was raining cats and dogs, and by the time I got
there, I was drenched! But, sure enough, tickets 'materialized' in the form of
ticket sellers at the door. My friend and I drew up a good bargain, and ended
up paying only *one* pound more than we would've paid if we'd bought the
tickets directly from the box office! Another piece of luck was that, since we
were there earlier than others (in search of tickets), there wasn't a very long
queue and as we had standing tickets, we got the *BEST* standing position
ever... right at the VERY front of the stage, with the microphone (and
Suzanne!) only 4 feet - about 1.2 m - away from us (the 4 feet in between being
reserved for *seated* photographers)!! I just stood there, not really believing
that after all the frustration and frantic mail postings and god-knows-how-many
phone calls to ticket hotlines, and not even having a ticket an hour before, I
had finally made it, and not only that, I had a place others would KILL for!
The venue, Shepherds Bush Empire (FYI: apparently, the British band Bush hail
from this area of London) had a very nice setting and an intimate atmosphere,
which is ideal for performances such as Suzanne's.
<p>
The opening act was pretty good, but then Suzanne came on, and she was
absolutely AWESOME! I'd never seen her playing live before, and it was
excellent! I had been told by you guys that she's very comfortable with her
audience and surroundings, but I hadn't quite expected how much! She was
kidding around with her band members, and made even the sweating photographers
up front feel at home with her! She was quite talkative, with lots of stories
to tell from her past couple of days in the UK. She said she was happy that she
could actually "see" a couple of faces up front; most of her previous concerts
in London had been in big venues. She urged everyone to "do their own thing"
and dance to the numbers they wanted to ("ofcourse" she said, "I know you
British people are too cool to dance around!"), and the crowd went absolutely
berzerk at her renditions of "Fat Man and Dancing Girl" and "Blood Makes
Noise"! She also made a comment about Ruby wanting "her Mama to sing, not talk"
when she heard a baby's voice (Ruby? I'm not sure). Altogether, a very
laid-back performer, at ease with her audience, her stage and her music. And a
lovely smile that comes every so often (I should know; she was staring me in
the face!). I loved her acoustic versions of "Small Blue Thing" and "The Queen
and The Soldier", and ofcourse everyone joined in for "Tom's Diner", by which
she said she was very impressed! The show had two encores, and then it all
ended, gone by in a flash. There were some people standing outside at the stage
door, waiting for her to come out at the back. I couldn't stay since I had to
catch the last train home, but I would've loved to speak to her or get her
autograph on my album cover.
<p>
Unfortunately, I didn't see any merchandise for sale over there, but I've got a
couple of promo pics from her tour and the "No Cheap Thrill" single, my ticket
stub and ofcourse my memories of a fantastic night of music with SV to remember
the concert by!
<p>
Sorry if I've rambled on for too long! It's just that I had a GREAT time last
night, and I thought I'd share my experience with you. Thanks for all your
support during the last (very hectic ;-) ) week, and especially thanx to Tom
"Marlene on the Web" Bergeon and Deb Lawler who gave me one last push to go
there, no matter what. All I can say to anyone who's going to see Suzanne
perform in the coming weeks on the Europian leg of her tour: YOU'RE IN FOR A
VERY BIG TREAT! ENJOY!

Subj:	Paradiso Amsterdam<br>
Date:	Fri, 14 Feb 1997 12:06:32 +0100 <br>
From:	jan volkers (janvolkers@digitaal.nl)<br>
<p>
Mrs Vega performed in our hippie- temple in Amsterdam last night. Yeah.
<p>
Since her first record i wanted to see her in the flesh, she is a kind
of mystery to me. Well, this was it.
<p>
What attracts me to her music is the vulnerability with which she sings.
It rhymes with the poetry that she writes and is a contradiction to the
fact that she is on stage as a rockstar. I guess one also has to have an
elephant-skin doing that.
She stands like a rock with it. This, along with the fact that i find
her music written and played with very good taste, makes me have a great
respect for her.<p>
Does this make me a fan? yukk...
<p>
Paradiso is for this kind of concert a small place. Very intimate and it
wasn't overcrowded though sold out. Suzanne seemed to enjoy this, even
as the audience wasn't responding much. Maybe it is the kind of people that
come to her concert that is not screaming and jumping frantically around
the place, i am not anyway.
It was nice to see who came. Keywords: softer, introverted, literate,
romantic. People i like.
<p>
Amazing to see what old farts were in her band (sorry guys, i'm one
too!) playing sitting down. But did they _play_ . For sure it is not Suzanne
alone responsible for the high quality of the music.
<p>
Suzanne herself is someone i would describe as peculiar, i feel somehow
uncomfortable at first sight with her. Maybe it is the view of her
feelings that makes me feel uneasy. It appears to be a one way deal, but isn't.
Obviously she enjoys this way of sharing, i felt such a warmth between
her and us during the concert. By the time she was singing 'Gypsy' in one of
the encores she sang right inside me...
Also in the encores she did 'Tom's Diner'. That fragile solo-voice, no
electronic effects, just the support of the audience singing tatatada.
Personally i am not so fond of the housy effects since 99.9F but at this 
stage it is ...ok. If it were only those introspective things, it would be way
too soft. Now there is that *rock*.
So there you have it. I'm so glad to have been there, and it's enough of
me pouring my personal sauce over you now. Hope you enjoyed it and please
reply.
<p>
To Suzanne: if you read this, hope you have tried riding a bicycle in
Amsterdam, i did. Also quite an experience :-)
And Thank You.

Hi fellow-underowers,
<p>
What better way to celebrate Valentine than with a concert of Suzanne 
herself ? Last Friday was the best day of my life I guess. My girlfriend 
and I at the front row of the stage and screaming at the top of our lungs. 
Suzy was absolutely great. Her warmup-gig was also good but quite boring 
compared with her.  But I think that Richard Julian got all the 
attention he wanted.  But Suzanne was great. I waited a whole year (not 
that long) to see her and it was worth waiting for. Only a pity that the 
journalists in the paper can't appreciate her.  Most of those people are 
quite old and anything that doesn't sound like Neill Young is bad. Pity 
though. But that doesn't mean that I and the rest of the people at the 
concert didn't like her !<p>
Like Jan wrote : she was like a sort of mystery. And that night the 
mystery came pretty close to an answer, but not that close anyway. She will 
stay a mystery to me.<p>
She sang about 21 songs over a period of two hours. But it was great. The 
whole band by the way. I thought that the bass-player sometimes looked 
like George Clooney from 'from dusk till dawn' and 'ER'. Or is it only my 
personal opinion/imagination. Anyway, Suzanne brought me a better present on 
Valentine than any other person could [except for my girlfriend :-)]

Hi fellow-undertowers,
<p>
This will be my small contribution to Suzanne's tour coverage.  
First I have to say that I am not an especially devoted fan; by this I mean
that I always remain critical -some say negative- about any performer I see
on stage.  I do love Suzanne Vega (otherwise I wouldn't be on this list,
would I?), but my review of her concert won't be as enthusiastic as Baker
Baker's.  I'm sure that you tolerant people won't mind...
<p>
I'll start with the (quite) negative points:
<p>
- the sound: the mix was sometimes awful, making it impossible to actually
hear Suzanne's voice (especially on the 'noisy' numbers; I do not know if
this was only the case in Brussels or if the sound engineer repeats the same
mistakes at every gig).
<p>
- the band: Sad to say, but it was a real 'backing' band; I mean they were
always in the back of the stage.  I know that Suzanne is the person everyone
wanted to see, but I found it somehow uncomfortable that the band stayed in
the shadow.  This is not my idea of a 'live' band.  They were professional
and all, of course (only their names can tell you so), but I won't say they
'rocked' so much.  I also have to say that 'Women on the tier' was a
disaster to me, as the very oppressive sound of the record (with the
industrial-sounding drum loop) was replaced by a single binary drum banging.
The song lost most of its impact...
<p>
- the audience: STOP!  I won't say that I blame every single person in the
audience; I just felt that most of the people there didn't seem so
interested in Suzanne's songs.  I'm not  sure that Valentine's day was so
great to see her: there were definitely many people who were there for their
compulsory Valentine's evening out. 'What am I gonna do for Valentine's day?
Oh there's that singer Suzanne Vega; I don't know her much, but isn't she
the one that wrote Luka?'.  The venue was sold out and it was difficult to
move, so there wasn't anyone dancing.  And that's sad...  Sorry if I feel a
bit sarcastic.  Anyway, Suzanne herself said that she felt shy because the
audience was so respectful (a polite way to say reserved or worse,
indifferent), and she was not used to; fortunately, someone shouted 'Then
shut up!', and she laughed and called him the New York guy all through the gig.
<p>
And now Ladies and Gentlemen, the GOOD point: Suzanne Vega herself.  Her
presence was enough to make the evening enjoyable.  First, she's charming...
I mean every guy in the audience, despite Valentine's day, was under her
spell (that's the mistery Baker talked about).  Then her voice (when you
were able to listen to it I mean)... Jesus it's the smoothest one I've ever
heard live (and I'm a busy concert-goer...).  And that's the reason I really
prefered when she was alone with her guitar; strange as I prefer the
sophisticated arrangements of the last two records. There was such an
emotion when she sang (I can't find the words- not a native English speaker,
as you certainly noticed).  [You're doing just fine -- Ed.]
She made nice comments although most of them were the usual ones (Gipsy and
the bandana, ...); she talked about Jacques Brel and said that 'Thin man'
was inspired by one of his songs (I should check the bulletin board to find
which one, if the topic has already been discussed; anyone can help me?).
<p>
So don't worry: I really enjoyed the show, and Suzanne still has her special
place in my heart.  Go and find out for yourself what you think about the
concert.  Strange but I'd like to find some people who, although they're big
fans, were disappointed by some aspects of her concerts.  And if you are
shocked by my negative eye, please say so!
<p>
Best wishes to everyone
<p>

Well, maybe Bertrand was right. But I was in front of the stage and I 
heard her voice pretty good. Maybe it was because of the monitors in front.

Betrand is right again. Excuse me for saying this but I was totally NOT 
interested in the band. Suzanne Vega had my complete attention.

I just want to ask a little question to Bertrand : What do you think of 
that one girl who threw a cassette to Suzanne ? I was a bit shocked 
because of that, but Suzanne really smoothened the wrinkles there (I don't 
know how to tell it correctly!) by thanking the girl and putting the 
cassette in her pocket (not rock in this pocket but cassette in this pocket 
this time !!)
<p>
Soit, her show was great in my opinion !

Hi gang--
<p>
I'm just back from Suzanne's show in Stockholm. The venue was small, but the
show was great. I wish more people would know how good she really is on
stage. But on the other hand, it's quite nice to be in a small audience in a
small place with an intimate atmosphere.
<p>
I had a chat with Suzanne afterwards, and she asked me to say hi to you all.
She misses you and promises to post as soon as she's got a new powerbook
working again. Anyway, she's well and so is Ruby and Mitchell, so there's
nothing to worry about...
<p>
The band was really great, too. I must say that I'm always been extremely
focused on Suzanne, but this time I enjoyed the band as a whole. Maybe it
was Mitchell's new keyboard as well -- he bought it today and played it for
the first time during the concert... Fat Man & Dancing Girl, a song I've
always had a love-hate relationship to, came out wonderfully. They almost
made me dance, which is a rare thing, at least in public :-)
<p>
But Suzanne can still mesmerize on her own. She played The Queen and the
Soldier as an encore -- and the intensity was stunning.
<p>
Well, I can't describe the concert any better than this -- make sure you get
to see her if you have even the slightest chance!
<p>
Later,<br>
        /Hugo
