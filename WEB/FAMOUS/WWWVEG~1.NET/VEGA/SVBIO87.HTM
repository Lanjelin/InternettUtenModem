"I suppose that the things that interest me most are character and place," says Suzanne Vega, the New
York-based recording artist whose distinctive songwriting talent and eclectic musical approach have brought 
her both national and international acclaim in the two short years since the release of her stunning debut
A&M album in April of 1985.
<p>
"I'm always curious about the atmosphere that people come from, and not so much what they do but why they 
do it," she stresses.  If striving for getting beneath the surface and uncovering those private feeling and 
secret thoughts that all people harbor within themselves is a theme that seems to recur throughout many 
of her songs, that's only understandable, since she is someone who knows all too well that our perception of things 
can often be quite different than what they actually are.
<p>
To be sure, there has been, since virtually the beginning of her professional career, much more to 
Suzanne Vega than meets the eye.  Watching her performing alone on the small stages of various Greenwich
Village clubs several years ago, with nothing but her own acoustinc guitar serving as musical accompaniment, 
her earliest suppporters could certainly be forgiven if, in their enthusiasm, they mistook her for the kind of <i> 
traditional </i> folk singer she never really claimed, not sought, to be.
<p>
"When I first started playing in clubs in the early Eighties," she recalls, "my perspective must have seemed
very strange.  At the time, I wasn't quite sure where I fit in, with music, with the world.  I knew that I was
aiming for something, but I wasn't really sure what it was.  I knew it wasn't folk, necessarily, although there
were a lot of thingsthat I liked about early Folk - Woody Guthrie, Cisco Houston, for instance - because it was
real and you could tell it was real.  It wasn't real for me personally - I certainly didn't know anything about 
freight trains - but you could tell from listening that these people had been there, and that there was no
pretentiousness about them.  But after I started performing regularly, suddenly there was all this press calling
me a folk singer, even though I didn't think that a song like say "Cracking," could really be construed as a
folk song.  After all, it wasn't exactly "Wild Mountain Thyme" ".
<p>
Suzanne's "perspective" ("I think it's probably my favorite word right now," she says) at the time was that
of a young woman barely into her twenties, a woman who, though she hardly looked it, had been raised in the
tough neighborhoods of New York City, who'd been a serious dance student for almost a decade, and who
was working in theater while majoring in English at Barnard College.  Although Suzanne grew up in a home
where the tastes in music leaned heavily towards folk ("When I was young, the whole aura around singer/songwriters
like Dylan, Paul Simon, and Leonard COhen was very strong") and jazz ("I remember listening to a lot of
Astrud Gilberto and Brazilian Music"), and as a teenager had done some performing at church basement-type coffeehouses
where "they'd give you a plate of brownies and a cup of juice after you played," she is quick to point out 
that her philosophy in regard to songwriting was profoundly influenced by former Velvet Underground leader
Lou Reed that she witnessed in late 1979.
<p>
"At the time," she notes, "everybody around me was into punk and new wave, but I just wasn't paying much
attention to it.  I barely even knew who Lou Reed was - I remember asking the guy who wanted to take me if he had 
any hits, and he said, "Walk on the Wild Side," and I think I went because I at least knew that one song.
He was being really aggressive and hostile towards the audience, and I just thought, "What is going on
here?" But there were a few songsthat he did that night that really got to me, like "Heroin" and "Caroline
Says Part II" that I found I just couldn't stop thinking about.  And the concert really wound up having a
great effect on me, because afterwards I didn't see songs, or songwriting, in the same light.  For the first
time it occurred to me that you could write a song using only one chord and say anything you wanted to
over it, and someone just might listen to it.  Before that, I always felt that songs had to make sense, have
some kind of narrative, be somehow traditional in structure.  But Lou reed was writing in a very different
way, and about things that I knew about.  So it was a shock of recognition and realization at the same
time - that you could not only write a song any way you felt like, but that you could also write about 
anything you felt like." 
<p>
As both her writing style and self-confidence developed and grew, Suzanne began to regularly venture
 down to Greenwich Village, and at clubs like the Speakeasy and the legendaryFolk City she found a
 sympathetic abd nurturing environment made up of musicians and listeners who shared her belief in the
integrity of "intelligent music that takes risks."  She quickly began to draw sizeable audiences and rave 
notices for her shows in New York and Boston and as the breadth of her songwriting skills became increasingly
apparant and her musical horizons expanded, the simple tag of "folk singer" ceased to fit. "One of the 
most distinctively original performersin the entire pop realm" was the way one local critic put it - a 
description that seemed much better suited for the author of such far afield compositions as the rap-like
"Cracking," the jazz-tinged "Freeze Tag," and the ballad-styled "The Queen and the Soldier."
<p>
These songs, as well as such stellar works as the reflective "Marlene on the Wall," the atmospheric and
dusky "Small Blue Thing," and the graceful, free-falling "Some Journey," can all be found on Suzanne's
self-titled first album, which was carefully and sympathetically produced by engineer (and along with Ron Fierstein,
co-manager) Steve Addabbo and former Patti Smith Group guitarist Lenny Kaye.  On it, Suzanne's voice
and guitar were sensitively complemented by the elements of a full-scale electric band, and the experience
ultimately led to her decision to tour with a complete backup group.  "You get a sense of energy with a band 
that I never quite understood until I was playing inside of one," she says, "There's a rough edge that I simply
couldn't get on my own that I think comes through now, and I'm happy for that."
<p>
While the <b>SUZANNE VEGA</b> LP received uniformly excellent reviews and a significant commercial 
response in the United States - given the strict formats of most American radio stations, and the general
climate for music that may initially seem to be somewhat, er, left of center, Suzanne feels that "it's actually
done much better than I thought it ever would"  - the album was an overwhelming and unqualified success in 
Europe.  "In some ways, I wasn't all that surprised about doing well over there," she admits.  "Many of the people
I like - Leonard Cohen, Laurie Anderson - have always tended to do better in Europe, so it kind of makes sense
to me."  In England, in fact, Suzanne has become quite a major star, to the extent that a British tour last fall
included two sold-out performances at London's fabled Albert Hall, and a half-hour BBC television show
culled from footage of the concerts drew an estimated audience of over two and a half million viewers. "I spent
a summer in England in 1979," she says, "and I was really inspired by the country's style.  I remember
wishing that I could somehow make an impact there.  So in many ways, the response I've gotten in England 
has been very, very gratifying."
<p>
Still, becoming a star - and inevitably a celebrity - is not something that Suzanne is sure she's necessarily
comfortable with, at least not yet. And in an age of big stars possessing even bigger egos, Suzanne Vega's
impressive talents as a singer, songwriter, and performer are perhaps matched only by her equally impressive
perspective on the trappings of fame.  While her brand new album, <b>SOLITUDE STANDING</b>, featuring 
such stand-out tracks as the provocative "Luka," the playful "Tom's Diner," the sinewy "Night Vision," and 
the forboding "In The Eye," is certain to bring her not only more critical support but also a more expansive
popularity than ever before, Suzanne Vega remains a refreshingly unassuming artist whose dedication is first and 
foremost, to the work at hand.
<p>
"When I'm performing at a concert and I finish my set and I see people getting all excited, I always feel
a bit ambivalent,"  she confesses. "There's a part of me that says,"Be happy for this," and anotehr part that just
feels distracted, that wants to say to the audience, "Hey, calm down, alright?"  In New York, if you stand up 
and they just <i>look</i> at you, you know things are going well.  But to go to Ireland and have two thousand 
people howling is very different.  My first response is that I couldn't possibly be that big a deal, and that
they should all sit down. I mean, I <i>hate</i> big deals.  Don't get me wrong, though," she laughs. "I like
knowing that people are listening to my songs.  And I do like being appreciated."
<p>
That feeling, one suspects, from her growing audience is more than mutual.
