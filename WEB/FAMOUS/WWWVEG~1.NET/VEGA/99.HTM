<A NAME="rock"><h2><b><i>Rock In This Pocket</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
Excuse me<br>
If I may<br>
Turn your attention<br>
My way<br>
One moment<br>
I won't plead<br>
It isn't much<br>
It's what I need<br>
<p>
And what's so small to you<br>
Is so large to me<br>
If it's the last thing I do<br>
I'll make you see<br>
<p>
If you turn from me<br>
You darken my sun<br>
You snap that thin thread<br>
I call my horizon<br>
And I'd like to remind you<br>
Of something small<br>
That the rock in this pocket<br>
Could cause your fall<br>
<p>
And what's so small to you<br>
Is so large to me<br>
If it's the last thing I do<br>
I'll make you see<br>
<p>
So small to you<br>
And so large to me<br>
If its the last thing I do<br>
I'll make you see<br>
<p>
I might be out like a light<br>
Extinguished in the throw<br>
But I'll hit my mark<br>
And you'll know<br>
Because I'm really well acquainted<br>
With the span of your brow<br>
And if you didn't know me then<br>
You'll know me now<br>
You'll know me now<br>
<p>
And what's so small to you<br>
Is so large to me<br>
If its the last thing I do<br>
I'll make you see<br>
<p>
So small to you<br>
And so large to me<br>
If it's the last thing I do<br>
I'll make you see<br>
Make you see<br>
Make you see<br>

<A NAME="noise"><h2><b><i>Blood Makes Noise</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
I'd like to help you doctor<br>
Yes I really really would<br>
But the din in my head<br>
It's too much and it's no good<br>
I'm standing in a windy tunnel <br>
Shouting through the roar<br>
And I'd like to give the information<br>
You're asking for<br>
<p>
But blood makes noise<br>
It's a ringing in my ear<br>
Blood makes noise<br>
And I can't really hear you<br>
In the thickening of fear<br>
<p>
I think that you might want to know<br>
The details and the facts<br>
But there's something in my blood<br>
Denies the memory of the acts<br>
So just forget it Doc.<br>
I think it's really<br>
Cool that you're concerned<br>
But we'll have to try again<br>
After the silence has returned<br>
<p>
Cause blood makes noise<br>
It's a ringing in my ear<br>
Blood makes noise<br>
And I can't really hear you<br>
In the thickening of fear<br>
<p>
Blood makes noise...<br>

<A NAME="in"><h2><b><i>In Liverpool</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
In Liverpool<br>
On Sunday<br>
No traffic<br>
On the avenue<br>
The light is pale and thin<br>
Like you<br>
No sound, down<br>
In this part of town<br>
Except for the boy in the belfry<br>
He's crazy, he's throwing himself<br>
Down from the top of the tower<br>
Like a hunchback in heaven<br>
He's ringing the bells in the church<br>
For the last half an hour<br>
He sounds like he's missing something<br>
Or someone that he knows he can't<br>
Have now and if he isn't<br>
I certainly am<br>
<p>
Homesick for a clock<br>
That told the same time<br>
sometimes you made no sense to me<br>
if you lie on the ground<br>
in somebody's arms<br>
you'll probably swallow some of their history<br>
<p>
And the boy in the belfry<br>
He's crazy, he's throwing himself<br>
Down from the top of the tower<br>
Like a hunchback in heaven<br>
He's ringing the bells in the church<br>
For the last half an hour<br>
He sounds like he's missing something<br>
Or someone that he knows he can't<br>
Have now and if he isn't<br>
I certainly am<br>
<p>
I'll be the girl who sings for my supper<br>
You'll be the monk whose forehead is high<br>
He'll be the man who's already working<br>
Spreading a memory all through the sky<br>
<p>
In Liverpool<br>
On Sunday<br>
No reason to even remember you now<br>
<p>
Except for the boy in the belfry<br>
He's crazy, he's throwing himself<br>
Down from the top of the tower<br>
Like a hunchback in heaven<br>
He's ringing the bells in the church<br>
For the last half an hour<br>
He sounds like he's missing something<br>
Or someone that he knows he can't<br>
Have now and if he isn't<br>
I certainly am<br>
<p>
In Liverpool<br>
In Liverpool<br>

<A NAME="99"><h2><b><i>99.9F</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
99.9 Fahrenheit degrees<br>
Stable now, with rising possibilities<br>
It could be normal but it isn't quite<br>
Could make you want to stay awake at night<br>
<p>
You seem to me<br>
Like a man<br>
0n the verge of burning<br>
99.9 Fahrenheit degrees<br>
<p>
Pale as a candle<br>
And your face is hot<br>
And if I touch you<br>
I might get what you've got<br>
<p>
You seem to me<br>
Like a man<br>
On the verge of running<br>
99.9 Fahrenheit degrees<br>
<p>
Something cool<br>
Against the skin<br>
Is what you could be<br>
Something cool<br>
Against the skin<br>
Is what you<br>
Could be needing<br>
<p>
99.9 Fahrenheit degrees<br>
<p>
You seem to me<br>

<A NAME="sings"><h2><b><i>Blood Sings</i></b></h2></a> 
<p> 
When blood sees blood<br>
Of its own<br>
It sings to see itself again<br>
It sings to hear the voice it's known<br>
It sings to recognize the face<br>
<p>
One body split and passed along the line<br>
From the shoulder to the hip<br>
I know these bones as being mine<br>
And the curving of the lip<br>
<p>
And my question to you is:<br>
How did this come to pass?<br>
How did this one life fall so far and fast?<br>
<p>
Some are lean and some with grace, and some without;<br>
All tell the story that repeats<br>
Of a child who had been left alone at birth<br>
Left to fend and taught to fight<br>
<p>
See his eyes and how they start with light<br>
Getting colder as the pictures go<br>
Did he carry his bad luck upon his back?<br>
That bad luck we've all come to know<br>
<p>
And my question to you is:<br>
How did this come to pass?<br>
How did this one life fall so far and fast?<br>
<p>
When blood sees blood<br>
Of its own<br>
It sings to see itself again<br>

<A NAME="fat"><h2><b><i>Fat Man & Dancing Girl</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
I stand in a wide flat land<br>
No shadow or shade of a doubt<br>
Whore the megaphone man<br>
Met the girl with her hand that's<br>
Covering most of her mouth<br>
<p>
Fall in love with a bright idea<br>
And the way a world is revealed to you<br>
Fat man and dancing girl<br>
And most of the show is concealed from view<br>
<p>
Monkey in the middle<br>
Keeps singing that tune<br>
I don't want to hear it<br>
Get rid of it soon<br>
<p>
MC on the stage tonight<br>
Is a man named Billy Purl<br>
He's The International Fun Boy<br>
And he knows the worth of beautiful girl<br>
<p>
Stand on the tightrope<br>
Never dreamed I would fall<br>
<p>
Monkey in the middle<br>
Keeps doing that trick<br>
It's making me nervous<br>
Get rid of it quick<br>
<p>
I stand in a wide flat land<br>
No shadow or shade of a doubt<br>
Where the megaphone man<br>
Met the girl with her hand<br>
That's covering most of her mouth<br>
<p>
Does she tell the truth?<br>
Does she hide the lie?<br>
Does she say it so no one can know?<br>
Fat man and the dancing girl<br>
And it's all part of the show<br>
<p>
Stand on the tightrope<br>
Never dreamed I could fall<br>
<p>
Monkey in the middle<br>
Keeps singing that tune<br>
I don't want to hear it<br>
Get rid of it soon<br>
<p>
Monkey in the middle<br>
Keeps doing that trick<br>
It's making me nervous<br>

<A NAME="movie"><h2><b><i>(If You Were) In My Movie</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
If you were in my movie<br>
I'd have you as the doctor<br>
Small black bag<br>
And a big black coat<br>
<p>
I'd have you make a house call<br>
To the woman<br>
You could lay your<br>
Diagnostic hand<br>
Upon her belly and her throat<br>
<p>
If you were in my movie<br>
You could be the detective<br>
You could sit behind the desk<br>
With a question on your lip<br>
<p>
Examine her for motive<br>
Investigate the scene<br>
In the ever present danger<br>
Keep the holster at your hip<br>
<p>
If you were in my movie<br>
If you were in my movie<br>
If you were in my movie<br>
<p>
If you were in my movie<br>
You could be the priest<br>
Long black frock<br>
White collar at the neck<br>
<p>
You could come to the confession<br>
You could give a girl a thrill<br>
You could save her from her passion<br>
Keep her body in check<br>
<p>
If you were in my movie<br>
If you were in my movie<br>
If you were in my movie<br>
<p>
If you were in my movie<br>
You could be the gangster<br>
Double-breasted pinstriped<br>
Man with the cigarette<br>
<p>
Go running down the alley<br>
With a double-crossing blond<br>
Explaining to the jury<br>
That you hadn't done anything yet<br>
<p>
If you were in my movie...<br>

<A NAME="as"><h2><b><i>As A Child</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
As a child<br>
You have a doll<br>
You see this doll<br>
Sitting in her chair<br>
<p>
You watch her face<br>
Her knees apart<br>
Her eyes of glass<br>
In a secretive stare<br>
<p>
She seems to<br>
She seems to<br>
She seems to<br>
Have a life<br>
<p>
Pick up a stick<br>
Dig up a crack<br>
Dirt in the street<br>
Becomes a town<br>
<p>
All of the people<br>
Depend on you<br>
Not to hurt them<br>
Or bang the stick comes down<br>
<p>
And they seem to<br>
They seem to<br>
They seem to<br>
Have a life<br>
<p>
As a child<br>
You see yourself<br>
And wonder why<br>
You can't seem to move<br>
<p>
Hand on the doorknob<br>
Feel like a thing<br>
One foot on the sidewalk<br>
Too much to prove<br>
<p>
And you learn to<br>
You learn to<br>
You learn to<br>
Have a life<br>

<A NAME="bad"><h2><b><i>Bad Wisdom</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
Mother the doctor knows something is wrong<br>
Cause my body has strange information<br>
He's looked in my eyes and knows I'm not a child<br>
But he doesn't dare ask the right question<br>
<p>
Mother my friends are no longer my friends<br>
And the games we once played have no meaning<br>
I've gone serious and shy and they can't figure why<br>
So they've left me to my own daydreaming<br>
<p>
What price to pay<br>
For bad wisdom<br>
What price to pay<br>
For bad wisdom<br>
Too young to know<br>
Too much too soon<br>
Bad wisdom<br>
Bad wisdom<br>
<p>
Mother you've taught me the laws are so fine<br>
If I'm good that I will be protected<br>
I've fallen through the crack and there's no getting back<br>
And I'll never trust whoever gets elected<br>
<p>
Mother your eyes have gone suddenly cold <br>
And it wasn't what I was expecting<br>
Once I did think that I'd find comfort there<br>
And instead you've gone hard and suspecting<br>
<p>
What price to pay<br>
For bad wisdom<br>
What price to pay<br>
For bad wisdom<br>
Too young to know<br>
Too much too soon<br>
Bad wisdom<br>
Bad wisdom<br>
<p>
Mother I'm cut at the root like a weed<br>
Cause there's no one to hear my small story<br>
Just like a woman who walks in the street<br>
I will pay for my life with my body<br>
<p>
What price to pay<br>
For bad wisdom<br>
What price to pay<br>
For bad wisdom<br>
Too young to know<br>
Too much too soon<br>
Bad wisdom<br>
Bad wisdom<br>

<A NAME="when"><h2><b><i>When Heroes Go Down</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
When heroes go down<br>
They go down fast<br>
So don't expect any time to<br>
Equivocate the past<br>
<p>
When heroes go down<br>
They land in flame<br>
So don't expect any slow and careful<br>
Settling of blame<br>
<p>
I heard you say<br>
You look out for the feet of clay<br>
That someone will be falling next<br>
Without the chance <br>
For last respects<br>
You feel the disappointment<br>
<p>
When heroes go down <br>
Man or woman revealed<br>
You can't expect any kind of mercy<br>
On the battlefield<br>

I heard you say<br>

	So beautiful<br>

	Doesn't matter to me<br>
	Which side of the line<br>

<p>
If sand waves were sound waves <br>
What song would be in the air now<br>
What stinging tune<br>
Could split this endless noon<br>
And make the sky swell with rain<br>
<p>
If war were a game that a man or a child<br>
Could think of winning<br>
What kind of rule<br>
Can overthrow a fool<br>
And leave the land with no stain.<br>
