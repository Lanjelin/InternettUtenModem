<b>Her name is Vega</b>
<p>
Suzanne paved the way for Alanis and co to hold sway in today’s charts. But don’t hold that against her. She’s back, with a baby, and a sharper, grittier sound. By Lucy O’Brien.
<p>
"I can’t listen to Days of Open Hand without feeling like I’m getting hives. It was such a difficult album to 
make, I was doing it under such pressure. I can feel myself getting weird as soon as I hear it," says 
Suzanne Vega, sitting in a downbeat café near her Soho apartment in New York, reassessing earlier albums.
<p>
 Although the recent release of her fifth, Nine Objects of Desire marks 12 years in the business ("or 22, if 
you count the 10 years before I got a record deal"), she is sanguine about her success, claiming in her 
quietly precise way that at 37 she has just started to scratch the surface of  "what I’m capable of".
It was in 1985 that Vega emerged from the Greenwich Village folk circuit to release her self-titled debut, a 
sharp, thoughtfuç collection reminiscent of Joni Mitchell and Laura Nyro that completely went against the 
grain of the punchy, video-led chart pop of the time. She was being groomed by A&M for critical cult status 
and modest sales when the 1987 follow up, Solitude Standing, became an unexpected hit, selling over six 
million coppies worldwide and yielding the No 3 UK hit "Luka", a dipassionate, moving song about child 
abuse. Her hypnotic street lullaby "Tom’s Diner" then became a smash in 1991 when dance remix duo DNA
 slipped a hip hop beat under her vocals.
<p>
Proving that a "serious" female singer/songwriter could sell, Vega’s success opened the door for a whole new generation of women artists, from Tracy Chapman to Michelle Shocked, and latelly, Alanis Morissette and Alaskan songstress Jewel.
Vega’s brand of subtle observation, however, hasn’t always worked with critics. Her third album, Days of 
Open Hand was seen as a detached, lacklustre affair with disappointing sales.
<p>
But by 1993 she had evolved a much grittier, more declarative sound on the album 99.9Fº, and Nine Objects of Desire, with its sharp songwriting and neat combination of rock, bossa nova and percussive beats, is considered to be her best yet. Gone is the earlier self-consciousness of lines like: "Today I am/ A small blue thing/ Like a marble/ Or an eye".
Back in 1992 Vega was a resolutely single girl until she fell in love with Mitchell Froom, top producer for 
acts like Elvis Costello and Chrissie Hynde, when they were working together on her 99.9 Fº album. "I felt 
like somebody had cast a spell over me and I didn’t appreciate it, it seemed unfair, there was no way to 
fight back."
<p>
Because he was married at the time they didn’t act act on it until later. "After we finished the album I 
wasn’t sure if I was going to see him again. I didn’t want him to leave his family but there was this feeling 
of destiny, a weightiness I was puzzled by." Eventually Froom left his wife for Vega, but while she was 
doing press for the album they kept the affair secret. "I found that strange. Everything had a double
 meaning - like when a journalist, ‘I really admire Mitchell Froom’s production but I wish he’d leave his 
organ out of it.’ I’d go red, thinking, What’s the matter with you, there’s nothing wrong with it !"
<p>
Two years after they officially became an "item" Vega had a baby girl, Ruby, an event she depicts with 
clattering unsentimentality in the song "Birth-Day". It was through her daughter that Vega became aware 
again of music’s everday importance. "You forget that as a singer because music just becomes a daily grind. 
But I found that singing to my daughter was the one way I could get her attention. When I first did it I felt 
really shy - what if she hated it? Normally it calms her down, but one time I sang to her in a fake opera 
voice and she started screaming. That cured me of doing that again!"
<p>
Having Ruby has also changed her life in terms of the mundane practicalities of being a musician.
 "I wonder why before I had her I never realised how free I was, because I’ll never be that free again,"
 she says, somehow wistfully. She finds the age-old struggle of career versus bringing up baby "as hard 
as hell". On her forthcoming tour, for instance, Vega is scheduled to sleep on a bus for two weeks in the
 coldest parts of Europe, including the former Yugoslavia. "This is a nice place to bring a two-and-a-half-year-old
 baby girl whose immune system isn’t fully developed yet," she says. "Are they nuts? I have to fight with 
everyone - my manager, my agent - and ask them if they’ve lost their minds. Ruby should be going to 
nursery school, not dragging around with a bunch of guys with tattoos."
<p>
Though she is also aware that the country is a healthier place to bring up a child, Vega is reluctant to
 leave New York, her home and her muse. "There’s a state of mind in this city that allows me to write," 
she says. "The feeling of being alone in a crowd. Even though people are smashing up against you, you 
can be private and self-contained."  For Vega there is rich experience to draw on and every part of the 
city has a memory, from the High School she went to near Times Square, to uptown Spanish Harlem where
 she grow up. "New York has the quality of a problem that’s not solved yet. So I keep coming back."
<p>
One issue she has gradually reconciled over the years is the split identity of growing up white in a Hispanic 
neighbourhood with a Puerto Rican stepfather, the novelist Ed Vega. "Until I was nine I thought he was my 
real father, and when I was told he wasn’t it came as a shock. I felt embarrassed, my idea of white people 
then was stereotypical and I assumed my natural father would be a very nerdy guy."
<p>
She joined a street performance group called The Alliance of Latin Arts as a way of fitting in, "to try to
 prove myself to my stepfather". She was never fully accepted. Once, the group did a show in the South 
Bronx and they were pelted with eggs. People accused her of trying to pass herself off as a Puerto Rican.
 "I still have a flyer that shows all these brown skinned girls standing in a line and at the end of it there’s 
me, a very white girl who’s completely withdraw, as if Emily Dickinson had wandered into the wrong picture. It was totally wrong."
It wasn’t until she left home and carved a career in folk music that Vega found a separate identity. 
Yet although she felt she had to distance herself from him, she acknowledges that her stepfather was 
one of the biggest influences in her life. "He was a person who really believed in being true to your artistic
 ‘calling’."
<p>
"I saw how dedicated he was to his writing, how he put that above everything else. I wish I could do 
the same in my household, declare, ‘I’m the breadwinner, I’m the artist - if I wanna stay up all night and 
write I can and you better not wake me in the morning.’ I find it difficult to put my foot down and say, ‘My 
writing comes first’." She pauses, stirs her tea and then says with a smile, "But I will. When I’m older. I’ll
 be like Martha Graham, the Queen of the Castle"
