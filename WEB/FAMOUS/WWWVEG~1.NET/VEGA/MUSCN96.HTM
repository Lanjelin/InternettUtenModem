<b>Suzanne Vega Battles Burl Ives in Nine Objects of Desire</b><br>
by Chuck Crisafulli
<p>
On an unseasonably hot Hollywood day, there is a flurry of activity within
the cooled confines of Studio B at the Sunset Sound Factory.  Tracks are
nearly completed for Nine Objects of Desire, the first Suzanne Vega album in
four years, and with a playback for studio brass scheduled tomorrow, producer
Mitchell Froom (Vega's husband) and engineer Tchad Blake are working hard to
polish their rough mixes.  In the midst of the purposeful chaos, Vega is a
figure of poise and resolute calm.
<p>
"I had such a hard time writing these songs that I'm just grateful to get
anything done," she explains, taking a break from what she hopes will be her
final vocal track.  "It's hard to know what to make of the music this time,
because we worked really fast.  I was finishing lyrics in the studio, trying
to hold off Mitchell and Tchad: 'Give me ten minutes and you'll have a song
with better rhymes!' "
<p>
If the rough tracks are any indication, Vega's incisive poetry is in fine
form, and her gracefully sensual vocals are well set atop the varied sonic
pastiches that Froom and Blake have created.  "Headshots" is a piece of
nearly perfect pop that finds Vega closing the book on a romance of old,
while the gentle melody and insistent rythms in "Stockings" describe an odd
friendship tested by nylons and gin and tonics.  On most of the tunes, the
precision rock drumming of Pete Thomas combines with the looser world-music
percussion work of Jerry Marotta to creat wide engaging grooves, while the
arrangements contain everything from reggae bass loops to Indian strings to
an amplified Vega exhalation.
<p>
"It's hard not to get into sounds when you're working with Mitchell and
Tchad," says Vega.  "They're always coming up with imaginative ideas, and if
they fit the song, we use them.  If I listen back and say, 'What's that
horrible noise?', it's not going to stay in.  They argue for twisting the
song, and I argue for keeping it more straightforward.  I think that's called
creative tension," she laughs.
<p>
Vega hopes the result of that tension, due out in September, will get a more
positive response than the one it prompted from her newest fan:  two-year-old
daughter Ruby.  "She likes 'Caramel,' and she thinks that 'Birthday,' which
was written for her, is okay.  But, frankly, she enjoys Burl Ives more than
anything we've been working on lately."
