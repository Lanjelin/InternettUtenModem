Subject: a one-time thing<p>

Okay, I'll admit to occasionally browsing through that 
informational junkyard otherwise known as alt.music.
alternative, and I'll even admit that I sometimes read
those silly posts about the 5 best songs ever or stuff 
like that. So anyway, for some reason I decided that
a post called something like "best opening lines of 
a song" would be worth reading, and the first post is
from someone who voted for this SV line:<p>

It's a one-time thing<br>
It just happens a lot<p>

First of all it was pretty unexpected since SV is hardly
the preferred sort of artist on that list. But the bigger
surprise to me was that for the countless times I have
heard that song (and I've had that album since the year
it came out), I never really realized how funny that line
is until I read it there. So there, in the first line of her first 
song on her first album, SV cracks (pun intended) a joke.
So where did she get this oh-so-serious reputation from?<p>

Of course, this still doesn't mean I quite know what she's
talking about here. *What's* a one-time thing that happens
a lot? Any ideas?<p>

Certainly, that opening line is ironically funny--in a way--in a very sad way
though.  Here's what I picture for the whole song: Cracking:<p>

This person in an abusive relationship (physical/mental or both) who has just
been abused again--her lover has gotten out of control again and beaten her
up or whatever and she's contemplating it:  It's a one time thing/It just
happens (there is that pause when you listen to it) a lot.  She's perhaps in
love with the person--doesn't want to give up on the relationship--is beaten
down though--confused--hurt.  That's where the confusion comes in as she
works her way through the song till the end:<p>

The sun is shining<br>
Dizzy golden dancing green<br>
Through the park in the afternoon<br>
Wondering where the hell<br>
I have been<p>

That's my interpretation of that line.  The humor in that line I read as
dark, sad, and ironical--I mean the person is "cracking" after all--and I'm
sure she's referring to an emotional breakdown.  <p>

Anyone else?<p>

>From a Southbank Show interview of SV from around '87 - '88 
talking about the song "Cracking":<p>

SV:  "The narrator is going for a walk in the park.  Through the
details reflected in the landscape you can see that this person is 
cracking.  Not the ice on the sidewalk.  It's the person that is cracking,
that is the important thing.  And so I guess what I tried to do with
that song, was write, put the kind of details in that someone who was
cracking would write.  So from the first line - `It's a one time thing,
it just happens a lot' you know you're talking to someone who
is not making sense."<br>

Wendy!, I think you're interpretation of "one time thing" is valid, 
though I've not quite thought of it that way. To me, these lines are, 
paradoxically, positive. Since I'm too tired to explain what I mean, let 
me quote Leonard Cohen:<p>

	Ring the bells that still can ring<br>
	Forget your perfect offering<br>
	There is a crack in everything<br>
	That's how the light gets in<p>

And these cracking moments are ideed "a one time thing", quite distinct 
from everything else, thought they may "happen a lot". I don't say that 
they are without pain, though. Life *is* painful.<p>
