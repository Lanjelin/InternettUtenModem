<h3><b> SUZANNE PERFORMS AT THE BOTTOM LINE</b> </h3>
Subject: The Long Voyage<br>
Date: 95-04-03 15:38:02 EDT<br>

<p>
3 April 1995
<p>
Suzanne appeared with John Cale during the encore of his performances at the
Bottom Line in New York on Saturday and Sunday, April 1 and 2.  They performed
"The Long Voyage," the song from "Chansons Des Mers Froides."  They also sang
"Hallelujah," the Leonard Cohen song that Cale covered for the "I'm your Fan"
tribute album of a few years ago and can also be found on Cale's live album
"Fragments of a Rainy Season."  Suzanne and Cale traded verses at the Bottom
Line.  Both songs were well received by the audience during the show I saw.
<p>
BTW, another Cohen tribute album will be released in the next few months--I
forget which label--but it will be a more commercially mainstream, but probably
less interesting project than the earlier "alternative" French production.
Suzanne has recorded "Story of Isaac," which will undoubtedly be worth a listen.

<b><h2>Suzanne Vega at NY Press Conference, February 9, 1995</h2></b>
<p>
Suzanne appeared today at a press conference with two New York State
Assemblymen in support of legislation designed to allow judges to act in the
best interest of abused children - not automatically returning them to
abusive family environments in order to keep the family together.
<p>
I heard Suzanne's comments on NY1, a local NYC cable station - I assume
they're just a small portion of what was said... 
<p>
<b>Suzanne:</b>
<p>
"I don't think anybody wants to take a child from their family but I think
there are times when the family environment is too toxic and too abusive for
a child to live in.
<p>
"You can't legislate what happens in private life.
<p>
Since the time of Charles Dickens we've been able to protect children in the
workplace, but we're not able to protect them in the privacy of their own
homes. "
