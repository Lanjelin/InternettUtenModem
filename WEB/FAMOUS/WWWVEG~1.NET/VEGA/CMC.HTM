Subject: Suzanne Vega and Carson McCullers<p>

Okay,  the new topic of Suzanne Vega firsts is "most excellent"  some of 
the pieces written are very beautiful and it seems that everyone has been 
impacted greatly by Suzanne's music.<p>

I would just like to get input on what people think of Suzanne Vega and 
Carson McCullers (author of The Memeber of the Wedding and The Heart is a 
Lonely Hunter--among others) Carson is my favorite American Writer and I 
really feel that Suzanne posesses some of the same elements in her 
writing that were familiar in Carson's writing.<p>

I think a strong parallel between the two writers is certainly their 
characterizations.  Carson always chose characters who were marginal.  
Usually young, adolescent females or as in "The Ballad of the Sad 
Cafe"--characters living on the fringes (a migit etc)--She wrote about 
what the world looked like through the eyes of these marginal characters, 
giving new perspective--giving voice to perhaps those who have had no voice.<p>

Am I on a tangent or do people recognize that in Suzanne's 
characterizations?  Certainly Luka--as a character--can be seen as 
marginal and a voice from the fringes (finally the world through an abuse 
child's eyes--finally that voice is heard).  Also, "Calypso"--in 
literature is seen as a seductress and usually gets a bad rap.  She is, 
perhaps representative of the dangers of feminine whiles (sp?)--a 
distraction for men of ambition.  Suzanne portrays her very differently, 
and thank the goddess that I had done some intense Calypso listening 
before reading the Odyssey.  I was able to look at Calypso with a more 
sympathetic eye.  The wanting of woman--the need for connection with 
another human soul--the isolation!<p>

Then, their is Casper Hauser--another marginal character--a previously 
unheard voice.<p>

It is interesting to note that these characterizations are always in the 
first person narrative--making them personal--adding to their haunting 
quality but at the same time making the listener feel as if they are 
intimate with this marginal character--pulling the listener into this 
characters world and not letting the listener get away without some kind 
of--not sympathy--but understanding of this marginal life.<p>

I hope there are other McCullers fans out their--I would expect the 
literary world to maybe be tuned in, but, I am an American Literature 
major and Carson appears in NO anthology of American Literature--and I 
have never read her for a class.  You can bet, though, that my students 
will know and understand Carson McCullers when I enter the classroom.  
Unless my friends here on Undertow think I'm nuts about this, Suzanne may 
be brought into that as well--studies on marginal characters--etc. (Don't 
expect me to write my disertation on this--it would be interesting, but 
I'm already committed in another direction--but wouldn't my Undertow pals 
just love me if I wrote my disertation on Suzanne Vega's music?)<p>

Blurp everybody !<p>

I'm absolutely not new on this list, but in fact it is the first time that I 
contribute...<br>
Just like Wendy Carson McCullers is my favorite American writer, but maybe it is
because I don't know much about American littereture.<br>
I always wanted to send a message to the list to talk about the link between CMC
ans SV, but I didn't dare because each time I realised that I hadn't many 
precise facts to write on that subject.<br>
This link has always been obvious to me, but I never could analyse it.
I can't say it is because of the characters, the stories... Maybe it is, I don't
know.<br>
Maybe it is that these two artists are, I think, very close as human beings. 
Both girls/women, both musicians, both writers, and with a few important common 
characteristics. The type of girl who, as kid, can hardly be differentiated 
among a group of boys playing together, the kind of women that could not be on 
the cover of fashion magazines. In fact, not 100% girls...<br>
In "The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter", the fact that "every one is a woman and a 
man" semms to me clear through Mick (that is "almost" CMC), and of course 
obvious through Biff.<br>
And there must be something true in it. And this probably why, as a boy/man, 
when I read any book from CMC and when I hear most of the SV's songs, I think 
something like "how could they guess ?!", "how are they doing this ?!"...
In fact I feel very close to these books and songs. They are women, I'm a man, 
but we share a lot of things (mentally).<br>
And this happens only with these two artists.<br>
I love the music and the songs of Sinead O'Connor for exemple, but it doesn't 
touch me the same way as SV.<br>
Maybe the reason for this is just that the "boy" proportion in these two persons
(I wrote persons, and not artists...) is higher than in others, and maybe my 
"girl" part is also important (and it is probably the same for most of the real 
SV addicts).<br>
A "practical" aspect of this parallel is the kind of writing (maybe I'm wrong 
because as a French I can not do a fine analyse on this subject). It seems to me
that they both write a very simple way, with the minimum number of words, but 
always with the right words. They know ("knew" for CMC) how to express their 
feelings with the most efficient way.<br>
So for me that these two aspects ("easy writing" and "mala/female ratio") are 
the most obvious links between Carson McCullers and Suzanne Vega, and these are 
also the reasons why their books and songs touch me so deeply.<br>
Please, don't hesitate to go further/deeper... I think my point of view may be 
"disturbed" by the fact that I love their works and persons, which makes me 
slightly unable to provide a clear and logical analysis.<p>

I think that Suzanne did an evening of reading Carson McCullers stuff a
couple of years ago... I don't know if that was a one-time thing... Maybe
someone on this list who attended could provide more info...? Did anyone tape
the event?<p>

Am I correct?<p>

Hi Everyone - <p>

A couple of days ago I wrote,<br>
"I think that Suzanne did an evening of reading Carson McCullers stuff a
couple of years ago... I don't know if that was a one-time thing... Maybe
someone on this list who attended could provide more info...? Did anyone tape
the event?"<p>

Here's Suzanne's reply:<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------<p>

"Yes, someone taped it -- I did, in 1988 and MTV did in 1992.  It was a
version of a one-act play I wrote when I was in college, based on the life
and work of Carson McCullers.  I did it as my senior thesis project --
dressed up as her, spoke in her Southern accent, smoked like her and later
discussed her work with the audience.  The original version had songs based
on her short stories and was called "Nothing Human", based on a quote she
liked -- "Nothing human is alien to me".  It was about an hour long.<p>

"I submitted it for a CAPS grant in the early 80's and it was rejected, but I
have taken it out over the years and dusted it off -- performed it at
benefits, readings and stuff like that.  I have a couple of the readings on
tape, and even some reviews from some of the shows (good ones).  The last
time I performed as her a few years ago, it was filmed by MTV -- they used a
piece of it for something -- but I decided not to perform it any more as I
felt the material was becoming too neurotic, or maybe I was becoming too
neurotic -- at any rate I felt that I had outgrown it.<p>

"For a time in my life she meant a great deal to me.  I still like her
writing.  Funny how this connection isn't common knowledge but is in the air
nonetheless."<p>

Suzanne<p>

I expect the next question you'll have is "So, how can I get a copy of the
tape?"  :)<p>

More soon,<br>

Subject: re:  Suzanne and Carson and Androgyny<p>


The whole question of androgyny is very important in both Suzanne and 
Carson's work.  With androgyny or revolation of saying that some of us 
have a balance between feminine and masculine should not come some 
revolation of homosexuality or whatever.  Androgyny as a way of thinking, 
acting, or looking has little if nothing to do with sexuality.  I only 
say this because Jeremy sort of alluded to this masculine/feminine 
intuitiveness as maybe having something to do with sexuality.
<p>
But, I certaintly think that one can look at the entire concept of 
"...the we of me..." that is played so heavily upon in The Member of the 
Wedding as certainly the narrator expressing this androgyny--and for 
Carson, personally, there is more than likely an expression of her 
bisexuality within that--but that is me writing for the author.  The 
young girl in The Memebethe Wedding is consumed by her brother's marriage 
and finds that she has a crush on him as well as the bride--the 
situation--the wanting to be with them and be "a part" of them--not just 
be with them, but actually be "a part" of that relationship.  I think, 
this is certainly an expression of both sides of one's masculine/feminine 
psychie.
<p>
To try to bring this idea around to  Suzanne's music, one might see her 
body of work as interconnecting--there is the artist (female) taking on 
the role of male characters--getting into their minds (their psyche) to 
express some feeling about a situation from their point of view.  Luka 
and Casper Hauser come to mind right now.  There is this sense, certainly 
that these are small moments where the artist sort of explores her own 
androgyny--to look at a situation from the masculine side (especially in 
the case of Luka, I mean, why not make it an abused girl instead of a 
boy?)
<p>
Then, there are also the songs where the gender of the narrator is 
non-specific.  One must wonder what perspective the narrator is coming 
from--whether is be a genuinely female perspective or a male perspective 
or is it somewhere in between--thus androgynous perspective (Here, one 
can call to mind Tom's Diner and In Liverpool).
<p>
That is my thesis for the day all--just trying to stay in step for the 
academic year that still lies ahead of me.  Of course, if all my papers 
could be on such a fascinating topic--would I be happy.
<p>
Wendy!
