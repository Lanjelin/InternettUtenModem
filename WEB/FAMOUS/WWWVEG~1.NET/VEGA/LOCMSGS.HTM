 Hi everyone...
 <p>
 My name is Jen.  This is my first post to this list, so if it's a little
 scary, please try to write that off as first-post-jitters.  :)  I've been
 reading Undertow for quite awhile now, but I was reluctant to jump into the
 conversation for a few reasons.  One being that until yesterday, I didn't
 even have all of Ms. Vega's albums (oh, by the way, that reminds me of
 something -- I usually call people Ms. and Miss whatever...is that kosher
 here?  I don't want to offend anyone or anything <smile>).  A dear friend of
 mine found Days Of Open Hand for me -- can you believe that?  I searched ALL
 over the place and NEVER could find it.  Anyway, that's not the point?  What
 was I saying?  (I have a tendency to go off on tangents at any time, so be
 warned.)  I alwso got the feeling that...hmmm...off-topic conversation isn't
 as welcome here as it is on, say, the Sarah McLachlan list, which I'm also a
 member of.  And since I've got that dear little problem with tangents, I
 didn't want people to be mad at me.  But, I've decided that the time has come
 to hop out of the corner and run screaming in to the land of Suzanne.  Wheee!
 I know you're excited.  :)
 <p>
 This post is getting long, so I'll just cut straight to the real reason I'm
 posting (well, the reason besides that I wanted to introduce myself).  A
 friend of mine -- the one who bought my Day Of Open Hand, acutally -- is
 wondering about a Suzanne song called Left Of Center.  He heard it played a
 LOT on the radio in the early 90s, 1990-1991, and never could find it.
 Finally, he looked it up in the little yellow book that every record store
 has, and it's listed as being on the album Suzanne Vega -- which it's not, as
 far as our copies of it go -- and on the soundtrack for Pretty In Pink.  So
 he and I were wondering what the deal is.  Why would they play a song from
 the mid-80s in heavy rotation five or so years after it came out?  Is it on
 another soundtrack?  And why is it listed as being on Suzanne Vega?
 <p>
 Thanks everyone for reading this, and I look forward to hearing from you!
 <p>
 Jen

 Hi Froggy Jen,
 <p>
 When I started reading your message I wondered why your name was so very
 familiar to me and then when you mentioned Sarah McLachlan it hit me.  You
 have a most excellent SM page which I have a link to from my page:
 http://www-scf.usc.edu/~wchapman.
 <p>
 Anyway, glad you're over here on Undertow and keep up the good work on
 your Sarah page.
 <p>
 Oh, and the deal w/ "Left of Center"  I couldn't really tell you why they
 were playing it a lot in the early 90's--maybe trying to catch some of the
 backlash that was created by the Tom's Diner thing.  It is only on "Pretty
 in Pink" and a few Live albums (well, the "Live in England" album that was
 released in New Zealand and Japan)  That's all I know about it other than
 it was never released on the Suzanne Vega album that I know of--and if
 there are copies out there with it on them, then I want to know because
 they're probably collectors items.
 <p>
 Wendy!

 No, it was never a part of "Suzanne Vega". Pretty in Pink was written and
 recorded for the soundtrack of the film with the same name after "Suzanne
 Vega" had already been released. As it is undoubtedly one of Suzanne's
 simplest songs, I guess it bacame more widely popular than the rest of her
 songs...

Hiyah!
<p>
Yeah, LEFT OF CENTER always was a kind of problematic song for me. Actually,
I first heard it on a radio broadcast of one of Suzanne's early concerts in
Germany (just after SV was out). She announced it as being from the PRETTY
IN PINK soundtrack. I liked it from the first moment, so I was tempted to
buy the whole soundtrack album just because of the song on it.
Actually, I didn't, because I happened to find a strange release which
was possibly only available in Germany: It's a four track CD called HITS (or
something like that - I'm mailing from my university and don't know this
ridiculous title by heart, it's LEFT OF CENTER to me) and includes the
studio version of L.O.C.! It came for the cost of a single CD!
Still, my first experience with Suzanne's music was on a school party.
Someone had brought SV and I instantly fell for MARLENE, SMALL BLUE THING,
THE QUEEN... and UNDERTOW. So, I had to get the album (I didn't have a CD
player then)! Later I got the CD, especially as I had played the vinyl so
much that its quality got poor (I think that's the reason). 
And that's the story!
<p>
