<b>Guest: Suzanne Vega</b>
<p>
["No Cheap Thrill"]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So, now I have her actually right in front of me: Suzanne Vega,
and I welcome her to my show, welcome her back to my show.  And now that
I have you right in front of me, I can say to you: You know what
that song did to me one day about two weeks ago?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> What?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It drove me crazy!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Really!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, with that bom-bom-bom-ba-ba-ba-ba-bom [SV laughs] was
in my head for an entire day.  It was the first piece of music I
listened to that morning.  
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> About a week and a half ago.  And no matter what I did for the
whole rest of the day, I couldn't get that riff out of my head.
It just was like...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, that's good to know.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, you think?  [Vin laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's my little guitar riff.  It's my little one-string melody.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Is that yours?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Can you play that?  Do you actually do that one live?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Uhhhh...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That's such a sort of an arrangement kind of a song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It is an arrangement kind of song.  I've been practicing it,
you know, because I basically wrote it on one string, which is this
string.  [SV plays the riff on her guitar]  It's like all on
one string.  So it kind of lacks a little something right now
in the acoustic presentation of it.  But I'm working on it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It just absolutely drove me crazy.  [He plays the riff
from the record again while SV laughs]  Which was okay as long
as I was alone.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> But I was doing things like, you know, going to the store,
and going to the gas station, and walking around in the mall, and
things like that, and I'm going "bom-bom-bom-ba-ba-ba-ba-bom".
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I think that's the kind of song, it's kind of like a walking-around
sort of song, I think.  That's when I first thought of it, was on a
Saturday afternoon when I was walking through Soho, I think, with
my daughter, and when I got back home I realized that that line
had sort of curled itself up--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The musical line.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, the musical line.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And you said the musical line came first?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I started fooling around with the guitar once I got home,
and I realized that it had sort of been there for a while before
I realized that I could make a song out of it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ahhh.  And then-- is that usually the way it comes for you?
Does the music come first usually?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It used to be that the music would usually come first.  Lately
I feel like I work all different kinds of ways.  Sometimes it's the
music, sometimes it's the...it's a phrase or a...a couple of lines
that I've written down in a notebook somewhere, and then they come
to life when I get the music.  So it's-- the older I get, the more
variety there is.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, that's good.  It means you're open to lots of different
sources of inspiration, and different ways of working as well.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I think I've had to become that way, because my time
has changed.  You know, as a teenager I just, uh, I would start
working on a Saturday night, 'cause I never went out, so I would
just stay home, and then start working at about eight o'clock,
and fall asleep about one in the morning, and then I'd finish
the song the next morning and...so now I don't do that anymore.
Now I just...now it's usually late afternoon. [laughs]  Since
Ruby was born, it's like, I don't have my nighttimes anymore.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> This is what you're talking about, the major changes--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The fact that just about two years ago you had a child--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I had a daughter, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And that brings lots of changes on us.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And especially when you're a creative artist who is used to working
on the spur of the moment, the kind of situation that you're discussing
right now is one that you really don't think about ahead of time.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Before you have a kid.  You don't go, "Wait a minute, how is this
going to affect how I work?"  You know?  but--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, people had told me that it would, and I honestly didn't
really believe them.  I just figured, well, you still have the same
feelings, and then, you know, while the baby's asleep you'll whip out
your guitar.  But what they don't tell you is when the baby's
asleep, you're like, your brain is fried.  [laughs]  You just have
nothing.  You know, when the baby goes to sleep, you go to sleep.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, you hope that you're asleep, too.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, is she doing that now?  Is she sleeping through the night?
Or, uh--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Not always because we travel a lot, and so she's usually jet lagged,
or we're jet lagged,
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ohhhh, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> You know, sometimes my husband will go away, and then he'll come
back, and so she's excited.  Or I'll go away and then come back.
And so, she's still kind of not exactly always sleeping through
the night.  She's sleeping right now, though.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> My daughter is 16.  She still doesn't sleep through the
night.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.  [They laugh]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> She still can be up at some point along the way.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Complaining about something.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Something, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Actually, I'm exaggerating.  She sleeps through the night now
'cause she's exhausted.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> 'Cause she works so hard.  She's 16, a junior in high school.
But she, for many years, didn't sleep through the night, you know?
That just became her habit.  She became, like, a nocturnal creature
almost.  And everybody kept saying, "That'll go away after a year or
two, you know, once they're out of babyhood."  Naah.  It didn't.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It was a long time before we got a full night's sleep again.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> But it's worth it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> [laughs] I think so.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Roo-bee.  Yeah.  So what kind of music is she into?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh, she's into all different kinds of music.  I mean, this
morning we tried playing the Allman Brothers, and she wasn't thrilled
about that.  She likes the new record.  She likes...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Your new record.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> My new record, yeah.  She listens to some of the Disney stuff
like "Hi-ho" and, you know, the Seven Dwarves soundtrack.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> She listens to...for a while she was very deep into Burl Ives,
which was kind of a pleasant thing for me.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Sort of like, "Big Rock Candy Mountain" and stuff like that?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> More like, what was it, "Little White Duck."  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> "Little White Duck"?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It was "Little White Duck."  And the Pete Seeger tape, she liked
that one.  I sort of wanted her to listen to the songs that I'd grown
up listening to, so I played some of those old tapes, and so she likes
them.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And then I have a tape that we made together, of the two of us
singing songs, and so she listens to that.  The Mama/Ruby tape.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh yeah?  [SV laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yes.  Don't look like that, it's not going out of the house,
believe me.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, boy, I'd love to get ahold of that.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Way too embarrassing.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> [laughs]  Can we hear that someday?  Come on.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It's me singing "Kumbaya" and all sorts of things that I said I'd
never sing.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Right.  But for the kid you'll sing 'em, of course.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh yeah.  No, the two of us, we sing them together.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Sure, sure...How's Mitchell?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He's good.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay, Mitchell Froom is Suzanne's husband as well as producer/partner,
sometimes even co-songwriting partner.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Sometimes, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So the three of you comprise this interesting unit as family on
the one hand and work unit on the other.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Up to and including the fact that Ruby sings, too, right?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, she sings...she's really, I think, more into percussion.
[laughs]  She's really more into making loud noise with the cymbals
and the sticks lately--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, that's gotta--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's what she's really into.  She walks around the house banging.
You know, Mitchell's working on a film score, and then Ruby walks around
the house smashing the cymbals together and playing the tambourine.
It's very noisy around our house.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, that has to be the Mitchell gene coming to the forefront.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> [laughs]  I think so.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Don't you think?  I mean, 'cause he's real into percussion.
That's really become a trademark of the work that's producing and
working on with Tchad Blake as well as just interesting percussive
sounds.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, some of it, although he's also really versatile, 'cause
there's a lot of string arrangements, or horn sections, or...I
think he tries to do what's appropriate for the song.  But yeah,
things have become a lot more percussive on my records since I've
been working with him.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> We're talking about Ruby.  Can we start right right at the very
beginning of this new album of yours, the album called "Nine Objects
of Desire"?  Of course, that song that we just played is the one that's
been floating around for a month or so now.  It's the single.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> "No Cheap Thrill."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yep.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And I should identify that They Might Be Giants song that I
played before that, which I played for my daughter.  "Exquisite Dead
Guy" [SV laughs] is the title of that.  It's from their new album.
She listened to the new album yesterday, and she said so far that's
her favorite track on it.  So she requested that I play it for her
tonight.  "Exquisite Dead Guy" from "Factory Showroom," They Might
Be Giants, not yet out.  The new Suzanne Vega album is out.  It is
called "Nine Objects of Desire."  I'll ask you about the title maybe
a bit later on.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You can decide whether or not you want to tell me about it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Okay. [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> But I thought we could begin at the beginning, because the
very first track is called "Birth-Day," parentheses, "Love Made Real."
Birth, and it's not like "birthday," one word, it's "Birth," hyphen,
"Day."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It is probably safe for me to assume that this song is, to a
certain extent, about the birth day of Ruby.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> About giving birth.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It's about the day she was born, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And was it...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> A difficult subject.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I mean, how soon after her birth did the song come to you?
I mean, did it take a long time?  Did this song gestate, you should
pardon the expression, for a long time before you were able to
get it out and deal with it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, it was earlier this spring.  I'd say it was...she was
just about a year and a half old and probably almost two years
old by the time we'd written the song.  I knew that it was
womething I wanted to write about, but it was very difficult, you
know, you have to...when you think back on those experiences,
to figure out what details to put in and what details to leave
out, and how graphic do you make a song like that, and...and so
I had the music first, and I just had to kind of figure out what
to sing there.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> This is not a simpy lullaby kind of song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, I mean, well, I was surprised in a way that no one had
written...I don't think I've ever heard a song about that
particular experience before.  I think other women have written
songs about their children.  Chrissie Hynde, I think, wrote
"Show Me the Meaning of the Word," and that's a really beautiful
song to her daughter, but the experience itself is so extreme
and especially in modern...I mean, it's just such an extreme
experience that...I think if guys experienced it you'd hear about
it all the time.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Aha. Really.  Well, there's a couple of lines towards the end of
the song that I remember very specifically was as close as I came to
at least visually experiencing the thing.  The line is "Shake all over
like an old sick dog / There's a needle here, a needle there, tremble
in the fog / It's a tight squeeze, vise grip, ice and fire / She's
a hot little treasure / And the wave goes higher."  I mean, it's a
wonderful, as you say, graphic and evocative image of what that
experience is.  But I'll never forget shortly before my wife went into
the room she had gone through labor for a long time, and ultimately
had to have a caesarian.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.  As I did, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.  So shortly before she went in for that, they gave her
something.  They stuck her with something.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And I was in the room with her, and quite literally, just
"shake all over like an old sick dog," that's what happened to her.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> She just started, like, her whole body began--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's what I had.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah!  I guess it's from whatever the drug is that they give
you at that point, I don't know what--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Sometimes you have a reaction to it, but some women shake in
labor anyway.  But I think with some women it's a reaction to that
drug.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  'Cause up til that point, there hadn't been anything
like that.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And as soon as they give her that, I was like, Oh my G...and I
looked at the guy like "What did you do to her?"  You know, "I'll
punch you out!  What did you do to my wife?"  [SV laughs]  So...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, it kind of makes you cold all over--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Because it's supposed to numb the feeling, and you still have
sensation, but you don't have the feeling, and...but what you feel
is a kind of a deep, cold feeling when you're experiencing it.  You
still experience this, you know, these sensations, but between the
drugs, and the feelings that you're having, and then the long hours
and everything, it just takes you out so far.  And so when I...I was
just thinking back on that day and wanted to organize it and kind of
put it into a shape for myself.  And that's what it ended up being.
<p>
["Birth-Day (Love Made Real)"]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> There's that constant heartbeat throughout, too, isn't there.  [SV
laughs]  That rhythm that it begins with, and it's there throughout...
almost sounds like horns on that track towards the very end, but
there aren't horns on that.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, I don't think there's any horns.  It's...keyboards, two
drummers, bass, guitar.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Pete Thomas and Jerry Marota.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Jerry Marotta.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Jerry Marotta, I'm sorry, on drums.  Where do I know Jerry from?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He played with Peter Gabriel.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And many other people.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And that's Mitchell on the keyboard?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That's nice, that's a nice sound.  It's an organ sound, but it's
not an organ.  It's a keyboard approximating an organ?  Do you think, or
remember?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> You know, I don't know what he does sometimes.  He's got a lot of
things and then either he changes it, or I'll go back and redo things,
and half the time I don't remember what the exact things that both of
them have done.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> 'Cause it has that Hammond, like that B-3 kinda sound.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I like that a lot.  So how do you guys work together?  Do you...
at a certain point do you just sort of leave the room and, like you
say, he'll go back and he'll rework things and play with things
and stuff...does he work on the tapes without your presence, and
then come back to you and say, "Hey, check this out, listen to this"?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, sometimes.  Let's see...well, there's different stages.
You know, when we're doing preproduction we get together in a
room and, we'll just sort of see what the other one has.  I'll have
some lyrics, I'll have some melodies, sometimes I'll have melodies
with no lyrics and sometimes, you know...but then once we've got
the song structures down and we're actually doing the recording, I'm
usually there all day.  Sometimes he'll come in early the second day of
a song and do something.  But I get the final say when that ever
happens.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh sure.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Occasionally I've come in and said, "Where's that guitar part that
I liked?" and they'll be like, "Oh, we erased it, we thought it was
really corny."  And I'll say, "Well, you have to get it back, 'cause
I loved it."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That was something that happened on "In Liverpool."  They had erased
the beautiful chiming guitar part that I kept falling in love with, and
they had thought it was too corny, so they had to go get the guy--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh no!  They--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> and get him to rerecord it, or actually I think Tchad had sort
of approximated what had happened.  They made up another guitar
line that they thought would work.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You're not supposed to erase anything!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, but they...[laughs] the way they work is so stream of
consciousness, you know, it's like, well, you know, it all depends...
it's sort of like a performance.  What's the word?  It would be
like something in progress, it's always in progress.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> A work in progress.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, it's a work in progress, and then, finally once it's
mixed then it's finished, and then you forget about it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> All right, so an obvious question, when you talk about people
who work together professionally like that--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Who are also married, they live together.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Is there a point at which the works stops and family life,
domestic life begins, and the work doesn't sneak in?  Or is the
work always there?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> For me, I really like to just leave my work outside the house.
I really, I don't like to talk about arrangements, or musicians,
or touring, or anything inside the house.  But Mitchell, he's the
kind of guy who is just always hearing music in his mind, and he's
always working on something, and so it's always with him.  It doesn't
matter really to him where we're working.  He can work in the living
room with Ruby marching around, you know, and...'cause he's just really
into it, he's always consumed by music.  Whereas I find I really
need to leave it at the front door.  So when we work together, I lke
to work out of the house, that's kind of my role...for myself as
we work away from the house.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And...so do you find yourselves compatible on these different
modes of operation?  Or do you get to a point where you just look at
him, "Stop! Stop doing that!"  [SV laughs]  "And, you know, come over
here and do this!"  You know?  I mean--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Occasionally, 'cause he likes strange, you know, he likes strange
instruments and things that...yeah, he's got this keyboard that he's
really crazy about, it's like a...something he got in Paris.  It's
probably from the late 1800s.  And he's just nuts about it, but
to me it sounds like a bunch of whistling teapots, you know, and
then the high notes really make me nuts, [laughs] so I have to go
somewhere else if he's gonna play that.  But for the most part, you
know, I don't mind what he's doing as long as he's working on
something else in the house, but when we're together--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Not your stuff.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, not my stuff.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So, that's kind of where the line is drawn.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Suzanne Vega is my guest tonight here on WNEW.  Do you like
my new digs?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Beautiful!  Beautiful!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Very nice, huh?  Yeah.  Nice and big.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Actually what I really like is to watch you dancing before.  I
thought that was very nice.  [They laugh]  I liked watching you dance to 
"Birth-Day."  That made my day.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You weren't supposed to see that.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh, I'm sorry.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And before, to "No Cheap Thrill."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I think it was "Birth-Day."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Was it "Birth-Day" that I was dancing to?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, "Birth-Day," it just...there's this movement.  I mean, that's
what the song is about; it's about a movement, you know?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So, okay, so now I know it was during "No Cheap Thrill" I 
actually wrote some stuff down.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I actually wrote down some of the lyrics.  Because it occurred to me 
that they have all these other meanings beyond the meanings that they
have in the card game--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That's going on there, with Lame-Brain Pete and Butcher Boy and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> These other characters.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And just looking at them, written down, in my own scrawl of
a handwriting now, they do have a whole different meaning.
I'm talking about the words, "I'll see you"--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> "I'll call you," "I'll raise you."  You know?  Especially
in light of "Birth-Day" and the fact that you had a young child,
you know?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> "I'll raise you" takes on a whole different meaning.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right, right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> But "I'll see you"..."I'll call you" [They laugh]  Are you
a card player?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, actually.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah?  Really? 
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, when I left my house to come here, my whole family was
in the middle of a card game that I had to leave.  There was my
brother, my mother, and my sister and my niece.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh yeah?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And their two friends were all playing poker as I left the house.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Poker?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, sort of in a...that's what...the song is based on poker
language.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right, right.  But the...but it's interesting that those words can
have other meanings as well.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I just love words that are like that--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That you can find and that they have a bunch of different kinds
of meanings.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So are you a good poker player?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I'm pretty good, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Poker face, dumb face?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I'm pretty good, I'm pretty good.  'Cause most of the time I
come in and people think that I'm sort of inexperienced, and...
this was the best night I ever had, I won $8.00 on a penny ante.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So that was pretty cool.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yean, really.  [SV laughs]  See, I'm terrible.  I'm a bad liar,
and I can't keep a secret--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And I'm a terrible card player.  If I have a good hand, I
slip.  [SV laughs]  I just, I just start smiling.  And I "Woo-
de-da de-da-da, da da," and everybody's out.  [They laugh]  You
know, it's like...but I like to play.  And those family games,
sometimes those are the most fun games, you know, those family
penny ante games.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I used to play cards all the time with a dear friend of
mine who's like my brother, and his father and uncle, so these
two old guys, Uncle Louie and Uncle Jake--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Are these two old Italian guys.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Who have been playing cards for, like, you know, sixty,
sixty-five years, seventy years together, all their lives, and they
knew each other's tricks, they knew when each other was cheating--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And it was great fun to watch and play.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And to attempt to, like, second guess them and stuff.  I never
could.  I mean, I'd get a good hand and I'd smile.  [SV laughs]
Now, this new album is called "Nine Objects of Desire."  When I
first heard the title, and hadn't seen the album yet, I thought,
"Well, hmm, maybe there will be nine songs--"
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> On the album.  There aren't nine songs; there are twelve.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So where does the title come from?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, you know, things in life are never as tidy as they might be
in the abstract world, so there are some objects of desire that you
want more than others, you know, so there are some objects of desire that
get two songs, like...Ruby has two.  Mitchell has two songs.  The
figure of death has two songs.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ohhhh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So that's three objects of desire in six songs.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And...you know, there's a little statement right there in the
beginning of the album, and it says who the album is dedicated to,
and those are the nine objects.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh, I see.  For Ruby.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> MF.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Lolita.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The figure of death.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yep.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Three men.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> One woman.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> [laughs] And a partridge in a pear-- [SV laughs]  No, and a plum.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And a plum.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And a plum.  [laughs] Which this is not.  This on the cover.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh, no, it's an apple, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> This is not a plum.  It's a green apple.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It's a green apple.  I asked on the day that we did the shoot I said,
"Well, where are the plums?"
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> They said, "Well, the plums are out of season."  This was back
in April.  So, but they said, "The apples look really good."  So
they bought a bunch of apples, and that became the object of desire
on the record.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.  Even though the song is "My Favorite Plum."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  But it also, I mean, there were other reasons for the
apple.  You know, I guess you could say that Ruby is the apple
of my eye, and that sort of thing.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And that's why I picked that picture that's over my eye.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.  Okay.  This is an interesting song about desire on this
album that I wonder how people have reacted to so far, 'cause the
album just came out this week.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So you probably haven't gotten a lot of fan reaction to it
yet.  The song's "Stockings."  If we take the song quite literally--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The song seems to be about a woman being attracted to another
woman.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> If we assume that the narrator, the singer of the song is a woman.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And we do that because you're singing it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Which may not necessarily be fair.  It could be about anybody.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You know, it could be a guy.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Could be a guy.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Narrating the song.  And it's a real interesting song.  It's a very,
sort of matter-of-fact, as well as seductive song.  Am I reading
the right things into it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Absolutely.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Or am I totally off?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I mean, in some ways actually you're probably reading even more
than...I mean, I think that all the songs on this record are really
from my own point of view, which is probably not the way I've written
other songs in the past, you know, I've gone to great lengths
to sort of create characters and...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Throw my voice into them.  And this one, it happens to be
one that is from my own point of view, you know, and actually
when I was working with Mitchell he sort of...you know, well,
he kinda gives me a look and he says, "So, is this something that
happened recently?"  [Vin laughs]  And I said, "Well, no, it
isn't, you know, it was just sort of, you know, a passing moment that
happened, like, ten, fifteen years ago."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So he goes, "Oh, that's good."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And then it's the end of that discussion, you know, so...but
a lot of people, yeah, have been curious or they're wanting to
know, did I write it from a specifically male point of view.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I did make the choice when I was writing it not to bring
the issue of gender into the narrator.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> 'Cause I felt like if a guy wanted to cover this song, like
Evan Dando or somebody -- you know, Evan Dando had covered "Luka" --
I thought it would be interesting to just write it from a perspective
that could go either way.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is part of the seductiveness of the song, too.
The mystery--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> There's a lot of men who really like this song because I think
that they have been there.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> In that moment.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Could I get you to sing it for us?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
["Stockings," acoustic version]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Suzanne Vega.  I like that line about...that she doesn't show
you the way out on the way in.  [They laugh]  Yeah.  I see.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, she was the kind of girl that might do that.  [They laugh]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Definitely.  Definitely a problem.  Would you mind if I played the
album version of it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh, please!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> 'Cause there's such a difference between it and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I like the album version, too.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I really like it.
<p>
["Stockings," album version]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Where did this sort of Middle Eastern thing come from there
in that song?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mitchell's imagination?  [laughs]  He just said to me, "Well,
what if we put some Arabian strings there?"  and I said, "Oh, that's
a good idea."  And--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> See, that's--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's where they came.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That's, I guess, maybe what I was talking about earlier with
Mitchell as a producer--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Not only on your stuff but on the other things he's worked on...
is that all of a sudden these sounds will come at you from out of nowhere,
and they're wonderful.  They're like, they tease you and they tickle
you, and they make you laugh [SV laughs] and they fit as well.  I
mean, they're not just extraneous sounds--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  I think so, too.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I mean, that song is sort of moving along one way, and all of a
sudden it's like Kashmir!  [SV laughs]  You know, it's like, whoa!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The belly-dancer comes in.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font>  Really.  But it works, it works.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I think so.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So it'll be interesteing to see what the fan reaction is to that song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh, it's been very interesting so far.  I mean, I've gotten a
wide range of responses.  'Cause I've been doing these in-stores,
you know, all week in different cities and stuff like that, so
people will come up and...one man came up to me and said, "I wouldn't
ask this except that you put it out there, so I feel I have to ask
you, you know, if you consider yourself to be bisexual," you know--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And I said, "No I don't consider myself to be bisexual.  I'm
heterosexual with...but I've imagined upon occasion that it could
be otherwise, really," so that's been...and he was terribly apologetic
for even asking the question, you know--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, true.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> But he was going, "Well, you put it out there," you know.  So
there's been some amount of curiosity, or whatever, but I mean, no
one's been offended, or...some people have thought it was really
great, or some people have felt like...that I was speaking for
them on some level.  So...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Speaking of being offended, I've read somewhere that...I think
it was like somewhere on one of the web sites--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  I know, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Now I know, yeah, you've been sort of interested in the
Internet as a way of communication for a while now.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> For a couple of years, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I remember the last time we spoke, which was maybe
<p>
[the transcriber lost a few seconds here when he turned over the tape;
Vin mentioned the Learning Annex talk from Jan '96, then returned to
the subject of the Internet]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yourself, at least you were doing it then.  I don't know if you
still do it now.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, it's not quite like that.  I don't go to the, um, I
don't go into the rooms where they're discussing; it's not like
a live room.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It's more like I'll post things--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And then receive mail...and read the mail.  But it's very
rare that I'm actually...I only did my first live chat, actually,
last Tuesday.  Last Monday.  Where there was like a live discussion
that went on around the room.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And that's one of those official sponsored kind of things.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It's sponsored, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  'Cause otherwise, I don't...I think it can tolerate up to a thousand
people at a time, so it'd just be mayhem, you can imagine.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And...yeah, and somebody's [SV laughs] sort of going through the
questions, and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, I went through the questions, and I picked out the ones I
was gonna answer--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And then I posted them, and so we did this-- so it was live, and
within the space of an hour.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> But most of the time it's a little more pedantic than that.  It's
like I open-- you know, I go get my email, and maybe there'll be like 30
messages or something, and then I'll scan them and figure out which ones I
want to answer.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So you do actually answer that mail.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I post on the...on what's called the Undertow from time to time.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.  [SV laughs]  The Undertow!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> [laughs]  Yes.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So I was somewhere--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I was fooling around with something the other day, and I came across
a reference to the Columbus song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> "World Before Columbus."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And you mentioned the word "controversy."  There seems to be some
sort of a minor controversy--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> [laughs] That's right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> About some political correctness or something--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> In this song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> There's been a political correctness issue with this song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> What's the song about?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, the song is called "World Before Columbus," and it's basically
the idea that if-- and it was written for my daugher Ruby, and the idea
is that if her love were taken from me, the world would feel flat to me.
So I took that idea, and that's what the "world before Columbus" means.
I don't mean it literally; I mean that before...supposedly...you know,
what we were taught in America, the myth is that Columbus discovered
America and also discovered that the world was round.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Of course, my sister, being a fourth-grade schoolteacher, informs
me that this is *not* true, that Columbus did *not* discover that the
world was round, that there were other explorers who discovered that
the world was round before Columbus.  But when I was in third grade,
I'm sorry, I don't know who I had as a teacher [laughs], she'll
probably call me up and...but anyway, so then there's a couple of lines
also about...where I say the world would be as cruel, would be as
cruel as the world before Columbus.  And some people, I think, and
they didn't say this, but they were, I think, implying that they
thought I was racist or something, or that I was saying something
about the native Americans.  And the fact is I wasn't even thinking
about the native Americans, I wasn't thinking about...what I meant
by the world being cruel was that world would be a flat place that
you could fall off of and never return to--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Surrounded by darkness on every side, with monsters, 'cause I
remembered that the picture in whatever book I had been reading
when I was 8, in the New York public school system, I just remember
this flat world with the dragons underneath it.  And to me, this was
what I was thinking of when I wrote this song for Ruby.  But...so a
couple of people have read other things into it, and...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, and so anyway, I printed a defense of myself-- [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Saying, listen, you know...because the other thing is that racism is
such a strong problem, and it's such a serious problem, that it seems
not really appropriate for someone to come along and try and make me out
to be a racist--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right, right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> When I just want to say clearly that I am not.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I mean, what's your immediate response to something like that, the
first time you read it, or hear it, it's just...it's so far from where you
were [SV laughs] when you wrote the song.  It's--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I know.  Well, actually...I mean, this, today at dinnertime we
were talking about how, what other ways could you misinterpret some of
the songs I wrote.  For example, my family, my sister had said we could,
you know, "The Queen and the Soldier" could have been misread to be about
gays in the military [they laugh] if you really wanted to stretch it.
Ahem, yeah, well.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, see you know what's happened with this whole Internet thing.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And with all of these web sites, and discussion groups, and email,
and all that kind of stuff, is that we've become this nation of
instant critics.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Y'know?  Everybody with access to a keyboard and a modem and a
computer and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Can go on...who desires to be, can become a critic, and can
publish--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> There.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Their criticism--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yep.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And their opinion immediately.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And it goes out to X number of people, whoever happens to be
subscribing to that discussion group, or whatever.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing.  You know?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, you know, the thing is, people might have thought that anyway,
but they might not have had the venue--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> To publish it, and the thing is, even when "Luka" came out, there, I
got some very bizarre letters from people you wouldn't expect, who
thought that I was saying somehow that children were to blame for their
own abuse.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And some of them were even people who worked for child abuse agencies,
who wrote to me telling me they thought it was a terrible song, and that
I should have written a more empowering one.  And this kind of thing.
And so they'd really taken the whole point of the song--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Completely wrong.  And so, you know, at that point ten years ago,
there was no Internet, but I still received, you know, these letters--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And so there's always gonna be some people.  And frankly, I don't
mind defending myself.  I'll come out and say exactly what I meant.
And if some people do find it offensive--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Then they can tell me, and it's not the way I had intended it.
I'm not a racist, and it's not-- that was not my intent.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Are-- Do you-- Are you hurt by that, though?  When somebody
misinterprets?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I'm not hurt by it, no, because I think if a lot of people do
misinterpret, even people who love the songs, and who study the
songs, and who spend a lot of time with the songs, still may not
read it the way that I intended it to, and it's because, you know,
the songs can be really difficult.  I mean, I admit that they are.
I don't feel that I'm the clearest, most straightforward songwriter
in the world.  I'm trying to express things that are complicated.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So I realize that people-- so I don't feel hurt by it.  I just
feel that...that particular one I found offensive.  'Cause I felt
that it was not...thought out.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And not...*true*, you know, not, just...obviously someone
looking to pick a fight.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  And it just took a surface, cursory glance at the words,
really, and it didn't really understand how you were using the words.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> What the image was.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And I'm not trying to teach American history--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh, uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> To the world or to anybody.  I was using it as a device for my own
idea of expressing a form of love.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And of a way of expressing what the world would feel like to me
if her love were taken from me.  And I wanted to write a song to a
baby that still had the dignity of a real love song, that wasn't
obviously to an infant, and that's what I was thinking of, and...
so that's...so maybe I should just sing this song [laughs] now
that we've talked it to death.  Here we go.
<p>
["World Before Columbus," acoustic version]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It's a beautiful song, Suzanne.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Thank you.
