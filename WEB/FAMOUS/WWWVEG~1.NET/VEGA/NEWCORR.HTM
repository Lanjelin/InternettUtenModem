<h2>Suzanne's Letter to NEWSWEEK, April 1994</h2>
<i><h3> DONT ROLL ME OVER</h3></i>
</center>
 First I looked with interest at the pictures of women
 musicians I admire in your March 28 PERISCOPE piece
 on female pop singers. Then I looked at the headline:
 ROLL OVER, SUZANNE VEGA. Excuse me? I am 
 supposed to "roll over" and "forget acoustic guitars,
 peasant blouses, angst and other traditional trappings
 of female pop stars"? I have never worn a peasant
 blouse in my life, NEWSWEEK, and I don't like being
 pitted against a generation of women I respect. As you
 said, "Women are the new, brawny force in pop, leading
 the groups making the toughest, most innovative sounds."
 And I am for them, not against them. I won't be pigeonholed
 into a caricature. You'll have to find someone else to do your
 rolling over.

Subject: Re: joan baez's vibrato<br>
<p>
For the people discussing Joan Baez's vibrato and whether it is "natural" or
not;  here is a paragraph from her biography "And a Voice To Sing With" where
she reveals that it was not:
<p>
"Mine was a plain, little girl's voice, sweet and true, but stringy as cheap
cotton thread, and as thin and straight as the blue line on a piece of binder
paper.... I tried out for the girls glee club, and when I wasn't accepted,
figured it was because (1) I was not a member of the in crowd and (2) I had
no vibrato so my voice wasn't mature.  Powerless to change my social
standing, I decided to change my voice.  I dropped tightrope walking to work
full time on a vibrato.
<p>
"First I tried, while standing in the shower, to stay on one note and force
my voice up and down slowly.  It was tedious and unrewarding work.  My
natural voice came out as straight as an arrow.  Then, I tried bobbling my
finger up and down on my Adam's apple, and, to my delight, found I could
create the sound I wanted.  For a few brief seconds, I would imitate the
sound without using my hand, achieving a few "mature"-sounding  notes.  This
was terrific!  This is how I would train!
<p>
"The time it took to form a shaky but honest vibrato was surprisingly short.
By the end of the summer I was a singer."

<p>
If you're interested in the "new wave" of "folkies" [quote marks
mostly suppressed hereon in], check out the latest bimonthly "Option"
magazine, a cultural oddity that I'd bet a dollar or two most F_M
people don't see. "Option" is the true <alt> music mag, and
covers stuff that's _very_ unlike the faded heavy metal sludge
and/or open G strumming that the major companies sell as
"alternative" music.
<p>
        This month's issue has a cover story on Beck, whose (they
say) "hip hop folk" album "Mellow Gold" and single "Loser" are a
big smash at the moment. ["Loser" is a dry mix of sloppy
bottleneck guitar, slacker vocals, and dubbed noises, a la rap,
and is not totally repulsive. But folk? I doubt if many here
would take the bait.]
<p>
        To several, including the New York Times, this new
formula made this guy (guess what, cliche spotters?!) the _New
Bob Dylan_. [Kiss of death, right?]
<p>
        Anyway, it's essential listening/baloney (delete
whichever applies to you). The cover story sports the line "Beck
and the New Folk Renegades." Well, you have to read it to really
appreciate it where folk music might going, in the opinion of the
Californian publishers...
<p>
        In an adjoining piece, with the unfresh headline idea
"why does every new generation reinvent the acoustic guitar?"
[possible reply: what's new about them, or it?] there's coverage
of Ani DiFranco (big on the F_M list recently), plus others yet
unfamiliar to me: Tattle Tale, Lois Maffeo, Cobalt and Smog. You
don't learn all that much about the music, really, but you can
check out the haircuts (excellent!) and pouts (industrial
strength). And the attitudes are quite neat, if you haven't heard
sixties cliches recycled recently. Escaping the "folk ghetto",
how they don't want to be confused with poor old Suzanne
Vega...etc. Well, product differentiation is the name of the
game, after all. The chances are, none of 'em is dull to see.
Musical? Profound? You'll have to tell me.
<p>
        Anyway, whip out $3.50 and treat yourselves so I don't
get rash with overquoting and break the scary laws of copyright.
You'll love it all (or not, depending on how you feel about life
in general). BTW, the "twang" of these performers is not
discussed or compared.

Dear JahUbik:
</pre>
<p>
I, for one, am interested in the "Folk Renegades" (sic), as you put it.  Your
posting was so "witty" that I'm afraid some of the essential information was
lost.   Where does one find it?  How does one subscribe?  It is on
newsstands?
<p>
For those readers who may be interested, Beck at one time was  hanging
loosely with those people known as the "anti-folk", based on the Lower East
Side of New York, which included Roger Manning, Cindy Lee Berryhill, Lach,
and others.  They played (and still play, I assume) acoustic music with an
attitude.  What kind of attitude?  That would take too much space to discuss
here, and I am afraid Alan would become impatient.  Anyone interested in that
group?
<p>
I love folk music, all kinds; new, old, and anti -- that's why I subscribe to
this digest.

Yours truly,
(neither poor nor old!),

Hi, gang.  I thought I'd check in.
<p>
Dear SNORM:  I appreciate your cynicism, and if someone signs on "SuzyB" they
are definitely an imposter, since mine is SuzyV.  It's true though -- how can
you know for sure?  One person asked me what my brother's name was, since he
had been to one of his parties.  As if I didn't know my own brother's name --
<p>
To Miba -- thanks for your comments -- the knife is neither ancient nor
buddhist but a gift from someone a few years ago.  It's like a good luck
token.
<p>
To PATNPETE -- if it was both Carnegie Hall and Radio City, it must have been
1987!  New music?  There is another Leonard Cohen Tribute album coming out on
A&M records, and I sing a version of "Story of Isaac".  I think it's coming
out in the fall, but I don't have the official release date on that.
Otherwise, I plan to start recording next year, and probably won't tour for a
little while after the baby's born in July.
<p>
As for "Salt water" -- it was a song I wrote with DNA for their album called
"Taste This" on EMI.  The album came out in the UK in1992, and disappeared.
I like the lyrics and I want to include it in a "retrospective" of some kind,
in about a year or so, with "Left of Center", and the singles from each of
the albums.  Any comments?
<p>
thanks, you guys.<br>

<p>
Hi.  Thought I would check in!
<p>
Regarding David's questions about Fast Folk Magazine -- I've been on
several, so many I can't remember exactly how many.  About eight, I
think, including some recently.  I ran the Subscription Department of
the Fast Folk in 1982, when it began.  "Cracking" was on the very
first issue. (I was friends with Jack Hardy and Brian Rose, the
Founding Fathers -- I don't know if that makes me a Founding Mother).
I had a song called "The Marching Dream" on one issue, which has not
been on any album.  The last song to appear was "Blood Sings",
recorded live at the Bottom Line.
<p>
Yes, Ed Vega is my father -- my stepfather, actually -- and he did the
Spanish translation of Luka.  He is Puerto Rican and a novelist in his
own right (in English), and the translation is very good.
<p>
Who asked if Men in a war was like the Velvet Underground on purpose?
yes, I felt it was the best way to handle those opening lines which
are hard to sing.  I like doing it live better than the record.
<p>
As to all the discussion regarding the videos -- there was a
compilation made in 1990 of all the videos made till then, but only
available in Japan.  We did four after that for 99.9 -- "In
Liverpool", where I'm dancing with curly hair as the gypsy from the
Hunchback of Notre Dame (it was fun but not seen by very many) --
"Blood Makes Noise", "99.9" and "When Heroes Go Down".  So far, not
much more than that is available in America  (must speak to the record
company about that.  Maybe when I release the "retrospective" they
could do a new compilation.  I don't think "Live at the Albert Hall"
is worth a hundred bucks -- bagels are more important to your daily
life!  It was made in 1986. I hope I'm a better performer these days.
<p>
The tape you saw, David, was a benefit for Folk City (w Joan Baez and
Eric Anderson, among others), taped in 1985 or so, and offered for
sale recently.
<p>
So there are some answers -- Copdoc, your question is really good. But
if I revealed who I was writing about about all the time, everyone I
care about would never speak to me again.  All of the songs are from
my life.  That's for certain.

Hello gang.  Thank you for the congratulations. Ruby is six weeks old today,

<p>
hi gang --
<p>
sorry it has been a while since I dropped in.  I find that since Ruby is born
I have only enough time to do the "flashSessions", and very often I can't get
to the Message Board at all.
<p>
The Undertow newsletter gets "delivered" through the mail, so sometimes I
answer any questions that may be lurking in that forum.  To get onto that
mailing list you write to "undertow-request@vader.cc.emory.edu" (without the
quotes), and you post the word "subscribe".
<p>
There's a little more action on that front, but there probably won't be much
until next year when another album comes out.
<p>
By the way, The "Ruby Vroom" album, by Soul Coughing, was produced by Tchad
Blake, who is Mitchell Froom's partner and engineer -- they asked to use
Ruby's name for their album, and I said they could if they changed it.  In
case you were wondering!
<p>
Otherwise -- I did a  half hour benefit on Saturday afternoon for the Fast
Folk Cafe on N. Moore street in Manhattan.  And I participated in the J.
Morgan Puett fashion show, carrying Ruby. (she's the designer who made the
big baggy pants from the last album and tour.)  Otherwise, let's see --
breastfeeding mania has subsided somewhat, but I'd rather not go into the
gory details, if you know what I mean.
<p>
Thanks for hanging in there --

<p>
Hi --
<p>
Ruby Maria Froom was born July 8, 1994 -- she was 6lbs, 9 oz. It was a long
and difficult labor, ending in a C-section but I am well and just about
recovered.  
<p>
I have been reading your comments with interest -- I am especially intrigued
with all the questions and comments about "Wooden Horse" , the song about
Caspar Hauser, and am working on a reply about that song.
<p>
Forgive me if I don't write in all the time.  I tend to be reclusive, but I
am so very happy to know that there is a group of you out there who want to
discuss the songs.  Your questions and comments stay with me for days.  I
only found out about this list a few days before I went into the hospital.
So while I have been reading the list, I haven't responded so far.  I'll
write in from time to time.

Thanks a lot for listening.

I thought I would quickly explain why "Soul Coughing" named their album what
they did --
<p>
they wanted to call it "Ruby Froom", but I said no, so they changed it to
"Ruby Vroom", which I found acceptable.  The album was produced by Tchad

it was a pretty name.  I said no because -- what if she wants to make her own

hi Tim--
<p>
re: concert venues:
<p>
many times I will get to a city and find out that the venue is "21 and over",
even though we are slated to play that city because it is a college town.
 weird, huh?  a few people brought that to my attention on the last tour.  
<p>
it is a glitch in the agent's way of thinking.  there were a number of
problems like that on the last two tours I did.  as much as I try to control
what happens on a tour beforehand, once I'm out there it is nearly impossible
to keep track of each gig at each venue at each city -- that's why you hope
your agent is a good one, with some contact with reality.
<p>
by making the gigs "21 and over" I cut out a large portion of the audience
who are obviously teenagers -- it is a stupid rule and someone should remind
of this issue when I make plans for the next time out.

dear tim--
<p>
one more thing -- do I have control over where I play?  only if I make
specific requests or if the gigs are slanted one way or another.  obviously I
can't ask for each venue in each city by name.   ironically, on the last
tour, most of the promotion was slanted toward the "alternative" market,
which is a younger crowd, so many of the venues reflected that, or I thought
they did.  and yet you have problems like the one you brought up.
<p>
I myself don't see why you can't have the records slanted towards both
"alternative" and "folk"-- it's hard for someone like myself who doesn't fit
any specific category.  how do you target an audience? I never think of those
things-- I assume whoever likes the record will buy it.  this is a problem
only in America -- in Europe there is no "alternative" or any of these
subdivisions Americans are so fond of.

Subject: kinds of retrospectives, etc.<br>
<p>
Dear Hugo, et al;-
<p>
I will probably put out a retrospective at some point, but not next year --
next year I will be working on the fifth album, tentatively titled "Love
Hotel".  
<p>
After that I want to put out two things -- one collection called "Thirteen
Early Songs" w songs like "Marching Dream", "Silver Lady", "Daniella", "Black
Widow Station", and some others that aren't known, like "Feather and Bone"
and "Not Me" which I used to think were too intense to sing in public.
<p>
I also want to put out a "Best of", but the kind I like is the kind you hate
-- I love records that collect an artist's singles throughout a period, with
no odds and ends, no filler, no experiments, just the tried and true.
 Sometimes I'll buy that instead of someone's entire collection (like the
Pretenders, for example.)  I am always assuming people don't have the money
or patience to buy tapes of someone fooling around, because I never did.  But
I will consider it -- PJ Harvey's demos are supposed to be even better than
her second record, for example.
<p>
As for bootlegs -- I assume that if someone goes to all the trouble of
getting something illegally, they probably have the legit stuff already.
 Live is another thing -- my voice isn't that strong sometimes, so I don't
like the thought that there are lousy shows floating around somewhere.  That
doesn't mean I encourage bootlegs, but I figure what the hell.
<p>
Keep writing ( and I'll do the same ) --

Uh, I meant "Anton's" roof -- Anton was the keyboard player in my band and
the co-producer of "Days of Open Hand", and my boyfriend at the time.  How

Dear gang:
<p>
It has been a while since I posted a note, but I have been reading the
comments, as usual, with great interest --
<p>
I wanted to thank Eric S. for setting up the WWW page, along with Hugo and
Jeremy from AGF (am I leaving someone out?) -- I hear it's great. I haven't
seen it yet, as I don't have the software to get there (Mosaic, perhaps?).
<p>
Thanks for the messages of congratulations regarding my wedding!  For the
record, Mitchell is 41 and not 31, as they reported in the newspapers.  Not
that it matters, really !
<p>
Lately I have been working on a piece called "Fighting With Boys" which is
due to come out in Details magazine this spring. I am not sure which issue.
<p>
Regarding "Pilgrimage" -- yes, it was about the incense bowl, as it said the
quoted interview, but it was also about the journey to find my father, who I
met in 1988.  He lives in California, and I lived in New York, so I took a
plane trip across the country to see him for the first time since I was 18
months old.  So "years of an inch and a step toward a source" means my source
-- my father.  It's a song with at least two meanings.
<p>
Thanks for your questions and your comments -- I appreciate them with my
whole heart.

From:	Suzanne Vega<br>
<p>
<b>The following are Suzanne's comments on the Brian Rose Q/A, which were forwarded to the website:</b>
<p>
...[Brian Rose]  is the
"narrator" character of Tom's Diner;  (I was pretending to be him that
morning), and is one of the characters in the Boulevardiers -- 
<p>
"he loves the city with the bricks and broken bottles and the pretty little
flowers as they grow along the wall; he is dark, he is tall, he is the
tallest one of all of us." 
<p>
I think he was always annoyed that I didn't say "handsome".  His line in
Knight Moves is --"she doesn't have a political bone in her body", which he
said about me in a catty moment (there were many).
<p>
The real influence Brian had on me was getting me to listen to the Velvet
Underground -- I had just seen Lou Reed the year before I met Brian, and
though I coudn't forget it I hadn't really  explored the whole thing.  We
also listened to the Talking Heads and Television and Blondie and I think
Patti Smith, although that whole scene was dying out by that time.  We had
aspirations of being New Wavers.
<p>
Anyhow -- thanks again.  I'll stay in touch.

Hi gang -
<p>
Thanks to everyone who sent birthday greetings to me and to Ruby -- she
seemed to enjoy her birthday, though I'm not sure she knew what it was all
about.  She's getting her front teeth now and starting to take her first
steps.
<p>
I've been reading the comments as usual, and intend to answer some of them --
then time passes and everyone's on to a new thread, but I wanted you to know
that I do read this list.  One comment I agreed with recently -- the thread
was "Days of Open Hand" and someone was mildy complaining that it didn't seem
as " effortless" as some of the others -- I would have to go back and check
my files for the exact quote -- but I agree; it wasn't until the year as over
and I listened to the whole record that I realized how slow and careful it
sounded.  Anton  Sanko and I worked on it for just about a year, sometimes 20
hours a day, in my apartment, where we had a studio.  We never got away from
it.  So that's why now I forbid throwing around of musical ideas in the
house.  (Besides, you can put an eye out that way.)
<p>
Anyhow -- I think of you with affection (the readers of this list).   I
caught the measles earlier this year and for a moment thought of posting this
news to get sympathy, but resisted the urge.  ( I am all better and do not
need the sympathy now, so don't send it! :)
<p>
So thanks again and I will try to write soon.
<p>
Yours ever truly,

Date:	95-07-29 22:30:27 EDT<br>
From:	Suzanne Vega<br>
To:	undertow@law.emory.edu<br>
<p>
Hi gang --
<p>
you all did get my last message thanking you for the birthday greetings,
didn't you?  I got a copy of it myself, but the Internet sent me a message
recently saying they had "killed" the message because it was "undeliverable".
 Bizarre.
<p>
Anyway -- regarding the "greatest hits": obviously if it were a true greatest
hits package it would have 2 songs on it; Luka and Tom's Diner.  So it is
really intended to be a "retrospective".  
<p>
I think that to go back and take some songs from each album and place them
together in one collection would be interesting because it would change the
context of the songs.  To me, a song like "Cracking" is not that different in
concept from "Blood Makes Noise".  One is obviously -- well, noisier.  But
neither are really "folk songs".  To me they are more similar than they are
different.   And that would change the way people perceive the songs.  
<p>
Most people think of the first album as "more folk" and the last album as
"more industrial"  when actually all the albums are a mixture of acoustic
guitar and synthesizors (how the hell do you spell that?)
<p>
I'm also thinking of including other projects that were never included on any
album -- "Left of Center", "Salt Water",  possibly "Ignorant Sky", a song I
recently sang for Philip Glass (though I didn't write the lyrics).  A
retrospective is meant to give perspective.  (I want to get the "Squeeze "
one myself.)
<p>
If I could I'd release one every year, whenever I find I'm looking back and
trying to make sense of it all.  They could all have different slants like;  
"The Mental Health Collection ." featuring Cracking, Blood Makes Noise, and
others;  
"The Folk Songs of SV." featuring The Queen and The Soldier, Night Vision,
Bad Wisdom, Gypsy; 
"Love Songs."  with Night Moves.( that would be a very short retrospective so
far, I'm afraid).  
"SV Rocks Out" with Men In a War, Neighborhood Girls.  And so forth.
<p>
I'm getting silly now, sorry.  But I enjoy hearing what you would like and
your reasons, though I don't know that I will please everyone. (The DNA
version will probably be on it, and it will probably be called something
witty like "Retrospective").
<p>
I'm still trying to balance the "tried and true" with the "odds and ends".
 Maybe it will be  a 2 CD set -- one with "tried and true" and the other with
"odds and ends".  But first I have to finish the current one.
<p>
As to the "Covers" tape, of course, I am tickled that you would want to
undertake such a project.  I hope you are free and imaginative in your
interpretations.  I really liked some of the ones on Tom's Album ( though the
REM one was probably my least favorite).
<p>
Talk to you soon.

<p>
Dear Webmates;<br>
 (are we spiders? ducks perhaps?) -- (or "Gang", as I prefer it):
<p>
A lot has happened in a month.  I hear that we have been acknowledged by AOL
as one of their more "attractive" sites --  That's very cool, and Eric S
should take a bow for that --  I have to thank him personally for taking the
time to set up the page to begin with, and for maintaining it so well.
<p>
I wanted to say hi to Hugo and to welcome him publicly as the new editor of
the page.
<p>
I have to say that it is ironic to me that the page has received 370,000
"hits" in 6 months, when I am not able to access it yet myself -- I am
working on that and hope to be able to see it myself soon from my own
equipment.  I have only seen it once, and I was not aware that everything I
posted to Undertow was being filed in the Correspondence Section.
<p>
So I was very surprised by what Alex Beam said in his column -- how did he
know?  Did he subscribe to this list of 300 people?  No, he found it on the
board.  So I asked my management to ask Eric to remove 2 posts that I thought
could be harmful if taken the wrong way, including the "Measles" one. 
<p>
It was like thinking you were playing to an intimate club of 300 (this
newsgroup called Undertow) and suddenly realizing that every whisper was
being broadcast to hundreds of thousands of people (on the WWW page), some of
whom may not be interested but who are just cruising through for material
(that letter to Spin is at least seven years old.)
<p>
On reading it again, it really isn't that bad, and it is affectionate, and it
was taken out of context, for Christ's sake, so perhaps Hugo or Jeremy at AGF
could do me the favor of reinstating that particular one.  I am just going to
be more careful with what I say, as self-mockery in print is dangerous,
especially when inane editors of Melody Maker may be lurking somewhere
waiting for more cheap shots.  But then why blame the British, when we have
our own American Alex Beam!  (he is, right?)
<p>
When I have access to the page myself, I can give more input as to what
should or shouldn't be posted (not everything has to be).  Yes, Hugo, please
post this one!!
<p>
Quick updates regarding some questions you guys were peltering Eric with:
<p>
1.  I don't know what happened to the VH1 special regarding the Police.  It
has been postponed, is what they told me.  Maybe they shot it without me,
maybe it has been cancelled.
<p>
2.  "Fighting w Boys" -- unedited version -- I have to see what the legal
situation is with that.  I have to wait at least 90 days from July before
reprinting it anywhere.
<p>
3.  Amnesty Int'l forward -- I will have that for the page next week when I
am back in NY.
<p>
By the way -- my comments on the Steven Talkhouse gigs are:  I thought
Thursday's audience was great!  It was lively and excited -- Friday's was
good, too, but more subdued, more jaded?  I was tired also from the night
before.  I thought I was going to meet you, Wendy -- I thought you were the
woman at the soundcheck Friday.  But you came Thursday.  I should have known.
<p>
Enough for now.
<p>
Thanks again,<br>
yours truly,<br>

 Dear friends,
<p>
I should be glad if you would forward this message to Suzanne Vega or send 
comments to me on my E-mail address vvucic@sorosyu.ztn.zer.de
<p>
Dear Suzanne,
<p>
I am now currently in warsaw on one seminar on telecommunications and I found
your WWW-site.  I am amazed that it happened.  Though I like yor songs from
the very moment I heard them a several years go, I was amazed that I heard your 
voice in the interview with Leonard Cohen.
<p>
 Actually, I am originally from
the town Split on Adriatic coast in the Republic of Croatia (at the time when I 
heard your songs for the first time it was Yugoslavia). My parents are from 
Bosnia and herzegovina.  (Our family house in Mostar was burned down, some my
relatives were killed; I do not want to bother you with the horrible things.)
<p>
As you know the horrible war destroyed my country whith thousand of killed, 
enormous massive pain and sorrow are in the eyes of those who refuse to kill
anybody.  Of course, I am one who refused to kill anybody though police
wanted me two times to send in Bosnia to fight.  Those arrestments are nasty and 
traumatic but, nevertheless I am ready to suffer from much bigger pain if the
consequence is resistence to any kind of killing.  My friend who was living
in Split and who worked in Institute of Anatomy (he is currently in Edinburgh as
the asylum seeker) recorded the above mentioned interview and sent it to me.
He is wonderful guy, we discussed a lot on glandula lacrimalis-tear gland and
its importance on human functioning.
<p>
 I am now living in Belgrade and working 
for the Soros Yugoslavia Foundation.  I do a lot of work with the children 
refugees.  Since I heard that interview hundreds of times ( I like Lenny's 
songs very much., I must tell you that your songs are much closer to my
heart. 
<p>
 I am sorry f this sounds that I did not like your songs.  I liked them and 
Like them still very much but, from that time, I do not why, maybe beacuse "I
lived to long on my knees", you and Lenny are my the most respected
musicians. 
 I want you to know that there are still people who despite distances,
horrible 
pain and sadnees still believe in peace and love and who appreciate
compassion 
and empathy found in beautiful songs.  I do not like comments that songs as
you 
and Lenny sing are old.  Love, empathy, compassion, sorrow and happiness are
as 
old as the humankind is.  Those emotions are inherent to us and as we are
tring 
to inhibit them the risk for turning ourselves into something ugly is higher.
<p>
To be clean and shining despite all tempetations, dangerous situations that's
my goal.The music is a nice prysm through which shining souls are showing
their beautiful rainbow spectrum.  I will always like your and Leonard's songs.
I hope that there will be time when you and Lenny will come in my country and
sing your sings.  I will come and enjoy sincerity and spiritual love in your 
and his songs.  Hold on and continue your career; send my best wishes to
Lenny.  He is magician.
<p>
Peace and love,
<p>

"Yes, someone taped &#91;the Carson McCullers project&#93; -- I did, in 1988 and MTV did in 1992.  It was a
version of a one-act play I wrote when I was in college, based on the life
and work of Carson McCullers.  I did it as my senior thesis project --
dressed up as her, spoke in her Southern accent, smoked like her and later
discussed her work with the audience.  The original version had songs based
on her short stories and was called "Nothing Human", based on a quote she
liked -- "Nothing human is alien to me".  It was about an hour long.<p>

"I submitted it for a CAPS grant in the early 80's and it was rejected, but I
have taken it out over the years and dusted it off -- performed it at
benefits, readings and stuff like that.  I have a couple of the readings on
tape, and even some reviews from some of the shows (good ones).  The last
time I performed as her a few years ago, it was filmed by MTV -- they used a
piece of it for something -- but I decided not to perform it any more as I
felt the material was becoming too neurotic, or maybe I was becoming too

Hi again - 
<p>
Here's what Suzanne has to say about her new single, "Woman On The Tier" for
the Tim Robbins film DEAD MAN WALKING.
<p>
Suzanne writes:<br>

"It's for a movie called "Dead Man Walking", directed by Tim Robbins.  
The music is very aggressive -- like "Blood Makes Noise" but even harder.
It's a from a book written by a nun who becomes a spiritual advisor to a
killer on Death Row.
<p>
"It's supposed to come out December or January.  So
they say right now, anyway.  The other artists are Bruce Springsteen and
Eddie Vedder and one other to be determined.
It's a very "industrial" track -- like "Blood Makes Noise" but more so.
<p>
"I am checking w my manager to see whether I can post the words on the
internet before they are copywritten. 
<p>
"The song is from the book "Dead Man Walking" written by Sister Helen
Prejean.
I wrote it from the point of view of the nun (played by Susan Sarandon) who
befriends a killer on Death Row (Sean Penn).  The song is called "Woman on
the Tier" and takes place at the point where she comes to the jail to visit
him for the first time.  I'm happy with the lyrics."

Hi gang --
<p>
Just a quick note to let you know I am still reading everything and enjoying
the discussions very much -- sometimes the comments make me laugh out loud.
<p>
Regarding the music for "Woman on the Tier" -- it is very noisy, metallic,
dark, rhythmic -- no melody to speak of.  It's a big black noise.  In some
moods it is practically impossible to listen to.  Even Mitchell (Froom, my
husband and co-producer of this track), or MF as I call him, was irritated
sitting in front of the speakers while we worked on it.  (He had the flu that
day, also.)  I really like it.  But I was very happy with the lyrics, which
is why I posted them, and all the noise of the track won't make sense unless
you know the context, which is provided by the lyrics.
<p>
I am currently in the studio six days a week, and things are going well, I
think.  Maybe it would be fun to give you a synopsis of each song as it gets
finished.  Maybe you'd rather be surprised!  The new working title for the
album is "Slice of Life", for many reasons which I'll explain later if you
want.
<p>
Thanks for listening, all 262 of you, or is that 261 since the last
"unsubscribe"?

affectionately yours,

Hi gang --
<p>
I forgot to mention that the song "Woman on the Tier" won't be a single, so
it won't have any video with it.  I don't mind doing them -- at least I don't
dread them the way I once did.  I don't like cameras in general.
<p>
I like the Internet because we get to know each other without having to judge
each other's "images"  -- I get to know Wendy and Bobking, for example --
many others as well -- through their style of writing, their punctuation (or
lack thereof), their choice of words; things that are almost more spiritual
in nature.  We don't know who's thin, fat, pale or dark, or even man or
woman, neccesarily, which I like.  I prefer it this way.  In cyberspace there
are no appearances to be judged by (so far).

From:	Suzanne Vega<br>
To:	undertow@law.emory.edu<br>
<p>
Hi guys --
<p>
While I have a minute I will address a couple of things that have come up
recently --
<p>
One is a question from Huub Ritzema (next time post the question to the
group, not just me!) from the Netherlands -- this person would like to know
if I was going to do a duet with the singer Fish from the band Marillion --
if so, why? what's the connection?
<p>
Sometime in the late Eighties I ran into that band in a hotel in Sweden.  We
all met up in the bar.  I was drinking Drambuie, and he (being Scottish)
seemed very happy about this, and showed me new and various ways of drinking
it, including "depth chargers" where you put a shot-glass filled with
Drambuie into a larger glass filled with Guinness, where it plummets to the
bottom, and then you drink the whole thing down.
<p>
Well, it seemed like a great idea at the time, and we drank these things
until the bar closed, whereupon we all went back to his room, where he played
Pink Floyd music incessantly and began making out with one or two girls who
had been partying with us the whole night.  At about five-thirty in the
morning I went back to my room (I don't think he noticed) , and later that
morning he sent the remains of several six-packs and a1/4 bottle of brandy up
to my room, with a lovely note.
<p>
I don't remember much else about a duet, but it's possible we discussed it.
 No, the song had nothing to do with "Just Friends".
<p>
To answer Bobking when he noticed my connection to Fast Folk
and wondered whether I "embrace the label (of folk singer) as part of my
general identification with outsiders" --
<p>
I don't embrace the label.   But I did embrace the scene. (sometimes
literally, since I was involved with a few people from that folk scene in the
early eighties).   I loved Folk City from 1980  to 1985 -- the Kettle of
Fish, the Speakeasy -- all these places were a wonderful and fertile ground
for someone like myself who was a loner as a teenager and prone to being shy
and introspective.  So, yes, I was also surprised to hear Tracy Chapman say
there was no folk scene, since I had been happily participating in one for
years.  
<p>
I remember the day Jack Hardy said to me that he had an idea of putting out
an album a month.  I thought it was one of his crazy schemes.  But he did it,
and I handled "subscriptions" for a while. 
<p>
So I was loyal to the scene (and still am), but I have no loyalty to the
label of "folk singer" -- I write whatever songs in whatever styles happen to
come out the best way.  "Caramel" is a reworking of a song I wrote in my
teens called "Daniella", about a girl I used to babysit for -- musically it
reflects what i was listening to then, which was all of Antonio Carlos
Jobim's records, and of course, Astrud Gilberto, and Joao Gilberto, and the
recordings they did with Stan Getz.
<p>
Regarding your poem -- I can't comment on it now, but have saved it for
futher perusal!
<p>
That's quite enough, I think --
<p>

Hi gang --
<p>
Sorry it has been a while since I posted but as you might imagine, I've been
busy.  It's been fun meeting some of you on this radio and in-store promo
tour I'm doing -- I like connecting faces to the names I see so often!
<p>
There were a couple of things I wanted to clarify -- someone posted recently
complaining about the imagery of World Before Columbus, saying there were
other explorers before Columbus who proved the world was round, and that the
line "cruel as the  world before Columbus" was one that my Puerto-Rican
stepfather wouldn't have liked, implying, I guess that I was talking about
the cruelty of Native Americans? or indiginous people in general?
<p>
Normally I let criticisms go, but this one offends me because it is not what
I mean, not how I was raised, and not what I believe.  To me, the main image
of this song is that of the world being flat if this person's love were taken
away.  Nowhere do I mention Indians.  A flat world (surrounded by demons)
that one could fall off and never get back to is my idea of a cruel world.
 Similarly, when I say the world could be as "dark as the world before
Columbus" I am NOT talking about Africa, savages or anything like that,
implying that Columbus somehow civilized the world and made it bearable.
<p>
I am only referring to the one belief -- that the world was flat.   That's
all.  As for the other explorers you mentioned -- their names don't sing as
well.  I guess the choruses are clear enough.  Most of the time I don't mind
interpretations, but I found this one offensive.
<p>
I also wanted to answer Charlie's question of a month or two ago -- before he
shelled out the money for the new album he wanted my position on gay rights,
marriage, adoption, the whole shebang.  For the record, I think gay people
should have the right to marry, with all the privileges of marriage -- no, I
don't think it tears at the moral fiber of society, (as someone suggested); I
think quite the opposite.  But I don't think you should buy the album because
of  my political beliefs!  I am not running for office.  But since you wanted
my position -- there it is.
<p>
I enjoyed the live chat the other night!   I'll see you soon!  It's been an
exciting week.  Thanks to everyone --
<p>
love,<br>
Suzanne

Hey gang --
<p>
so tonight is the eve of the American tour.  so far, some shows are doing
really well.   New York and Chicago are sold out, but others are doing badly
-- Philadelphia, for example.  I wonder why?  We had a great in-store, but
the tickets aren't selling at all.  Is the ticket price too high?  Is the
venue out of town?  What is the ticket price?  How does it compare with the
others?
<p>
I have really enjoyed meeting you Undertowers on the road -- I met David in
Paris before the show, and U212 in NY , and Wendy! in LA -- usually if you
let me know you are an "Undertower" I will say hi and chat as long as I am
able to.  My schedule is going to be even more hectic than it has been, so I
won't be able to talk for a long time each time, but I really love putting
the faces with the names and thoughts.
<p>
We played the show in Paris and Germany.  It runs about an hour and a half --
so far there isn't a section where I tell stories formally  the way there has
been in other shows.   I will be trying some things out though, seeing what
the show needs.
<p>
So I'll be seeing you!
<p>
Affectionately yours,
<p>
Suzanne

Hi Gang!
<p>
        We are all here in Prague (as you probably know.) My computer stopped
working when we got to England a month a go (which you probably know as
well!)
<p>
	So I am missing all of last months mail - I have no idea what you have been
"talking" about.
<p>
	So far we are all in good health (knock wood.) The worst moment of the tour
so far was in Poland when we found out that the monitor man's baby had died
from SIDS back in the U.S. We dropped 'World Before Columbus' from the set
for that reason (temporarily.) He had gone home to be with his family.
<p>
	I saw Hugo in Stockholm - I had not seen him in a while and I was glad he
came. It was probably the show with the fewest people - Helsinki had the most
and I met some 'Undertowers' in the snow after the gig. 
<p>
	I am sorry I have not been able to read what people have been saying about
the shows!
<p>
	We picked up a little troll in Norway and I keep him in my pocket to amuse
Ruby - We were calling him "Matchee Fram" which was a mis-spelling of MF's
name in a Polish paper - See you soon.
<p>

	Affectionately yours,
<p>
Suzanne
