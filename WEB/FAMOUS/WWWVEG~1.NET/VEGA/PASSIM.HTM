Hi there! I'm sorry to be posting this so far after the fact, but you know 
how it gets. Leah and I saw Suzanne at the Orpheum Theater in Boston a
while ago and we decided to post our responses together, so here's what Leah
wrote and I'll add a few things to the end. I'll start out by saying it was
really wonderful to see her after all this time. We both saw her 5 years ago,
or so, at the same venue and I can still remember the feel of the songs going
through me...and we were in the balcony. I saw the last Passim benefit and
couldn't go to the concert at Avalon (?) because it was 21+ and I was 19.
Anyway, here's Leah's take on it.

        Hi everyone.  Karin and I indeed did go to the wonderful Passim
benefit (night 2) and saw Suzanne Vega, Ellis Paul, The Nields, Greg Brown,
and special guests Bill Morrisey and Jonatha Brooke.  It was GREAT!!!!  I
personally hadn't heard much adult Greg Brown before, though I love his
children's album, and I really enjoyed his thoughtful songs and witty
performance style.  The Nields are this crazy energetic new band that are a
blast to watch.  Suzanne was, as ever, musical and wonderful.  I loved
listening to the stories about her baby, as well as the random yet
meaningful piece about the "blow-job queen" (a la Liz Phair).  Suzanne, I'm
with you; I don't want to be anyone's blow-job queen either.  
<p>       It is lovely and generous of Suzanne Vega to donate her time to
Passim ( a wonderful small folk club in Cambridge, MA where many
artists,like Suzanne, got their start,and is now struggling for funds). 
Useless trivia: Rae Ann Donlin, co-owner and founder of Passim, told a
story about the first time "Small Blue Thing" was performed--at Passim.  Be
proud, fellow Massachuettsians!

Yes, I totally agree with all she said. It seemed to me that Suzanne was 
excited to be there talking to someone older than 6 months. :) I can't blame
you, Suzanne. They're not such great conversationalists, but they're
wonderful
listeners..unless you make them cry by singing sappy songs. But I guess you
won't be doing that again, huh?
<p>
Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the whole concert and was greatly amused by the
sad rendition of "Hey Jude" as the finale. It brought "humanity" to the 
performers. And was pretty funny. All the performers came on stage to sing
together...about 10 people...and not a one knew all the words.
I'm looking forward to forthcoming albums and wonder if anyone else out there
saw this concert?
<p>
That's enough for now. Back to your regular cyber-cruising!

Karin (& Leah)
