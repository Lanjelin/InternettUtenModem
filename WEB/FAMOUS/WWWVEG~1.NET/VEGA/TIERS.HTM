<b><h2>Woman On The Tier (I'll See You Through)</h2></b><br>
		Music & Lyrics by Suzanne Vega  <br>
<hr>
Too hot.  No air.<br>
Loud fan and a big tin can.<br>
Wait here.  Steer clear.<br>
They've gone to get your man.<br>
<p>
10 AM.<br>
Through gate 3 with picture ID.<br>
This old billfold<br>
Experiences security.<br>
<p>
I hear the click.  These men are hard.<br>
I'll see your face through bar and guard. <br>
You're new to me.  I'm new to you.<br>
I see your fate.  I'll see you <br>
You through.<br>
<p>
Ice within.<br>
And it's all cement in the government.<br>
Approved?  Then move<br>
To the plywood booth where the prisoner's sent.<br>
<p>
You read in red<br>
The letters on the door and you know what they're for.<br>
You feel unreal.<br>
And the rattling chain's coming over the floor.<br>
<p>
I hear the clock.  These walls are green.<br>
I see your face through tin and screen.<br>
You're new to me.  I'm new to you.<br>
I see your fate.  I'll see you<br>
You through.<br>
<p>
Too hot.  No air.<br>
Loud fan and a big tin can.<br>
Wait here.  Steer clear.<br>
They've gone to get your man.<br>
