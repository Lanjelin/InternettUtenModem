Dear Webmates,
<p>
Have you ever imagined a scenario if SV were to succumb to record 
company pressures and did a purely commercial record? I shudder to think 
of what would happen:
<p>
* The title of the album is "suzanne."
<p>
* Hugh Padgham, sound engineer on "Days of Open Hand" is at the helm as 
producer. Padgham is, of course, well-known for his work with Phil 
Collins. Oh, and Phil duets with Suzanne on an "Against All Odds" type 
of ballad that is also the theme song for a new Disney movie (probably 
the live-action "101 Dalmatians").
<p>
* A sequel of "Tom's Diner", "Tom's Ribs" is included in the album. 
"Tom's Ribs" details Suzi's warm observations in a black family-run 
barbecue restaurant. The single would include several remixes by R. 
Kelly (Down Home Mix, Chitterlin Mix), with guest rapper Ol' Dirty 
Bastard. Sample lyrics: "Where you been, girl? /You lookin' fine"/Says 
the man/Behind the counter/To the woman/Who has come in/She is 
shaking/Her derriere.
<p>
* Suzi embarks in a nationwide shopping mall tour to promote the album, 
a la Tiffany. Sponsored by Contempo Casuals.
<p>
* On the album cover, SV wears a white Gucci dress, and gold eyeshadow. 
She appears in several different outfits and hairstyles in the CD 
booklet. She thanks, among others, in her two page thank-you note, 
hairstylist Oribe and Steven Spielberg ("for inspiration").
<p>
* "Stockings" is adopted as the theme song for the new L'Eggs ad 
campaign.
<p>
* A&M actually spends some marketing money to promote the album.
<p>

Kidding? No way!

It'll be on Gangsta's tribute to Suzanne, which is called, "Solitude
Shootout."

Yes, Wendy, I was kidding!

 Dear "Easy-E, aka Grand (web)Master E."--
 <p>
 I'm a lurker who must tell you that this thread on "Suzi selling out" 
 is one of the most hilarious threads on Undertow, and I'm truly 
 enjoying the creativity and humor expressed. Keep up the good work!
 <p>
 Debra
 <p>
 P.S. I can't believe Wendy! thought "Gangsta Suzi" was for real!
 Wendy!, why don't you post some creative "Suzi sells out" material
 of your own? I think it would be great!

Dunno if I'd care.
<p>
Since being a music fan starting about 1970, I've had my
favorite artist "go gold" so many times it's just another
phase.
<p>
Usually what happens is after a few years, I realize that a lot
of the new material is BETTER. Peter Gabriel comes to
mind. 
<p>
Every artist wants to sell out! It's just a matter of the style of
selling out. 
<p>
Every fan wants their artist of desire to their own private
club/cult.

Hey - Khairyl started it! :)  Maybe this will draw Bob King out of lurkerdom,
perhaps to compose, "Glock In This Pocket" or "The Queen and the Homeboy"...
 He writes really well, I bet he can bust a rhyme.

<p>
        Bruce Springsteen also springs to mind; he "sold out" with BORN IN
THE USA after NEBRASKA and so forth, then came back with DEAD MAN WALKING.
<p>
        I have a copy of "Rock Notes" (?) magazine from way back in '92,
with an interview with Suzanne in which she "firmly denies rumours she's
working on a hip-hop album of her own". So I think she's one step ahead of
us ...
<p>
        Cheers,<BR>
                Robin

        That's TERRIBLE. Really really awful. I love it.
<p>
        OK, howzabout a country-and-western Suzanne retrospective?
"Solitude Scootin'" ... featuring "When Heroes Go Down (With Their Boots
On)", "Fancy Grits", "I Shot A Man In Liverpool, Just to Watch Him Die",
and, of course, "Tom's Country Bunker" ...
<p>
        I think I'll take a cold shower.

No no no no! It's "As Grits Go":<p>
<p>
You make some pretty good grits<BR>
as grits go<BR>
they still taste kinda dry<BR>
you shouldn't use the instant type
<p>
if I could choke these down<BR>
would I really be southern kind?<BR>
Or should I stick to pig's feet<BR>
and collard greens with pork rind?
<p>
(Insert Guitar Solo Here)
<p>
Oh, and then there's "Marlena-Lou on the Wall", and "Cracking (Sweet Peas)"
and "Cool Hand Luka" 
<p>
.. and now *I* have to take a cold shower...

Hello everyone,
<p>
I was temporarily disconnected for awhile due to server problems, but
I hope it's fixed now.  I just got the last ~50 Undertow posts all at once!
Good to see people introducing themselves and delurking.
<p>
The 'rap' Suzi and C&W Suzanne ('What if Suzi sold out') thread gets my
vote for most hilarious in a long time!  I think Neighborhood Girls is an
obvious choice for a rap re-do as "Girls 'n the 'Hood."  For C&W, how about
Fat Man and Dancing Girl re-done as "Preacher Man and Honky-Tonk Woman"? ;)
<p>
Aww - what the heck:  here's a little of 'Girls 'n the 'Hood':<BR>
(rap with obligatory chunky bass beat)
<p>
"I wuz walkin' in the mornin', by McKinsey's bar<BR>
Then I saw her comin', didn't have to look far<BR>
She had the long, black hair and the eyes of ice<BR>
And I said to myself, 'Hey, she looks kind of nice.'
<p>
Hangin' with my homeys at the party later on <BR>
She was talkin' this jive 'bout a backbone gone..."   OK, that's enough! :)
<p>

The 'woman singer and producer husband' list is interesting to think about
also.  I hadn't realized there were that many!
<p>

Back for now, pending lack of further mail server snafus (!),
<p>
-Rob
