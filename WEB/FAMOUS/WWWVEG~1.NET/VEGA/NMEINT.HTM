<i> A folkie for the yuppie Me Generation is how <b>Suzanne Vega</b> is all too often seen but as
<b>Alan Jackson</b> found out she and her songs are not as innocent as they seem.  Picture: A.J. Barratt
</i>
<p>
<b>Featherweight? Even</b> I, a man mountain at 9st.2lbs, feel muscle-bound and potentially lethal sitting 
beside her.  Our food reacts accordingly: a spinach salad cowers beneath its French dressing in a bowl before
me, while a selection of stir-fried vegetables relaxes prettily on Suzanne Vega's plate.  An overweight, slightly
camp waiter is hovering solicitously around her, wondering if she might like a cup to go with the pot of tea he 
had just brought her.  "Why yes," she replies in her dry, wry way.  "I think that would be helpful..."
<p>
And so she turns to me, acknowledging an earlier remark that she, more than most of us, must find that people 
react to her in a manner almost totally dictated by her outward appearance.  She sighs in belated agreeement.  
That certainly is something she finds.
<p>  
"People think I'm very thin and very pale and think of me as waif-like or whatever, but inside I'm really a six 
foot, 220lb. skinhead like my brother," she says matter-of-factly, picking up her cutlery.  I feel sure that I can see the 
 vegetables blanch upon her plate. 
<p>
She has the perfect disguise, of course.  Not our fellow diners in this Baltimore hotel, not our waiter, not 
even I suspected this hidden truth.  What we are reacting to is the slender, shallow-shouldered New York girl
 with the large, clear, wide eyes and the near-translucent skin.  Imagine the ways in which such a girl 
might walk on the wild side... by letting those library books run a day or two overdue, by skipping a dental 
check-up, by deliberately stepping on the cracks in the pavement.  But then, as we all know, nothing in this world 
is what it actually seems.
<p>
The difficulty other people have in perceiving her true identity is something Suzanne is aware of, but nothing that 
bothers ehr too much.  That's probably just as well, because those resistant to her discreet charms have laid 
a variety of dreadful charges at her door. 
<p>
One allegation is that she's nothing but a time-warped folkie washed ashore two decades late.  Another is that 
she's simply following in Joni Mitchell's Me Generation footsteps.  And the third and most serious, members of the 
jury, is that she's some kind of Joan Of Arc figure, providing musical catharsis for the upwardly-mobile.  Honestly, 
if a girl weren't so well-bred it would make her want to spit. 
<p>
"The question I get asked more than any other is do I think I'm a folk singer," she says.  "When I started off in 1981 
it was very easy to call myself that, because I was hanging out with other people who called themselves folk 
singers, playing acoustic guitar in clubs that were folk as opposed to rock.  I guess that's pretty much a folk singer."
<p>
She laughs a little, anticipating the next question.  Isn't it a pretty problematic thing to be in the late '80s?
<p>
"It wasn't something <i>I</i> had a problem with until it started becoming a problem with record companies, 
who don't want to know you if you're a folk singer.  If anything I got a record deal in spite of that fact, and 
even A&M turned me down twice before they finally took me on.  It's like, 'Folk? Oh god, how gauche...' "
<p>
Now, Suzanne figures, people can discuss what she is or isn't until the cows come home, while she gets on with more 
interesting pursuits.  To prove her indifference to the subject she neatly strngles her tea bag with its own 
little drawstring, squeezing the last drops out over the back of her spoon and into the cup.  And then she instances 
the day she defined her own artistic territory - the one on which she received tapes of two songs commissioned from 
her by Philip Glass, the most avant garde, esoteric work she has done to date, and of the Arthur Baker mix of 
'Left Of Center', the pop song she contributed to the <i>Pretty In Pink</i> soundtrack.  "I listened to them 
back-to-back and thought, well, the margins are pretty far apart, which gives me all this space to run around 
in between."
<p>
If the folkie jibe is irrelevant (and Suzanne Vega doesn't see the tag as the automatic insult many other people 
do),  then the Joni Mitchell comparison is erroneous.  Mitchell's concerns have been almost exclusively inward 
looking - she is the high proestess of the confessional - but Vega shivers with distaste at the idea of competing 
with parallel self-revelation.
<p>
If anything, she tends towards anonymity as a songwriter, most often choosing to submerge herself in the 
points of view of characters from literature ('Wooden Horse (Caspar hauser's Song)' and 'Calypso,' both on the 
new 'Solitude Standing' album) or of real or imagined third persons.  Could this be out of a high regard for her own 
privacy, or a fastidious dislike of the cult of the self?
<p>
"I'm not really interested in other people's <i>details</i>," she admits.  "I don't find I want to know everything 
about their private lives.  Brecht, for example, did not write about his affairs... 'Mack the Knife' is a great song 
on its own merits, not because it's about someone he slept with.  I have this feeling that, just because <i>I've</i> 
slept with someone, the whole world is going to be happy to hear about it."
<p>
Indeed Suzanne.  In fact, judging from the earnest faces of the male sector of the audience at Baltimore's 
Lyric Theater the previous evening, you might conclude that a sizeable proportion of Suzanne Vega's public 
would welcome an assurance that the slight figure in the spotlight was saving her virginity just for them.  Isn't 
this the point at which other people's expectations get beyond a joke?
<p>
"That's an interesting idea," she says, tugging at the shoulder of her black outfit so that the hint of something 
shocking pink is allowed to blossom forth momentarily.  "I remember being asked by some Japanese journalists 
once how, when I look so innicent on stage, I could refer to such things as cannibalism and oral sex.  I told 
them that I'm just not as innocent as I look."
<p>
Nor is she.  The impressive 'Solitude Standing,' which entered the official British album chart at No. 2 last 
week, neatly undercuts those CD-ish prejudices by courting subject matter as black as anything favoured by 
other, more fashionable prophets of doom.  But then, perhaps the real problem is that Suzanne doesn't  make 
enough <i>noise</i> to convince sceptics of darker intents, so that all they're left with is an impression of sweetness 
and light.  She's working on that one - on a warm-up date for her current world tour, ironically enough in 
Woodstock, she was encouraged by her band to take her electric guitar on stage. 
<p>
"My first time and the amp caught fire," she says simply. "It was a little embarassing, to say the least."
<p>
<b>Suzanne Vega has </b> this problem with the rest of the world, which may or may not account for her against-the-grain 
success.  For a large part of the time she feels like an outsider, and most especially amid the conspicuous consumption 
 of her own country.  Judging from the massed ranks of her public, many of them seeming to be very much on 
the <i>inside</i>, that's a position many of us indentify with, whether with justification or as some kind of 
emotional conceit.  It's a feeling she knew as a child, the eldest of four born within a short space of time to parents 
young themselves, and which was fanned during her school years.  It found its crystallization when, in her late teens, 
she enrolled as a counsellor at a summer camp for priviledged middle-class kids in America's Adirondack Mountains. 
<p>
"I remember one girl advising another that if, when they went to college, their room-mate was in any way 
queer, nt to hang out with them or else people would think she was queer too.  At first I thought they meant gay, 
but they didn't.  They meant <i>weird, strange</i>, in any way.  <i>Odd.</i> And then I looked at myself - there 
I was, singing Leonard Cohen songs at them, being paid to teach these kids how to disco dance to the Bee 
gees. I felt <i>so </i> strange."
<p>
Suzanne handles this feeling of otherness by internalizing her feelings.  From the demure, black-clad exterior 
to the detached, almost deadpan manner in which she delivers her sometimes chilly, often sinister songs, she is the 
very model of restraint.  Which helps people to preconceive and misconceive.
<p>
She feels this is a product of her upbringing, both as a New Yorker and as a member of a volatile if closely-knit 
family.  "My brother says that on stage I seem so gentle that I'm almost disappearing, fading in and out.  I think 
it's a response to violence.  It's not because I've grown up in a pasture somewhere.  I guess my character is 
more restraint than aggressive, but Im not a wimp.  I <i>will</i> stand my ground. I will fight if I'm pushed - I 
used to ahve to fight in school, to defend my brothers and sisters.  But having seen so much violence when 
I was growing up - emotional, domestic, on the street - I have an aversion to it now. I really <i>hate </i> it.  It 
makes me feel very sick."
<p>
The summation of this feeling comes in the song 'In The Eye', from the new album.  With habitual self-mockery, she 
introduces it on stage by saying that <i>if</i> someone were to threaten your life, and <i>if</i> you had the 
opportunity to sing as song before being killed, this might be an appropriate one: "<i>If you were to kill me now /
right here I would still / look you in the eye / and I would burn myself / Into your memory/ as long as you were 
still alive..."</i>
<p>
Isn't that called passive resistance Suzanne? Why be so stoical? Why not punch the bastard in the mouth (he's going 
to kill you anyway), or belt off down the road?  this stiff-upper-lip-at-all-costs stuff is the sort of thing your 
fellow New Yorkers go into therapy trying to breaking through.
<p>
"I guess so."
<p>
But you're desperately holding everything in...
<p>
"Well I <i>do</i> let things out sometimes.  But again, having seen so many people letting it all out to no good 
use ... there's only so much hysteria you can stomach before you have to say, hey, let's get a grip.  Someone 
round here had to take charge, keep things moving, do the dishes, make breakfast.  If you were to run around 
being hysterical all the time you'd never get anything done."
<p>
Suzanne has the sense to laugh at herself here.
<p>
"One journalist asked me, isn't it exhausting to hold that deadpan throughout one song?  I thought, one song? 
I hold that deadpan throughout my entire life."
<p>
<b>When she was</b> a schoolgirl Suzanne Vega used to wonder why it was always she who had to set the 
good example.  On the one side were her parents, old enough to do what they wanted, and on the other her brothers 
and sisters, too young to know any better.  that left just her, not old enough to do what she wanted, but 
definitely old wnough to know better.  Enough to make you ask yourself, why me?
<p>
"Yeah, sometimes.  For instance, it's strange that when I eventually moved out of my parents' apartment I moved 
straight in with a woman who, unknown to me, had a ten-year history of attempted suicide and all kinds of 
mental illness. I'm thinking, well maybe <b>she's</b> a little strange, but then I am too.  Before I know it she's 
spending each and every day curled up on her bed rocking back and forth.  Obviously I'm concerned, but this is 
the first place I've had away from home and I'm saying to myself, this is <i>unfair</i>."
<p>
It was, it is Suzanne.  But it's never too late to assert yourself against the world's unfairness.  Sod that good example.  
Overturn the table.  Throw those congealing vegetables at the maitre d'.  Order a bottle of bourbon and start 
talking dirty...
<p>
"This is the way that I am," she is saying. "This is the way I have always been.  I can't remember a time when 
I wasn't restrained.  It's in my personality.  But..."
<p>
Yes, yes. But?
<p>
There <i>is</i> a part of me that's very spontaneous, that likes to do things off the cuff and be very funny."
<p>
I'm sure there is, Suzanne, but ow much do you indulge that part of yourself? Don't you ever feel like drinking 
too much and losing all control? She nods sagely and for a moment I believe I can hear a skeleton rattling 
nervously in a cupboard.  Am I about to hear that Suzanne Vega has a serious drink problem? 
<p>
"for a while I would drink a lot and, you know, find myself sitting in someone's lap and carrying on," she 
grins, those clear eyes fixing me to my seat.  "There's this part of me that gets very flirtatious and will let loose 
in a second, but I find I don't always want to do that.  After all, "  and here she pauses a second for effect, "you 
have to go back to being restrained afterwards."
<p>
<b>Watching Vega</b> perform at the Lyric again that night, it becomes clear that whatever personal compromises
 this inbuilt reserve forces her to, it is the strength behind her art.  The songs on "Solitude Standing" that work 
best of all, subvert from within, gaining their force from the melodies in which their dark lyrics are wrapped and the 
cool, detached and lovely voice that delivers them.
<p>
"If you over-dramatize it and act it out on stage, by the end you're looking at a nervous wreck.  It's like, 
<i>oh, please.</i>  You have to understate, otherwise you're looking at someone falling apart on stage, which is 
embarassing.  It's the delivery that makes it work."
<p>
So, as she relaxes into the world tour that brings her to Britain this week, it's no good audiences expecting her to 
stray from the microphone and act her songs out in Kate Bush fashion?
<p>
"I'd feel very uncomfortable doing that.  I've just made a video for 'Luka' and I thought, come on Suzanne, you really 
should try and put more expression into this.  So, I was acting it out a little - not a lot, just some.   And when I 
saw the results it was just <i>horrible, </i> like <i>Oh Jesus Christ.</i> I had to ask them to cut out the parts 
where I was trying to look defiant or whatever.  The least little bit of exaggeration sent it flipping off into another 
dimension."
<p>
You mean, you tried the Billy Idol sneer, I venture sympathetically.
<p>
Suzanne nods quickly, shamefaced.
<p>
And the Shirley Bassey arm movements?
<p>
"Oh <i>no,</i>,"  she protests in horror.  "No, no, <i>no.</i> Never, <i>ever</i> the Shirley Bassey arm movements."
<p>
Well that's a relief.  What British audiences can expect however is more of the muscular sound previewed on the 
new album and created by her now-permanent four-man band.  The decision to augment her sound stemmed from 
her own disappointment at the overly-comfortable feel of 1985's debut set, and by the wish to be surrounded by a 
team of musicians who could contribute to the writing process.  Could it also have something to do with creating 
a sound more palatable to American radio programmers, who have largely ignored her work so far, hence denying 
her the chart success she has found in Britain and elsewhere?
<p>
"I'd be very surprised if I get onto Top 40 radio with this album, although it depends how carefully people listen to 
the lyrics.  I'd been asked to do some radio promotions here and so I went to one station and they said to 
me, everyone's really excited about your new L.P. - - what's the first single going to be and what's it about?
<p>
"Well, I'm saying it's called 'Luka' and it's from the point of view of a nine-year-old child abused by his 
parents.  The guy's nodding but his eyes are starting to glaze a bit.  then he asks me about the second single.  I tell him 
it's probably going to be the title track, which personifies solitude on a character, the third party in this 
relationship, and he's saying, oh, that's nice, and looking desperate.  I begin to tell him about 'In The Eye', the 
third single, wherein someone's life is being threatened, and I realize I've lost him altogether."
<p>
US radio could be something of a problem then, but even so Suzanne's doing her bit backstage, signing albums for a posse of 
lucky winners in a local radio station's promotional contest.  Inevitably there's one guy who thinks he's paying her a big 
compliment when he tells her she sounds far better without any electronics and that she really shouldn't 
bother with a band.  The situation is made worse by the fact that a photographer is snapping away throughout 
this exchange and the erst of the contest winners are grinning down at her inanely as she perches uncomfortably 
on the edge of her chair.  Does Suzanne Vega fly off the handle and stab Mr. Tactful in the eye with her pen? Not a 
bit of it.
<p>
"Well, that's certainly one point of view," she says pleasantly, handing him his album and shaking hands goodbye.  
And as she turns as requested to sign the backstage pass a female fan has foolishly stuck to the leg of her 
jeans, there's just the slightest cloud of annoyance in those clear, wide, wise, <i>restrained</i> eyes.
