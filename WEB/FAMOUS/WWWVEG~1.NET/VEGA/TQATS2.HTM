Today, I discovered all the discussion on this song while I was browsing
around America On Line.  I cannot believe how many people know TQATS, how
many people think about it. I have always felt like it was about me, but I
never understood how.  The song got me through my summer, I sang it in the
shower almost every day.  Okay, here are some more questions to think about.
 In the beginning, when the soldier says, "I've watched your palace up here
on the hill, and I've wondered whos the woman for whom we all kill, but I am
leaving tomorrow and you can do as you will, only first I am asking you why."
 This seems like the soldier does not know the queen, although she "has seen
his face someplace before."  He knows that she exists, and that he has been
killing for her (along with everyone else).  He does not know anything about
why they are all doing this.  It also seems as though he has given up on her
before he even knows her motives. NOw that he has given up, he tries to
understand her purpose and is let inside.  If she is  supposed to represent
all women (and he all men), does this mean that after men give up on women as
something to battle for, that they finally try to understand them.   Is this
similar to the way she gives up in the end? Or has the queen given up from
the beginning?  The soldier then says "I've got this intuition, says it's all
for your fun, and now will you tell me why."  Perhaps he thinks women play
games, that it's all one big game.  When she responds, "..with an arrogant
eye.  You won't understand and you may as well not try."  THis could mean
that he will never understand why she plays her games.  I think it means that
the game is all his illusion and she knows it.  Men think that women tease
men, hurt men for fun, as a game.  THe queen knows how mistaken the soldier
is.  That is why she is arrogant, he won't understand that she is a human
being.  Maybe the "castle on a hill" is the soldiers illusion, just that they
are killing for her.  THey are killing for themselves.  Maybe instead of
being immature, the queen is wise and knows they are fooling themselves into
thinking they are killing for her.  WHen she does try to let him inside, when
she tells him about bleeding, when she shows him her humanity, he bows her
down to the ground and tells her she is hungry and weak.  He says "I won't
march again on your battlefield", he has missed the point of what she has
told him.  He still thinks he is at war with her.  I don't know how much of
this I believe, but your feedback would be  greatly appreciated.

Replying to Rebecca Schiff,<br>
<p>	I remember talking to my roommate a few years ago, about this
song, and *at the time* it just seemed obvious that the soldier and
queen were some sort of (maybe secret) lovers, which my roommate
didn't think was true - he figured they didn't know one another.
<p>	I thought it was basically about the isolation of 'rank',
that she was the ruler and commander of her subjects and army, and
that the 'secret burning thread' she swallowed was the bitter pill of
her 'responsibility' to her country, which, as its ruler meant 
(she felt) that she had to make horrible decisions and set her 
feelings to one side.
<p>	So, when she has the soldier killed, she's doing it for
mixed reasons. For one, she could not marry a common man, and she 
would not have her authority challenged (for pride and the sake of
her reign and country), nor would she have her isolation broken.
<p>	I think her authority and isolation are, at least to her, 
necessarily bound together, and to lose one would mean the loss of 
the other. In the end, then, she's left in the 'solitude that she 
preferred'.
<p>	Well, that's the way I see it, and thinking about it that way
I'm sure you could read something about the relationships between 
men and women (I figured you were a man when I read your letter,
cos I read it as 'women hurt men for fun', instead of 'do men think that
women do this..' ; my fault for reading too fast). 
But I don't think that it's taking any sides between men and women - 
read King for Queen and female soldier for male soldier ? Okay, the 
story wouldn't seem as much a typical fairytale, but I think that 
my meaning's clear.
<p>	I can't explain why I think that the two are lovers in the story,
but I do think that it's somehow implied; guess I'm too stoopid to 
figure out how.<br>

<p>
My own opinion is that the entire event is representational of an occurrence
in Suzanne's life dealing w/ a power struggle, a 'secret' relationship which
is somehow hurtful or damaging.  In the Performing Songwriter interview from
last year, she even says so herself.  She said the original idea was about
two queens fighting each other, and once she got the idea of substituting
a soldier for one of the queens and "put[ting] the battle outside the 
castle," the song made more sense.  Perhaps the soldier's 'intuition' is
a remnant from the earlier idea, since we really don't hear too often of 
"male intuition"! :-)
<p>
Also in the interview, she says that the "secret burning thread," which the
queen swallows, is possibly representative of a relationship ("I used to
think
of relationships between people as threads...").  So, I would characterize
the
song as using the battle metaphor to highlight these aspects of power and
possible abuse in a relationship.  Ultimately, of course, the queen keeps
everything inside, breaks off the relationship without telling the other
person why ("the soldier was killed *still waiting for her word*"), and goes
on alone.  Important thing to think about - a 'castle' represents someone's
home - draw your own conclusions!
<p>
BTW, the last line, in which Suzanne sings the words "*strangling* in the 
*solitude* she preferred / the battle ** continued on" is not only a great
lyric but excellent musically w/ those short, punctuated guitar chords -
here represented by the asterisks.  Very effective at conveying the point.

I have a bootleg (1982  or 86 concert at the London School of Economics) 
in which SV introduces Q&S as "this is not a love song", or words to that 
effect.<br>
Also, when introducing "the rent song" she says friends always complain 
that she only writes on two topics, those topics being love and mental 
illness, and that she had thought about what else is there to write 
about. She also ads that since writing it, friends have classified it as 
a mental health song...

Okay then: what about Rebecca Schiff's earlier question - what are everyone's
thoughts on 'The Queen and the Soldier', its meaning in the story and its
relevance to relationships between people (and *did* the soldier know the
Queen, and if so, how well?).<br>
