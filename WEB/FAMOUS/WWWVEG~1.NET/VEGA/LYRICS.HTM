<A NAME="magic"><h2><b><i>The Magic Kingdom</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>
There's a riot of color on Main Street<br>
And the cops can't keep from smiling<br>
There are people taking photographs<br> 
Standing arm in arm with Mickey Mouse<br>
Back to the future<br>
On a monorail to Tomorrowland<br>
There's music piped in everywhere<br>
Marching bands and fireworks in the sky<br>
<p>
It's a small world<br>
Smaller but more fun<br>
And more is more<br>
In the Magic Kingdom<br>
<p>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah<br>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah-day<br>
<p>
Mickey was all circles <br>
Said Mr. Hench, Vice President<br>
Round shapes are softer <br>
Like clouds, hills, babies and so forth<br>
You can handle anything <br>
If it gets down to your size says Mr. Hench<br>
Everything is slimmer <br>
Than it should be and it soars<br>
<p>
It's a small world<br>
Smaller but more fun<br>
And more is more<br>
In the Magic Kingdom<br>
<p>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah<br>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah-day<br>
<p>
There is little that is black <br>
Black is mystery and holes and things<br>
The farther away you recognize danger<br> 
The more comfortable you feel<br>
The people say gee we had a good time<br> 
But they don't know why<br>
It's because they forget <br>
Tomorrow and yesterday<br>
<p>
It's a small world<br>
Smaller but more fun<br>
And more is more<br>
In the Magic Kingdom<br>
<p>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah<br>
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah-day<br>

<A NAME="street"><h2><b><i>The Street</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>

The sidewalk is swept by the super's wife<br>
The broom is her partner the dance is her life<br>
She sings in the morning and she sings at night<br>
From her fire escape garden by the amber street light<br>
   <p>
There is a street of hope<br>
There is a street of despair<br>
There is a street balanced 'tween neglect and care<br>
   <p>
Her children are scattered to the pavement like seeds<br>
Where they grow in the cracks as stubborn as weeds<br>
She sings to the birds who visit her window<br>
And she scatters some seeds on the sidewalk below<br>
<p>   
From the roof there is splendor a city in the sky<br>
Lost to the skylight's dull-witted eye<br>
As she plants her feet on the concrete sod<br>
She says to her husband we are closer to God<br>
<p>   
And far up the avenue in the glittering stars<br>
In the region of rooms in the zone of black cars<br>
Where wave after wave pounds on the shore<br>
By that standing army the keepers of doors<br>
<p>   
The sidewalk is swept by the super's wife<br>
The broom is her partner and the dance is her life<br>
She sings in the morning and she sings at night<br>
From her fire escape garden by the amber street light<br>
   <p>
There is a street of hope<br>
There is a street of despair<br>
There is a street balanced 'tween neglect and care<br>

<A NAME="fever"><h2><b><i>Fever (La Lune)</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>

I'm hot and cold<br>
I'm feeling ill<br>
I have this pain<br>
A pain to kill<br>
   <p>
Fever, fever<br>
La lune<br>
<p>   
I'm sinking through<br>
A lake of sleep<br>
Drowning with you<br>
Drinking so deep<br>
<p>   
Fever, fever<br>
La lune<br>
<p>   
I'm seeing things<br>
That can't come true<br>
I'm dreaming lies<br>
I lie with you<br>
<p>   
I'm hot and cold<br>
I'm feeling ill<br>
I have this pain<br>
A pain to kill<br>
<p>   
Fever, fever<br>
La lune<br>

<A NAME="in"><h2><b><i>In The Mirror</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>

There's a girl who stands in the mirror<br>
She looks for the story in her eyes<br>
She follows the curves of her body<br>
Wearing nothing but a naked disguise<br>
   <p>
I'm in love with the girl in the mirror<br>
I look over her shoulder and stare<br>
She's looking at me as I'm watching her<br>
Running her hands through her hair<br>
   <p>
On the border of her body<br>
She traces the bumps and the folds<br>
Each open plain and hiding place<br>
Each dark thicket of her soul<br>
   <p>
I'm in love with the girl in the mirror<br>
In the light so cold and stark<br>
I am drawing the lines of her body<br>
A faint bruise and a pale birthmark<br>
   <p>
There's a girl who stands in the mirror<br>
She looks for the story in her eyes<br>
She follows the curves of her body<br>
Wearing nothing but a naked disguise<br>
   <p>
I'm in love with the girl in the mirror<br>
I'm in love with the girl in the mirror<br>
I'm in love with the girl in the mirror<br>

<A NAME="st"><h2><b><i>St. Brigid's</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>

I venture out with hopes I have doubt<br>
I know not where these feelings are bound<br>
I wander by the tailor's <br>
Shop on the wrong side of town<br>
These beat streets breed defeat<br>
I am alone and I am afraid<br>
As the shops close the eyes know<br>
That no one will come to your aid<br>
   <p>
And the bricks fall upon us all<br>
By St. Brigid's the church bells chime<br>
And the landlords and the warlords<br>
By St. Brigid's they bide their time<br>
   <p>
The breeze stirs the winter<br>
My eyes are stormy and grey<br>
I call to a friend can we still be friends<br>
If I hold my heart at bay<br>
The answer's a smile that warms me awhile<br>
Till the next time we meet the street mime<br>
Where strangers pass through broken glass<br>
Fearing an ambush of time<br>
<p>   
And the bricks fall upon us all<br>
By St. Brigid's the church bells chime<br>
And spring blooms in costume<br>
By St. Brigid's I bide my time<br>
<p>   
The shadow of tomorrow<br>
Ever keeps me here in the dark<br>
As danger stalks where money talks<br>
Deep in Tompkin's Square Park<br>
This hungry night of street lights<br>
Lies like a dog beneath the moon<br>
This pale night turns white<br>
As my dreams sway and swoon<br>
<p>   
And the bricks fall upon us all<br>
By St. Brigid's the church bells chime<br>
And my love grows solo<br>
By St. Brigid's I bide my time<br>

<A NAME="open"><h2><b><i>Open All Night</i></b></h2></a> 

   <p>
Smoke blue breath in the window<br>
Harsh lights and watery eyes<br>
Burnt out butt out and out of sight<br>
The deal goes down at moonrise<br>
   <p>
A newspaper blows through this tunnel of love<br>
A tumbleweed in the city blight<br>
Pissing neon in the pouring rain<br>
Open all night<br>
   <p>
Skin green splitting in the back room<br>
Still praying to God above<br>
Dim names left back in the diner<br>
All for a thimble full of love<br>
   <p>
There's news of a murder up at 14th and T<br>
And the waitress shivers with fright<br>
As two cops tell a fish story<br>
Open all night<br>
   <p>
She wipes the counter and she sweeps the floor<br>
She makes the coffee and she asks do you want some more<br>
She looks in the eyes of a desperate man<br>
She can't say much but she can understand<br>
Another aimless loner<br>
Another brittle voice<br>
Another ghostly goner<br>
His head in his hands<br>
Open all night<br>
   <p>
And outside the street is a minefield<br>
To the ex-soldier with the tattooed arm<br>
A cigarette stuck on his lower lip<br>
He thinks of his mom back on the farm<br>
   <p>
And thick thighs snicker behind him<br>
She says boy you don't have to fight<br>
Come on home with me baby<br>
I'm open all night<br>

<A NAME="danger"><h2><b><i>The Danger</i></b></h2></a> 

  <p> 
Wrote a letter faith in the mail<br>
Yes I'm praying that my words will not fail<br>
For I have not gotten through <br>
And all I have to say is I need you<br>
Competition is at your door<br>
For I've fallen in love with the danger<br>
the danger the danger the danger that is you<br>
   <p>
In the panic of no return<br>
I realize my bridges have been burned<br>
And the moment of truth has come<br>
And the moment of truth has struck me dumb<br>
Desperation is at your door<br>
For I've fallen in love with the danger<br>
The danger the danger the danger that is you<br>
   <p>
I look around at this mess<br>
A year has passed and left me in distress<br>
Whereupon you did fall<br>
And all I have to hold is your call<br>
Renovation is at my door<br>
For I've fallen in love with the danger<br>
The danger the danger the danger that is you<br>
   <p>
Wrote a letter faith in the mail<br>
Yes I'm praying that my words will not fail<br>
For I have not gotten through<br>
And all I want to say is I need you<br>
Inspiration is at my door<br>
For I've fallen in love with the danger<br>
The danger the danger the danger that is you<br>

<A NAME="swan"><h2><b><i>The Swan</i></b></h2></a> 

   <p>
The swan the swan the end at last<br>
The season delayed by a wintry blast<br>
Blew bitterly by and by it blew<br>
The swan the swan sailed out of view<br>
   <p>
She fell in love at last so I heard<br>
And flew away a beautiful bird<br>
I walk the shore where illusions float<br>
The stars fall like piano notes<br>
  <p> 
My work goes on the daydream drones<br>
And late at night I am perfectly alone<br>
The cries of one across the lake<br>
I rise to speak and fall awake
 <p>  
I have gained my ground and lost the swan<br>
I have come of age but she is gone<br>
She is truly gone and all is clear<br>
The swan the swan has disappeared<br>
  <p> 
The swan the swan distant and cold<br>
Beautiful to see impossible to hold<br>
She fell in love at last and flew away<br>
Through a looking glass some folks say<br>
  <p>

<A NAME="burn"><h2><b><i>Burn Burn Burn</i></b></h2></a> 

<p>   
Drew a gun cold on the page<br>
My pencil splintered with such intimate rage<br>
Curl in the corner black snake coiled<br>
Curl in the drain black midnight oil<br>
Running through my veins<br>
<p>   
And now I've run away with a bottle of desire<br>
An empty rumor that has set this world on fire<br>
World on fire<br>
Burn burn burn<br>
<p>   
At the wishing well I wished you well<br>
A penny falling like an angel in hell<br>
Come back my angel bird on the loose<br>
If we can't settle down we'll make a truce<br>
For the sake of friends<br>
   <p>
And now I've run away with a bottle of desire<br>
An empty rumor that has set this world on fire<br>
World on fire<br>
Burn burn burn<br>
<p>   
Ten years tumble your face is blurred<br>
My friend my friend where is your nerve<br>
Moon on the river waves in the sky<br>
Ghost on the water diamonds in my eye<br>
But I do not cry<br>
   <p>
And now I've run away with a bottle of desire<br>
An empty rumor that has set my world on fire<br>
World on fire<br>
Burn burn burn<br>

<A NAME="cities"><h2><b><i>Cities On The Aerial Paths Of Communication</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>  


Dreamers of a bright and shining world<br>
Built on the ruins of ancient palaces<br>
Architects descend the Odessa Steps<br>
To their blueprint islands<br>
On the Black Sea<br>
   <p>
Cities of glass and of light<br>
Floating spheres in the night<br>
On the wings of imagination<br>
On the aerial paths of communication<br>
   <p>
Princes paupers and the proletariat<br>
Thrown in the cauldron of utopia<br>
Hid in the cells of workers' housing<br>
From the whispers and and the echoes<br>
Of Moscow nights<br>
   <p>
Workers with nothing but to lose<br>
Swept up in a chain reaction<br>
Falling dominoes splitting atoms<br>
Poisoned the cornucopia<br>
Of the Ukraine<br>
   <p>
Visions of a faith built of steel<br>
Flung high above the onion domes<br>
Lie dead on the drawing boards of history<br>
Lost in the cold of Siberia<br>
And over Red Square<br>
   <p>
Cities of glass and of light<br>
Floating spheres in the night<br>
On the wings of imagination<br>
On the aerial paths of communication<br>

<A NAME="factory"><h2><b><i>Old Factory Town</i></b></h2></a> 
<p>   
As I was sleeping the rain fell down<br>
Washing the streets of this old factory town<br>
I dreamed of the watchman making his rounds<br>
As the rain fell on this old factory town<br>
   <p>
When I awoke my wife was gone<br>
Down to the kitchen at the break of dawn<br>
I could hear her humming our favorite song<br>
When I awoke at the break of dawn<br>
   <p>
I kissed her waving frame in the door<br>
To rustle the kids and tend to the chores<br>
Each night she whispers let's have one or two more<br>
Rustling kids to tend to the chores<br>
   <p>
I punched in at seven at J.T. McTell<br>
Iron and brass hotter than hell<br>
Where I cast the clappers of church steeple bells<br>
Iron and brass at J.T. McTell<br>
   <p>
The whistle at four to the bar for a round<br>
Quenching the thirst of this old factory town<br>
The lights come up as the sun goes down<br>
Over the bars in this old factory town<br>
   <p>
As I was sleeping down the rain fell<br>
To strike in the streets and scatter pell mell<br>
Oh I dream of the clamor of all the church bells<br>
Cast in iron and brass at J.T. McTell<br>
