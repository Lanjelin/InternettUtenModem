              TIRED OF SLEEPING

             Oh Mom, the dreams are not so bad
             It's just that there's so much to do
             And I'm tired of sleeping

             Oh Mom, the old man is telling me something
             His eyes are wide and his mouth is thin
             And I just can't hear what he's saying

             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
             It's just that there's so much to do
             And I'm tired of sleeping

             Oh Mom, the kids are playing in pennies
             They're up to their knees in money
             And the dirt of the churchyard steps

             Oh Mom, that man he ripped out his lining
             He tore out a piece of his body
             To show us his "clean quilted heart"

             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
             It's just that there's so much to do
             And I'm tired of sleeping

             Oh Mom, the bird on the string is hanging
             Her bones are twisting and dancing
             She's fighting for her small life

             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
             It's just that there's so much to do
             And I'm tired of sleeping

             Oh Mom, I wonder when I'll be waking
             It's just that there's so much to do
             And I'm tired of sleeping
</PRE>
