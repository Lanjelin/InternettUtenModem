     <i>Following the release of Suzanne's self-titled debut album in early
1985, the first Suzanne Vega Band was formed, featuring Michael Visceglia on
bass guitar.  Five years later, he remains as the onyl member of that original
line-up.  In this exclusive interview, Michael tells of how he came to embark
upon a career in music, recalls those early days in the clubs and colleges of
the United States and discusses the development of the band.</i>
<p>
     When I was ten I started taking piano lessons, and I moved into a few
guitar lessons when I was about eleven.  I studied classical guitar for about
a year and a half, and later on I studied jazz guitar for about a year.
<p>
     When I was about twelve or thirteen, a local band was rehearsing in my
garage and I used to go down and watch them.  Then my father came down one
day; they were having some trouble with their bass player, and with a little
bit of pressure about  "Since you're rehearsing in <i>my</i> garage, why don't
you give <i>my</i> son a chance to play in your band?"  That was my first real
band; we were playing all the radio songs of the day, some Jimi Hendrix,
Beatles, Young Rascals.  We used to wear sequins and jackets with medallions
on, like Spinal Tap, you know - <i>Listen To the Flower Children!</i>
<p>
 <b><i>Were you writing songs?</i></b>
<p>
     Oh, yes.  I've always written.  And I have my own tunes out on records,
particularly on an album that I did with Spy.
<p>
  <b><i>Can we talk about your work with Spy?</i></b>
<p>
     Well, around 1976 I joined John Cale's band, touring.  We did a tour of
England and Europe and after a year and a half of that it was turning out to
be a really bad experience - the whole thing.  He was a really hard guy to
work for and I was really kind of disillusioned.  I have a bunch of friends in
New York, and they were feeling similarly about what they were doing, so we
decided to put our own band together and see where that would take us.  We
did this band called Spy, which went through a few different incarnations and
basically lasted about three years.  We got a record deal with Don Kirshner;
his other band was Kansas, and we were a very Kansas-type band.  We did one
record which didn't come out very well, and it cost a fortune, and I guess they
decided we really didn't have the goods after all.  So, we were dropped, the
album was released with a very big whisper, and that was the end of it.
<p>
 <b> <i>You played with Kate and Anna McGarrigle on their album</i> Dancer
With Bruised Knees...</b>
<p>
     John Cale was asked by their producer to help on that album and they
needed a bass player for it.  I was still in his band at that time and he
recommended me.  That was a really good experience because I got to play with
some really good studio musicians - some of the greatest in the world
actually - and it's a really nice record.  I played on four tunes, including
the title track.
<p>
<b><i>What about Flo & Eddie?</i></b>
<p>
     The Flo & Eddie thing turned out to be mainly good.  They're very funny
and they've done some very good stuff, especially when they were working with
Zappa.  I enjoyed it a lot; it was hard work - a lot of touring - but it
eventually got to be more of an oldies act than anything else.  I played with
them for a long time, but it became a dead end.  I thought, 'I have to leave
this otherwise I'm going to be forty years old and presenting myself as an
oldies act, and I don't want to do that.'  I knew I had to get involved with
something that was more vital, so I quit.  I had no other job - I hadn't met
Suzanne at the time - but within three months I had gotten this thing.
<p>
 <b><i>How did you and Suzanne first become aware of one another?</i></b>
<p>
     Well, I had heard of her.  I mean, there was word of her around New York.
And we had a mutual friend in Lucy Kaplanski; they actually had an apartment
together for a while.  One day I was doing a club thing with Jon Gordon,
playing country rock in this club called the Lone Star, and he mentioned to
me that he'd just been working with Suzanne - that she'd got a record deal
and so on - and at some point she might need a band, and he'd keep me in mind.
Then one day she did need a band, and he recommended me.
<p>
 <b><i>The album was already finished, so your first work with Suzanne was
touring?</i></b>
<p>
     Right after the first album was done, she started playing in April of
1985.  The first tour we did was without a drummer.  We went out for seven
weeks in the United States.  It was just Suzanne, myself, Jon Gordon and
Peter Zinsmeister, whose stage name is Peter Zale.  It was hard; we played
small clubs, and we were travelling in a trailer pulling a little... what we
call a <i>U-Haul</i>, - a tiny little box with wheels that had the equipment
in it.  All of us were driving, and we stayed at little flea-bag hotels.  We
went all over the United States, east to west.
<p>
     The audiences were small, sometimes it was only twenty, thirty, forty
people.  But as the buzz was getting bigger, the audiences started getting
bigger.
<p>
     After that we added Sue Evans - we decided it would be nice to have a
drummer in the band - and the second time we went around to these cities,
we were playing larger and larger crowds, larger places.
<p>
  <b>   <i>The first U.K. show was at the London School of Economics, October
24th, 1985...</i></b>
<p>
     Yes.  I think that Suzanne had it going here right from the beginning;
for some reason they really took her to heart, almost immediately.  Suzanne
always did much better here than she did in the States.  I don't know why,
but for some reason here it's always been more and more, bigger and bigger,
very quickly.  After the L.S.E., we were back in the States; it started
happening, especially in the colleges.  Not as exciting as over here, but it
was picking up.
<p>
 <b>    <i>That line-up with Sue Evans, did it feel like the first "solid"
Suzanne Vega Band?</i></b>
<p>
     Yes, but it never felt permanent.  Sue Evans is a very successful studio
musician in New York, and I knew that no matter how much she said she was
into the band, that eventually it was going to be a great conflict of interests
for her.  Peter was more of a jazz-influenced, fusion-influenced keyboard
player.  With Jon it was a combination of things; I guess he was a little
dissatisfied with what he thought the future was going to hold, and he was
torn between coming out on the road and staying at home, so I think he opted
to stat at home and concentrate more on other things.
<p>
  <b>   <i>The Albert Hall shows in 1986: It's a very prestigious venue, lots
of history, the Bob Dylan connection, etc... Were you conscious of that on
the night?</i></b>
<p>
     Oh yes, and I think it comes across like that too: it was a very reserved
show.  In the video of it I don't think they got rid of that sense of
reservedness about it, even with editing.  It's a very formal setting; it
was a similar feeling when we played Carnegie Hall in New York.
<p>
 <b><i>Were you aware of just how things were taking off?</i></b>
<p>
     Well, I could see that it was getting bigger, but I never thought we would
have a number three song in America; it never seemed to me that Suzanne would
have that kind of appeal - that she would go Top Five, which is a very big
success.
<p>
     <i>Luka</i> was a surprise to all of us.  When the tune was done,
everyone was saying 'This is going to be a hit, this is going to be a hit,'
but we've all heard that before, so we didn't really know.  Then we started
hearing reports on how the radio stations were really into it, it was getting
heavy rotation, and it was selling really well and just started climbing up
the charts, and we started watching it... When it got into the Top Forty we
were amazed, and when it got into the Top Twenty we were astounded.  When it
got into the Top Ten we were agog, and when it got into the Top Five we just
couldn't believe it!
<p>
 <b>    <i>Was there a time when you thought it would go all the way to the
top?</i></b>
<p>
     Oh yes!  I started believing it after a while - it was hard to ignore.
And everybody was saying 'I think it's gonna go up, it's gonna go up to
number one!', but it got to number three.  Everybody was very happy; it was
a great success to get it that high.
<p>
 <b>    <i>How did it feel to be suddenly in "the mainstream"?</i></b>
<p>
     Well, it was good because I think it gave everybody the feeling that now
people are more familiar with the sound and they're open to it and will listen,
maybe it could happen again if we came up with the right thing.  The chance of
having another hit is now probably greater than before.
<p>
 <b>    <I>Yet both</i> Gypsy <i>and</i> Solitude <i>did badly...</i></b>
<p>
     Yes.  Well I never thought <i>Gypsy</i> would happen, never.  But
<i>Solitude Standing</i>, I have to admit I thought it had enough going for it.
But I guess it was just a little too off-beat.  It would have meant a lot to
the band too, because that was one of the band-composition songs.
<p>
  <b>   <i>You played two very large shows in '87, at the N.E.C. and Wembley.
Were you nervous?  Did you worry about adapting the show for larger arenas?</i></b>
<p>
     I guess the larger venues were really experiments to see if Suzanne could
project, and I think she can.  It was no problem, it really seemed to work.
We just added to the production value - made a nicer stage presentation
visually.  I thought the N.E.C. was definitely the better of the two shows.
<p>
     I wasn't nervous at all at the N.E.C. show.  I sometimes get nervous;
playing in London, playing in New York, they always seem to be more nerve-
racking because I know they're very prestigious; the audience is usually full
of luminaries - people that I respect and want to impress.  Thos situations
get your adrenalin going a little more than usual.
<p>
 <b>    <i>Does audience reaction make any difference to the level or quality
of your performance?</i></b>
<p>
     It makes a lot of difference, because it's not like the medium of doing a
record, where the initial reward is hearing the product and responding to
that; doing concerts is a very interactive event.  Sometimes you go out there
and they're totally there for you - screaming, yelling - and that makes you
feel good, it makes you feel relaxed and know that you're accepted.
<p>
     What we do is very, very hard and usually the only reward - the main
reward - is playing a good show, performing what we do.  For that hour-and-
a-half each day, hopefully it will justify the twenty-two-and-a-half hours
of logistics and boredom and tedium and travelling, and everything else
that goes into making it work.  This music demands a lot of concentration
because it's delicate, it has a lot of dynamic range to it, it demands a lot
musically, and it takes a lot of attention and concentration.  So if the show
isn't rewarding then, oh boy, the day is kind of shot, you know.
<p>
     The shows where you really feel the music, get lost in it, those are the
best; that's what you strive for in any artistic endeavour - to really commune
with the Muses, and to feel that you are actually a part of the music.  Those
are the peaks of the art, and it does happen; I've felt that, and it's a
great feeling.
<p>
  <b>   <i>How is your enjoyment of the music affected by the fact that this is
your job, and you have to play the same songs, again and again?</i></b>
<p>
     One of the reasons for doing this is because I don't feel I have the
constitution for a routine nine-to-five kind of existence; I'm not demeaning
it, I'm just saying that I haven't done that in like fifteen or sixteen
years - it doesn't suit my lifestyle, my style of being.  So I never want
to feel that playing music has any connection with that routine, even though
there are obvious relationships when you're playing the same things night
after night.  Sometimes it's not inspiring and you feel like you don't want
to be here doing this, but you have to, and it becomes the job more than the
art; when it feels like that you have to just push through it.  One good
thing is that there's this little break in the show for us: we go backstage
and kid around, drink some Perrier, and talk about how the first half of the
show went; we can get a little breather, then go back on and have a fresh
attitude.
<p>
 <b>    <i>Is there a conflict between the part of you that loves jazz - and
presumably improvisational work - and this role where you are basically
reproducing the album live?</i></b>
<p>
     Well, no, because my sensibilities run classical too.  I mean, ultimately
I would <i>love</i> to have the improvisational ability of a jazz musician -
that to me is the highest art form; but to reproduce something faithfully, if
not exactly, night after night, and do it in an inspired way, is a good
sensibility.
<p>
 <b>    <i>You are credited with co-writing</i> Language <i>with Suzanne.  How
did that happen?</i></b>
<p>
     Well, she had the basic idea of the song structure.  We all started
bouncing ideas off each other, but it seemed to lack one part - a different
section just to take it away from the basic structure.  So I came up with
this idea for the bridge, which I thought had a nice harmonic change to it,
a nice mood change.  It just moves the song away a little bit, out of the
same chords and the same movement.
<p>
  <b>   <i>Which gives you more pleasure: the situation where the "creative
spark" is at work, or reproducing the music live?</i></b>
<p>
     That's a good question... They both have a high value, and I guess
one is the completion of the other.  It's very rewarding to come up with
the creative ideas that fit into the compositional arrangement, and then the
coming to fruition of that is the performance of it.  I think they both have
their value, and are both different.
<p>
  <b>   <i>Do you think that having a cohesive band unit has produced a better
sound than the session musician approach of the first album?</i></b>
<p>
     Oh yes, I think it's definitely the right thing to do.  It feels much
more complete.  The first album doesn't have the impact of a band; it sounds
like a project.  Personally, it's something that I've always wanted; the
reason I haven't immersed myself in striving to become a studio musician
is because I've always wanted to have a band identity.
<p>
 <b>    <i>Do you see your work with Suzanne as a long-term commitment?</i></b>
<p>
     Well, I hope so.  I really feel that I have a lot to offer, and I hope
that my value has been proven.  I have been with this from the small
beginnings, and I would love to see it come to fruition - I think there's still
a lot of growth potential.
<p>
 <b>    <i>You have now been relieved of your duties as backing vocalist... You
react to that with some pleasure!</i></b>
<p>
     Oh, total pleasure!  That was a giant leap.  My singing ability is not
of the standard for this kind of thing; I never had the right, pure, tone
qualities - I'm much more of a rough singer, and I'm really glad that I don't
have to do it anymore.
<p>
 <b>    <i>Do you have a favourite song in the set which you particularly enjoy
performing?</i></b>
<p>
     It's a toss-up between <i>Small Blue Thing, Ironbound</i> and
<i>Cracking</i>, - I still juggle those three around.  I think that they're
lyrically the nicest tunes, and I like listening to them; I like the way
they're structured, there's a lot of feeling, and I think they showcase
some of the best parts of Suzanne.
<p>
<b> <i>What artists do you particularly like listening to?</i></b>
<p>
     Well I guess my favourite is still Peter Gabriel.  I think he's in line
with what I feel is the best about this business: his songs, performances,
state-of-the-art production.  His whole presentation is totally first-rate,
there's nothing deficient about him at all in my eyes; nobody comes close
to him.
<p>
     As for bass players... Chris Squire, John Entwistle is a great player,
and I think Mark King is a very good player too.  But Anthony Jackson is
astounding, probably <i>the</i> best American bass guitarist.
<p>
 <b>    <i>So, what is your favourite sandwich filling?</i></b>
<p>
     My favourite sandwich filling would be either salmon, or peanut butter
and jelly.  Sometimes a combination of both!
