<b>FOREWORD</b>
<p>
My name is Suzanne Vega and I have helped the work of Amnesty International
since 1988.
<p>
Recently, I began working with the Working Group for Children, the division
of Amnesty International devoted to the rights of children caught in the
political crossfire.  I have done a lot of work for organisations devoted to
children in one way or another, especially since "Luka", my song about child
abuse, became a hit in 1987.
<p>
The Working Group for Children impressed me because of its clear statements
of what children's human rights are.  Childhood is where humanity begins.
Therefore, any discussion of human rights must include the rights of
children: the right from birth to a name, to acquire a nationality and to
know and be cared for by his or her parents; and the right of a child to
play, recreational activities and to participate in cultural and artistic
life.  Being human alone entitles children to protection, but the fact that
they are small and more vulnerable entitles them to special protection, which
Amnesty International outlines for us in the following document.  This
argument may seem obvious.  It is not, as you will find out.
<p>
I am grateful to Amnesty International for outlining these principles for the
world to see, and hopefully to follow.  I urge you to read it.
