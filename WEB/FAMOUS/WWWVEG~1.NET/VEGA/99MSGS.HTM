<p>
Hmm well it seems no one else has roused themselves to defend it but me I
think 99.9F *far* surpasses the status of noble-but-flawed/failed experiment.
I think it is thoroughly wonderful, I listen to it probably more than any of
her other records at this point, and this is coming from a fan who's been
with her since 1985, and who ranks the first album among his all-time
favorites by anyone.
<p>
I guess it's that there are certain artists with whom I am willing to go
wherever they take me. It's not-- quite-- unbridled, uncritical adoration, I
don't think. It's more that I have over the course of ten years felt such
admiration of and attraction to SV's music that I deal w/ her as an artist of
utmost talent, conviction, and inspiration. If 99.9F was what she felt
compelled to put out, I don't listen to it w/ the idea of 'well, gee, I don't
really like industrial-sounding music,' I listen to it as a SV record. If it
doesn't grab me right away (and, actually, it did), I listen to it again, and
again. Sometimes it takes time. 
<p>
Now, this is just my opinion, and everyone is free to feel differently.
Likewise is this my opinion: I do not think it prudent to sit and wait for an
artist either to 'return' to something she's done before, or to completely
abandon something produced w/ genuine inspiration. She may well move on from
the precise sound of 99.9F, but if she does it won't be because she's leaving
it behind as a botched 'experiment.'

<p>
Agreed!  Though I must say 99.9F is my favourite album of ALL time.  I was
an avid Vega fan till 'Days'...  I'm afraid I found that album too wishy
washy - it doesn't really seem to have an edge to it ... ( I realise my
opinion is 99 percent subjective - please forgive me all you 'Days'
supporters!)   Its a 'nice' album; its pleasant sounding too; its something
that you catch yourself humming even if its not your fave album....  But at
the end of the day I find it doesn't really  grab or move me.
<p>
I actually didn't bother to get 99.9 because I was so disappointed with
'Days'.   When I saw Suzanne in concert I soon realised my mistake!  She
was, of course, outstanding.
<p>
Now I know it is suppose to be "industrial folk" but actually I find the
album very moving;  I think it is the intriguing subject matter ("As girls
go"; "Blood makes noise")...  and I love the melancholia of "Song of Sand"
and "Private goes public" (reminiscent of another fave "Wooden Horse")...
and above all (my fave song of all time) "In Liverpool" - the images in
that song haunt me so much!!  Can anyone enlighten me as to the story
behind that one??  I think I read somewhere it was something to with
someone getting over a soured affair - that sort of spoiled it for me cos I
always thought it was about a suicidal street kid!!
<p>
Anyway, hope to hear someones thoughts!!

Maybe you will be surprised but i'm glad to hear that there are defenders for 99.9F.
It would be terrible if we'd all share the same taste of music. But as you were to 
see there are many of us who were not that enthusiastic about this Album.

Then it was a love at second sight? This things happen, i know. The first time i 
was listening to Pink Floyd i thought "uh... Oh... thats awfull!!" but now i
really love them.

If i'm right about Suzanne then she will do as she please.She won't care too much
about what we want her to do. She has always gone her own steps and this is part of what
we all love her for!

I believe that 99.9f is without doubt the best of SV's albums. I always
apreciate people bending and streching preconceived ideas of what each
individual genre of music should sound like. It is always refreshing to see
someone like SV, associated with a particular genre, experimenting while
still keeping her roots. Tracks such as Private goes public and song of
sand harking back to the days of her debut album, haunting vocals
acompanied by the acoustic guitar we have come to know and love. While
Tracks such as 99.9f and Blood makes noise her music, and many others
besides, into a new era.
<p>
99.9 has everything. You get to hear SV as we have in the past while seeing
her music progress into something new. Many artists get bogged down into
reproducing the same tracks over and over, while others progress to far and
leave their fan base wishing for the old style. 99.9 has got it right.

I'm noticing a nice 'international' flavor to this discussion - i.e. comments
coming in from several countries - this is what we need!

Agreed.  It's encouraging to hear new styles, new ways of presenting the
songs.  However, it's *dis*couraging to hear reviewers try to slap labels 
on 99.9F (and Suzanne also) - i.e. the 'industrial folk' thing - as they did 
10 yrs ago with the 'waifish' image.  They feel the need to categorize, I
suppose - something to give clueless people a convenient phrase to use!  :-)

Yes, that's what I was thinking when I first heard 'In Liverpool' - a return
to her previous styles.  Then, of course, when I heard the entire album I
was (pleasantly) surprised.  I agree that 99.9F has it right, and I'm sure
I'll be pleasantly surprised again when the new album comes out.

<p>
     Blurp everyone !
     <p>
     Just a very short contribution to the 99.9 F debate...
     I've got the feeling that many people on this list focus almost 
     exclusively on the two 'extremes' of this album, that is : the 
     'industrial' side, with Blood makes noise etc..., and the 'folk' aspect 
     (blood sings, Private goes public, etc...); so of course the resulting 
     designation for the whole album is 'naturally' : 'Industrial Folk', 
     although many are very happy to notice some traces of 'Classic Suzanne 
     Vega Style'...<p>
     I think all this has the effect to limits the album (in the opinions 
     of the listeners) to a few particular styles, much more than the songs 
     themselves do it.<p>
     And what about songs like 'As Girls Go' ? Is it industrial, folk, 
     grunge, 'New Orleans'...?! (My intention is not to debate on this 
     particular song; it is just an example)<p>
     My feeling is that even when, on this album, SV is said to do some folk 
     (blood Sings), it sounds hardly folk to me; and when she is supposed to 
     sound industrial (Blood Makes Noise), I can notice very few (!) traces 
     of it (for example, if someone on this list, pleased by the BMN sound, 
     goes to a record shop and buys a whole collection of Einstuerzende 
     Neubauen, he/she is very likely to be deceived...).<p>
     I think that what Suzanne has done with this album (like with the 
     previous ones), is to take only the best of different musics she has 
     been playing or listening to for years, and to give them her own 
     interpretation, in order to create simply Suzanne Vega songs.
     So to conclude, I think that this album is a genuine Suzanne Vega 
     album (and not simply an experiment that she should either forget or 
     take further), because in every single song (no matter how it 
     sounds) I can find the sensibility and the feelings which are in 
     every release since the first album, and which are the reasons why I 
     love her music.

<p>
Adding to the international flavor...
<p>
imho 99.9F is THE best SV album.
<p>
I love the industrial folk sound -or whaterver it is you call it out 
there.
<p>
I am 23 years old now, when I started out as a SV fan (at the time of 
the first album) I was just a small scared schoolboy in the middle of
 the big wide world knowing nothing obout anything.
 <p>
My english was very bad then I didn't understand much of the lyrics 
and the little a could understand was probably wrong. I had no idea
what Luka was about. 
<p>
I just heard her lovely voice singing songs I thought were nice, 
somehow soothing. 
<p>
Since then a lot of water has run under the bridge, I have had my 
english lessons and the world don't seem such a big place anymore.
<p>
And my taste regarding music grew out of just wanting to hear nice 
songs. I began wanting "some balls" to the music I listened, something
 Suzanne just didn't seem to offer.
<p>
Days of open hand was a disapointment (sorry!!). On 'room of the 
street', listen to the hand claps. They are credited to SV. Every time I 
listen to the song my attention is captured by them hand claps. I see
in my minds' eye a vision of Suzanne sitting in an otherwise empty
 studio recording to the 'hand clap track'. The (in my opinion) stupid
 'hand clap track' and the thing that it actually is credited to someone
are good examples of what as a whole is wrong with the record. It is
over produced.
  <p>
I still got some kicks of Suzannes music as I eventually began little 
by little understanding the lyrics, "hey these are great!" 
<p>
Lyrics were the thing that kept me hanging on. I didn't/don't listen 
to other folk singer/songwriters, neither their music nor their lyrics say 
nothing to me. Suzanne is an exeption. Her lyrics just hit the sweet 
spot in me... well I know I don't have to explane, you know what I mean...
<p>
And then came 99.9F.
<p>
BOOOM. 
<p>
The minute I got the CD in my hands saw the cover and opened the 
booklet I knew that this is it. It was as if she had read my mind.
Just what I had wanted/needed. It seemed allmost unnatural,  how 
could she?
<p>
And now,I just can't wait to hear "Woman On The Tier" and "slices 
of life". "Sexy sound" sounds very good to me, could it be it has got
something to do with the groove/jazz thing that seems to be buzzing 
in the air at least here in europe... 
<p>
Anyway whatever it is I know I'll love it.
 <p>
 Johan.
