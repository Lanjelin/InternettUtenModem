<p>
Don't call her "pale and interesting"...
<P>
... Or frail. Or wan. Or shy and retiring. There had to be a harder,
brasher, more ambitious side to the Suzanne Vega who exchanged the cosy
security of the Greenwich Village folk clubs for the rigours of the arena
circuit. "Who wants to see some shrinking violet?" She asks Adrian Deevoy.
<P>
The first time Suzanne Vega says "oral sex" it is most physically
disturbing. But you get used to it after a while. Look, she's saying it
again...
<P>
"My sister had Undertow playing at her wedding reception," She says, "and
my brother came over to me and said, I can't believe you'd let them play a
song about oral sex! He actually said oral sex and another word like that.
No, not fellatio... it will come to me later. But the line in the song that
got to him was: If I could right now I believe I would swallow you whole."
<P>
Later that evening on stage in Rotterdam before singing the opening lines
of Undertow, a track off her first album, she says, "I was saying in a
conversation I had earlier that someone had said this song was about oral
sex and I couldn't remember the other word. It's "cannibalism". Oral sex
and cannibalism."
<P>
Way past bed time at the Rotterdam Hilton, in the middle of a conversation
with a group of record executives, she suddenly turns to me with her round,
almost innocent eyes and mouths the word again. "Cannibalism". It's enough
to make a grown man cough.
<P>
In the flesh, Suzanne Vega is unexpectedly strong, straight backed and
confident. She is not - as we have come to expect - crouched, knees against
mouth, in the corner of a derelict tenement or gazing reflectively from the
nearest available rain-spattered window. It is also worth noting that she
is neither grainy nor black and white. The horsehair cassocks of yore have
been replaced by a rather dapper navy suit and her hair which is cut
boyishly short, occasionally disappears beneath a smart black pill-box hat.
<P>
She thinks clearly and speaks articulately, punctuating her conversation
with a breathy, high-pitched giggle which descends to a fully blown Sid
James dirty chuckle particularly when discussing libidinous pursuits of the
upside-down variety.
<P>
Could this be the same Suzanne Vega who introduced the expression "frail,
wan, waif-like poetess of enormous sensitivity" to the masses? Were these
unholy oaths falling from the same mouth that sang intimate laments about
being "a small blue thing/ Like a marble or an eye..."? Had we arrived by
mistake at a Lenny Bruce convention? Indeed not. For this was the self-same
songstress of deathly pallor and painfully introspective disposition. The
folk singer turned stadium capacity star who had recorded two massive
selling albums (Suzanne Vega, her debut has sold a million copies, Solitude
Standing two and a half million worldwide) and found a uniquely diverse
following. Under the same roof at her concerts are quiet, studious types
who've memorised the lyrics and gung-ho air-punchers, both feet on the
armrests three songs into the set.
<P>
In much the same way, the Suzanne Vega story itself comprises two distinct
and contrasting halves.
<P>
There is the mythical version in which a stray waif wanders into a New York
folk club clutching her acoustic guitar, wins over the unimpressible
audience and becomes everyone's favourite manic depressive and, apparently
by accident, a major international recording artist.
<P>
Then there is the real story in which a determined half Puerto Rican girl
grows up in the Hispanic neighbourhood on the Upper West side near Harlem,
hell-bent on success. Her performance-orientated family, driven by their
novelist father's artistic enthusiasm, encourage her to attend the New York
High School Of Performing Arts (of Fame fame) where she studies dance but
discovers a taste for the more immediate medium of music. After listening,
all be it unfashionably in 1977, to early Dylan and reading Sylvia Plath
she sings self-written folk songs in Folk City, The Speakeasy and The
Bottom Line whilst working by day as a receptionist. She is adopted by two
managers - a lawyer and a recording engineer - and after three years of
gigging and getting turned down by record companies gets signed, records
her first self-titled LP and goes touring like a woman possessed to
encourage its sales, stopping only to write and record a second album,
Solitude Standing, before launching into a massive 11 month world tour to
promote it. Far from drifting ethereally into our lives, Suzanne Vega has
determinedly kicked her way into our collective consciousness. In marketing
terms, she's about as frail and sensitive as Jon Bon Jovi.
<P>
So, as she prepares to bring her world tour to a climax at Wembley this
month the question on a million lips is: Suzanne Vega - Small Blue Thing or
Ass-Kicking Mother-Bitch?
<P>
"It's true that I'm not what people think I am," she says backstage at the
2,600 seater Munster Congresshalle in Rotterdam. "I am a little shy but I
don't like the implication that I'm timid because if I read in the press
that someone was timid I wouldn't want to go and see their show. Who wants
to see some shrinking violet? I get irritated with all this, she's so pale
and shy and quiet, because I'm not actually that quiet."
<P>
"But I would describe myself as a brave person. I think I have done very
difficuly things in my life. For a supposedly shy and timid person I went
down to the Village every night and sang and had people stare at me and I
did well at it and succeeded at it and did it on my own terms. I think
that's accomplishing a lot. I didn't listen to any rock'n'roll until I was
20. That was only eight years ago and suddenly I'm well respected in a
field that I had no intention of becoming involved with."
<P>
"When I was growing up I had to be brave or else I'd get hit on all the
time. Fighting doesn't come easily to me but I decided that I wasn't gonna
let it happen to me. Fortunately these days I find that I don't have to
physically defend myself. Most of the men I'm involved with don't hit women
and don't want to hit me. People used to always tell me, if you ever get
into a fight pick up the nearest bottle and smash it. Whether I could do it
or not is an interesting question. I haven't been pushed to that degree.
I'm not aggressive but I'm extremely resistant."
<P>
But despite being able to handle herself and fluently talk dirty, it's
still inordinately difficult to imagine Suzanne Vega getting blind drunk,
trashing televisions, sexually harrassing bellhops and generally being -
dare one say it - a 24-hour rock'n'roll chick?
<P>
"Well I don't know about trashing televisions or even the sexual
harrassment," she chuckles, "but I drink quite a bit. I don't now drink
half as much as I used to. There was a time when I was hanging out and
drinking a lot. I drink red wine, I like that, gin, brandy and horrible
sweet drinks like Brandy Alexander. I went through a phase of drinking
White Russians but I found that after four or five of those you'd find
yourself waking up in strange and unknown places. So I kinda stopped
drinking them in my early twenties. I'd stay up all night at folk clubs
like the Kettle Of Fish on MacDougal Street in New York and I'd run into
people from Ireland and stay talking to them until dawn. What kind of drunk
am I? Well, I'm either extremely flirtatious and I giggle and laugh a lot
and sit on people's laps and hold their hands. Or other times I get really
sad and weepy. The bad thing is it got to the point where I couldn't
remember why I was sad. I'd wake up the next morning and go. What the hell
happened? What was I carrying on about? The last time that happened
seriously I was very upset and I was telling whoever I was with at the time
that they should tell me the truth. Of course he had no idea at all what I
was talking about. I don't think I did either! But that's what I'm like
when I'm drunk. Either I'm really happy and dancing in the lobby or
miserable and a pain in the ass."
<P>
"I got really drunk when we were in Australia recently. But wild drunk as
opposed to quiet and sad drunk. It was very badly timed because I had to
sing the next day on live television at midday. But they told me that I was
dancing in the lobby of the hotel the night before and suddenly I woke up
with this amazing hangover and found myself coming to on midday live TV in
front of two million people. But my hangover put me out of commission for
quite a while - they've got worse as I've gotten older. I got sick
afterwards."
<P>
Would the author of such tenderly written songs as Luka, Tom's Diner and
Small Blue Thing describe herself as a bit of a party girl, then? "I used
to hate them," she says, "but I really got into parties when I was 19 or
20. But at that time I didn't realise that the best way to talk to someone
was to get them to talk about themselves. I hadn't really learnt the basic
rules of human company. So I would always talk about myself. I'd just
corner someone at a party and tell them every single thing I'd ever thought
in my life and they'd generally run away. I remember cornering one poor guy
and talking to him until six in the morning. I was still going and he said,
I think maybe you should have something to eat."
<P>
"I'm different at parties now. I get dressed up and put on my make-up and
if I have a couple of drinks I'll dance and have a good time."
<P>
The sexual content of your songs is often overlooked. The aforementioned
"swallowing you whole" in Undertow; the rising and falling men in your
bedroom in Marlene On The Wall; the breasts and thighs in Ironbound/Fancy
Poultry. Has sex always been a motivation?
<P>
"I went through a fairly promiscuous period," she says staring hard,
brazening out the personal question. How many people did you sleep with 10?
50? 100?
<P>
"I'm not gonna sit here and count people!" she laughs. "Although after
saying that, I did go through a period when I was actually comparing with
my friends how many. That was in my early twenties. I'd just moved out of
my parent's apartment; I was drinking a lo, carrying on and hanging out in
the Village and... I was exploring! But now I don't think it was the right
lifestyle for me. I'm certainly not as promiscuous now. It was too...
hectic. You discover that having sex with virtual strangers is very empty
too. For me that's not what having sex is really about. To me it's not just
the physical thing. That's why I disagree when people say that Madonna is
sexy because it's just, Here's my tits. There are so many other things that
make sex good, like friendliness, laughing, talking, intimacy, sharing
memories. All that kinda stuff. I found that with a lot of men I was very
good at talking to them and that surprised some men because they don't
expect you to be able to talk to them like another man might. Talking, for
me, is a big part of sex."
<P>
Have people you regard as heroes ever inspired any of these "untoward
feelings"?
<P>
"I really like Morrissey because he is so deliberately perverse. I'm not as
antagonistic about my shyness but I can see certain parallels. Morrissey
has the shyness market pretty well cornered in that respect, because if you
have any sympathy with shy people at all you're just completely drawn to
him. Then when you go to see him on stage and he just kind of dances
around, taking off his clothes, I just go, WHOOOOA! MORRISSEY! I willingly
give myself up to it. I become very fan-like, overcome with unnatural
desire! If we were put in a room togrther I think that I would... break the
ice!"
<P>
"Lou Reed is fiercely shy. He can be very nasty in order to protect himself
but it's a cover for his shyness. He has a very strange innocence. I saw
him walking around at this award ceremony and he's very intimidating when
you first see him because he has his shades and his leather jacket. You
feel that if you go up to him he might say, Fuck you, get the hell outta my
way. I'd seen him all night and I hadn't said anything but finally he
walked by me and I grabbed him and said, Oh Mr Reed, I really love your
music, or something equally pathetic.  It turned out he knew who I was and
he was so nice. In fact he was so nice that it made me blush. He raised his
glasses and looked straight into my eyes and I could feel myself going
crimson and then he said, I'd like you to meet my wife Sylvia. I was in a
terrible spin by then."
<P>
She has enormous affection for Bob Dylan, citing his immediately pre- and
post-electric periods as the most influential anyone has been on her in
terms of attitude, expression and musicality. She also liked his little
pointy boots.
<P>
"I've just read the Robert Shelton biography which was patchy but it was
good in that it updated me from the Anthony Scaduto one so in that respect
it was informative. But when I see those pictures of him in his oversized
jacket and tight jeans and so skinny in his little pointy boots and all
pale and intense, that's the character  I feel for. If I could have been
anyone that's who I wanted to be. It's not so much sexy as neutral and
fascinating which I guess is sorta sexy in its own way. Very mysterious and
cool."
<P>
Is there a lot of bitterness or jealousy in the New York folk clubs that
you have become successful after ostensibly using those clubs as a launch
pad for your career?
<P>
"I hear a lot of different things," she says cautiously. "The people who
knew me are pleased. Some of the people that I didn't know that well say,
Why her and why not me? and, I hear she's not that friendly anymore. That
she's gotten real cool and aloof. But I guess I can understand that. When
Steve Forbert and The Roches started to make it I was exactly the same. Why
don't they come down for a drink anymore? I suppose I was a little jealous,
and some part of me thought they were turning their back on their folk
roots. I decided then that if ever I became famous I would never say that I
wasn't a folk singer. It seems pretty graceless to me to be on a scene for
five years and then deny that you ever were part of that scene. Obviously,
now I don't play traditional folk music but I still feel very strongly that
I should acknowledge those roots."
<P>
"I vividly remember playing when I had just started at around 17. People
were saying, She has these little songs, isn't she cute? But I didn't see
myself being in any way cute. I used to dress really strangely. Not
deliberately but because I'd put on whatever was next to my bed. So I'd end
up with long white pants and high heeled shoes or this army jacket with a
Vietnamese woman silk-screened on the back and I had long straight hair
parted in the middle and no make-up. I never wore skirts because I didn't
want people looking at my legs while I was singing. I didn't want guys to
make snotty comments about my legs. I used to get them sitting there with
their feet up on the stage and their legs crossed or worse still open
saying, Hey, baby! Don't you ever smile? It can be a little daunting when
you're 16 and you're not even meant to be there in the first place."
<P>
Somewhat astutely for a 17-year-old, Suzanne Vega decided that she didn't
want run-of-the-mill fame. She wanted a less restricting celebrity that
would allow her both artistic and personal freedom.
<P>
"I wanted to be famous like Leonard Cohen was famous," she explains.
"Because to me, at 17, Leonard Cohen was in this terrific position: he
wasn't a pop star so he didn't have to worry about making hits. He was on
the fringes and he got to do whatever he wanted on an album without having
to worry whether or not it went Top 40. He never got mobbed by wild fans
either, it was more like intellectual groupies - people discussed his
records."
<P>
Cynics would say that this was a precocious young girl displaying the
business acumen of a gnarled record company executive: seeing a gap in the
market for a female Leonard Cohen figure and personally attempting to fill
it.
<P>
"I guess that was pretty astute at the age of 17," she laughs. "The thing
was I didn't really like anything that was popular. I didn't like Joni
Mitchell because she was on every billboard and everyone liked her and I
had this great chip on my shoulder because I thought I'd never be popular.
I remember liking Ringo out of The Beatles because I felt he was the most
unpopular one."
<P>
Would it be fair to call you a career woman?
<P>
"I suppose I had an idea and saw it through, which is similar. But I think
of a career woman as the woman who used to work in the office I worked in
who started out as receptionist and ended up as vice president. Instead of
doing that I met Ron (Fierstein) and Steve (Adabbo) in 1983 who became my
managers. I was extremely cynical at first but I agreed to meet up with
them if they paid for lunch. Ron asked me if I was like Joni Mitchell and I
said that I was more like Laurie Anderson and he'd never heard of Laurie
Anderson and I was thinking, Oh great!"
<P>
"Did I trust them? Yeah, I did. But I did get a lawyer to look at the first
contract just in case. You know, you hear stories. Then they told me to
quit my day job and I said, Forget it. I wasn't going to quit a realistic
job and borrow money to live on. But they convinced me. It was never, Yeah,
let's go for it! It was always done with great cynicism on my part."
<P>
And is the type of fame that Suzanne Vega has achieved to her liking?
<P>
"I don't really know if I have become Leonard Cohen famous," she says
thoughtfully. "He still has that sort of exclusivity and enigma surrounding
him. I guess, for me, it changes around the world. I was very nervous this
summer when Luka went to Number 3 in America. I found myself in a position
where Madonna is Number 1 and Los Lobos are Number 2. But in retrospect
there wasn't any need to get nervous. I'm not perceived as mainstream in
America. I'm a "classy iconoclast", as one writer put it."
<P>
"In a way it was a bit of a relief when Solitude Standing went to Number 94
and then fell of the US charts. I thought, OK, that's more like what I'm
used to! I don't have the burden of people saying, Are you going to write
another child abuse song that'll go Top 40? But I'm way more successful
than I ever thought I'd be. I just have to figure out what to do with it
now."
