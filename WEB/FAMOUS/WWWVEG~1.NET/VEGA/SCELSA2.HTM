[continued from part 1]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, it's a real beautiful song.  "World Before Columbus."  It
is one of the new songs on "Nine Objects of Desire," one of those
objects being Ruby, [SV laughs] Suzanne's daughter.  I'm so glad I got
an explanation, too, for "Nine Objects of Desire."  That's nice.
Well, let's-- can we talk about the figure of Death?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yes, please.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> In just a minute.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mind?  I insist.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> We will talk about Death right after we pause for some
commercial messages.  You know, John Hall was here last week with
Jenelle Mosser, and some announcement for some web site came on,
and I didn't even want to touch it.  It was off the air.  He
was just, like, right over there where you are, and he just started
going, "Dot com!  Dot com!  Dot com!  Dot com!  Dot dot dot dot dot
com!  Dot com!"  [SV laughs]  Clearly this is a man experiencing
some sort of information overload, you know, and I didn't even want to
talk to him about it.  It was, you know, have you had, like, a bad
experience on the net, or something?  It was like, "Dot com! Dot com!
Dot com!"  Very strange.  But you're okay with it.  You don't--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, I'm all right with it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, 'cause--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> At this point, it's a nice sort of steady flow.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And if I get backed up, I just sort of do a flash, a flash whatever
they call it, a flash...session.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And that way I can just download everything and read it at my own
leisure, and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Get around to it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I don't know.  I go in and out of being enamored of the whole
technology and what's out there--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And what's on the web--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And being very, what's the word, Luddite-like about it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> [laughs] Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Where it's just like, "Oh, stop, for heaven's sake, just
leave us alone, go away, rarararah."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You know, and I have these very mixed emotions about it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Interesting stuff--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The funny thing, you know, it's probably because it's new, that
it's such a novelty.  I mean, I will respond to an email, whereas if
someone got...if someone called me up and left a message on my answering
machine, it's less likely that I would call them back and leave a
message on their answering machine.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I'd be just likely to say, "It's a wrong number," and not even
think about it.  Or, "I don't want to deal with this."  But for
some reason, having it written down in such an easy format that you
can just pop "Reply" and then I just would answer--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> For some reason that makes a difference.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And are you more apt to answer email than what they now call
"snail mail", than the handwritten letter?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Typed letter?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, because I find that it's easier.  You don't have to address
it, you don't have to stamp it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right, right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> You don't have to do all of that stuff.  You can just, it's just
kind of done for you.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Much more--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> You can do it in 30 seconds, and it's done.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Sure, sure.  Much more convenient.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Don't have to go to the Post Office.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Having said that, you know, I don't [laughs] as a rule lately...
usually what I try and do is post it in a place where the most people
can read it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> 'Cause I don't really always have the time to answer every single
one.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> All right, now one of the objects of desire of the nine is the
figure of Death--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Listed on the first page of the booklet that accompanies the
CD.  So how is the figure of Death an object of desire?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, actually that's a little bit misleading, 'cause if you
think of the song "Thin Man," for example--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That's what I have cued up.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's...actually I'm the object of desire in "Thin Man." [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ahh, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He's desiring me, and I'm resisting him, saying, "Sorry, pal."
[laughs]  "Not ready."  So...but every so often you can feel the
presence somewhere, you know, and that's something I feel in
my life, as occasionally I'll feel the presence of death, so what I do
is I'll...I made a man out of this feeling, you know, made him
into a figure that I can negotiate with and sort of talk to, in a sense.
And that's my way of dealing with that particular subject.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So he's--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He's trying to be...he's seducing me--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He's trying to seduce me into giving in, and my role is to
say, "No, no," even though what he promises is seductive, which
is sort of this endless peace and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ahh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> This sort of tranquility.  That's what the song is about, is how
the possible...how tempting it could be, but then on the other
hand, you know, you have to resist it til the very end.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Have you had near brushes with death?  I mean, or is it
just a more ambiguous kind of...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It's a bit more ambiguous than that.  I mean, it's just...
it's probably more the way I grew up, really.  I mean, my father
was someone who had had brushes with death, and so he was aware of
the fact that everyone was going to die at some point, and so he
would take time out to remind of this from time to time.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh, really?  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yes. [laughs]  You know, just by-- it was his way of making sure
that we didn't take life for granted.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So there have been different times where I've felt it.  I felt it
when I....I mean, this is really personal, but when I was giving
birth to Ruby, there was a moment where things sort of started to
go wrong.  And I could feel the presence of it, and I...and, you know,
there was a point where her heart rate dropped down to 40 beats
per minute.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And so there was this struggle, and that was happening.  And other
times, too, when I met my biological father for the first time,
which was about ten years ago.  I took a plane to L.A. to meet him
by myself and had this recurring thought that the plane would
crash before I could get there, and there was just this feeling.  It's
a feeling I have often, of time about to run out, and so therefore
that I feel like...I always feel a sense of urgency, that there's
something that I have to get done, I have to get it done before
I go--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.  Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And so it's just kind of a...thing.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Now..the figure of the thin man, then.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Why did you portray him that way?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Why is he thin? [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  You know, for instance--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> This is...when I was in Germany, I was doing an interview and this
German guy was going, "Well, why is he thin?  You know, why is he
not normal size or even fat?"  [Vin laughs]  And I said, "Well,
because he's skeletal"--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> "And, you know, he's like a skeleton.  That's the way I thought of
him."  So then he said, "Oh, so--"  I said, "And also it's 'cause he's
not interested in eating, I mean he's a man-- Death is not someone
who's gonna sit down and have a hearty meal, you know?"
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right, right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> If-- When I think of Death, I think of someone who's skeletal, who
has, you know, is wearing sort of an old suit that was once
really fine.  This is the way I see him in my mind's eye, and,
you know, you don't-- I don't imagine Death, because you don't imagine
him  sitting down to eat.  You know, he's busy.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He's busy doing all...he's busy going on his rounds, you
know.  He's not the kind who's kind who's gonna sit down and
enjoy himself.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> There's a famous novel that was made into a movie and then
a series of movies, called "The Thin Man."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  I'm familiar with them, but I'm not...I didn't actually...
I don't think...I think I've seen one or two of them.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> William Powell, Myrna Loy.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Were the couple.  Now...and everybody thinks that--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> A sort of comedy, right?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, well, it was like a...they were comic detectives, they were
husband and wife--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Nick and Nora Charles, right?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Wonderful repartee between them.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> They were real partners, and they drank a lot.  I mean,
they would definitely be politically incorrect now [SV laughs]
because of the fact that they abused martinis incredibly.  [SV
laughs]  And the original novel was perhaps a bit darker than the
eventual film series.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> What I'm getting around to is that on some of the tracks,
some of the arrangements on this new album have a kind of
a film noir--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Sort of quality to them.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And while "The Thin Man," those movies were not film noir
movies, they were black and white, you know--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right, right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And it was a...that...you're shaking your head when I
say "film noir," so I'm not off base again.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> There's something...I'm on to something.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, I love film noir.  It's one of my favorite kinds of
movies.  I mean, that and the New Wave from the 60s, the
French films--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The French films from the 60s, those are my favorite kinds
of movies.  And lately I've gotten into MGM musicals from the 50s.
[laughs]  The Technicolor things...but film noir is something I
really, really like.  Although it's not something that Mitchell
and I discussed consciously--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> But we have watched a lot of those films, and...probably what
you're responding to is the muted trumpet, the horn section there,
and...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> To me, that arrangement reminded me of something else I
couldn't put my finger on what it was.  I couldn't figure out whether
it was a theme song from the sixties or something like that,
but it was kind of a...it reminded me of something and it really
made me laugh, and I couldn't tell whether it was really sort of a...
like a diseased way [laughs]--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Of treating the song, or whether it was really witty and funny.
In the end, I think we did a good job, but if-- there was a moment
there where I was howling with laughter, but I wasn't sure if it
was really gonna go over well.  So I'm glad it did.
<p>
["Thin Man"]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Now, I was going to say, but I didn't, 'cause I got sidetracked,
that the Thin Man in the movie series was not William Powell.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It wasn't Nick Charles.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The original Thin Man was actually the original victim in the
very first "Thin Man," in the Dashiell Hammett novel.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> But then, for some reason--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Which I have, but I haven't read yet.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It's good.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It's good, the original novel.  But for some reason, everybody
sort of began to assume that--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He was--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Nick was the Thin Man--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And the series became "The Return of the Thin Man," and "Son of
the Thin Man," and all of that.  [SV laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> But none of that has anything to do with your song--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Not really, no.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Called "Thin Man."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-mm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Which is again, another neat arrangement.  I like the horns.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You know?  And it's real trumpets in there.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.  Now, as long as we're talking about films and books--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> There is a song that shares a title and presumably a character
with a very famous novel--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That became sort of a controversial film.  "Lolita"--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Is what I'm talking about.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Tell about this song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, there's not really much to say.  I think it's probably one of
the most straightforward songs on the whole album, really.  It's
like, taking the character of Lolita, which is a certain...it's
certainly a common enough character that you see in America today.
You see those girls, those kinds of girls, every place.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The young, sexy, teenage objects of desire.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The young, sexy teenage girls.  Yeah.  The girls that use sex to
get attention, and to have, you know...to make their way in the world.
So in a sense it's just a word of warning to those girls, and in a sense
it was a...it's like kind of a song to myself when I was that age, and
it's a song to my daughter, who's only two--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> But in ten years will be twelve, and also it's in a way a song to
my mother, in a sense, 'cause I was born when she was 18.  She was
a very sexy young girl, and in a sense, she, I think, kind of taught
me not to use sex.  You know, she always wanted me to be...not to be
ashamed of being brainy, of being smart, and to treat myself with
respect and...so that's basically the message of this song--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> If you want to call it that.  It's not really literal.  Again,
it's not literally based on a character in the novel, but the kinds
of girls that are...that you know and see every day.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.  Well, the name has become--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Synonamous, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Sort of a, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> With the character.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It's, like, become a generic name now.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  It's amazing to me that he wrote such an American...that
whole book to me is so American.  It's like a...and that he was
Russian, and he was writing in a second language, and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The character of Lolita is just so familiar to me.  You just see
her every place, and you...when you say "Lolita," you know exactly--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Exactly.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> What you're talking about.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Sure.  I have a cool segue.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Okay.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> From "Lolita."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay?  So...and I hope-- I know you've been doing some radio over
the last week or so--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> As you've also been doing some in-store things--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> In a number of different cities.  So I'm hoping that I'm the
first to do this segue.  I hope nobody has jumped the gun and done
this already.  But listen, you'll see what I'm talking about.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> This is from Suzanne Vega's new album, the album called "Nine Objects
of Desire," here on Sunday night, on WNEW.
<p>
["Lolita"]
<p>
[Santana's "Oye Come Va" begins, and continues in the background
while they speak]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> See, actually it's a tough choice [SV laughs] between "Oye Como Va"
and "Spill the Wine."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> They would both work, wouldn't they?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, they would.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> All right.  Well, I opted for Santana's version [SV laughs] of
"Oye Como Va."  I thought you guys were actually sampling it, that
one note, you know?  [SV laughs]
<p>
["Oye Como Va" continues]
<p>
[After about 30 seconds, Vin mixes "Lolita" in with it, then goes back
and forth between the two]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I think we better stop now.  [SV laughs]  I just think--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Having a really good time here.  [Vin laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, it's sort of like, you know, it's like painting or
something.  ["Oye Como Va" continues in the background;
Vin laughs]  That's funny.  Now I've lost track of where yours
is.  I think you're over here.  [part of "Lolita"]  There you
are.  That, that, that, that note, that's the Santana note.
[both songs continue in the background]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's the other stuff...  ["Oye Como Va" continues, then
more "Lolita"]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> See, if I really wanted to get demented about it, I would
kind of slow the speeds down to get the rhythms exact, you know, and
actually do a whole--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Segue.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It's not so absurd, though.  I mean, that's what happened to
"Tom's Diner," right?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, no, it's true.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Those guys in England.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, they didn't even slow it down, I guess they just cut it.
They cut it up, that's what they did.  They cut up "Tom's Diner."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> They turned it into like, a hip-hop thing or something, yeah?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  Yeah, I asked them actually what gave them that idea,
and they said that it was completely obvious, and that if they
hadn't done it, somebody else would have done it.  [Vin laughs]
They said the rhythm was already there.  I said okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Which one of the many versions of it-- it's the first one.
Ahh...with DNA, right?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's the one that became a big hit, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah...why is it called "Rusted Pipe"?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> [laughs]  Well, that's because they did a bonus track, which
was a remix of a song I had called "Rusted Pipe."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh that was, that's your song, "Rusted Pipe."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So that's not--  Yeah, that's my song, "Rusted Pipe."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I want..track 7.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Track 7 is...I don't remember.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It says, "Tom's Diner"...no, no, that's not it, it's not DNA.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> It's probably the second one.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Doesn't it say, "Tom's Diner featuring DNA"?  "DNA featuring
Suzanne Vega"?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It just says "Suzanne Vega" on it.  Let's see.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That might be the one from the album.  You might not want that one.
[a cappella "Tom's Diner" begins]  That's the one from the album.
[laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That's the original one.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's the one from "Solitude Standing."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> All right...umm...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I wish I could help you out.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh, here it's the last track!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The last track.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Featuring DNA.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.  This is what we're talking about, for people who have
forgotten this.  ["Tom's Diner," DNA version begins]  It's such a cool
sound.  [SV laughs]  Were you pleased with this when you first heard
it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I was.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I thought it was very funny.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay if I play it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And I won't mix any Santana or War, [SV laughs] or anything else.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
["Tom's Diner," DNA version]
<p>
["Caramel"]
<p>
["Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)" by Astrud Gilberto]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, that sound is certainly present on "Caramel," on that new
song of yours, which actually was released prior to the release of
the album, because there was a soundtrack album to the film "The Truth
About Cats and Dogs."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And that was-- was that actually featured?  I didn't see the movie.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, it was.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Was it actually in the movie?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, it was featured in one scene where there's a...I think it's
Uma Thurman, and the male lead is a fashion photographer, and so..
[laughs] Uma Thurman come to the guy's house to tell him that he's in
love with the wrong person.  It's kind of like a female Cyrano de
Bergerac--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right, right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Sort of thing, so Uma's the front.  So Uma gets to the house,
and this guy decides to feed her some cake that's been left over
from a fashion shoot, and normally she doesn't eat much of anything
at all, you get that impression from the movie, and he spends the
whole scene just feeding her cake, and this song is playing in the
background.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And "Caramel"'s playing--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And-- yeah, and she's falling in love with him, but doesn't want to
acknowledge it--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right, so.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And he's, like, feeding her, shoveling cake into her mouth, and
they have all these close-ups of Uma's face, and...cake and stuff.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Did you write this song specifically for the movie?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I didn't, actually.  I wrote it because I just...wrote it, and I
wrote it for this album--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> For my own album, and then when they sent me the film, I realized that
that was a scene that that song would work really well in.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm.  And the comparison to Astrud Gilberto is an apt one?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I would listen to her music all the time--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> When I was a child.    My parents listened to bossa nova constantly.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Stan Getz, and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I was just crazy about her voice.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Right.  Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I mean, that was the way you were supposed to sing.  [Both laugh]
I just loved it, 'cause it was clear and pure, and there was no vibrato--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And to me that was just the best way.  I mean, I felt like if I were
ever gonna sing anything, that's the way I would do it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Interesting.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That that was an early influence for you.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, definitely.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Hmm.  Suzanne Vega is my guest tonight, here on WNEW.  We have to
pause for some commercial words.  And Vin Scelsa's Sunday night.  Here's
an exclusive sneak preview of an upcoming series of events at the Bottom
Line.  It's a series of evenings -- Suzanne Vega, you may be interested
in this -- evenings with Jane Siberry.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Are you a Jane Siberry fan?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I've listened to her albums on occasion.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Sometimes...I got into one of her albums.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.  She's doing a thing this fall at the Bottom Line, entitled
"Three Showrooms in the House of Siberry."  Now these performances are
being recorded for possible future release on her own label.  She's
got a new label now, of her own, called Sheba Records.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay, so October 23rd and 24th, the shows are called "Music for
Films and Forests."  "Music for Films and Forests."  The November
20th and 21st shows are entitled "Music for Saying What You Thought
of Too Late."  And the December 17th and 18th shows are called "Music
for the Christmas Season," 'cause it's the 17th and 18th of December.
Alan Pepper of the Bottom Line says, "Collect the whole set."  Tickets
are on sale now for all of the above shows.  Jane Siberry's "Three
Showrooms in the House of Siberry" in October, November and December
at the Bottom Line, 15 West 4th Street, in the heart of the Village.
"Tom's Diner," which we heard in...at the beginning of that set, the
DNA version--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The sort of hip-hop version, was the first song that you ever
performed on one of my radio shows.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Really.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Back in, I guess it was 1986.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It was one of those big acoustic Easter gatherings of lots of
musicians.  It was on K-Rock.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> We prerecorded it in the studios...Christine Lavin was there,
Shawn Colvin--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh yeah, I remember that, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Tom Paxton, it was a whole bunch of people.  And that night
you sang two songs.  You did "Tom's Diner."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> A cappella.  And you did a song that was being featured in a
movie, another movie song, that was in "Pretty in Pink."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I did?  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  The title of the song--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> How could I have done that acoustically?  Normally it's hard for
me to do that one acoustically.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, you did that song.  What was the name of the song though?
I can't-- "Left of Center."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> "Left of Center."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You did that song that night.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  You don't remember.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I don't remember doing that one just 'cause usually I had...since
I didn't write it myself on the guitar I needed Steve Addabbo to play
the guitar for me--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I don't-- I'm pretty sure you--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So... [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I'm pretty sure you did it at-- maybe--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, maybe he was with me, maybe he did it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Maybe, yeah.  Okay.  But that was the first time we ever did
radio together.  I'm having fun tonight.  I'm enjoying this; are you?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's-- yeah.  Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You okay?  All right.  We're not keeping you up or anything, or
keeping you out all night?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, no, no.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Because I know, you know, being a mom and stuff now, you know,
the bedtime may have changed, depending upon when--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Oh, it has changed.  Well, now it's midnight instead of four
o'clock.  [Both laugh]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> All right.  We're sort of observing the release of this new
Suzanne Vega album, the first one in a couple of years, since
99.9 Fahrenheit degrees.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Degrees Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit degrees?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I think it's Fahrehnheit degrees.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Fahrenheit degrees.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  And poetic license.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You're getting out, and you're starting to perform a bit, doing
some in-store things--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Which has become something that a lot of musicians and writers
are doing these days.  Is this something that's exciting for you?
Is it challenging for you?  Having been off the road for a couple
of years now, are you intimidated by it at all?  Are you hot to get
back to it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, no, I really like it.  Yeah, I like-- I especially, I like
doing in-stores, because then you really get to see people up close,
and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Over the summer I did a couple of festivals, and I found that
a little bit daunting, 'cause I was playing in front of ten thousand
people at Newport, and I really couldn't tell how it was going, or how
the new songs were going over, or if they were gonna like "Blood Makes
Noise" at Newport Folk Festival--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> You know, that sort of thing, and I found that a bit scary, but I
find these in-stores to be really interesting, 'cause then people get
to ask me questions, or talk to me about this and that, and I get to
see what they're thinking about.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.  Were you playing solo--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, solo.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> At the festivals?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  No, no, at the festivals I was playing with Mitchell on keyboards
and Mike Visceglia on bass.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I'll play another track from the album, and then maybe will you
sing something else for us?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, sure.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Maybe like an older song or something?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> That's be cool.  Tell about this song, "Honeymoon Suite."  [SV
laughs]  This is kind of a funny, interesting song about a couple
who are obviously on their honeymoon in France--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> In Paris, in Paris, yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> In Paris, and the husband has a strange dream.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And he dreams that there's all kinds of people in the room.
I'm telling about it.  [SV laughs]  I asked you to tell about it,
and I'm telling about it!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Ahhh...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You tell about it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, it actually is based on a true incident.  Actually I married
my husband last year in April, and we went to Paris for our honeymoon,
and we had had this deal that since he was having sort of a string of
nightmares every night, I had sort of jokingly said that I would
stand at the gateway of his mind and make sure that he wasn't disturbed
again.  And so we went to sleep, and he woke up the next morning, and
he gives me this look.  [laughs]  And I said, "What's the matter?" and
he said, "Where were you?"  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Really.  [Both laugh]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And I said, "What are you talking about?  I was right here."  And he
said, "Oh, you wouldn't believe this dream I had.  It was unbelievable."
So that's how it began.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, see that, [SV laughs] that was-- it was a nice sentiment on
your part, you know, I'll stand at the gateway of your mind--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I know.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And protect you, but--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I wonder if I would have had that...  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And then I said, "Well, listen, you know, they could have come
round the other side of the bed to see me, you know.  I was here.
It's just that they--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Obviously weren't interested in coming over to this side.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> They decided to visit him instead.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> They visited him instead.  But the whole idea of it was that
there was someone...that he thought that they had come to the wrong
man, basically.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Right.  So the song is called "Honeymoon Suite."  It starts
off rather atmospherically.
<p>
["Honeymoon Suite"]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So when I first heard that song, it put me in mind of another
relatively new song by Marshall Crenshaw that I thought I'd play for
you, 'cause I think it fits, it's appropriate.  It's called "What Do
You Dream Of."
<p>
["What Do You Dream Of" by Marshall Crenshaw]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, we're searching for syncrhonicity, you know, so there's a new
song from Marshall Crenshaw that sort of echoes in a certain way that
new song from Suzanne Vega called "Honeymoon Suite."  Trying to get
inside somebody's mind and into their dreams, [SV laughs] it's not an
easy thing to do.  Although it's a lovely romantic notion [both laugh]
that we can do it.  Suzanne Vega is my guest tonight here on WNEW.
Can we get you to do an old song or two, maybe, for us?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Are there any of your older songs that you just don't like any more?
Or are they basically all sort of still like children of yours, and, like
children, you always like them.  I mean, I know we've talked about "Luka"
from time to time.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And you've said that "Luka" has not become an albatross for you,
that you're--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No.  It still isn't, no.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> There are songs that I don't like any more.  I don't sing them
any more.  In fact, I don't really think about them much any more.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah. 
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Some of the songs on the second album, I'd say.  Like a song
like "Language" I very rarely do, or "In the Eye," or something like
that.  So there's always some songs that really stick with you
for life, and then there's others that fall by the wayside.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm.  And they fall by the wayside just because you're removed
from that place where you were when you wrote them?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, they're just not as interesting to me any more.  Whereas
there's other ones that really stick with me.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Well, we have a couple of requests here in the studio.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Okay.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So which one are you gonna do first?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Uhh...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I said "Marlene," and Carrie said "Gypsy."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I'll do "Marlene."
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.
<p>
["Marlene on the Wall," acoustic version, first verse]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font>  Mmmpf.  Boy, that's never happened before.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> What happened?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> All of a sudden I just hit a snowbank.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> What, did you forget the words?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  I was thinking of the cirumstances that led me to write
this song.  I was also thinking that, when I had first written this
song, this was a song I had always figured that I would never sing
in public.  So I had kind of thrown it in the closet, and, you know,
with a bunch of other things, and then I made it an up-tempo song for
a gig, and I played it for my guitar player at that point, and he said
he really liked it.  And so it's become like a song that I would have...
that I sing all the time, although I...if it was up to me, I would
never have sung it now.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> In the first place.  Really?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> For me it was a song that never quite made the grade.  But let me
try it again.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Wow.  Well, no-- that's interesting.  And the reason why is 'cause
it never made the grade...it just...creatively.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> For me it was a song that I could always see the patch marks in.
It's like, there's some songs that sort of arrive whole, and then there's
other songs that you cut and paste.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And for this one I can always see the cracks where I cut and paste
this line, and had that idea and that thought and kind of stuck them
together, and...to me it was a bit...it was more forced than I like a
song to be.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And for some reason you flashed on all of that just now?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, because we were talking about songs that fell by the
wayside.  So I was singing a song and I was remembering back to
1983--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ohhh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> When I was doing these gigs around the city.  So, sorry.  Sorry
about that.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> But...this is a song that you do continue to sing, though.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I sing it all the time, yeah, all the time.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You probably sang it a day or two ago at one of those in-stores.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I do.  I mean, the embarrassing thing is as I do get older,
I do forget more of the lyrics, becuase there's more lyrics in my brain
these days, and sometimes they just fly out of there.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> One of the greatest compliments that I get from listeners is
that they feel like when I'm with a guest like this, things become
so sort of intimate [SV laughs] that all the guards are let down.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's true.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And that we tend to forget that we're even on the radio, you know--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And that there's lots of people listening and everything.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I think that's what just happened just now, like--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I was just suddenly carried away.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Wow, cool!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> You don't have to-- 
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, but I mean-- 
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> If you don't want to do it--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The thing is, you know, you know, it's okay to do it once, but
it's like, you know, [laughs] if I were to continue forgetting all my
lyrics, it'd lose its charm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> All right, so you have to get back on the horse then.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I gotta get back on the horse, yeah.  Okay, so...take two.
<p>
["Marlene on the Wall," acoustic version]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> I don't think I've ever asked you this, Suzanne Vega.  Was there--
There was an actual picture of Marlene.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, a picture of Marlene Dietrich.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.  A picture, right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> A photograph.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Does it still exist?  Do you still have it?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, somewhere around.  It was a small picture.  And then
after that, people gave me posters of her, so some of those are
framed that I have in my house now.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> The original picture, I think, is somewhere in a corner somewhere.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  Hmm.  So the other request we had was for "Gypsy."  [SV
laughs]  Which as I recall was written either while you were still,
like, a teenager--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, I was still at camp.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And summer camp has something to do with it, right?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Wasn't he...the boy was a counselor?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He was a counselor at the boys' camp up the road, and I was a
folk singing and disco dance counselor at that point.  This was 1978.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Wait a minute, wait, wait.  A folk singing--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yes...
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And disco dance?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Well, you got two for one.  [Vin laughs]  Two for the price of one
at that point.  So I would teach folk singing, you know, for some of
the-- my periods, and then disco dancing for the rest of that.  This
was the era of the Bee Gees.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah, sure.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And so, yeah, this guy was...he was a counselor from Liverpool
who was the arts and crafts counselor at the boys' camp up the road.
And was a Dadaist painter actually.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ouch.  Y'know?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Who had sort of... [laughs] seems like he had shaved his head
and it was still growing back, and he sort of applied to this camp
not knowing what he was really getting into.  He was kind of like a...
a bit of a punk from Liverpool--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> And he just kind of applied as this anarchistic statement, and he
got in, much to his own surprise, so the two of us became really
good friends, and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Where was this camp?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> This was up in upstate New York, near Mount Marcy.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Uh-huh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> In fact I still meet people who tell me, "Oh, my sister was in your
bunk," and--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Ahhh.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> This kind of thing, and...so I worked there for one summer.
And this is the song that came out of it.
<p>
["Gypsy," acoustic version]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Suzanne Vega, that song, the line "Hold me like a baby that
will not fall asleep" has probably taken on a different meaning
for you now [SV laughs] from when you first wrote it as a
teenager.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, same meaning, really  It's just...more experience.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Yeah.  [laughs]
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Than I had before.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> The song called "Gypsy."  Suzanne Vega.  Well, this has been fun.
I've enjoyed this tonight.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, me too.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Thank you.  You've been very generous [SV laughs] with your time--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> I've enjoyed it.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And your conversation, and your music as well. I will send you
on your way into the New York night with another song from the
new album.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Okay.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And with a question also-
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Which is, can we look forward to performances above and beyond
in-stores?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> At some point soon?  Do you have any plans?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.  I'll be coming back on a tour in October.  I'll be at Irving
Plaza.  I don't remember the exact date.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh, okay.  Good.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> With that same configuration of musicians your album got, or--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> No, actually, this is gonna be a different.  We'll have Pete Thomas
on drums, from the Attractions--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> From the Attractions!
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> He's on the album.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> He's on the album.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh, great.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mike Visceglia, my long-standing bass player--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> On bass, Steve Donnelly on guitar, Mitchell Froom on keyboards,
myself on acoustic guitar.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And Ruby off in the wings somewhere?
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> [laughs] Ruby's gonna be in bed.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Oh, okay.  All right.  Good.  So we'll look forward to that sometime
in October.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Okay.  About a block and a half away from here, on 8th Avenue,
just south of 57th Street, up above the stores--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> So, like, on the 3rd floor, I guess.  I drive by every Sunday--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Mm-hmm.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> On my way to work, and I never looked up before to see the big,
huge sign that says, "Headshots."  [SV laughs]  And the twelve
headshots, the twelve--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> That's funny.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Black and white headshots, up there on the 3rd floor.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Wow.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> It's on the west side of 8th Avenue--
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Just south of 57th Street.   They're probably all over New
York, aren't they, and I just never noticed them.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Yeah, well, this particular song, I-- there was a a photographer
who apparently wanted to get work very badly sometime about ten years
ago or something, and he had flyers up all over the Village, and
all over the East Village, and all over Soho, which was where I was--
you know, I still hang out mostly down around there, and so this was,
like, a flyer that was up all over the place.  All it said was-- the
flyer only said, "Headshots," had a picture of a young man, and it
had the numbers, and the man reminded me of someone that I used to
live with.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And so he was following you around everywhere.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> So he was watching me.  [laughs]  He was reminding me of unresolved
things in my life.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Mm-hmm.  Well, I knew as soon as I looked up from my car a
couple of hours ago and see this big, huge sign that said, "Headshots"
that at some point along the way tonight I would have to play this song
[SV laughs] from the new album.  So I will play it as the final
song.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> All right.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> And again, my thanks to you for a nice time on the radio.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="red">Suzanne:</font> Thank you.
<p>
<font size=4 face="arial" color="darkblue">Vin:</font> Suzanne Vega.
