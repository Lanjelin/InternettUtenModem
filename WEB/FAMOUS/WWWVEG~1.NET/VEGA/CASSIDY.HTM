<h3><i>Cassidy</i></h3>

<pre>
I have seen where the wolf has slept
by the silver stream.
I can tell by the mark he left
you were in his dream.
Ah, child of countless trees.
Ah, child of boundless seas.
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you're born to me.
Born to me.  Cassidy.

Lost now in the country miles
with his Cadillac.
I can tell by the way you smile, 
he is rolling back.
Come, wash the night-time clean.
Come, grow the scorched ground green.
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine.
Close the gap of dark years in between
You and me.  Cassidy.

Quick beats in an icy heart.
Catch-colt draws a coffin-cart.
There he goes, here he starts.
I hear her cry.
Flight of the sea-birds,
scattered like lost words,
wheel to the storm and fly.

Faring thee well now, let your life proceed
by its own design.
Nothing to tell, let the words be yours,
I am done with mine.
