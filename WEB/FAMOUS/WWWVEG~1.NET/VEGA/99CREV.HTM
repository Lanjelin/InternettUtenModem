Suzanne Vega, Hammersmith Apollo

<P>
Few musical stereotypes fit as badly as the one long since
assigned to Suzanne Vega. The image of fey, flaxen-haired
folkie was far from apt in the first place but has become
increasingly wide of the mark as, over the course of four
studio albums, the 33-year-old New Yorker has subverted the
expectations inherent to her genre with ever more ambitious
and challenging material.

<P>
Most recently, for example, the album
<I>99.9 Fahrenheit Degrees</I>
placed both industrial noises and dance beats alongside the
expected acoustic folk to throw shadows and light on some of
the most intelligent songwriting accomplished anywhere
within the pop sphere during the past year. And that it has
proved, in America particularly, something of a commercial
disappointment seems only to have strengthened Vega's
resolve to plough an individual furrow.

<P>
Vega's best work demonstrates an astonishing attention to
detail: each word is weighted perfectly within any one line,
each line is balanced to bring rhythm and momentum to the
verse, and each verse advances the imaginatively realized
narrative of the whole lyric. And that she delivers these
widely divergent songs -- ``Small Blue Thing'', ``Rock in
this Pocket'' and ``As Girls Go'' among them -- with a
seemingly artless detachment that belies the intent behind
them only intensifies their impact. But a more economically
yet emotionally effective one is equally rare.

<P>
An eight-year chart career is such that she has now amassed
obvious crowd-pleasers: fans ad-libbed the group DNA+s
backing to her previously
<I>a cappella</I>
``Tom+s Dinner++ in tribute to its surprise re-emergence as
a 1991 dance hit and went into [a] frenzy over two beautifully
delivered favorites, the hit single ``Luka++ and a closing
``The Queen and the Soldier++. Elsewhere Mitchell Froom, who
produced her latest album and who here led a distinguished
four-piece supporting band, ensured that a suitably robust
and adventurous soundtrack accompanied her well-chosen mix
of both old and new material. Despite her steely confidence,
her diffidence in dealing with the clamour for another and
then yet another encore suggests she still does not realise
quite how good she is on present form.

Suzanne Vega, The Academy, New York City, March 11th, 1993
<p>
In pop music a homecoming ought to be a happy affair.  With family and riends predent, there usually exists
an emotional bond between the performer and the audience that makes for wonderful give-and-take.  And that's 
the way it was for Suzanne Vega when she returned home to New York after a seven-week tour in support of her 
latest album <b>99.9f</b>.
<p>
Beaming and a little bit surprised by the applause showered on her when she walked onstage, Vega treated her 
fans to a nearly flawless set of songs about love, life and lost innocence.  Taken together, they went a long 
way toward proving that Vega can give her best musical vignettes new breath and vitality in concert. 
<p>
As expected, the lion's share of the songs Vega performsd were from the critically acclaimed <b>99.9F</b>. 
Backed by her razor-sharp band  (drummer Frank Vilardi, bassist Mike Visceglia, guitarist Mark Schulman and keyboardist
Stephen Gabory), which was more interested in creating clever tonal shadings and rich, percussive filigrees 
than blazing solos.
<p>
Vega sent out striking renditions of new gems such as "Fat Man and Dancing Girl" and "Blood Makes Noise." 
During the latter song, Vega sang some of the lyrics through a small bullhorn, giving them arigid, steely edge.  Yet on 
older songs, especially the classic "Luka," Vega opted for a warmer, more personal delivery, recalling her 
earlier days as an urban folkie.  That Vega was able to move so effortlessly from one mode to the other revealed just
how far she has come as a performer. 
<p>
Of course, no Suzanne Vega concert could have been complete without a performance of "Tom's Diner." Vega 
saved it for the first of her three encores and let her fans help her with the now-famous chorous.  They might 
just as well have been singing, "Welcome home, Suzanne."

Suzanne Vega, The Academy, New York City, March 11th, 1993
<p>
Suzanne Vega gained fame by sketching the view from life's corners.  Her first two albums, which established her
as a literate folk chanteuse in the early 1980's, offered delicate attempts to articulate the awkward and the
painful.  Ms. Vega's voice, prim as a china teacup, made her seem unduly coy at times, and as her career wore 
on, her songs became frustratingly oblique.  But with her new album and a tour that stopped at the academy on Thursday 
night, Ms. Vega demonstrated a willingness to try new musical and thematic encounters.
<p>
Her sound first changed without her permission, when the dance group DNA remade her a cappella song, 
"Tom's Diner," to a loopy pop-industrial beat.  Ms. Vega responded to this challenge with <b>99.9F,"</b> her
latest album (A&M), which interlaces her voice with dance rhythms and synthesizer effects.
<p>
At the Academy, Ms. Vega and her four-piece band performed songs from throughout her
career, but she focused on her developing voice as a rock artist with a folkie past.  Ms. Vega has a talent 
for shifting the dynamics of her singing ever so slightly, increasing the intensity without sounding loud or strained.
<p>
On some of the more rock-oriented numbers, she was overwhelmed by her band's aggressiveness.  But on 
songs dominated by Stephan Gabory's keyboards and a dance groove, she wove her vocals artfully into the mix.  "Blood 
Makes Noise" and "As Girls Go" percolated with energy.  On the new album's title track, Ms. Vega's voice 
became the ghost in the music's machine, diagnosing society's fear of illness with the precision of a thermometer.
<p>
Ms. Vega offered her enthusiastic fans an ample portion of her older material as well, including "Luka," "Marlene 
on the Wall" and a version of "Tom's Diner" in which the audience's raised voices became the backing track.  But 
her show demonstrated how vital experimentation has proved for this once seemingly meek artist

Suzanne Vega.  Homecoming Queen. The Academy, 234 W. 43rd Street., Manhattan; Thursday night <br>
With Kitchens of Distinction <br>
<p>
</b>
"I don't know if I mentioned that I'm from New York City," Suzanne Vega casually announced a short way into
her set at The Academy on Thursday night.  The broad grin on her face and the boisterous audience response
marked it as a deliberately unnecesary comment: This was the return of a hometown heroine.
<p>
Suzanne Vega's relationship to New York is usually discussed in terms of the Greeenwich Village folk scene
that she emerged from in the mid-80's.  But her recent, fourth album, <b>99.9F,</b> with its vaguely industrial 
rhythms, has proven her to be so much more than a folksinger. Hence the standup venture, and the weird sonic 
textures, as with the metallic samples on "Rock In This Pocket."  Occasionally, her group was allowed to rip 
like a real rock band, but more often it provided a subtle accompaniment to Vega's strong presence of voice
and acoustic guitar, and now and then the band simply left it all to her - a woman, a guitar and 1,500 fans.
<p>
Variety was the show's strong suit.  During "Blood Makes Noise," Vega sang through a bullhorn; encoring 
with "Tom's Diner," she sang a cappella, drawing the audience into providing backing for the chorus while
delightfully deflecting their sloppy handclaps.  While the biggest response was reserved for older material 
like "Small Blue Thing," "Left Of Center," and a nicely understated "Luka," there was never any suggestion 
that playful new songs such as "If You Were in My Movie" and "Fat Man and Dancing Girl' could not hold 
their own.
<p>
Apart from that plaintive but disarmingly powerful voice, Suzanne Vega's selling point has always been her 
ability to draw listeners into the vignettes of everyday life that she turns into exceptional songs.  It was therefore 
no surprise that she occasionally took time out for storytelling.  The moral of one rambling, and hugely funny 
tale, seemed to be that even from an early age, growing up in New York, Vega had been both cerebral and 
streetwise.  And it's that delicate balance that keeps her established as one of the city's finest musicians.
<p>
That this was to be no night for folk music stereotypes was indicated early on by Kitchens of Distinction, a
British three-piece who provided solid walls of richly textured rock music, over which singer Patrick Fitzgerald 
wove his own tales, mostly about gay love.  Introducing a song from the band's first album, "Love Is Hell," he 
announced that "It's not happy, it's not cheery, it's not much fun - but we like it."
<p>
Fortunately for him, so did the audience.

<H1>Eloquent Appeal for Amnesty</H1>

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL'S CONCERT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS - Festival Hall
<p>
</b>
The fact that this concert is now planned as an annual event is a sharp reminder that human rights violations
can never be written ou of the political agenda.  It also emphasizes how much  rock stars are now looked upon 
as perpetual torch-bearers for the world's good causes.
<p>
Suzanne Vega appeared after an address by Amnesty's secretary-general, Pierre Sane.  Armed only with 
acoustic guitar, she filled the hall with her compelling introspections.  Her most recent album, <b>99.9F,</b>
recast her in a tougher rock setting.  But here, alone with just six strings, she defeated her natural stage 
timidity to draw an entranced audience into such well-chosen pieces as "Tired of Sleeping," "Men In A War,"
and her 1985 debut album's "Small Blue Thing."
<p>
But it was her opening song, "Rock In This Pocket," that best echoed the evening's mood. "I'm really well 
acquainted with the span of your brow," she sang. "And if you didn't know me then, you'll know me now."  As a
call from David to the Goliath of intolerance and cruelty, it was an eloquent request for amnesty - Paul Sexton
