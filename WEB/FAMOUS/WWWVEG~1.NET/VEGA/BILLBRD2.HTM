Vega Unveils ‘Nine Objects of Desire’
<p>
Her 5th A&M Release Sports Sultry, Jazzy Vibe<br>
BY PAUL VERNA<br>
<p>
<b>NEW YORK</b> - Always an artist who pushes herself to explore uncharted musical territory, Suzanne Vega was presented with the ultimate challenge two years ago, when her first child was born.
<p>
	Suddenly, she found herself with precious little' time to devote to songwriting, performing, and recording.  Eventually, however, she and her husband/producer, Mitchell Froom, hit their stride and got down to the business of recording her fifth studio album.
<p>	The result of their efforts is "Nine Objects Of Desire," the follow-up to Vega's acclaimed 1993 release "99.9' F." Due Sept. 10 on A&M Records, "Nine Objects" is a sultry, exotic recording that features Froom's artful production and inspired performances from drummers Pete Thomas and Jerry Marotta, bassists Bruce Thomas and Sebastian Steinberg (of Soul Coughing fame), and Froom and engineer Tchad Blake on various instruments.  The album was recorded at the Magic Shop in New York and mixed at Sound Factory in Los Angeles.
<p>	Vega describes "Nine Objects" as "a sexier album than any other one I’ve made" and a "less defiant" record than its predecessor, which emphasized edgy, industrial sounds.  She adds that the new record is "not a retro album," despite the lounge-like styling on the sleeve for "Caramel," her single from the soundtrack to "The -Truth About Cats And Dogs," issued earlier this year.
<p>	"A lot of people are thinking that the whole album is going to be like 'Caramel' and it's going to be lounge music, but I don't think it is," says Vega.  "It has a funkiness about it."
<p>	A&M plans to aggressively promote "Nine Objects" to Vega's eclectic fan base, which spans the triple-A, alternative folk, modern rock, and AC formats.  The album's first single and video is "No Cheap Thrilll," an uptempo, catchy cut.  The track goes to radio Aug. 14.
<p>	A&M product manager Brad Pollak says, "To a certain extent, this is a relaunch in that Suzanne's been away from the marketplace for [almost] four years, so we are not taking anything for granted.  Part one of the attack is to aggressively tell her fans that she has a new record out."
<p>	Pollak adds that "Nine Objects" "combines many different sides of Suzanne Vega.  For those who are hardcore fans, like myself, you can find a little bit of her [self-titled] first record," which established her in 1985 as a leading figure of the folk revival.  As you progress through 'Solitude Standing,"Days Of Open,Hand,'and '99.9'F,'there are bits of all of them" in the new project, he says.
<p>	U.S. radio programmers and retailers have high expectations for "Nine Objects Of Desire."
<p>	Bob Waugh., assistant PD at modern rock outlet WHFS Washington, D.C., says, "It's a really strong record.  Even though it's been a little while since her last album, she continues to reinvent herself.  When you're looking for something that you’re trying to differentiate next to Bush or Green Day, it's great to play an artist like Suzanne Vega.  You leave no doubt in the listener's mind as to what it is."
<p>	Waugh says he is particularly keen on "No Cheap Thrill," the funky "Casual Match," and the lilting "Head Shots."
<p>	Vince DeLeon -- buyer at Harmony House, a 38-store chain based in Troy, Mich. -- says, "I expect this to be a highly successful album.  We did extremely well with '99.9 F,' and Suzanne Vega's catalog always does well at Harmony House.  The quality of her songs always shines through.  We're just hoping for a tour.  She hasn't been to Detroit for way too long."
<p>	Vega played U.S. dates Aug. 2-Saturday (3) with Sarah McLachlan and will appear at the Newport (R.I.) Folk Festival on Saturday (10).  She will then tour major U.S. markets in the fall and possibly go overseas early next year.
<p>	A&M international marketing director Martin Kierszenbaum says "Nine Objects Of Desire" has ample potential worldwide.
<p>	"From an international perspective, Suzanne Vega's career started with'Marlene On The Wall,"' the lead single from her first album.  "That was a huge hit in Europe before 'Luka' broke in the States.  It's rare for American repertoire to break in Europe and then come back.  In that respect, we've always considered Suzanne Vega one of our key international artists."
<p>	Kierszenbaum also points out that Vega's "Tom's Diner" broke in Europe when German production team D.N.A. released an album of remixes of the a cappella song from "Solitude Standing."
<p>	"That opened up new fans for Suzanne, and they converged on '99.9 F,' " says Kierszenbaum.  "This album is a combination between the progressive wall-breaking of '99.9' F' and the immediate melodic sensibility of 'Solitude Standing."'
<p>	In addition to Europe -- where Vega recently did a promotional tour -- the artist has sold well in South America, Southeast Asia, and Australia, according to Kierszenbaum.  "We've got a pretty good spread in terms of her fan base internationally," he says.  "There's no market she's underperformed [in] in the past."
<p>	Vega’s active presence on the Internet will also help A&M market the album internationally, according to Kierszenbaum.  The artist's official World Wide Web site is touting the upcoming release.
<p>	Vega says she is eager to release the record and resume her life as an artist.  "
<p>	"I was having a little trouble getting back into the swing of things because of the birth of my daughter.  It took a while for my brain to start functioning," she says.  "I really have to make an effort, because otherwise I just get caught up in what's happening in the household.
<p>	"I used to just travel by myself, and now I'm part of a triangle.  It's a constant adjustment.  But I figure that's the way it's going to be from now on, and if we have any more children it's just going to be that much more chaotic.  And I'm just going to learn to tune everything out and say, 'Go away, I'm writing."'
<p>	Explaining the album's enigmatic title, Vega says, "In every one of these songs there's an object of desire.  It's either me desiring someone or someone desiring someone else or someone desiring me.  And there are different types of desire, so I added them all up and there were nine.  I thought of lying and calling it 'Seven Objects Of Desire' or calling it 'Twelve Songs About Desire,' but then I thought it would be more accurate to say it was nine."
<p>	Unlike many singer/songwriters, Vega is willing to help fans interpret her material.
<p>	"I like to feel that I'm communicating, and with my songs it's not always easy, so I'm honestly trying to make it as easy for the listener as I can," she says.  "I'm not trying to be willfully obscure; I'm just trying to make it right.  I don't think I should just sit here and go, ‘Figure it out yourselves.’ It's good to have inforrnation to try to help somebody out."
<p>	Vega's songs are published by Waifersongs Ltd. through Warner Music Corp., administered by ASCAP She is managed by Ron Fierstein of AGF Entertainment and booked by Premier Talent.
