Subject: Net appreciation<br>
<p>

I'm new to this list, but just wanted to thank everyone involved with the 
website for providing some positive energy on the net.  It's refreshing 
to know that just when I'm beginning to get cynical about cyber 
communication, I can check into the Vega net for a good dose of 
rejuvination.  I have finally become inspired enough to join the list and 
see what becomes of it.  
<p>
I'm coming off a Vega hiatus in a way.  I only recently bought 99.9F, and 
haven't even heard Days of Open Hand.  My tapes of the first two are 
wearing out and in dire need of replacement.  It's all in the works.  
There's so much to listen to.
<p>
Thanks.<br>
Darcy<br>

Welcome to the list!  Soon, you'll be 'equivocating' with the rest of us!
(listen to 'When Heroes Go Down' again for the "controversial" word 
'equivocate')  ;-)  Check out the website too, while you're at it.
<p>
>haven't even heard Days of Open Hand.
<p>
Yikes!!  Run, do not walk, to your nearest CD store immediately!  Once
you've listened to it a few times, Wendy! and some others of us will be
glad to further extol the virtues of this great album  <-- (inside reference
to an ongoing discussion as to whether Days is merely mediocre or is 
Suzanne's 'best' - if you can pick such a thing, which I can't.  About all
we can resolve is that some love it, others 'not so much.')  :-)
<p>
Welcome again, and enjoy,
<p>

Hi folks,
<p>
I leave for the USA in a few days so I will have to unsubscribe from the
list tomorrow. I would just like to say thank you to everyone on the list
for making it so much fun. It really has been great to find a group of
people who enjoy Suzanne's music so much      ( thanks especially to
Wendy!!!!!!! and the elusive Bob).
<p>
Special thanks to Hugo and Eric for all their hard work with the
website.... it truly is one of the best sites I have seen.
<p>
I look forward to the new album.... I'll certainly be buying a copy on the
day it is released. I hope you all enjoy it. Well I'm all packed and
waiting to go.... my trusty Walkman and Vega tapes will be going with me.
Suzanne's music has been a comfort so many times so I just had to bring the
albums with me on this epic journey.
<p>
Take care all<br>
Finally many, many thanks to Suzanne for the music over the years<br>
Sharon<br>
<p>
PS. I go the new issue of Language a couple of days ago.... try and support
Karien by subscribing. She really puts a lot of time and effort into it and
it is always an interesting read. On top of that the cover of this issue is
really cute :)

<p>
Hi Everyone!
<p>
Just wanted to let you all know that Magellan has recognized the Suzanne Vega
Website by awarding its highest rating (4/4 stars), and awarded the Brian
Rose In The Spotlight section a 3-star award as well. 
<p>
The review cited the extensive discography, for which we thank John Relph...
Thanks to  everyone who contributed to the website, and especially John
Giannadrea who continues to provide the server - gratis.
<p>
So, thanks and congratulations!  The review from Magellan
(http://www.mckinley.com) follows...

<p>
"The Suzanne Vega Website - You couldn't really fnd much more extensive
information on the female folk/alternative music star, Suzanne Vega, than at
this page developed by Eric Szczerbinski and Hugo Westerlund.  The site
includes a complete discography of Vega's recordings and...
<p>
Brian Rose, ..users may be tempted to buy the Brian Rose album after a visit
to this musician's home page.  This site offers extensive information on this
fellow musician and friend to the acomplished Suzanne Vega with a biography
written by Rose himself."

Subject: Net.Music Guide<br>
<p>
The 1996 edition of a book called Net.music is on sale at US bookstores now -
It includes reviews of websites for musicians and record labels, radio
stations, and other music biz sites.
<p>
They've included the Suzanne site in the book, page 201, where they provide
the address, and brief review, something like - "If all being conscientious
and hard working gets you is a website like this, it's all worth it"...

Hi Everyone!

Sorry to interrupt your discussion of the merits of "Days" vs "99.9", but I
have some good news... The guys at GROUND ZERO, part of TAGE Multimedia, have
favorably reviewed our website, and have awarded it a "Ground Zero Cool
Pick"!
<p>
The site now sports the new Ground Zero Cool Pick logo, through which you can
visit their site, which is pretty cool too.  :) Or, surf directly there at
http://www.ground.com.
<p>
Thanks, and congratulations to everyone who has worked on our website!
 (Ditto on Hugo's thanks to Wendy! for typing up the rather lengthy Suzanne
bio from "Bullet In Flight". Thanks too to Chris at Ground Zero for taking
the time to check out the site, and to give it the thumbs up.
<p>
Here's a snippet from the note I received from Ground Zero...

THE SUZANNE VEGA WEBSITE
<p>
A rare exception to the vat of unauthorized fan sites on the Web, this
Suzanne Vega site has the official thumbs-up from Vega herself. That doesn't
mean it's slick marketing fluff, though. This collaborative effort between
prolific songwriter Vega and her fans feels a lot homier than any record
label's online marketing machine. The site is large, with just about
everything a fan could hope to find -- including a stilted but authentic
audio endorsement from Vega herself.

Hi guys...
<p>
I think I'll stop announcing these on the mailing list, it's probably boring
for everyone else.
<p>
Just got a note and award logo from "The Family Jewels Website" recognizing
the Vega site for "Excellence in Web Design"...

Their logo is on the site, linked to the award page...

Hey Everyone!
<p>
InSITES, a pretty cool web index/review just reviewed our site - 4/4 Stars!
 Congrats to everyone who participated!
<p>
InSites is at:
http://www.iguide.com/insites/index.sml
<p>
They said:<br>
<p>
"Excellent design, comprehensive coverage and an audio file "welcome" from
the woman herself make this Suzanne Vega site a must-visit for fans. Also
included are music clips, photo images, reviews and a discography."
<p>
In the next few weeks we hope to add the Learning Annex Transcript
(finally!), our first video clip (the famed no-longer missing Pulp
Fiction/Suzanne Vega segment), and another '90 profile.
<p>
See ya,<br>
Eric
