Ms. Lavine is perhaps one of the best of the modern folk group.  You 
should definitely give her a listen.  She's very talented and her 
material is very diverse.  Funny at times, touching at times, and always 
entertaining.
<p>
Shawn Colvin  . . . She's okay.  Definitely not up to (in my opinion) the 
quality of Suzanne Vega or Christine Lavine, though.  She's folk with a 
bit too much country thrown in for my taste.
<p>
Sarah McLachlan is more or less a more talented Tori Amos.  Kinda 
alternative folk, is such a thing is possible.  Her music is interesting 
but the vocals aren't always as distinct as I feel they should be for the 
sort of music she's doing.  
<p>
Gee, this is my first post to Undertow.  Ironic that it really isn't 
about Suzanne Vega.  :)

Christine Lavin is, IMO, talented to a point. Don't expect to be moved as in
SV, however. Actually, I think Lavin is at her best with her funny stuff,
some of which (including btw her SV parody) is really great. When she gets
serious, she tends to get sappy.. 
<p>
And while we're at it, allow me to voice some disagreement about the previous
opinion of Shawn Colvin, who is astonishingly talented, especially as a
singer and guitar player. She has written some great songs as well. Country??
Not really. She has been overproduced at times, however.

I have her most recent cd and have seen her live a couple of times, 
apparently she has been touring for quite some time.  I really like her 
material.  Her song writing, esp. on this last album, is great.  She is 
also a very accomplished guitarist.  She shows this off some on the last 
album, and can really get into it live..  In fact, she puts on a 
wonderful show.  The two times (both times in Corvallis, Or) I've seen her 
she has genuinely seemed to enjoy interacting with the crowd.  She has a 
cutting wit, a liberal bent and a willingness to talk a bit.  The shows 
were both funny, and musically fantastic.  I went up to speak to her 
after the last show, she was great.
<p>
Of the artists you mentioned for comparison, Sarah M. is probably the
closest, 
but their shows are completely different.  I've only seen Lavin as a solo 
act, just her and guitar.  She sometimes tours with a bass player, I've 
been told these shows are even better than the ones I've seen.
Anyway, bottom, pick up the cds and see a show if you can.

Sarah McLachlan is an Excellent artiste.  I'd catch her if i could .. 
though i think it's unlikely she'll be touring this part of Asia.  
<p>
If u havent gotten Fumbling Towards Ecstasy already .. its probably coz u 
havent heard Sarah's material.  Check out her excellent contribution to 
the No Alternative compilation, Track 10 HOLD ON - an alternate version 
is available on the album FTE.

Christine and Suzanne know each other from their days struggling in the 
NY folk scene. Christine has even  written an amusing parody of Suzanne's 
style. You should certainly consider seeing Christine if you have a good 
sense of humor, but she's not really comparable to Suzanne or the 
other artists you mention aside from being female and accompanying 
herself on the guitar. Her main style of lyric is satirical and much of 
her material is humorous. She puts on a good show, but don't go expecting 
poetic lyrics full of glowing imagery. She's a welcome alternative to 
Vega, not a substitute. You'll probably enjoy her, just don't expect the 
same itch to be scratched - for that you'll have to wait until Suzanne 
tours again.

yes, i think you would enjoy christine lavine's concert. my mom saw her and
thought she was quite good. i've heard a tape and, although she's not 
Suzanne or Shawn, she reminds me of their early stuff, raw and full. some is
just fun. go, have a good time.

	i don't know about christine lavine.  BUT i do know aht you will 
most likely like shawn colvin.  she has a folk flavour that is comprable 
to suzanne.  AND she has guest starred on a number of song by suzanne as 
well!  i do believe she did back up for luka, as well as back up for one 
or two songs off of days of open hand.  they know each other from a while

	i assume you are talking about sarah mclaughlin.  she is 
wonderful, but not that similar to suzanne.  other than she has a great 
voice and has some great songs.  you should go to the ocncert though.  
paula cole is opening up for her, and she is wonderful as well.  she did 
back up for peter gabriel for his secret world tour.
<p>
	people that sarah mclachlan has been compared to are: tori amos 
(though sarah has been around longer than tori), kate bush, sinead 
o'connor, and a few others here and there.   
<p>
	sarah has that song possession that was pretty popular awhile 
back.  i also hear that her lighting show is phenomenal.

Christine Lavin is great, if you go for that kind of stuff.  If there
was a Dr. Demento for Folk, Christine would be played on that every 
week.  She writes a lot of "humor" type folk songs.  "Mysterious Woman"
off of "Good Thing He Can't Read My Mind" is her ode to Suzanne.
The quote from the liner notes is:
<p>
"I used to dream of owning an air conditioner.  I used to dream of
owning a microwave oven.  Then I got one.  Now I dream of being
a "Mysterious Woman," which I know will remain my impossible
unfulfilled dream, since I blab everything.  This song probably
comes from listening to Suzanne Vega's albums one too many
times.  I love her music.  Oh ... to be of those elusive sirens
of the night.  Oh ... to keep everyone guessing.  Oh ... to be
a mysterious nightbird in flight.  Oh ... well."
<p>
Shawn Colvin has done backing vocals for Suzanne a few times, and Suzanne 
has done backing vocals for Shawn, too (sorry, I'm too lazy to get up
again and grab the CDs to check the liner notes to tell you which
songs).
<p>
I think Shawn does best without the backing band.  If you can see her
live when it is just her and guitar, do it!  She really shines in that
format (so does Suzanne!).  I talked to her once after a concert, and she 
was really very nice.  This was just after her first album came out, and we 
talked a bit about her work with Suzanne, and she talked about how she had
just done some backing vocals for Suzanne's next album (days of open hand, 
I tink) the week before.  The reason I went to see her in the first place was
<p>
the fact that one of the local rags said that Shawn could be Suzanne's little
<p>
sister (more or less a quote).  I wasn't disappointed, but keep in mind that 
everyone has their own style.  I don't think that Shawn's music is quite
as "deep" as Suzanne's, but I still enjoy it.

<p>
I also really enjoy Sarah's music.  I also think that her label gives
her more support than A&M gives Suzanne.  I've always been able to find
lots of Nettwerk releases with Sarah on them without any problems, and I 
always have to drive to 5 stores before finding any non-album releases
by Suzanne (e.g. CD-singles, etc).
<p>
p.s.
<p>
It is Sarah McLachlan.

<p>
        I'm sort of lukewarm on Shawn Colvin. I don't like some of her
songs, but I _really_ love "Set the Prairie on Fire" (from _Fat City_).
<p>
        It's also sort of ironic that Shawn and Suzanne ended up in
competition for the Best Folk Album for 1990 (with Steady On and Days of
Open Hand, respectively) when each of them had done backing vocals on the
other's album!

First of all, belated congratulations to Suzanne on her marriage!
<p>
My favorite Christine Lavin song is "Amoeba Hop".  "Cold Pizza for
Breakfast" comes in a close second.
<p>
Is there much overlap between Suzanne Vega fans and Ani DiFranco fans, or
is it just me and Karin (hi Karin)?
<p>
For anyone who likes Jonatha Brook (formerly of The Story) I saw her open
for Holly Near this weekend, and she said she'll have an album out
hopefully in August.  She was really good.
<p>
An anecdote: I go to Swarthmore College, which is in the teeny tiny teeny
tiny suburb of Swarthmore, PA (near Philly).  The other day I was in our
one coffeehouse, the Jumping Cow.  It is owned by neat Swarthmore grads who
often play Suzanne Vega in the restaurant.  This particular morning, Days
of Open Hand was on, and some alum was reminiscing that she first saw
Suzanne on her Solitude Standing tour, at Swarthmore College.  Sigh...  I
would love for Suzanne to come here now.  We are not a big enough school to
support artists as popular as she is now.  But that really isn't a request
(unless you're dying to experience painful suburbia, Suzanne!)

<p>
well I'm sure many others will be more informative, but just as a start, John
Cale (who's from Wales I think)  was one of the founding members of Velvet
Underground, and has had a long and interesting career as a solo artist,
occasionally with major record labels, ever since he left the group (after
just two albums). He's often veered off into serious avant-garde stuff, then
will turn around and do some relatively straightforward, almost punk-ish
rock--a hard to categorize body of work all in all. He reunited w/ Lou Reed
for an Andy Warhol tribute album of sorts in 1990 and collaborated with Brian
Eno on a surprisingly good-humored album released that same year. So he's no
stranger to collaboration.
