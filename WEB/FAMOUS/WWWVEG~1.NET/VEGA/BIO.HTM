I was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, and grew up in Williamsburg,
the restored 18th century town. In 1977 I went to New York to
attend Cooper Union, where I majored in photography. While in
school I began writing songs and hanging out at various music
clubs and cafes in Greenwich Village.  It was there that I met
other aspiring songwriters such as Suzanne Vega, Jack Hardy,
David Massengill, John Gorka, and Shawn Colvin.  In 1982 I was
the co-founder (with Jack Hardy) of the Fast Folk Musical
Magazine, a record/magazine promoting new songs and songwriters.
<p>
During the 80's I concentrated much of my attention on
photography--documenting the streets and landscape of the
city--and in 1985, I began to photograph along the former Iron
Curtain border and the Berlin Wall. That project, which I
continued to work on till after the fall of East Germany and the
Soviet Union, has been exhibited in several one-man shows, and
prints from the series have been collected by the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art.

<p>
After a few years away from music, I once again began writing and
performing songs. In 1991 I recorded an album simply titled
"Brian Rose."  The music runs from full band arrangements,
produced by Suzanne Vega, to spare acoustic guitar and violin.
Over the years I have written 200 or more songs, 40 or 50 of
which I still stand by.  Whether one calls what I do rock or folk
is not particularly important.  What is essential is that the
music, played with a band or solo, starts with the idea of a song
as a complete thing in itself.
<p>
In 1993 I married Renee Schoonbeek, a Dutch urban planner. I
travel frequently between New York and Amsterdam both for music
and photography.  Most recently I have been photographing the
landscape on the periphery of Amsterdam.  The working title of
the project is "Amsterdam on Edge."  Most recently my photographs 
were exhibited at De Balie, a cultural center in Amsterdam.
