          Excuse me
          If I may
          Turn your attention
          My Way

          I'm really well acquainted
          With the span of your brow
          If you didn't know me then 
          You'll know me now
</pre>

<p>These are the lyrics to the opening song of Suzanne Vega's fourth album,
 entitled <b>99.9F</b>, coming out in September 1992.  This album marks a stylistic departure
for Suzanne, who has already proven herself to be wildly diverse, working with such artists as Lenny Kaye
from the Patti Smith Group, Philip Glass, Arthur Baker, They Might Be Giants, The Lemonheads, and 
the ubiquitous DNA of "Tom's Diner" fame.
<p>Suzanne rose quickly through the New York folk scene in the early eighties.   Her first album was released
in 1985.  With each album she broke new territory, as the reviews below confirm.  With this fourth album, 
<b>99.9F</b>, produced by Mitchell Froom, she gets rid of any preconceived ideas that might be left.

<pre>
          99.9 Farenheit degrees
          Stable now, with rising possibilities...
          It could be normal but it isn't quite
</pre>

To know how she perceives herself in the pop music realm, keep reading! It's all there...

<b><h3>THE ALBUM REVIEWS</h3></b>
<pre>
            <b>Suzanne Vega</b> - Released April 1985
</pre>
"... She emerges as the strongest, most decisively shaped songwriting personality to come along in years... 
A major achievement"
<pre>
                                             - <i>John Rockwell,
                                                       The New York Times, April 1985</i>
</pre>


"The singer's 1985 debut album...awakened listeners to a fresh new voice, reviving the folk-music genre
 after nearly two decades of dormancy...In retrospect, Vega's intimate first album proved to be a significant
 milestone in this decade..."
<pre>

           <b>Solitude Standing</b> - Released April 1987
</pre>
"...She's now established as the greatest songstress of the '80s...no one is really doing anything like this,
not in such a lyrically open, delightfully spiritual fashion"
<pre>
                                               - <i>Sounds (U.K.), May 1987</i>

                                                
          <b>Days of Open Hand</b> - Released April 1990
</pre>
"The soft-spoken whiz-kid from New York has come of age with this one..Suzanne has...moved into a world
of high-tech production and incredibly intricate arrangements, so successfully as to make <b>DAYS OF OPEN HAND</b>
her best album to date."
<pre>
                                               - <i>X-Press (Australia), June 1990</i>
</pre>

"With DAYS, Vega assumes her place in the folk tradition as an individual talent.  Bob Dylan did it when he
 moved from the offhand plain speaking of folk songs into a denser folk rock...Vega's record takes a similar
leap; she's now beyond borders, making an unaffected art music that's heady, heartfelt, very demanding - and 
very rewarding..."

<b><h3>ABOUT SUZANNE VEGA</h3></b>
<p>"...Some people are cultivated roses, but I'm this tough dandelion.  I felt like a weed, and I was proud 
of it.  Weeds are just there.  They're tough.  They stick around... They're not anything splendid...

<p>"...I always considered my voice plain and fine-no big deal... the kind of voice that you use to sing
to your children or your brothers and sisters.  I like to think of it as a pencil.  It's very useful. It's
ordinary.  Everyone's got one...My voice is like a little kid singing a tune.  She's putting on her socks
and she's singing.  That's all."
<pre>
                                                -<i>MUSICIAN - 1990</i>
</pre>

<p>"One journalist asked me, 'Isn't it exhausting to hold that deadpan throughtout one song? I thought,
one song?  I hold that deadpan throughout my entire life."
<pre>
                                                -<i>NEW MUSICAL EXPRESS, UK - 1987</i>
</pre>

<p>"...I never faked it.  I never said, 'I'm going to be Top 20, and this is what you have to do to be Top
20: show a lot of skin, be bright and cheerful and aggressive' - if anything, I've done everything exactly the opposite.  
I wore black for most of my singing career, and refused to be cheerful on stage to the point where it
irritated the audience sometimes.  I do like to make them laugh."
<pre>
                                                -<i>L.A. WEEKLY - 1987</i> 
</pre>

<p>"I see myself as a little bit left of center of the mainstream.  I think the mainstream goes up and down
depending on what year it is; some people say oh she is big, oh she's small. But I'm just playing on the sideway.
<p>...My role is to have a life and to express things from a very street-level point of view.  This is what I really
believe.  I don't think it's my job to express a pop star's life.  So this means that I have t olead a normal life, 
which means walking around, talking to people, experiencing things and struggling through things.  It's not like
riding around in limousines and that kind of thing.  That's not interesting to me and that doesn't give me 
anything to write about; it doesn't help me; it doesn't inspire me to write songs."

<b><h3>WHO'S LISTENING</h3></b>

<p>"...boys in black leather jackets and shaved heads, middle-aged men in pin stripes, literate boys with
notebooks under their arms and girls who are gay or whatever..."

</pre>

<p>"...It makes me feel that I've done a good job if I can reach people from all different levels.  That's why
I was pleased that "Tom's Diner" did what it did, cause suddenly all these black kids in the neighborhood
where I grew up in New York were listening to my songs.  So it had this impact, and I'm happy when I feel that the 
songs can go into all different levels of society.  That's what I'm aiming for."

<b><h3>SONGWRITING</h3></b>
<p>"...I get my inspirations from things that are ordinary and not precious at all, like children's nursery
rhymes, and games that kids play in the streets.  Things that I had played as a child; sing-song rhymes
and rhythms that you make up to amuse yourself while you're jumping rope, or if you're teasing somebody else... 
That's where I first got a sense of words, what they were about.
<p>But I also use other things.  Medical textbooks, science textbooks.  Pieces of information...Whatever rings
true to me is where I'll find it...
<p>I love songwriting.  To me, there's all these elements that are mixed into it, of magic, spells and prayers...
children's games...science...I like to bring all these things together so it's all one.  You can draw from any 
source...
<p>I have a problem with specifically confessional songwriting.  I think you have to craft it in some way.
I don't think you can come on stage and blurt out yourinnermost feelings.  My niece can blurt out her innermost
feelings.  She's four years old.  I wouldn't want to pay $25 (laughs) to go see her do that.  You need to put
it in a form...
<p>As a songwriter, I need to be able to say those things that are part of everyday life: I need you, I want you.
 War must end.  How do you get to say them without sounding like a jerk or sounding simplistic, that's my
next challenge...how do you say it in a way that seems as if they haven't heard it before?"
<pre>
                                                   -<i>SONGTALK, PART 1 - 1991</i>
</pre>

<p>"...The one political song that I've heard recently that I think is really good - and if I were to write a 
political song I would want to write one like it - is Peter Gabriel's "Biko."   the reason it sounds great is because
 he writes about one man, one person, and he makes it a metaphor for a nation, which I think is important.  In 
my way I try to do that - I write about small things as metaphors for larger ones.  To me that's more effective than
writing about the big picture in very general terms."

</pre>


<p>"I like the feel of the words in my mouth.  I pick short words with hard syllables at the beginning and end.  
Sometimes I sing nonsense things until they come out meaning something..."

<p>"I was watching a special on JFK.  And I noticed people when they are moved by grief, that their language
 becomes very condensed and would start to rhyme.  And they weren't being poetic.  They were trying to express
something that meant a lot to them.  And I noticed that the quality of the language changed.  Suddenly they
started to speak in a way that you speak in when you're writing songs, if you're close to something truthful.  It was
eerie to watch and see that...
<p>Also, a lot of religious writings are in verse.  It makes me feel that there's something about rhythm and
rhyme that gets close to the truth of things. I think it's connected..."

</pre>


<p>"If there was one message to my songs, it would be that things are not always as they seem to be.  I
fight stereotyping in all forms.  If you scratch the surface of people, strip away the outsides, on the inside 
you see the similarities.
<p>...Injustice and the idea that there are still things that happen that are degrading to people, like child
abuse, makes me angry, makes me sick.  And it makes me want to reveal it mand make it stop.  I'm 
dedicated to preventing child abuse and (promoting) the things that Amnesty International is doing for
Human Rights."

<b><h3>TOM'S DINER</h3></b>

<p>"...If I thought it was bad I would have sued them (DNA).  But I thought it was funny and inventive and I never
dreamed that it would be a big hit.  And I was really happy when I realized that it was going to an audience that is 
normally not my audience.  Black and Puerto Rican Kids in New York all heard it.  I grew up in this kind
of neighborhood, so it was ironic to me that without knowing it, my music had suddenly gotten into these other areas.
To me it was like translating the song in another language.
<p>...I get letters from people.  They hate DNA. My feeling is, why not experiment.  If you hate that, if you
hate "Tom's Diner" by DNA then don't listen.  Go back to <b>SOLITUDE STANDING</b>.  It still exists
in the original form.  There's no reason to get hysterical.  People feel upset but I don't feel that way.  I think it's fun..."

<b><h3>IMAGES</h3></b>
<p>"People, when they listen, want to know what you're singing about.  And if you know what it is, they'll 
know what it is.  Not even that you have to say it, but if you know what it is, then they'll know.  Because 
it will be there in the structure...
<p>Images are what I find beautiful.  I found that to be one of Dylan's strengths.  Not that he said war must
end, which he did, but when he said, "A hard rain's gonna fall," and used the images of "white ladder
covered with water" and "white man walking a black dog."  All of these images have mystery in them and 
they say racism must end and all men must be brothers.  But they don't come out and say it.  They have it
within the images, which we recognize from our own lives.
<p>And that to me is where his strength was.  Not that he was a great politician, but that he was a great
poet and he used those images to reveal those basic messages.  Because it's not about messages.  If it
was just about printing messages you could just write a pamphlet or a bulletin on index cards and pass them out.  
So it's obviously not just messages that we're trying to give.  It's got to work on some other level."

<p>"When I was about 12, I saw this green military shirt at a rally.  You could pick out a silkscreen to go
on the back of it, and I picked one of a Vietnamese woman with a baby in one arm and a gun in the other.  And
this was my emblem.. I'd get up in the morning and I'd put on my jacket and I'd be very dressed for the day.  This
was my thing.  It covered me from my neck down to my knees, and I felt like the coolest person in the world when
I had my jacket on."

</pre>


<p>"The images have their own context.  If you sing that song ("Tired of Sleeping") in Czechoslovakia,
where they just had a revolution, it has a whole different resonance than if you sing it in San Francisco, or in a
college town.  The college kids will feel that it's a psychedelic song and people in Czechoslovakia feel that
you're talking about rising out of sleep and releasing yourself from oppression.  Both readings are true."

</pre>

<p>"...I am interested in images.  that's why I put them down.  They're not beautiful - (sometimes) they're
ugly or shocking - but I feel that they haunt me and therefore they are something I need to recognize; to write 
them down for what they're worth."

<b><h3>99.9F</h3></b>

<p>"...There is one song called "Blood Sings" which is about looking at photographs of an uncle that I
have never met.  We look very much alike but I have never seen him in real life.  And he had a very tragic
life and a very short oneso this is what the song is about; how it feels to see yourself in someone else.  Another
song which is called "(If You Were) In My Movie" which is a very straightforward song and it's  a sort of
flirting song with someone.  If you were in my movie: these are the parts you would play and the parts are:
a detective, a gangster, a priest and a doctor.  It's easy to see what the songs are about.  They are about
real things."
