Good reply to Newsweek, Suzanne! And thanks for posting it, Jeremy.<p>

Here are a couple of lines I've been thinking about a lot:<p>

	Did you ever keep the date<br>
	With the steel side of the knife<p>

I'm fascinated by them, but they fail to make any "sense" to me. I'd like 
to know what *you* make of them...<p>

In the newsgroup rec.music.folk I found the first Internet comment on 
Suzanne's participation in the Passim benefit -- someone wrote that she 
spent a lot of time talking about being a new mother. (Want to share some 
of that with us on Undertow, Suzanne?) Didn't anybody on Undertow see her? 
I'd love to read a review...<p>

The latest news about Song of Tower, the Cohen tribute featuring Suzanne, 
is that it will be released in the UK on 27 February. It's about time ... 
but who knows if it's the final date...<p>

Later,<br>

	i had thought that the song it was from "as girls go" was about 
transvestism and cross dressing and the whole transgendered community, 
and that thos particular two lines deal with the actual physical 
operation of a sex change, and suzanne was wondering if the cross dresser 
actually was a physical "woman" or a man dressed as a woman....<p>

	of course i might be wrong.  i would love to hear suzanne's 
little story about how that song came about and if she is actually 
friends with a crossdresser (no i don't cross dress, but i wrote and 
presented a paper on crossdressing and the politics of drag...)<p>
	
	suzanne?<p>

My simple interpretation is this: The narrator is asking the he who
makes a beautiful girl (as girls go) whether or not he ever actually
underwent the transsexual operation.  Went "under the knife".  The
steel side of the knife is the end with the point; the other side is
the hilt (a much safer side to be on).  "Did you ever get surgically
changed from a man to a woman?"<p>

So there it is.<p>

I don't have the rest of the lrics in front of me, but off-hand, I would 
say it's either a suicide or a murder, but something invloving death, or 
killing... What else would you need a knife for- besides cutting 
something. It seems pretty basty, "the steel side" and all.

It always seemed to me to be a question of whether or not the person
who makes "a really good girl, as girls go" has had a sex change
operation, to put it bluntly.<p>

I thought that the date would be that with a surgeon for a change of sex
operation.  Steel side of the knife I guess refers to the hard edge of a
surgeons scalpel.<p>

I find all of these interpretations interesting, but I have always had a
different view of these lines.  <p>

People often link a transvestite or other "deviant" automatically to a deeper
sexual deviantcy.  This is similar to those who see all gay people as child
molesters.  I see the lines as asking did you ever "keep the date," as in
consumate the relationship using force, "the steel side of the knife."  In
other words, being a "deviant," have you raped ever raped an unsuspecting
schmoe that didn't have a clue until the last second.<p>

This is just my view.  We all see things from our own biases, and, being
involved with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, I have built up my own set on
observations based to those that dress up like a girl for pleasure or any
other reason.  A simple deviation is often seen as a sign of something deeper
and more sinsister to someone who doesn't understand it.<p>

Thanks for all the interesting replies to my question about the Steel
side of the knife!<p>

The majority seems to be for surgery. Another theory is that the knife
refers to violence or rape. Both interpretations seem valid to me. But 
there is another, more far-fetched thought that has stayed in my mind.<p>

         Let's chronicle<br>
         The dark side of a life<br>
         Did you ever keep the date<br>
         With the steel side of the knife<p>

'Date' could have several meanings: a doctor's appointment (certainly
in line with a main theme on the album), a sexual date (which seems
equally plausible). The word 'chronicle', however, suggests that there
could be another meaning as well: the day of the month and year. If I
remember it correctly, Robinson Crusoe would "keep the date" by cutting
a mark in a stick for each day that passed. This practice goes far back
in history -- some of the earliest calenders were sticks, where the
important (often astronomical) dates had been marked. This also reminds
me of hunters, who cut a mark in the butt of their rifles for each
animal (or human being) they kill. It is not a question of *measuring*
time, it is a way of *marking* time, of making something more real than
the ordinary flow of things -- a bit like pinching yourself to make
sure that you are awake (alive).<p>

Psychologically, this is related to the antisocial behaviour mentioned
by a couple of posters, but it is also a part of healthy functioning,
as pointed out by Eliade in his excellent book The Sacred & The
Profane: "For religious man time ... is neither homogenous nor
continuous. On the one hand there are the intervals of sacred time, the
time of festivals ...; on the other there is profane time, ordinary
temporal duration, in which acts without religious meaning have their
setting. Between these two kinds of time there is, of course, solution
of continuity; but by means of rites religious man can pass without
danger from ordinary temporal duration to sacred time."<p>

Without danger this passage need not be, though. Often the highest and
the lowest lie perilously close together. Abraham preparing to
sacrifice Isaak is but one example. By taking things to their extreme,
perhaps by an act of violence, or by surgery, we hope to find the
essence of existence:<p>

         I wanted to learn all the secrets<br>
         from the edge of a knife<br>
         From the point of a needle<br>
         from a diamond<br>
         from a bullet in flight<br>
         I would be free then<p>

Is this what the transvestite is trying to do? Perhaps. The
interpretation is somewhat far-fetched, I admit, but very compelling to me. 
Does it make sense to anyone else? Any comments?<p>

Subject: Steel Side of the Knife<p>

While I'm certainly eager to find whatever great philosophical
significance resides in Suzanne's songs (witness the 79K thesis
on "Wooden Horse" I posted a while back), I really have to 
disagree with all the metaphorical interpretations I've been
reading of "As Girls Go." I think the simple, prosaic, boring
interpretation makes the most sense: the song is a
conversation with a crossdresser or transsexual, and the
"steel side of the knife" question refers to the sex-change
operation.<p>

I'd place this song with some of the quirkier,
somewhat light-hearted material that makes up a good portion 
of _99.9F_ (the title song, "Fat Man and Dancing Girl," "(If You
Were) In My Movie," etc.) and help distinguish that album from
_Days Of Open Hand_, which is so filled with hefty ruminations 
about life, death, one's place in the cosmos, etc. (I think my next
mega-interpretation is going to be about "Those Whole Girls"
or "Tired of Sleeping," or maybe just the whole album, so watch
out, folks.)<p>

Of course, this is Suzanne Vega, and her light-hearted songs are
far more perceptive and intriguing than a lot of songwriters
even approach in their most philosphical mode. I find a few 
things very perplexing about this song.<p>

First, I get the distinct impression that this transvestite
or transsexual is someone Suzanne (or the narrator, anyway) has
known for at least a short time -- in his/her female guise.
That's my reading of the "Still kind of look like a guy/Never
though to wonder why" line: "I never thought to wonder why you
have this somewhat masculine appearance." She never would have
had any occasion to wonder before if they'd just met; at least 
that's my reasoning.<p>

Maybe the person has just revealed his/her true birth-gender to
Suzanne, and she's reacting to it. She's clearly trying to be
supportive. My interpretation of "You make a really good girl/As
girls go" is: "You really look good as a female, by normal female
standards -- that is, keeping in mind that many women differ
from the idealized female image that's always being shoved at
us by popular culture." (I can't imagine that any but a small 
percentage of transsexuals or transvestites can conceal all
traces of their male origins if you get a chance to observe them
at close range. Then again, most women I know complain about
being made to feel inadequate by Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue models and the like.)<p>

Suzanne goes on to reassure him/her about her/his appearance:
"Not exactly natural/stunning none the less." She also tells
him/her that gender doesn't matter and the ambiguity doesn't
bother her: "It doesn't matter to me/which side of the line ..."<p>

Then Suzanne expresses her curiosity: "What happened
to you ..." ("more girl than girls are" probably refers to the
other person dressing/acting more femininely than biological
women generally care to) and the "steel side of the knife"
question. "Dark side of a life" could refer to "dark" as in hidden, 
since the status of a person's genitals is kind of a private
matter, or dark as in "gloomy, dismal," referring to whatever
trauma the person must have gone through during his/her
transition.<p>

But we also we have this really weird shift into first person
early in the song, and that starts to throw my theory off: "If I
could pull this off/would I know for certain/the real situation/
behind the curtain."<p>

My main theory is that these are the thoughts of the crossdresser 
wondering if he can be accepted as a woman in society and, by 
being treated as one, learn the secrets of what many guys tend 
to regard as the mysteries of women's lives. (Such as, what DO they 
talk about in the bathroom together?)<p>

But whose point of view is this, anyway? My guess is that we're
shifting momentarily into the mind of the other person, which
makes for jarring narrative but has been done before. But if
that's true, why does this sound like the first time s/he has
been dressed as a woman? The rest of the song makes it sound
like this person has some experience at this. Is this a flashback?
If so, why?<p>

Another possibility is that this is the narrator, maybe trying
to identify with the point of view of someone crossing the
gender boundary and wondering what it would be like. <p>

Or maybe the narrator has agreed to try it out and is experiencing
crossdressing first-hand. But that doesn't seem to fit the rest of
the song; and it really doesn't fit if the narrator is
female, as I've always imagined. (The level of supportiveness 
from the narrator is not what I'd expect from most men who find 
out the woman they're talking to is/was a guy.) <p>

Or maybe the narrator _is_ male. You could draw that conclusion
from the lines "Would you ever show or tell/'cause you're so
good so far," which have a distinctly flirtatious and sexual
tone to them (not at all out of place on this album). So maybe 
we're in a "Crying Game" type of situation here. Maybe they did
just meet in a bar or club,  and the guy was attracted to the
person based on the female appearance, just realized the
situation and is curious/excited anyway. Or maybe it's a female
narrator who is excited. Are these people 
Suzanne knows, or is this a conversation she overheard somewhere (a la 
"Neighborhood Girls")?<p>

Or perhaps this is all a monologue conducted by the crossdresser
looking in the mirror, musing over his life, etc. (But then why
the uncertainty about the operation? Wouldn't he _know_?)<p>

Anyway, you can see I have a number of interpretations
here and can't defend any one of them with 100% certainty.
Anyone else care to take a crack?<p>

Thanks for the analysis of As Girls Go, Bob. Your interpretation makes
good sense, although I may add that the reality behind the song was that
Suzanne used to see this (wo)man in a local restaurant -- I think (s)he was
the waitress. <p>

However much I agree that the "simple, prosaic" interpretation is the one
that makes the most sense, I do think that every possible ambiguity is
significant, at least in a song by someone like Suzanne. I'm sure you
could say "did you ever undergo a sex-change operation?" in a million
different ways, so why did Suzanne choose the words that she did? Surely 
not by chance or mistake -- there must be some, conscious or unconscious, 
intention, and therefore I think alternative symbolic (rather than 
metaphorical) interpretations are called for.<p>

In this particular case, however, I may very well be mistaken. English is 
not my first language, so perhaps I see an ambiguity where there is none. 
Besides, I never claimed that my ponderings make any real sense, quite on 
the contrary, and I certainly never intended to come up with *the* 
interpretation of the song.<p>

So I'm hoping to read more comments about this, or any other, song...<p>

Finally, Bob, please send me your 64k interpretation of Wooden Horse -- 
you must have posted it before I joined Undertow in September last year.<p>
