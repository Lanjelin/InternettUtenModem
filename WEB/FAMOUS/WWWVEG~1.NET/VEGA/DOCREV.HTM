<h3>Concert Review - Suzanne Vega, Friday, Sept. 14, 1990, Austin Opera House, 
Austin, TX</h3>

<h4>Vega delivers intimate concert despite post-"Luka" recognition </h4>
The Daily Texan (Student newspaper, The Univ. of Texas at Austin)<br>
Monday, Sept. 17, 1990<br>
by Dave Winter, Daily Texan staff<br>
<p>
Judging the quality of a Suzanne Vega concert is easy - if her voice
prevails over everything else, it's a success.
<p>
Vega's voice, which at once confronts and flutters overhead, has been
obscured since the hit "Luka" thrust her into the national spotlight
three years ago, sending her on auditorium tours that impeded the intimacy
with her audience which had come so easy in Manhattan coffeehouses.
<p>
Despite the fact that the evil children of "Luka" - her featureless
back-up band, its inescapable amplifier feedback, a stadium light show,
a fluctuating public persona weary from an extended international tour,
and 1,000 or so pop-folk enthusiasts - came with Vega to the Austin Opera
House Friday, her voice still resonated, strong and haunting.
<p>
Since the show was her second U.S. date after returning from Japan, and
since Vega donned the garb of a Geisha doll during the Solitude Standing
tour three years ago, many of her fans indicated with their attire that 
they expected the same; instead, Vega, obviously separating the songs 
from their source of strength, emerged as the epitome of Austin fashion,
in a sleeveless heather sweatshirt and faded jeans.
<p>
With that visual distraction thwarted, Vega proceeded to dismiss any
audio ones with powerful renditions of "Rusted Pipe" and "Tired of
Sleeping," from her unheralded current album Days of Open Hand.
<p>
On the album, the dominant synthesizer of Anton Sanko fills in the
fluctuations of Vega's vocals, but at the show Sanko's keyboard and
the rest of Vega's band were relegated to the background early and
gradually yielded to Vega's solo songs.
<p>
After strong but still obligatory renditions of "Ironbound/ Fancy Poultry"
and "Marlene on the Wall" the band encircled Vega and then left the stage
entirely.
<p>
With no band and no image in her way, Vega wove her voice and acoustic
guitar into a beautiful version of "Gypsy" from Solitude Standing.  She
then betrayed her reputation of solemn introspection with a sharp sense
of humor - after imploring the Austin audience to follow her to Dallas
for her Saturday show at the Arcadia Theater, she related several anecdotes
from her elementary school days, finishing with a cheerful a cappella 
rendition of her playground favorite "The Willabee Song."
<p>
Unfortunately, the band interrupted Vega's monologue by returning to the
stage and cluttering another round of inevitable songs like "Luka" and
"Book of Dreams."  Vega's return to solitude, however, resulted in 
another series of intimate songs, none more mesmerizing than her first
encore of "The Queen and the Soldier" from her 1985 self-titled debut
and "Tom's Diner," whose blend of Vega's voice and the unisoned snaps
of 2,000 hands produced the concert's most beautiful song.
<p>
The rapture of the Opera House crowd was not measured by the number of
Bic lighters held aloft or the duration of the applause, but by the fans'
tacit struggle all night not to compete with her voice.  And with their
help, Vega reasserted her uniqueness, which defies the traditional 
categories used to format radio airplays and target audiences.  It's a
defiance that at once stunts her potential for star status and preserves
the climate needed to maintain her integrity as an artist.

<h2> Concert Review - Drentse en Asser Courant -13 December 1990 </h2>
<h3>by R. Loots</h3>
<p>
<b>Suzzzzzzanne Vegaaahhhhhh</b>
<p>
Sweetness lasts just a couple of songs with Suzanne Vega. However,
yesterdays concert in Groningen - presented as the only one in the
Netherlands, although a previous one was in The Hague last May- lasted more
than one and a half hours and twenty songs.
<p>
<b>Debut</b>
<p>
At her debut as a girl with guitar in New York folkclubs like The Speakeasy
and
Folk City she was praised by critics and compared to Joni Mitchell and Bob
Dylan. As a result of this success she released her first album, plainly
self-titled in making her "a phenomenon".  "Her second album, Solitude
Standing, made her a star. With her third album Days Of Open Hand, Suzanne
Vega develops into one of the clearest, purest, most poetic voices of the
nineties." 
<p>
	That is, thus is acclaimed in her own tourbook, delivered with the Tour of
Open Hand. It does not only sound pretentious, it is plain exagerated.
Especially when one sees Suzanne.
<p>	I do not want to speak any evil about her, because she is such a sweet and
fragile girl. With a little voice which can be just as moving as kid's,
repeatedly reaching for the right key and everytime just missing it. 
Like a little Sinaspril-kid who cites the song it learned in kindergarten,
all by itself in a crowded living room. Meanwhile counting every loop in the
high wool carpet and nervously drilling her pointing finger into the
buttonhole
of her vest. It almost makes grandma snivel.
<p>	Just like I felt yesterday hearing Suzanne sing a song, she learned as an
eight year old. A folk song, she said, because it was sung at school in the
past by black as well as Puerto Rican, by Asian as well as thin, pale kids.
How folk can it be? It was not called 'Kumbayah', nor 'I'm working on the
railroad'. What it was called Suzanne did not say either. When she was
eight, she could not have done it any better.
<p>
<b>Poor Thing</b>
<p>
It sounded like Tom's Diner, the encore in which the poor thing forgot the
lyrics. But those lyrics then are much more difficult to remember. And that
basically tells what Suzanne Vega is: She is a fine observer. She has the
gift to draw spheres and pictures in between the narrow space a songtexts
offers to lines and words. From Room Off The Street:
 Somewhere in a room is a woman who's drinking and her dress is so tight, you
can see every breath that she takes. Do you get it? A simple example, but you
immediately know what it looks like. 	
  <p>                 Thus she reveals the beauty of simplicity, sometimes with
a couple of lines consisting of just one word  This with the intention to
wake up the lower consciousness of man by the recognizability of it all.
Only does Suzanne not have a rough throat, but a sweet one. And then even
two stools on a stage offer to little variation. I would rather prefer a bed.
