You're welcome!  "Plumb" was just about my favorite album of 1995; I can't 
choose between this one and Dar Williams' "The Honesty Room" - both are
simply excellent.  The other two albums by The Story, while containing
several good tracks, pale in comparison to Plumb, IMHO.  Her phrases take
unexpected turns and twists sometimes, but whatever she does, it works -
kind of like R.E.M. (see below).  I did check out "Oyster" in a listening
area, and didn't like it enough to purchase...
<p>
I'd also recommend Sara Hickman's albums, "Equal Scary People" and "Shortstop"
on Elektra and her latest, "Necessary Angels".  While I'm on the letter 'H',
I also like Peter Himmelman and Kristin Hersh.  
<p>
For pure sublime quality, you can't beat the early R.E.M. albums - check out
the IRS re-issues w/ bonus tracks!  A bit expensive, but worth it.  
Enough for now...
<p>
Any further word on upcoming events from Suzanne?, (details - we want details)
<p>

i didn't care too much for _plumb_, though the song "nothing sacred" is
incredible - there's just something...something about the way the drums
sound which do me in. the rest of the album is much too musically bland
to hold my interest.
<p>
however, to be fair, i should note that the songs are very
well-written. i managed to catch jonatha's appearance on the world cafe
where she played a handful of the songs from the album with just her
acoustic guitar and they sounded much more "right" in that form.

<p>
Greetings all,
<p>
In addition to all the press the Suzanne got over the weekend, I saw that one
of the panelists on VH1's "4 On The Floor" show picked "Dead Man Walking" as
his selection of the week, and while not going into any detail about
Suzanne's contribution he did mention her as one of the featured artists.
 Hope that caught some attention.
<p>
Eric, I noted your thanks to Rob about introducing you to Jonatha Brooke and
The Story's "Plumb."  They have two other release, credited just to The Story
-- I've only found one of them but it's wonderful, and if you like "Plumb" I
think you'll like this one a lot, perhaps even more -- it's called "Angel In
The House."
<p>
Best to all,<br>
Scott<br>

This is getting a bit far afield from Suzanne, but I'd just like to make a
small correction to this info.  The first two albums by The Story featured
both Jonatha Brooke *and* Jennifer Kimball; most of the songs were duets,
or complex interweaved vocal passages between the two.  Their first album was
called "Grace in Gravity," originally on Green Linnet Records.  The duo 
broke up in 1994, after "Angel in the House."
<p>
"Plumb," although credited to 'Jonatha Brooke and The Story', is essentially
her solo debut, with limited backing vocals.  No Jennifer Kimball, although
she is thanked in the credits.  So:  if you like "Plumb", don't expect the
other two albums by The Story to sound the same.  They all have in common
Jonatha's songwriting, although I believe a few tracks on the other albums
were jointly credited.  Whew... hope that was helpful.  
<p>
I like all 3 albums, just thought I'd clarify things.  We now return you to
your regularly scheduled 'Dead Man Walking'/ 99.9 /new album  discussion. :-)
