Subj:	Some first impressions<br>
Date:	96-09-09 10:35:09 EDT<br>

Sender:	owner-undertow@law.emory.edu<br>

<p>
I can't wait to tell you about some of my first impressions of the album,
but I'll try not to reveal anything so I won't spoil your own first
listening (anyway you're not forced to read this):
<p>
-The songs don't suffer at all from being too short, like in the previous
album, except that I wish there were fewer open-ended songs. <br>
-I think that 'No Cheap Thrill' is a pretty bad choice for a single and I'd
be very surprised if it ever became a hit. They should have chosen
'Birth-day' (surprising song for Suzanne, it could have made a hit but maybe
that it would have brought a kind of public she isn't looking after),
'Headshot' (which is awesome), 'Caramel' or 'World Before Columbus'. I can
say that because this is precisely the kind of thing you can only see at the
first listenings. <br>
-Suzanne has really changed, this album is much happier than the others,
'Tombstone' is almost funny, the piano makes me think of saloon music, and
the song reminds me a bit of 'Black Widow Station' <br>
-'My Favorite Plum' is really sweet <br>
-'Honeymoon Suite' is the most Suzanne-typical song <br>
<br>
  Well I can't tell you everythiong I like in the album because it would be
too long, but here are some (light) disappointments: <br>
-It's very... weird how she repeats "Oh Yeah" in 'Stockings', but maybe it
means something in the song, I'll have to read the lyrics carefully<br>
-I've now checked all the lyrics and it seems to me that 'World Before
Columbus' has the kind of lyrics she has always avoided (but the music is
great). Once again I haven't translated it and maybe I'll probably change my
mind soon. But moreover, when she says 'It would be as flat as the world
before Columbus', well... err... I don't know how to tell you this, Suzanne,
but Columbus never proved the world was round. Copernic made the theory long
before, and Magellan actually proved it after Colombus'death. I won't teach
anyone anything if I say that Colombus thought the world was round and so
wanted to reach India by the west, and he never did, so he didn't prove
anything at all. <br>
And when she says 'It would be as cruel as the world before Columbus', well
I'm not sure that her (adoptive) Puerto-Rican roots that she tries to go
back to with this album would agree, it could even make them mad. 
<p>
well anyway this album is more than great and it's good to see that I wasn't
wrong, that I really love everything she does. What's strange is that
there's really a connection between her songs and me, like I thought. I mean
I already feel like I've known all these new songs long before (though
they're all very innovative), they already are a part of my life. 
<p>
And I think that this album can be very successful in the UK because it's a
strange blend of the two UK crazes of these days: trip-hop and
easy-listening music (any English undertowers can confirm that?). I don't
know if it's the same in the US and I wonder if Suzanne was aware of it, but
a lot of things in the album (bossa-nova, things from the 40s, 50s and 60s
(like she says), plus the artwork (that I have now checked on the web)) are
really close to this easy-listening fashion.

<p>
Well I think this must be me. Oops! <br>
Believe it or not, I intended to apologize today because yesterday evening I
caught the meaning of the song (at least one meaning that suits me, even if
it's not the real one). I don't think shes even speaking of the real
Columbus, I think that Ruby (or Mitchell, I don't know) is her own little
Columbus and that her body is the land... they made it round. One thing I
don't quite grasp in the song is the line 'that's the day I lose half my
sight', does it mean that she lost all perspective because Ruby's the
biggest love she ever felt? that would explain why 
the song is so sentimental. And is it connected with the apple on the cover?
because it actually hides half her sight. 
Anyway, I'm very sorry, sometimes I just shoot straight from the hip. 
But hey, maybe that has helped her to see that some people might
misunderstand the song and find it offensive, and so she can avoid critics
better. 
<p>
Sorry again, <br>
David.

<p>
There's a more mundane answer.  In one of the recent interviews
(I think it may be the MPN one), she mentions how her cat scratched
her eye and she had to wear a patch for a while.
<p>
As ever though, it's only one of the possible interpretations... :)

Subj:	In-stores and World Before Columbus<br>

Hi gang --
<p>
Sorry it has been a while since I posted but as you might imagine, I've been
busy.  It's been fun meeting some of you on this radio and in-store promo
tour I'm doing -- I like connecting faces to the names I see so often!
<p>
There were a couple of things I wanted to clarify -- someone posted recently
complaining about the imagery of World Before Columbus, saying there were
other explorers before Columbus who proved the world was round, and that the
line "cruel as the  world before Columbus" was one that my Puerto-Rican
stepfather wouldn't have liked, implying, I guess that I was talking about
the cruelty of Native Americans? or indiginous people in general?
<p>
Normally I let criticisms go, but this one offends me because it is not what
I mean, not how I was raised, and not what I believe.  To me, the main image
of this song is that of the world being flat if this person's love were taken
away.  Nowhere do I mention Indians.  A flat world (surrounded by demons)
that one could fall off and never get back to is my idea of a cruel world.
 Similarly, when I say the world could be as "dark as the world before
Columbus" I am NOT talking about Africa, savages or anything like that,
implying that Columbus somehow civilized the world and made it bearable.
<p>
I am only referring to the one belief -- that the world was flat.   That's
all.  As for the other explorers you mentioned -- their names don't sing as
well.  I guess the choruses are clear enough.  Most of the time I don't mind
interpretations, but I found this one offensive.
<p>
I also wanted to answer Charlie's question of a month or two ago -- before he
shelled out the money for the new album he wanted my position on gay rights,
marriage, adoption, the whole shebang.  For the record, I think gay people
should have the right to marry, with all the privileges of marriage -- no, I
don't think it tears at the moral fiber of society, (as someone suggested); I
think quite the opposite.  But I don't think you should buy the album because
of  my political beliefs!  I am not running for office.  But since you wanted
my position -- there it is.
<p>
I enjoyed the live chat the other night!   I'll see you soon!  It's been an
exciting week.  Thanks to everyone --
<p>
love,<br>
Suzanne

You know I felt really bad that I had misunderstood 'World Before Columbus'
but today I talked to a friend who doesn't like Suzanne (but who doesn't
dislike her neither). I hadn't told her about the story but she told me she
had heard the song on the CD from Les Inrockuptibles and she (who
understands little English) and her friend (who is bilingual) had been very
shocked by it and she asked me if Suzanne were racist. I explained her the
whole story and now she knows. But what about all the other people who will
hear the song and who won't read the lyrics carefully? I think this song is
really great but Suzanne might (unfairly) be in big trouble with it. I'm
afraid she might now feel like she has to justify herself when she performs
the song, because Columbus represents evil for Native North Americans and
also a lot of the South Americans. 
Can anyone in South America confirm this? Anyway, like I said that's no
longer what *I* think of the song.

Hi All,
<p>
It is so interesting to me this whole controversy about "World Before
Columbus" as it is probably my favorite song on the album.  I've been
making my friends who are mothers listen to it--especially if they have a
daughter.  I cry every time I hear it and only because I see A Mother
telling her Daughter these deep emotions that she feels about her child.
I haven't really thought about the Native American issue and all that
because it just seemed to me that the Mother's position is that somehow
her life became round and formed since the birth of her child and if
something were to happen, she would go to a place that is flat and cold
and bleak.
<p>
I hope when people hear this song they hear the love the mother has for
the child and that's the focus.  One mother who listened to it was a
little shocked at the line:  "If your life was taken from me"  She said,
"Girl, you don't even think about that."--to the CD player--I think she
was talking to Suzanne.  But this line never surprised me coming from
Suzanne as she seems to be one to think about these things and express
these thoughts that a lot of people might have but refuse to acknowledge.
I think she confronts this possibility.
<p>
Yes, this is my favorite song and I don't read as much of an historical
slant as some others might be reading.  I read a very deep and persnal
emotional slant to the song--one that is really beautiful and touching.
<p>
Wendy!

Well she obviously feels very strongly about the meaning and about what WE
feel the song means. (I mean nobody wants to be called a RACIST after all) I
say for myself that I never got a racist interpritation from hearing the
song and still don't. Also, to say that Columbus represents evil may be true
in terms of Native American feeling, but it isn't true in reality. Does
anyone remember the song- "Christopher Columbus, sailed across the ocean, in
fourteen hundred and ninety two. Christopher Columbus, sailed across the
ocean, to find a better life for me and you." Whethter that means a better
life for Native Americans or immigrants the song doesn't say. The point is,
CC's travels were not designed to create genocide. CC had no "Prime
Directive" like on Star Trek. And just because CC isn't "politicaly correct"
these days doesn't allow people to become stupid. I think the whole topic is
disgusting. So far, the argument I've heard is- "Christopher Columbus is
given credit for discovering the world wasn't flat. Suzanne Vega wrote a
song about "The world before" such a discovery. But SOME people think CC was
an evil guy who went around the world enslaving it's innocent cultures.
Therefore, SV is a racist and a Nazi for mentioning such a person in her
song." I have a question for those who hate Columbus- What would you do if
you were in his place? NOT discover the New World? NOT try to find a better
way to India and help your country's economy? Give me a break...

<p>
Yeah -- wasn't that by the Animals? :) (Well, I'm sure CC had the same
senitiment, at least.)
<p>
I've found this whole issue pretty interesting so far.  I, for one,
*haven't* had the opportunity to listen to the song firsthand (didn't want
to spoil the surprise by reading the lyrics or listening to small
pre-release bits -- but my "NOOD" CD is "in the mail" at this very moment!)
so I haven't decided whether it could be that easily misinterpreted. I can't
help wondering, though, if Suzanne has had any second thoughts about the
title...
<p>
IMHIPSTO, confusion as to the meaning of this song could actually be a
positive thing. One or more organizations interpret this as an affront to
Native Americans (North, South or Central) and begins a "Boycott Suzanne
Vega" campaign. The national/international media picks up the story.
Curiosity seekers buy her CD. Over the next few days, as CNN broadcasts
images of the same organizations burning piles of newly-purchased SV CD's,
Suzanne is interviewed extensively, and viewers are won over by her
perfectly rational explanation. More of them run out to buy her new CD,
then, liking what they hear, pick up her older material. Offended
organizations, having now made their point regarding their feelings
concerning C.C., make public peace with Suzanne (while not admitting they
were mistaken regarding the meaning of the song) and go home (playing NOOD
in the car on the way). The world has been enlightened as to the importance
of political sensitivity, and Suzanne has received more publicity than A&M
has given her in her entire career. NOOD wins a few Grammys, which Suzanne
and Mitchell dedicate to Ruby in their "thank you" speeches. World peace is
declared...
<p>
Well, that's one scenario, at least :)

Alas, from only hearing the title, I assumed "World before Columbus" was
talking about the pre-columbian world literally. I have not heard the song yet,
so I think I qualify as a typical experimental subject.
<p>
I think that as late as the 1960's, many people indeed would have closely
associated Columbus and the world's (european world of course) idea of the
shape of the world. But he is now more often associated with adventurism and
imperialism - all that PC stuff. 
<p>
So it's a good thing Suzanne has got some explaining practice in!
<p>
But it sure is cool getting email from SV at work. The world after listervs...

Of course, as a parent, I know that this fear forms the very pit of one's fears.
Of course you think about it, have nightmares about it, obsess about it. And
that's from a father! It's obviously moreso for birth mothers. And the life of a
celibrity makes parenthood that much more touchy. Consider Eric Clapton &
"Tears in Heaven".
<p>
So it's a pretty brave thing to sing. I always wonder how Clapton deals with
singing Tears in Heaven, not to mention hearing it on the radio.

Hi Undertowers!
<P>
Oh me, I never post here.  It's so bad of me.  But last night I finally got
out of my house -- the only time I've left in the past week is to go to
school!  yikes! -- for dinner with a friend, and after, since I had leftover
money, we ran across the street to Barnes and Noble.  My original plan was to
buy Weetzie Bat, by Francesca Lia Block, but when they didn't have it, I
decided to tease myself by looking at NOOD, even though I knew that I
wouldn't be able to afford the $15 they'd charge for it.  So I wandered to
the music section, looked at the front table, and GASP!  There was Suzanne
with her redder-than-before hair and apple for only $11.99!!  Much
excitement...I found myself talking to her on the cover of the album.  (Yes,
I'm an idiot, but I'm also the girl who says hello and goodbye to the Tori
Amos poster in the music store down the street  :) .)  So of course I bought
it and herded my friend out of the store and home as fast as I could so I
could *finally* listen to the album and read all of the letters I had from
the list!  (I didn't let myself read anything about NOOD because I didn't
want to spoil the surprise.... Great idea, unless you've *got* to read the
posts so you can get them organized and converted to HTML for the web page.
 We all know that *I'll* be doing today... ::grin::)
<P>
First impressions -- I *love* World Before Columbus.  Wendy!, I love the way
you described the song.  Listening to it reminds me of when I was very small,
and at night my parents would come in and sit on my bed, and the hall light
would be on to give some light to my room, and my dad would bring his guitar
in and sing Peter Paul & Mary and Pete Seeger and Weaver's songs to put me
to sleep.  
<P>
No Cheap Thrill is another favorite...it makes me want to dance in my chair
and conduct like I do with some of my favorite Tori songs.  The only problem
with this is that the chair is broken and makes squeaking noises that
interfere with the song.  Oh well... :)
<P>
I like the first four songs (I'm too lazy to type them out, but you know who
they are :) a lot, too.  This is just a great album.  I doesn't give me the
feeling that Solitude Standing did when I first got it, though...it's more of
a Days Of Open Hand feeling for me.  This is a good thing, of course...I
*loved* DOOH when I got it.  
<P>
I suppose I'll go back to my little corner now... <BR>
Goodbye friends.  <BR>
Jen.<BR>

(b) Suzanne won't be gracing Texas with her wondrous presence.  Hello
