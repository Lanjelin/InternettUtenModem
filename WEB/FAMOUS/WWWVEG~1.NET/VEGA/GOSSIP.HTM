GREAT NEWS!  
<p> 
Hello, I've been lurking on this list for a few months, and am writing for
the first time.  I live in  New York City, and happened to see them walking
arm-in-arm on Spring Street and West Broadway in Soho during December or
January.  They looked tremendously happy.  (I must confess that I
recognized Mitchell Froom first, since Suzanne was wearing a long coat,
large hat and sunglasses. No, I didn't say anything -- this is New York,
and that wouldn't be cool -- just smiled and nodded.)  Suzanne and
Mitchell, if you're reading this, all the best from a fan of both of you! 
<p> 
 
Now for my two cents about the other recent topics of conversation:   
If you get a chance, see both Christine Lavin and Shawn Colvin in concert. 
The concerts are very different experiences, but both are best when "solo
acoustic".  One of Christine's best is "Good Thing He Can't Read My Mind",
which is spot-on about the dating game.  As for Shawn, I think the first
album "Steady On" is the strongest so far, with the least intrusive
production. 
<p> 
You folks have done an amazing job with the WWW site.  One question, though
-- how do you play the sound bites?

        And I. On behalf of the population of Australia, I'd like to send
the warmest congratulations to Mitchell and Suzanne!
