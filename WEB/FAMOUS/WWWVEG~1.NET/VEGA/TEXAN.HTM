Many listeners took Suzanne Vega's new single "Luka," with its quick tempo
and energetic rhythms, as sort of a message to the public:  the singer was
proclaiming her desire for wider commercial success.
<p>
With the soft acoustic melodies on her first album, which underlined the
singer's whispery vocals, the New York City native was heralded as the
new queen folkie, occasionally receiving a "female Bob Dylan" tag.
<p>
Yet as the singer-songwriter explains, the harder, more percussive sound
of her new most recent album, <b>Solitude Standing</b>, was actually what she
wanted all along.
<p>
"I never intended the first album to be as soft and sort of Windham-Hilly
as it came out," Vega explained in a recent interview.  "I had wanted the
music to match the intensity of the lyrics.  And I remember listening to it
going, 'Well, that's not what I really meant at all.'
<p>
"I was very depressed about it for about a couple of months.  And I thought, 
'Well, I'm just going to have to work harder on the next album to get the
music lined up more with the lyrics,'" she continued.  "I realized what I
thought had a harder edge was not hard-edged in the real world - because 
you've got punk, disco and all this stuff assaulting people's senses."
<p>
Vega will be bringing her newfound sound to the Austin Opera House this
Tuesday, where she will be performing on part of a 1987 World Tour.  
Although most Austin radio listeners are familiar with the more hard-driving
"Luka," the material on Vega's new record reflects a diversity of creative
ideas and influences, a result of the singer's wide musical background.
<p>
Exposed to blues musicians and Brazilian jazz artists like Joao Gilberto
through her parents, the singer turned her listening tastes to Bob Dylan
and Simon and Garfunkel, and eventually she became hooked on folk star
Leonard Cohen.  It was not until she had reached college, however, that 
Vega started paying serious attention to more street-conscious music.
<p>
"I went to my first rock 'n' roll concert when I was 19; I went to see
Lou Reed," Vega said.  "That was really interesting.  This was 1979, when
he had sort of a lower profile.  It was a really influential concert; I
started listening to his records right after that."
<p>
Although she was once actively involved in the Greenwich Village folk 
community in Manhattan, hanging out at clubs like Folk City and Speakeasy,
the young performer now seems to have mixed feelings about being considered
a traditional folk artist.  While Vega is concerned with the roots of her
music, she is also very interested in modern sounds:  "I want to take what
I like about folk music and make it contemporary."
<p>
But to many listeners, "contemporary" folk music means the acoustic artists
of the early and mid-1970s, much of which has been relegated to the light
rock or "easy listening" radio stations.  Consequently, Vega has often been
compared to such singers as James Taylor, Carly Simon and, most frequently,
Joni Mitchell.
<p>
"That's slightly annoying to me because everyone is always going to say 
that I sound like Joni Mitchell," said Vega.  "Certainly no girl with a
guitar in the '70s couldn't helped but be influenced by Joni Mitchell...
I don't think she gets as much credit as she deserves.  But there's the
implication that you don't have any of your own originality.
<p>
"Because I grew up in New York City in kind of hectic circumstances and 
bad neighborhoods, I felt my daily life was always a struggle," she
continued.  "I think for a while I was listening to a pastoral kind of
music in an effort to get back to a purer time or something.
<p>
"Then when I saw the Lou Reed concert, it really struck me that suddenly
there was an urgency to write about the world as it was, and as I
experienced it, instead of in an idealized form," Vega said.
<p>
The lyrical content of much of the material on Solitude Standing reflects
Vega's attempts to sing about more than just sunrises and golden dewdrops.
"Luka" is the story of a battered female, age unknown, who refuses to
discuss her experiences; "Solitude Standing," the title cut, speaks of
a metaphorical death figure who awaits the singer.
<p>
Despite the critical praise that she has received for her lyrics, and the
flattering comparisons to the songs of Bob Dylan, Vega emphasizes that
she is a songwriter, not a poet.
<p>
"I never work on lyrics without the music because they go hand in hand with
me.  I wouldn't say I'm a good poet because I write lyrics.  They're
conscious as lyrics - they are meant to be sung, they are not meant to be
spoken out loud," she said.  "I'm very conscious of the ways the consonants
and the vowels fit together and the way they'll read when I sing them."
<p>
Vega has been on the road for three months, mainly in the United States, 
but also playing a few dates in Europe "to let people know the album is
out."   After the stateside dates are up, she is scheduled to return to
Europe for more extensive coverage.
<p>
"I'm a litle more confident now playing on stage.  But I feel like I still
have a lot more 'theatricality' that doesn't know how to come out yet,"
she said.  "I find that it's one thing to watch MTV and see what other
people do on stage, but I can't run around on stage because I've seen
Patti Smythe do it.  That's not my way of being expressive."
<p>
"I never try to make my music deliberately obscure - I always try to make
it as simple and clear as possible.  My aim is to talk to people."
