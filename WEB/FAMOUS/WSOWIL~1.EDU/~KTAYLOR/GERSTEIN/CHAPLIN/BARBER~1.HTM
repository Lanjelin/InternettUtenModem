<h1>Charlie the Barber Addresses Ptomania</h1>		
<i>By Charlie Chaplin.  Spoken in </i>The Great Dictator<i> (1940).</i><p>
	I'm sorry, but I don't want to be emperor.  I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.  I should like to help everyone, if possible -- Jew, Gentile -- black men -- white . . . <p>
	The way of life can be beautiful, but we have lost the way.  Greed has poisoned men's souls -- has barricaded the world with hate -- has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.  We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.  Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.  Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind.  We think too much and feel too little.  More than machinery we need humanity.  More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.  Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.<p>
We are coming out of the darkness into the light!  We are coming into a new world!  Look up, Hannah!  The soul of man has been given wings and at last he is beginning to fly.  He is flying into the rainbow -- into the light of hope.  Look up, Hannah!  Look up!<p>
