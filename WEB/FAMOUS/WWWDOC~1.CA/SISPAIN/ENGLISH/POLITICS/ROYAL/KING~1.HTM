<P>
   JUAN CARLOS DE BORBON Y BORBON    was   born    on   
January 5th, 1938 in Rome, where the  Royal Family was living 
at that time, having had to leave Spain when the Republic was 
proclaimed  in  1931.  His  father,  Don  Juan  de  Borbon  y  
Battenberg, Count of Barcelona and Head  of the Spanish Royal 
Household ever since King Alfonso  XIII had relinquished this 
status, and his mother, Dona Maria de las Mercedes de Borbon y 
Orleans.

<P>
   At    the   express    wish of  his    father,   he    was   
educated in Spain, which he visited for the first time at the 
age of ten. In 1954 he completed his Baccalaureate at the San 
Isidro School in Madrid, and in 1955 began his studies at the 
Academies and Military Colleges of the Army, the Navy and the 
Air Force. During this time he carried out his practice voyage 
as a midshipman on the training ship Juan Sebastian Elcano and 
qualified as a  military pilot.  In 1960.61 he  completed his  
education at Madrid's Complutense University, where he studied 
constitutional and international law, economics and taxation.

<P>
  On   May   14th,   1962,   he  married Princess  Sofia   of   
Greece, the eldest daugther of King Paul I and Queen Federika, 
in Athens. After their honeymoon, the Prince and Princess went 
to live at the  Palacio de la  Zarzuela, on the  outskirts of 
Madrid, which is still their residence. In  1963 the first of 
their three children, Princess Elena, was born, followed, two 
years later, by  Princess Cristina  and finally, in  1968, by  
Prince Felipe.

<P>
   After  his   designation   as   future   succesor to   the   
Head of State in  1969, he embarked  on a series  of official 
activities, touring Spain and visiting many foreign countries, 
including France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United 
States, Japan, China and India.

<P>
   On   the death   of   the   previous    Head   of   State,    
Francisco Franco, Juan Carlos was proclaimed King on November 
22nd, 1975. In his  first message to the  nation he expressed 
the basic ideas of his reign, to restore democracy and become 
King of all Spaniards, without exception.

<P>
   The   transition to  democracy,    under   the    guidance   
of a new Government, began with the  Law on Politicial Reform 
in 1976. In May  1977, the Count of  Barcelona trasnferred to 
the King his dinasty rights  and his position as  head of the 
Spanish Royal Household,  at a  ceremony which  confirmed the  
fulfilment of the role incumbent on the Crown on the Crown in 
the  restoration  of  democracy.  A  month  later  the  first  
democratic election sice 1936 was held and the new parliament 
drafted the text of  the current Constitution,  approved in a 
referendum on December 6th, 1978.

<P>
    The    Constitution establishes   as    the    form    of    
government of  the  Spanish  State  that of  a  parliamentary  
monarchy, in which the King is the arbiter and overseer of the 
proper working of the institutions. By giving the royal assent 
to this Constitution,  King Juan Carlos  expressly proclaimed 
his firm intention to abide  by it and serve it.  In fact, it 
was the actions of the Monarch that saved the Constitution and 
democracy during the night  of February 23rd.  1981, when the 
constitutional powers  had been  retained  in the  Parliament  
building in an attempted coup.

<P>
  In   the   course   of   18   years  the   King   has   toured   
Europe, Latin America, the United States and Canada, the Arab 
countries, Israel,  China, Japan,  Indonesia,  Australia, New  
Zealand and  many  countries in  black  Africa.  He has  also  
addressed  many   international  organizations:   the  United   
Nations, the institutions of the  European Union, the Council 
of Europe, the Organization  of American States,  UNESCO, the 
International Labour Organization and the Arab League.

<P>
    The    King     has    encouraged    a     new    style    in     
conducting relations  with  Latin  America,  emphasizing  the  
identifying features of a cultural community based on a common 
language, and  pointing  out  the  need  to  generate  common  
initiatives and take  part in  suitable kinds  of cooperative  
activity.  The  countries  of  that  area  have  shown  great  
generosity in  agreeing on  the  need to  create a  permanent  
framework capable of  expressing this new  situation, setting 
objectives and  organizing programmes  and specific  lines of  
action. This  is  the  rationale  behind the  Latin  American  
Conferences, the  first  of which  was  held in  Guadalajara,  
Mexico, in 1991.

<P>
   As   a   convinced   European,    and   a   winner   of   the    
Charlemagne Award  in 1982,  Juan  Carlos delivers  insistent  
reminders of Spain s European calling throughout its history. 
The importance of the European union in the contemporary world 
and in particular  in the  areas which are  most akin  to it, 
including Latin America, has been stressed by the King in many 
messages, such  as the  one he  gave at  the French  National  
Assembly in 1993.

<P>
   King    Juan    Carlos,    who   pays    constant    attention    
to the world of intellectual developments and its capacity for 
innovation, has a special relationship with universities, both 
in Spain  and abroad,  where he  has had  conferred upon  him  
honorary doctorates by  the most renowned  centers, including 
the Universities of  Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge  and Harvard, 
amongst many others.  He is also  an associate member  of the 
Institut de France and the American Philosophical Society. As 
honorary  chairman  of   COTEC,  a  Spanish   Foundation  for  
technological innovation, King Juan Carlos gives his personal 
support to this fundamental activity on  the threshold of the 
21st century.

<P>
  He   also   pays   special   attention  to   the   future   of   
the Spanish language, the heritage of the community of Spanish 
speakers. The  King is  honorary  president of  the Board  of  
Trustees of the Cervantes Institute, which is dedicated to the 
dissemination of  the  Spanish  language  worldwide, and  the  
Foundation in support of the Royal Accademy, to whose setting 
up in 1993 he contributed out of his own personal patrimony.

<P>
  As   a   keen   practitioner    of   several   sports,   such    
as skiing and sailing,  Juan Carlos supports  and appreciates 
sport as a formative influence of unquestionable social value. 
The presence of the King and Queen and their encouragement of 
the Spanish Olympic  teams during  the Games in  Barcelona in  
1993 attest to the  importance which Juan  Carlos attaches to 
this activity.
