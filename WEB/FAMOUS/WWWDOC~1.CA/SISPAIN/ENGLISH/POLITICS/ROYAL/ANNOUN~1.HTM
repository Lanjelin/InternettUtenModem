<CENTER><H2>Official Announcement of the Wedding of the Infanta Elena and Jaime De Marichalar.</H2></CENTER>
<P>
On Wednesday, 23rd November, the King's Household issued a communique
announcing the engagement of Her Royal Highness the Infanta Elena to
Jaime de Marichalar Saenz de Tejada. The announcement came as a surprise
to many people, since the couple had conducted their relationship with
the greatest discretion.

<P>
The formal request for Infanta Elena's hand in marriage was made on the
following Saturday, the 26th, in the presence of both families. During
the ceremony, which went off in an atmosphere of cordiality and good
humour, the couple went out to meet the photographers and journalists
who were waiting in the Palace gardens, and talked to them.

<P>
A few dyas later, another communique from the Royal Household set the
time and place for what is to be the wedding of the year 1995. Infanta
Elena and Jaime de Marichalar will be married in Seville on March 18th.

<P>
Infanta Elena, the eldest daughter of the King and Queen of Spain, is
second in the line of succession to the throne, after her brother
Prince Felipe. The bridegroom is the fourth son of Amalio de Marichalar,
Count of Ripalda, and Concepcion Saenz de Tejada. Infanta Elena and
Jaime de Marichalar are the same age, 31, and first met in Paris in
1987, where he works as an economist.

<P>
The engagement confirms the wish expressed by King Juan Carlos and Queen
Sofia that their children should marry the persons they themselves
choose, and that they should not be necessarily members of other royal
families.
