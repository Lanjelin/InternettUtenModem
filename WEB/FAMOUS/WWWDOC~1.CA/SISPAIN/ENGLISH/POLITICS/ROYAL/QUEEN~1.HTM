<P>
   Dona   SOFIA  DE GRECIA   Y   HANNOVER    was   born   in    
Athens on November 2nd, 1938. She was the first born daugther 
of the King  and Queen  of Greece, Paul  I and  Federika. Her 
family belongs to one of the oldest Royal Houses in Europe and 
is related to  the Czars of  Russia, the German  Emperors and 
Queen Victoria of Great Britain.

<P>
   She   spent part  of    her   childhood   in   Egypt   and    
South Africa,  as her  family was  obliged to  go into  exile  
during the Second World  War. She returned to  her country in 
1946, completed  her  education  at  the  prestigious  German  
boarding school  of Schloss  Salem, and,  having  returned to  
Athens, specialized in paediatrics, music and archaelogy. She 
took part as a reserve for the Greek sailing team in the 1960 
Olympic Games in Rome.

<P>
  On   May   14th 1962   she  married   Prince   Juan   Carlos   
de Borbon y Borbon, and in subsequent years her three children 
were born: Infanta  Elena on  December 20th,  1963, Infanta  
Cristina on  June 13th,  1965, and  Prince Felipe  on January  
30th, 1968.

<P>
    In addition   to    taking    part    in    institutional    
events, the Queen devotes a great deal of attention to social 
and charity activities. She is the executive president of the 
Queen Sofia Foundation, which in 1993 has sent the major part 
of its funds  to help Bosnia,  and honorary president  of the 
Royal Board on Education and Care of Handicapped Persons, and 
the Foundation for  Aid for  Drug Addicts. She  takes special  
interest in this  latter problem,  taking part  personally in  
conferences and  meetings on  the subject  both in  Spain and  
abroad.

<P>
    Her     help for     the    underprivileged     is     not     
confined to resolving specific situations, but also extends to 
progress  in  the  field  of   research  and  to  encouraging  
initiatives and  cooperation agreements  designed  to prevent  
them from arising or to palliate their effects.

<P>
   With   regards   to   culture,   Queen   Sofia's  fondness   
for music is well known.  The Queen is an  honorary member of 
the San Fernando Academy of Fine Arts,  and holds an honorary 
doctorate from the University of Valladolid and, together with 
the King, from Cambridge.
