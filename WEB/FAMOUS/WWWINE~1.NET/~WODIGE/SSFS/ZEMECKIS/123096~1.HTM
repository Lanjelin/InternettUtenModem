<H2>Coppola sues over Sagan's <A HREF="CONTAC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/zemeckis/contact.html">'Contact'</A> contract</H2>

Director Francis Ford Coppola's company has accused the late Carl Sagan
and Warner Bros. of breaking a contract over the upcoming movie &quot;<A
HREF="CONTAC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/zemeckis/contact.html">Contact</A>.&quot; The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles
Friday, asks that the movie production be stopped because, 20 years ago,
Sagan had agreed to work with Coppola on a TV series based on the astronomer's
1985 book, &quot;Contact.&quot; The suit alleges that Sagan later entered
into a contract with Warner Bros. for the film. Sagan, a noted scientist
who put astronomy into layman's terms, died Dec. 20. The plaintiff's lawyer,
Robert Chapman, said Coppola and Sagan had agreed to share profits and any
other projects related to &quot;Contact.&quot; But Sagan went ahead with
the Warner Bros. project without Coppola, Chapman said. (AP)<BR>
