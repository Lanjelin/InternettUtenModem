<H3>Kaplan wooed for Chung strip</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>DreamWorks SKG has entered the sweepstakes for veteran ABC News producer
Rick Kaplan. Sources said Tuesday that Kaplan is in talks with the company
about becoming the executive producer of the new syndicated program starring
Connie Chung and Maury Povich. Kaplan, who is now executive producer, special
projects for ABC, is also in negotiations with CNN about taking a senior
programming position. He is weighing both offers as he is expected to leave
ABC after a 17-year career at the network. &quot;The only thing that would
be surprise me is if he stayed at ABC,&quot; a network insider said. Kaplan
is largely credited with creating ABC's &quot;Nightline,&quot; which he
produced for five years. (Stephen Battaglio)</P>
