Begin Principal Photography in April</H3>

<P><I>From a ClariNet Electronic News Service Report dated January 10, 1997:</I></P>

<P>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Jan. 10, 1997-- Production
will begin April 21 on the Richard Zanuck/David Brown production, &quot;Deep
Impact,&quot; (Tenative Title), a sci-fi thriller to be directed by Emmy
Award-winning director Mimi Leder.</P>

<P>Steven Spielberg is the executive producer.  &quot;Deep Impact&quot;
will be co-financed and distributed by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks
SKG and marks the second co-venture between the two studios, who are also
co-producing the Spielberg film &quot;<A HREF="../SPIELB~1/SAVING~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/savingpr.html">Saving
Private Ryan</A>.&quot;</P>

<P>Most recently, Leder directed the DreamWorks SKG feature, &quot;<A HREF=
"PEACEM~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/dreamworks/peacemaker.html">The Peacemaker</A>,&quot; starring George Clooney and
Nicole Kidman, which will be released in the fall of 1997.  For &quot;Deep
Impact,&quot; Leder will be reunited with several members of the &quot;Peacemaker&quot;
production team, including cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann, production
designer Les Dilley and composer Hans Zimmer.</P>

<P>States Dream Works SKG motion picture chief Walter Parkes, &quot;'Deep
Impact' is an extraordinary story, and a challenging one in its blend of
action, emotion and special effects.  After seeing Mimi's first cut on 'Peacemaker,'
we knew she had the unique gifts to bring this story to the screen.&quot;</P>

<P>Sherry Lansing, chairman of Paramount Pictures' Motion Picture Group
said, &quot;I am delighted that we will be working with Mimi, Richard, David,
Steven and the wonderful team at DreamWorks.  We first announced this project
in 1994, and now all the elements are coming together for the creation of
a truly thrilling film experience.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Deep Impact&quot; also marks a reunion for executive producer Steven
Spielberg and the producing team of David Brown and Richard Zanuck, who
gave the director two of his early assignments:  the 1974 critically acclaimed
feature &quot;Sugarland Express,&quot; and the 1975 box-office smash, &quot;Jaws.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I am very happy to be working with David and Richard again,&quot;
said Spielberg.  &quot;It took 20 years, but here we are... beginning a
movie that we hope will be a great roller coaster ride for audiences all
over the world.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We are proud of our history with Steven Spielberg and thrilled
to be collaborating with him again,&quot; said Richard Zanuck.  Adds David
Brown, &quot;Richard and I are also very happy to be working with Mimi,
whose first feature film, 'Peacemaker,' reaffirmed what we already knew
from her television work -- that she is a director of rare talent.&quot;</P>

<P>Written by Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin and inspired by the classic
&quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; and Arthur C. Clarke's book &quot;The Hammer
of God,&quot; &quot;Deep Impact&quot; is a contemporary action thriller
that follows three characters through the chaos that ensues when a group
of scientists discover that a comet is on a deadly collision course with
Earth.</P>

<P>Leder made her feature directing debut on &quot;The Peacemaker,&quot;
following a long and successful career in television.  In 1995, she was
honored with an Emmy for her direction of the episode &quot;Loves Labor
Lost&quot; of the top-rated NBC series, &quot;ER.&quot;  She began her directing
career with an episode of &quot;L.A. Law,&quot; before moving on to other
award-winning series, including &quot;China Beach,&quot; for which she received
two Emmy nominations for directing.  For her work on &quot;ER,&quot; she
has also been nominated twice by the Directors Guild of America for Best
Direction of a dramatic series episode.</P>

<P>The Zanuck/Brown team has distinguished themselves as one of Hollywood's
most prolific and prestigious production entities.  In addition to their
early projects by Spielberg, a partial list of credits include &quot;The
Sting,&quot; &quot;The Verdict,&quot; &quot;Cocoon,&quot; &quot;Cocoon:
 The Return,&quot; &quot;Driving Miss Daisy,&quot; &quot;Rush&quot; and
&quot;Mulholland Falls.&quot;</P>

1994 by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.</P>
