<P>NEW YORK -- Looking beyond just a movie production, DreamWorks SKG paid
several million dollars for the film rights to the nail-biting Shirley Jackson
story, <A HREF="HAUNTI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/dreamworks/haunting.html">&quot;The Haunting of Hill House.&quot;</A>
Following the mega-success of Universal's &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and
the high hopes for its sequel, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park,&quot;
Steven Spielberg -- director of those films and a DreamWorks partner --
decided to put Computer Generated Imagery and marketing savvy to work for
his own company. And quickly. The movie is already to skedded for a possible
June production date. The movie centers on a haunted house and features
a substantial number of supernatural occurrences that, in a '90s remake
of 1963's &quot;The Haunting,&quot; should lend themselves perfectly to
the special effects that CGI now makes possible. (Joseph Steuer)</P>
