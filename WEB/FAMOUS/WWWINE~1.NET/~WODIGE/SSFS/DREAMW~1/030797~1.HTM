<P>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--March 5, 1997-- Principal

fortune. The brothers are all set to fix up the house and cash in when they
discover that there's someone else on the property who isn't so eager to
sell: the world's smartest and meanest mouse who has no intention of relocating
without a fight.</P>

<P>&quot;We're very excited about `Mouse Hunt,'&quot; stated DreamWorks
feature executive Jason Hoffs. &quot;It's a high-energy comedy with two
terrific actors, Nathan Lane and Lee Evans, and a wonderful director, Gore
Verbinski. We can't wait for audiences to see it. It should be a lot of
fun for everyone.&quot;</P>
