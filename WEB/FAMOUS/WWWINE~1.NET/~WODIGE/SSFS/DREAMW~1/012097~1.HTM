<H3>Bonnie Lee signs deal with DreamWorks</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>Much-courted former Geffen Pictures executive Bonnie Lee disappeared
from these pages shortly after the Geffen division merged into DreamWorks
SKG. But now she's back. Sources say DreamWorks is soon to announce that
Lee, who was wildly courted by Warner Bros. as well as the Steven Spielberg-David
Geffen-Jeffrey Katzenberg organization, is about to announce that she's
signed a producer deal with the studio. Among the projects she is already
developing there is &quot;<A HREF="DEPUTY~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/dreamworks/deputy.html">The Deputy</A>,&quot; based
on a script by Kevin Quinn (who also wrote Universal's upcoming &quot;Shadow
of Death&quot;). The picture, set in the Southwest, centers on a simple,
noble sheriff's deputy who is assigned to protect a mobster in the witness
protection program, then begins to form a complicated relationship with
the man's wife. Lee, DreamWorks and Quinn's agent, Jim Stein of Writers
&amp; Artists, declined to comment.</P>
