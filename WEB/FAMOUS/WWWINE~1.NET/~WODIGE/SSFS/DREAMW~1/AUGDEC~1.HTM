<H3>DreamWorks studio may be back on track</H3>

<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I><BR>
<BR>
A DreamWorks SKG official said that things appear to be back on track at
Playa Vista, the troubled real estate development that is to serve as the
studio's first permanent home. DreamWorks has been vocal in recent months
about its belief that Maguire Thomas was allowing the Playa Vista project
to fall apart by inflexibility on certain financial issues. But Montgomery
said a recent move to give former Maguire Thomas executive James Thomas
control of the project instead of Maguire Thomas head Rob Thomas has spurred
progress on securing $150 million in first-phase financing. DreamWorks recently
held high-level talks with officials of Westinghouse Electric Corp. about
selling its CBS facilities in Studio City, which CBS nixed, although a source
close to the talks suggests it might be possible to negotiate a partial
sale of the facility to DreamWorks, with Westinghouse holding a continuing
stake. (Carl DiOrio)</P>

<BR>
Scott Hicks, the Australian director of &quot;Shine,&quot; is now attached
to two major Hollywood film projects: &quot;<A HREF="ARKANS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/dreamworks/arkansas.html">Arkansas</A>&quot;
at DreamWorks SKG and &quot;The Secret History&quot; at Warner Bros. The
most recent of the two projects, &quot;Arkansas&quot; concerns a sharecropper
with a heart of stone who adopts 25 orphans to work on his land. Brad Pitt
has long expressed interest in the material. A spokeswoman for DreamWorks
said no agreement has been reached with Hicks, but other sources said he
will be involved. &quot;The Secret History,&quot; which Raphael Yglesias
(&quot;Fearless&quot;) is now set to pen, is based on Donna Tartt's novel.
It concerns a secret society at a private Eastern college that tries to
cover up a death that takes place during one of its ceremonies. (Kirk Honeycutt)</P>

<H3>Environmentalists file lawsuit against DreamWorks project</H3>

<P><I>From Reuters/Variety:</I><BR>
<BR>
LOS ANGELES (Reuter) - A group of environmentalists filed a federal lawsuit
Tuesday seeking to block the planned construction of DreamWorks SKG's studio
development project at a site near the Playa del Rey beachfront section
of Los Angeles.<BR>
<BR>
The suit, filed against in U.S. Federal Court in Los Angeles against the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, claimed the agency violated terms of the Clean
Water Act and other federal laws when it approved the developers' provisional
permit to fill, dredge or pave over about 28 wetlands acres of wetlands
to build. DreamWorks was not named in the lawsuit.<BR>
<BR>
The lawsuit covers a small portion of the 1,000 acres set aside for the
Playa Vista project, the name of the development that is expected to house
the DreamWorks headquarters as well as other corporate offices.<BR>
<BR>
The site is situated in the Ballona wetlands north of Los Angeles International
Airport.<BR>
<BR>
The planned DreamWorks studio -- owned by Steven Spielberg, former Walt
Disney Co. executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and music mogul David Geffen --
is not part of the acreage.<BR>
<BR>
But the land will include storm and sewage run-off from DreamWorks, making
the project dependant on it.<BR>
<BR>
The Playa Vista development had been planned for years, but gained strength
in 1995 when the DreamWorks trio, looking to build a studio, signed on.<BR>
<BR>
The Los Angeles City Council gave the project $70 million in tax breaks,
outraging environmentalists who claimed the city was subsidizing millionaires.<BR>
<BR>
The lawsuit is part of a continuing legal battle between environmentalists
seeking to preserve all of the wetlands and developers who say they can
build and still preserve part of wetlands.<BR>
<BR>
Earlier this year, environmentalists lost a state court appeal to stop Playa
Vista, and in October filed an appeal.<BR>
<BR>
The status of the $8 billion project has become questionable following friction
between the developer Maguire Thomas Partners and potential tenants, including
DreamWorks.<BR>
<BR>
Already one tenant, International Business Machines Corp. has decided not
to participate in the project.<BR>
<BR>
A spokeswoman for Maguire Thomas said the developer was confident the court
would rule in its favor and construction would begin in the first half of
next year.<BR>
<BR>
DreamWorks declined to comment.<BR>

<H3>Disney's Rutherford to DreamWorks licensing post</H3>

<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I><BR>
<BR>
Travis Rutherford has joined DreamWorks Consumer Products to oversee licensing
and merchandising. The former Disney director of apparel will report to
Brad Globe, head of DreamWorks' Consumer Products division. In the new post,
Rutherford will develop and implement all licensing programs that stem from
DreamWorks' theatrical and television properties. At Disney, he worked on
all the licensing programs for the studio's feature films including &quot;The
Lion King,&quot; &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; &quot;Cinderella,&quot;
&quot;Pocahontas,&quot; &quot;Toy Story,&quot; &quot;The Hunchback of Notre
Dame,&quot; the live-action &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; and the upcoming
&quot;Hercules.&quot; Before Disney, Rutherford was vp licensing at Logan
James Ltd., a Colorado-based consulting firm that specializes in domestic
and international licensing and brand management.</P>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I><BR>
<BR>
NEW YORK -- DreamWorks SKG has contracted indie writer-director Maria Maggenti
to adapt the Cathleen Schine novel &quot;<A HREF="LOVELE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/dreamworks/loveletter.html">The Love
Letter</A>.&quot; Kate Capshaw is attached to star, and Midge Sanford and
Sarah Pillsbury will produce. Maggenti is best known for writing and directing
the well-received Fine Line film &quot;The Incredibly True Adventures of
Two Girls in Love,&quot; and &quot;The Love Letter&quot; is said to be a
potential directing project for her. DreamWorks said, however, that no director
has been set. &quot;The Love Letter,&quot; which will be published, is a
sophisticated romantic comedy about an older woman and a younger man. Writers
&amp; Artists' Rick Berg repped Maggenti, and DreamWorks' senior production
exec Nina Jacobson is spearheading the project for her company. Neither
could be reached for comment. Sanford and Pillsbury, whose production credits
include &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; and &quot;How to Make an American
Quilt,&quot; have a two-year deal with DreamWorks. (Joseph Steuer)</P>

Sources say that Davola opted to leave after finding that his eclectic style
didn't mesh with the company's more mainstream approach to TV development.
Davola could not be reached for comment at press time. A public relations
exec hired by Davola confirmed his resignation, saying that he and DreamWorks
parted ways amicably. Before joining DreamWorks, Davola spent two years
at MTV networks as senior vp of MTV Prods., where he launched the feature

<H3>DreamWorks Playa Vista studio still an option</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I><BR>
<BR>
DreamWorks SKG insiders Wednesday scorned reports that developer Robert
Maguire has agreed to cede control over the new DreamWorks site in Playa
Vista in an attempt to resolve a personality clash with Jeffrey Katzenberg.
&quot;Robert Maguire is pretending to be noble and step back, but the reality
is that he hasn't given up any control,&quot; said a top DreamWorks source,
contradicting published reports that Maguire's former partner in the Maguire
Thomas development firm, James Thomas, is replacing him as head of the project.
While insiders confirmed DreamWorks has proposed Thomas as a replacement
for Maguire, they said Maguire has done nothing of substance to turn over
reins of the mammoth development that is planned as home to the fledgling
studio. DreamWorks continues to investigate other options to Playa Vista.
Meanwhile, a Maguire Thomas insider said that &quot;to expect Rob Maguire
to completely step away from a project he's lived with for eight years is
unrealistic.&quot; (Carl DiOrio)</P>

<H3>Stan Winston signs deal with DreamWorks</H3>

<P><I>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</I><BR>
<BR>
By Anita M. Busch<BR>
<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - Special effects wizard Stan Winston, who is working
on Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park sequel <A HREF="../SPIELB~1/LOSTWO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/lostworld.html">The
Lost World</A>, has signed a filmmaking deal with DreamWorks.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to producing and directing feature films, he is expected to
get involved in other areas of entertainment at the studio such as the possible
development of an animatronic theme park attraction.<BR>
<BR>
Winston said he has developed a handful of projects over the years and has
about half a dozen under his new company. There is only one set up at a
studio, an untitled horror project at Disney's Touchstone banner.<BR>
<BR>
The special-effects guru has a close association with DreamWorks principal
Spielberg through his work on Jurassic Park and Lost World, for which he
is supervising the design and creation of the live-action dinosaurs. He
also worked with another DreamWorks principal, David Geffen, on Interview
With the Vampire.<BR>
<BR>
Winston has won special effects Oscars for Jurassic Park, Terminator 2:
Judgment Day and Aliens.<BR>
<BR>
``There are about three or four projects in development here that could
be naturals for Stan to get involved with, but we're also looking for him
to come up with his own ideas,'' said Walter Parkes, president of feature
development for DreamWorks.<BR>
<BR>
Winston said he will now actively start seeking projects to acquire. He
noted, ``Fortunately, DreamWorks is a young major so I'm one of a handful
and won't get lost in a slew of other production deals.<BR>
<BR>
``Steven and I have also talked about our mutual love of theme park attractions,''
Winston added. ``I always wanted to create the ultimate animatronic theme
park attraction. We have so many similar interests.''<BR>

<H3>CBS says NO to DreamWorks on Studio City</H3>

<P><CITE>From the Hollywood Reporter:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
CBS Inc. on Thursday issued a terse denial that it is considering the sale
of its landmark production facility on Radford Avenue in Studio City to
DreamWorks SKG. DreamWorks officials refused to confirm or deny that talks
are under way to take over the facility and declined comment on the CBS
statement. However, a well-placed DreamWorks insider continued to insist
that talks have been held in an effort to persuade CBS parent Westinghouse
Electric Corp. to sell the Studio City lot. The Studio City site would serve
as an alternative to DreamWorks' taking space in the troubled Playa Vista
commercial-residential development to be built near Playa del Rey. Other
than some site clearing, work has yet to begin and a planned 1998 completion
for Playa Vista now is considered impossible. &quot;CBS is always interested
in creative business opportunities,&quot; the network said. &quot;But there
is no scenario under which we would sell or give up control of (CBS) Studio
Center.&quot; (Carl DiOrio)<BR>
<BR>
<I>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</I><BR>
<BR>
By Ted Johnson<BR>
<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - CBS officials Thursday denied speculation the company
would sell its production facility in Studio City to DreamWorks, which is
having problems with its planned site in Playa Vista.<BR>
<BR>
Studio Center, the 66-year-old former Republic Pictures lot where John Wayne
began his career, had been mentioned in news reports as an alternative to
the Playa Vista development near Los Angeles International Airport.<BR>
<BR>
The fledgling DreamWorks and the lead developer of Playa Vista, Maguire
Thomas Partners, have been deadlocked over securing additional investors
to get the project moving.<BR>
<BR>
DreamWorks produces Ink on the Studio City lot in the San Fernando Valley,
and has held talks about the leasing of additional soundstage space; however,
there have been doubts as to how viable it would be as an alternative to
the kind of studio DreamWorks envisions in Playa Vista, where more space
is available.<BR>
<BR>
The CBS lot is already crowded with production of shows such as Roseanne
and Seinfeld.<BR>
<BR>
``CBS is always interested in creative business opportunities,'' a CBS statement
said. ``But there is no scenario under which we would sell or give up control
of Studio Center.''<BR>
<BR>
DreamWorks officials said Maguire has been unwilling to cede control of
the Playa Vista project as a way to attract a new investor. Sources said
the project needs about $150 million in equity to start its first phase.<BR>
<BR>
Over the past few weeks, there has been an increasing amount of pressure
placed on Maguire to take a new role or accept an offer in which he would
have a smaller equity stake. IBM sent a letter to him announcing that it
would not take part in the project as its technology architect. It also
demanded more than $400,000 in consulting fees.<BR>

<P><CITE>From the Hollywood Reporter:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
DreamWorks SKG is ready to bolt the troubled Playa Vista development --
said to be short of billions of dollars in completion financing -- and the
fledgling studio is in talks with owners of at least one alternative site
for a permanent DreamWorks home, according to top sources. A well-placed
insider said Wednesday that talks are under way with Westinghouse Electric
Corp. to buy the CBS Radford production facility in Studio City for use
as DreamWorks' main facility for 1,100 employees. That's its entire work
force other than animation operations, which are set to locate in Glendale.
DreamWorks, which is ramping up its production operations at more than a
half-dozen temporary sites including space on the Universal Studios lot,
declined comment on any specific negotiations. But a spokesman for Playa
Vista developer Maguire Thomas confirmed DreamWorks has been looking elsewhere.
&quot;Playa Vista continues to be our first choice, but we've been extremely
frustrated by the lack of progress and have had to look at the implications,&quot;
said Michael Montgomery, a DreamWorks project manager for Playa Vista. (Carl

<H3>Delays dog DreamWorks Studios</H3>

<P><CITE>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
By Ted Johnson<BR>
<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - A bold plan by the fledgling DreamWorks studio to
convert a coastal Los Angeles suburb into a vast business and housing development
is encountering obstacles as partners and potential tenants grow restless.<BR>
<BR>
DreamWorks had announced to much fanfare in December that it would locate
its new studio at a former Hughes Aircraft facility in Playa Vista, just
north of Los Angeles International Airport. IBM, special effects house Digital
Domain and Silicon Graphics expressed strong interest in moving in as well.<BR>
<BR>
And at the same time, studio founders Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg
and David Geffen became partners in all of Playa Vista -- a massive 1,087-acre
development of homes, offices and the studio -- along with property developers
Maguire Thomas and the Rouse Corp.<BR>
<BR>
But a groundbreaking originally scheduled for last June now looks at least
six months away. And there is uncertainty about a lawsuit challenging the
City of Los Angeles' approval of the studio. Although developers emerged
victorious last summer, the ruling has been appealed.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, IBM has decided to not take space at the site, and speculation
has surfaced that other tenants are also set to pass on the project, highly
placed sources familiar with the deal said Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
Digital Domain is now eyeing a site not far from the company's offices in
Venice, according to the same sources.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, lead developer Maguire Thomas Partners, DreamWorks and other
partners are struggling with issues including pricing, control of the project
and how financing will be structured. Among the problems: overcoming existing
debt on the property incurred after the real estate market fell flat in
the early 1990s, before DreamWorks was involved.<BR>
<BR>
The delays in the project have come as a surprise to City Hall officials
and others in the entertainment business as well as to DreamWorks.<BR>
<BR>
Developers also point out that the project is complex, and original plans
to break ground in June probably were too optimistic. Plans call for creating
no less than a community of the future, connecting homes, offices and the
studio with fiber optics, and at the same time, building the first major
studio in 70 years.<BR>
<BR>
But highly placed sources said DreamWorks has been frustrated by issues
concerning who would control the project as it seeks ways to come up with
$150 million to $200 million needed to launch the development.<BR>
<BR>
Sources close to the project have groused that Robert Maguire has stood
firm on staying in the lead position, even though it is likely he would
have to step back should a new investor take a major stake.<BR>
<BR>
Still, others have suggested that, with negotiations between the real estate
company and the partners becoming tense, DreamWorks and its partners may
be posturing to put pressure on Maguire Thomas.<BR>
<BR>
A Maguire Thomas spokeswoman rejected the notion that Maguire would hold
up the project because of control issues. The top priority, she said, is
coming up with a financing structure, which she pointed out would be complex
no matter who was in charge.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, tenants such as Digital Domain have had concerns not only about
lease rates on the property, but when the space would be available. With
groundbreaking uncertain, DreamWorks has inquired about space at CBS Studio
Center in Studio City as a contingency plan, sources said.<BR>
<BR>
Digital Domain CEO Scott Ross said he hasn't made any decisions about leasing
space, though he acknowledged that the company's commercial division has
grown and needs to move by Jan. 1.<BR>
<BR>
Also getting antsy about the project are city officials, who are in the
final stages on a $70 million incentive package designed to lure DreamWorks
to the site. But the incentives voted on by the City Council hinge on the
presence of DreamWorks in the project.<BR>

<BR>
&quot;Povich &amp; Chung,&quot; the big newsmagazine contender from DreamWorks
SKG, will be pitched to the major TV station groups and station representatives
in the next few weeks in an early push for its fall 1998 launch. Station
reps confirmed that DreamWorks executives are setting appointments to talk
about its syndication heavyweight contender for prized access time periods.
Helmed by husband-and-wife news veterans Maury Povich and Connie Chung,
the show is still early in its development process, but DreamWorks needs
to get it in front of programmers as far in advance as possible. Povich
is committed to Paramount Domestic Television as host of &quot;The Maury
Povich Show&quot; talk strip through 1998. Chung has not been on the air
since she was unseated as Dan Rather's co-anchor on the &quot;CBS Evening
News&quot; in May 1995.</P>

By Joe Flint<BR>
<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - Ted Danson has shifted his production company to DreamWorks,
which makes the actor's new comedy ''Ink.''<BR>
<BR>
Danson's Anasazi Productions was most recently linked to Paramount, and
the move was not unexpected. The first-look deal with DreamWorks covers
feature films, TV movies, miniseries and family programming.<BR>
<BR>
Anasazi produced the movie ``The Canterville Ghost,'' starring Patrick Stewart,
for ABC. Its other credits include the TV movies ``On Promised Land'' and
``Fight for Justice.''<BR>
<BR>
Currently, the company is producing the HBO film ``Miss Evers Boys,'' which
stars Laurence Fishburne, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis and Joe Morton. For
Showtime, the company is developing ``The Last Spy,'' based on the life
of Aldrich Ames, the CIA employee who sold secrets to the Soviet Union.<BR>

<H3>DreamWorks plans film about talking parrot</H3>

<P><CITE>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
By Michael Fleming<BR>
<BR>
NEW YORK (Variety) - Parroting the success of the talking porker picture
``Babe,'' DreamWorks is planning a movie starring an intelligent parrot.<BR>
<BR>
``Paulie: A Parrot's Tale'' is described as a comedy about a young girl
and her best friend, who happens to be a parrot. Unlike most parrots that
mimic language, Paulie has verbal and comprehension skills.<BR>
<BR>
The pair get separated, and the film is about the bird's quest to be reunited
with its pal. It's likened more to ''Forrest Gump'' than ``Homeward Bound,''
as the parrot narrates the film.<BR>
<BR>
Several studios bird-dogged the project, but DreamWorks took it off the
market, signing a $750,000 deal with writer Laurie Craig.<BR>
<BR>
Craig last wrote ``Bad Death,'' a comedy that has Demi Moore attached as
an insurance investigator who falls in love with a man she is tracking who
has faked his own death to cash in on his life insurance policies.<BR>

Ink (Mon. (21), 8:30-9 p.m., CBS) By Jeremy Gerard<BR>
<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - Faced with a pilot and several episodes that were
generating nuclear-disaster-type buzz, DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg and
CBS' Les Moonves recruited Murphy Browncreator Diane English to rebuild
``Ink'' from the bottom up -- and gave her all of eight weeks to do it.<BR>
<BR>
On the line were the reputations of Ted Danson, the Emmy-winning star of
the long-running ``Cheers,'' and his Oscar-winning wife, Mary Steenburgen;
several million dollars already spent on developing a sitcom for them; and
CBS' hopes for a primetime home run.<BR>
<BR>
CBS didn't get a very good sitcom out of that pressure cooker, but it did
get a home run.<BR>
<BR>
``Ink'' has a long way to go in working out a style and gaining some consistency
of tone. Moreover, its setting, the New York Sun, bears about as much resemblance
to an actual city newspaper as Murphy Brown's ``F.Y.I.'' bears to a real
TV newsmagazine.<BR>
<BR>
But people will no more tune into ``Ink'' for a journalism seminar than
they do ``Murphy Brown'' for a glimpse behind the camera at ``60 Minutes.''<BR>
<BR>
They tune in for the stars, and the stars of ``Ink'' -- individually and
in tandem -- deliver.<BR>
<BR>
They're great fun to spend 23 minutes with. Danson plays Mike Logan, the
Sun's star metro columnist. His face appears on the sides of buses; people
give him the thumbs up in the street; vendors have breakfast waiting to
press into his hands as he flies by on the way to work. Mike owns the city.<BR>
<BR>
The mayor's furious about this morning's column? Too bad. The borough of
Queens is suing? Tra-la. What really wrecks the day is the appearance of
Kate Montgomery (Steenburgen), Mike's globe-trotting journalist ex-wife,
who is globe-trotting no more.<BR>
<BR>
She's the Sun's new managing editor, hence Mike's boss, having arrived with
their teenage daughter, Abby (Alana Austin), in tow.<BR>
<BR>
The Sun fields an exceptionally high-spirited, nice, how shall I say, chipper
staff, in quarters so unnaturally clean that it's impossible to imagine
anyone coming into contact with the substance that gives the show its name.<BR>
<BR>
The cast of characters is, at this point, painfully predictable: a neurotic
(read: Jewish) financial reporter (Saul Rubinek), a police reporter (Ernie
Trainor) who's sqeamish about blood stains, a gung-ho editorial assistant
(Donna French).<BR>
<BR>
And, of course, a run-down, long-in-the-tooth society columnist (Christine
Ebersole) given to pronouncements along the lines of, ``I've got a hangover
that would take down Kitty Dukakis.''<BR>
<BR>
Not all of ``Ink'' is that tasteless, but a lot of it is that stupid.<BR>
<BR>
Much is made of Mike's horror over Abby's confession that she's a Republican.
The ``Metro-bomber'' calls Kate, only to be met with a harangue about the
trials of finding an apartment in the city and quitting smoking. You get
the picture.<BR>
<BR>
And yet Danson and Steenburgen are delightful. He is the master of preening
self-love and she, even outfitted in hideous clothes, appears completely
at ease before the camera.<BR>
<BR>
This clearly owes something to the presence of veteran sitcom director Thomas
Schlamme at the helm; for all their ragged plot edges, the scenes flow effortlessly.<BR>
<BR>
By the end of the first episode, the only thing established worth keeping
is that Mike and Kate face a real challenge working together, and that it
will be amusing to watch them figure out how.<BR>
<BR>
Everything else is up for grabs.<BR>
<BR>
Cast: Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Alana Austin, Jenicacq Bergere, Christine
Ebersole, Charlie Robinson, Saul Rubinek, Phillip Bruns, James Distafano,
Bill Macy, Kathryn Morris, Judy Prescott, John Del Regno, Troy Winbush.<BR>

<P><CITE>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - Sal Stabile, the Brooklyn-born filmmaker who debuted
with the dark comedy ``Gravesend'', has signed a two-picture deal at DreamWorks,
sources said.<BR>
<BR>
This is the second indie filmmaker deal the company has entered into in
a week. Australia's Scott Hicks (''Shine'') bagged a one-year, first-look
deal with DreamWorks earlier.<BR>
<BR>
Stabile's first project will be ``Dance With Angels'', which he is writing
and will direct. The drama is based on the story of his father, who was
an obsessive gambler.<BR>
<BR>
Stabile won the attention of the film industry after Toni and Mark Ross
(children of late Time Warner chairman Steve Ross) came on board as executive
producers of his ``Gravesend.<BR>
<BR>
He then caught the eye of Oliver Stone, who acted as a presenter on his
film. ``Gravesend'' is currently lining up domestic distribution.</P>

<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - Scott Hicks, the Australian director of film festival
favorite ``Shine'', is in final talks for a one-year deal with DreamWorks,
the company confirmed Monday.<BR>
<BR>
According to sources close to the first-look production and directing arrangement,
Hicks is negotiating to get the final word on any project under $15 million
that he sets up.<BR>
<BR>
Hicks is bringing at least one project with him, but DreamWorks executives
would not say anything about it. The studio won Hicks' services over several
rivals, including Fine Line Features and Miramax Films.<BR>
<BR>
``Shine'', a low-budget picture about a prodigy pianist Down Under, stars
relative unknown Geoffrey Rush along with Lynn Redgrave and John Gielgud.
It is slated for domestic release Nov. 22.<BR>
<BR>
It was the center of gossip at the Sundance Film Festival this year when
Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein got into a loud altercation at a restaurant
with the picture's U.S. sales representative over rights to the film. Weinstein
ended up securing international rights while Fine Line got domestic.<BR>
<BR>
The picture went on to win the Toronto Film Festival's People's Choice and
Metro Media awards.<BR>
<BR>
Hicks has directed Emmy-winning documentaries for cable's Discovery Channel<BR>
as well as two independent features.<BR>

SYDNEY, Australia -- Optus Vision, one of Australia's two cable TV providers,
said it has secured a long-term exclusive output deal with DreamWorks SKG
covering the startup Hollywood studio's first 40 films. OV CEO Geoffrey
Cousins, meanwhile, announced he was &quot;stepping back&quot; from that
position to become chairman once his replacement as CEO can be found to

Optus Communications, U.S. cable system giant Continental Cablevision, Australian
broadcaster Seven Network and financier Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting
Ltd. (PBL). Industry speculation has assumed that OV would win the DreamWorks
deal, given that over-the-air commercial broadcaster Nine Network -- also

In a highly unusual deal, DreamWorks SKG has agreed to put together and

team of the Beastie Boys and Beck) will do the original score and that Beck
and the Eels will probably perform on the soundtrack. (Kirk Honeycutt)</P>

Marking his first major film role since the smash hit &quot;The Birdcage,&quot;
Nathan Lane has signed on to star in &quot;Mousehunt&quot; for DreamWorks
SKG, said Walter Parkes, co-head of production at the studio. The comedy
marks the feature directorial debut of commercials director Gore Verbinski,
who won Clio Awards for his Nike and Budweiser spots. Tony Ludwig and Alan
Riche, who are partnered in Riche-Ludwig Prods., are producing. Written
by Adam Rifkin, &quot;Mousehunt&quot; is the story of two brothers who inherit
a run-down country house from their stingy father -- only to discover that
their new abode is actually a historic mansion worth a king's ransom. (Cathy

&quot;MR. SPIELBERG BUILDS HIS DREAM HOME<BR>
<BR>
Steven Spielberg recently unveiled several features of his latest playground,
the new DreamWorks studio complex. Located in Playa Vista outside Los Angeles,
the new moviemaking facility is the first studio to be designed with significant
input from a director, and it incorporates some unique features that were
added to Spielberg's specifications. The new soundstages will have built-in,
fully automated lighting grids, and the studio's production offices will
have a view of the films being shot on the stages.<BR>
<BR>
Playa Vista will also boast a tank custom-designed for underwater filming,
&quot;something all directors are crying for,&quot; says Spielberg, and
the stages will also have removable skylights that will allow sets to be
lit by natural sunshine.<BR>
<BR>
Construction on the new complex is scheduled to begin before the end of
this year.&quot;</P>
