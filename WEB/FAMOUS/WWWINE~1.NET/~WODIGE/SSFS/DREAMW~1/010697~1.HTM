<H3>'Connie &amp; Maury' giving NATPE a sneak preview</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>They may not have a syndicator yet, but Connie Chung and Maury Povich
will be heading to the big NATPE syndication sales bash in New Orleans next
week with DreamWorks SKG to give stations a taste of their new &quot;Connie
&amp; Maury&quot; news show for fall 1998. DreamWorks, which is producing
the half-hour strip for access, has been in talks with various distributors
but has yet to ink a deal. The company will be at the market with a room
at the New Orleans Convention Center for a flurry of meetings and talks
with stations. Heading the DreamWorks push will be the co-heads of television,
Bob Jacquemin and Ken Solomon. Industry observers had assumed DreamWorks
would want to lock in a major distributor before going to the National Association
of Television Program Executives convention with the idea of doing business
for 1998. &quot;We have had talks with distributors, but we believe the
next step is to actually produce the show,&quot; Jacquemin said. (Steve
Brennan)</P>
