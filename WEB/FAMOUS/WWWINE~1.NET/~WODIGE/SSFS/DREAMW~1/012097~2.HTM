<H3>Good news for Playa Vista project?</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>Playa Vista, a project usually preceded in news stories by the term &quot;much-troubled,&quot;
may soon have good news. Sources suggest a source should be on board by
the end of the month for $180 million in financing for the commercial/residential
project, to be anchored by the DreamWorks SKG studio. But negotiations on
details, which hinge on issues of investor equity and other sticky matters,
could delay a final financing document into next month. Developers are represented
in those talks by a three-member panel: Maguire Thomas Partners head Rob
Maguire; his business associate, Jim Thomas, recently placed at the project
helm in an effort to advance the stalled talks; and John Goolsby, representing
Howard Hughes Corp., which owns the land. (Carl DiOrio)</P>
