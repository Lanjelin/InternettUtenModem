<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>Paul and Chris Weitz, screenwriters of the upcoming DreamWorks SKG animated
feature <A HREF="ANTS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/dreamworks/ants.html">&quot;Ants,&quot;</A> have signed a nonexclusive,
one-year, first-look deal with the studio. The brothers first teamed as
screenwriters on the spec comedy &quot;Dances With Dinosaurs,&quot; which
was purchased by Columbia Pictures. They have since worked on projects for
Warner Bros. and Paramount. In addition to &quot;Ants,&quot; which stars
the voice of Woody Allen, they are at work on a screenplay adaptation of
the popular comic book series &quot;Badrock&quot; for New Line Cinema. (Cathy
