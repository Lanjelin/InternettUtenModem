<H3>Dough for DreamWorks Playa Vista studio</H3>

<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter (sent in by Andrew Wallenstein):</I></P>

<P>HOLLYWOOD - It looks as if the dream's coming true for DreamWorks. An
announcement is expected any day that a group led by Beverly Hills financier
Gary Winnick will fork over $180 million to get its Playa del Rey project
rolling. In exchange, Winnick's group - which also includes East Coast real
estate and insurance interests - will get an ownership stake in the development
that will have DreamWorks as its anchor tenant. Final approval of the financing
arrangement by Robert Maguire, head of lead developer Maguire Thomas Partners,
is said to be the only obstacle to announcing the deal. Maguire at least
nominally was replaced at the project helm recently by his former partner
James Thomas, with project decisions placed in the hands of a three-person
panel. But an insider says Maguire's long resistance to equity participation
by the Winnick group has stalled a final thumbs-up for the past several
days.</P>
