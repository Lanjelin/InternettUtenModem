<H3>Playa Vista wins financing</H3>

<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>More than $200 million has been committed by a group led by Los Angeles
financier Gary Winnick to get the massive Playa Vista studio project back
on track, officials confirmed Thursday. Maguire Thomas Partners, whose troubled
multibillion-dollar project DreamWorks SKG hopes eventually to call home,
said it is in negotiations to secure a final financing agreement. The announcement
follows months of near-desperate activity on funding-related issues. Robert
Maguire and James Thomas -- former partners in the development firm, which
is now run by Maguire -- have juggled control of Playa Vista between them
as they've worked with execs at DreamWorks to sort through a flap over who
to pick as a funding partner and how to structure financing. Maguire Thomas
spokeswoman Peggy Moretti said DreamWorks now is expected to move into Playa
Vista sometime in 1999, or &quot;two years from the time financing is secured.&quot;
