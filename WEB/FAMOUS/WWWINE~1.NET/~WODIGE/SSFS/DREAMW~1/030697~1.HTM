<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>T&eacute;a Leoni is set to star in &quot;<A HREF="../SPIELB~1/DEEPIM~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/deepimpact.html">Deep
Impact</A>,&quot; a co-production between Paramount and DreamWorks SKG.
The film, inspired by George Pal's 1951 sci-fi classic &quot;When Worlds
Collide&quot; and Arthur C. Clark's book &quot;The Hammer of Gods,&quot;
is scheduled to begin production April 21. &quot;Impact&quot; concerns the
discovery of a comet on a collision course with Earth and the ensuing massive
international race against time to save the human race. The Richard Zanuck-David
Brown production, written by Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin, will be
helmed by Mimi Leder, who recently wrapped DreamWorks' &quot;The Peacemaker.&quot;
Leoni stars in NBC's &quot;The Naked Truth.&quot; Her recent film credits
include &quot;Bad Boys.&quot; She is repped by Risa Shapiro at ICM. (Cathy
