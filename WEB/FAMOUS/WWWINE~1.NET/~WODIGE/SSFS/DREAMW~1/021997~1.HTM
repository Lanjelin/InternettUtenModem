<P>Harbert makes sudden segue to DreamWorks<BR>
One work day after his last day as chairman of ABC Entertainment, Ted Harbert
announced he has signed a 2 1/2-year exclusive deal to develop and produce
TV shows for DreamWorks SKG. As part of the deal, Harbert will immediately
become one of the executive producers of &quot;Arsenio&quot; -- DreamWorks'
new sitcom for ABC -- along with Tim O'Donnell and star Arsenio Hall. That
show premieres Wednesday, March 5. In January, when Harbert announced he
was leaving ABC, he said he would take some time off before jumping into
a new gig. &quot;I had a long weekend,&quot; Harbert joked Tuesday. (Lisa
