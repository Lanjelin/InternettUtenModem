<H3>Matthew McConaughey sails '<A HREF="AMISTA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/amistad.html">Amistad</A>'</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>Matthew McConaughey is in advanced talks to star in &quot;<A HREF="AMISTA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/amistad.html">Amistad</A>,&quot;
the first film Steven Spielberg will direct after he completes his &quot;Jurassic
Park&quot; sequel, &quot;<A HREF="LOSTWO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/lostworld.html">The Lost World</A>,&quot;
sources said Monday. It is also the first picture Spielberg will direct
for DreamWorks SKG, in association with HBO Pictures. The movie, which has
also gone under the title &quot;Black Mutiny,&quot; will guarantee McConaughey
a high-profile venture after shooting to attention as the star of Warner
Bros.' &quot;A Time to Kill,&quot; in which he co-starred with Sandra Bullock
and Samuel L. Jackson for director Joel Schumacher. That film has made more
than $108 million at the boxoffice. &quot;Amistad&quot; centers on the true
story of an 1839 mutiny on the ship of that name. Captured after their attempt
to sail home fails, 40 fleeing slaves have to fight the legal system with
help from former President John Quincy Adams. (Kirk Honeycutt and Stephen
Galloway)</P>
