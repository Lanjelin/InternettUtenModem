<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>Someone has beaten Steven Spielberg to the punch. A film having its premiere
in Africa this weekend bears several striking similarities to Spielberg's
<A HREF="AMISTA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/amistad.html">&quot;Amistad,&quot;</A> which entered production
this week. &quot;Ill Gotten Gains,&quot; which will debut at the PanAfrican
Film Festival in Ouagadougou in the West African country of Burkina Faso
(formerly Upper Volta), concerns a fictional uprising on a slave ship in
1869. &quot;Amistad&quot; relates the true story of a revolt on the Spanish
slave ship Amistad by a &quot;cargo&quot; of 53 Africans in 1839. Even more
startling is the fact that both films share an actor and the same ship for
a set. Djimon Hounsou, a top model in Paris who has appeared in &quot;Stargate&quot;
and the upcoming &quot;Deep Rising&quot; for Hollywood Pictures, has major
roles in both films. (Kirk Honeycutt)</P>
