<P>CULVER CITY, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Jan. 22, 1997-- Production
begins on TriStar Pictures' &quot;The Mask of Zorro,&quot; starring Antonio
Banderas and Academy Award-winner Anthony Hopkins on Monday, Jan. 27 in
Mexico City, it was announced Wednesday by TriStar president Robert Cooper.</P>

<P>A TriStar Pictures/Amblin Entertainment production, &quot;The Mask of
Zorro&quot; is directed by Martin Campbell, who garnered critical raves
for the hit James Bond thriller &quot;GoldenEye,&quot; which grossed more
than $350 million worldwide.  The film also stars Catherine Zeta Jones (&quot;The
Phantom&quot;) and Stuart Wilson (&quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;).  Doug
Claybourne and David Foster are the producers.  Terry Rossio &amp; Ted Elliott,
John Eskow and David Ward wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment film division, headed by Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald.</P>

<P>&quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; is a sweeping adventure of love and honor,
of tragedy and triumph set against Mexico's fight for independence from
the iron fist of Spain.  It's 20 years since Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins)
successfully fought against Spanish oppression as the legendary romantic
hero Zorro.  Now he must find a successor to stop Raphael Montero (Wilson),
the powerful former Spanish governor who has returned to reclaim the country
for himself.  Banderas stars as Alejandro Murietta, a drifter with a troubled
past whom Diego transforms into Zorro, the fearless romantic hero he once
was.  Armed with his mask, sword, whip and jet-black stallion Tornado, the
new Zorro embarks on a mission to stop Montero's plot to reclaim California.</P>

<P>&quot;'The Mask of Zorro' has been a tremendously important project to
this studio and we are excited to move forward with such a group of distinguished
actors and filmmakers involved, particularly Martin Campbell, who virtually
reinvented the James Bond movie with 'GoldenEye,'&quot; said Cooper.</P>

<P>The renowned behind-the-scenes team includes production designer Cecilia
Montiel (&quot;Desperado&quot;), costume designer Graciela Mazon (&quot;Desperado&quot;)
