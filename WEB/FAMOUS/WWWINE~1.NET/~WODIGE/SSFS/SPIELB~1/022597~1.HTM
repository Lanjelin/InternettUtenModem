<H3>65 million witness NBC 'Schindler'</H3>

<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>A 3 1/2-hour black-and-white film about the Holocaust attracted 65 million
people to NBC Sunday night. The network estimates that's how many viewers
tuned in to at least six minutes of its 7:30-11 p.m. presentation of Steven
Spielberg's Oscar-winning &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; The entire feature
broadcast averaged about 40 million viewers, nearly doubling in one night
the total number of people who saw the movie in U.S. theaters (25 million).
&quot;Schindler's List&quot; attracted a 23.8 rating/34 share in the 36
metered markets, according to Nielsen Media Research. This is the highest
overnight rating for a movie on any network since the NBC telecast of Spielberg's
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; on May 7, 1995, which garnered an overnight 25.3/37.
The film brought additional viewers to broadcast TV and did not hurt the
other networks' performances appreciably. Among them, the four broadcast
networks captured 78% of the television audience. ABC's Sunday movie, &quot;Volcano:
Fire on the Mountain,&quot; scored a 12.0/17 in the metered markets, while
CBS' &quot;Night Sins&quot; movie posted a 9.9/14. (Lisa de Moraes)<HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
