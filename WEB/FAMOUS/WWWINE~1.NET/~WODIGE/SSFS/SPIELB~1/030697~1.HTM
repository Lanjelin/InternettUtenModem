<P>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif.--(ENTERTAINMENT WIRE)--Feb. 18, 1997-- </P>

<P>Principal photography commenced Tuesday on the historical drama &quot;Amistad,&quot;
director Steven Spielberg's first feature under the DreamWorks SKG banner,
it was announced Tuesday by Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald, co-heads
of DreamWorks Pictures.</P>

<P>The film will be produced by DreamWorks Pictures in association with
HBO Pictures.  Debbie Allen (&quot;Fame,&quot; &quot;A Different World&quot;)
and Colin Wilson (&quot;The Lost World,&quot; &quot;Casper&quot;) will produce,
with Parkes and MacDonald serving as executive producers.  The screenplay
is by David Franzoni (&quot;Citizen Cohn&quot;) and Academy Award-winner
Steve Zaillian (&quot;Schindler's List,&quot; &quot;Searching for Bobby
Fischer&quot;).</P>

<P>The film features an international cast led by (in alphabetical order)
Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne, Djimon Honsou, Anthony Hopkins, Matthew
McConaughey and Pete Postlethwaite.</P>

<P>Set in 1839, &quot;Amistad&quot; is the true story of a revolt on the
Spanish slave ship Amistad, whose 'cargo' of 53 Africans rebelled against
their captors.  Captured off the coast of Connecticut when their desperate
attempt to sail home failed, the Africans are forced to stand trial for
the murders of the crew that had held them prisoner.</P>

<P>To win their freedom, the Africans -- with the help of local abolitionists
-- find themselves taking on not just the Spanish crown but the entire American
system of justice.  They are joined in their fight by former U.S. President
John Quincy Adams, who is willing to take on their cause and fight their
battle all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</P>

<P>Allen first brought the property, which she has had for more than a decade,
to DreamWorks' attention.  In the ensuing development over the last three
years, Allen has spearheaded the creation of an &quot;Amistad&quot; research
department which continues to amass a prodigious amount of historical documentation,
consulting with some of the leading scholars and cultural historians of
19th Century America and the Mende tribe of West Africa.</P>

<P>&quot;We are proud to launch Steven Spielberg's first DreamWorks project
with 'Amistad.'  It's a great story of courage and will, to be told by one
of our greatest storytellers,&quot; said Parkes in making the announcement.
 &quot;It is only fitting that we've begun the filming of this important
episode in American history during Black History Month,&quot; he added.</P>

television work, Freeman came to moviegoers' attention in the 1980 prison
