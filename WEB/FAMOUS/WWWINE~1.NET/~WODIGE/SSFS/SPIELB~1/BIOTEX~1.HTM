Steven Spielberg</H1>

<P>Steven Spielberg was born on December 18, 1947 in Cincinnatti, Ohio.
His mother Leah Spielberg was a concert pianist and his father, Arnold Spielberg
was an electric engineer who was part of the team that designed the first
computers. His family moved from Ohio to New Jersey, and then to Arizona
while he was just a young boy.<BR>
<BR>
Spielberg had been a film enthusiast from childhood.  The first films he
remembers seeing is Cecil B. DeMille's <I>The Greatest Show on Earth</I>
(1952) and Walt Disney films. Spielberg began making short films before
he was a teen, casting family members and friends as actors and placing
himself as director. He won a contest with a 40 minute war film, <I>Escape
to Nowhere</I> and his first box office success was the 140-minute <I>Firelight,</I>
a science fiction story which was shown at a local theater. He studied in
the film department of California State College, made regular trips to Universal
Studios (where he would sport a suit and tie and be waved through by the
guards) and in 1969 made his professional debut with a 24-minute short,
<I>Amblin'.</I> With this film under his belt, he was finally granted a
contract with Universal to do television work. Early television work included
directing Joan Crawford in an episode of <I>Night Gallery</I> and the first
ever series episode of <I>Columbo.</I> But his breakthrough came with the
television movie <I>Duel</I> (1971), a thriller based on Richard Matheson's
story about a travelling salesman who is mysteriously harrassed by an anonymous
truck driver whose face is never seen and motives are never revealed. <BR>
<BR>
With the success of <I>Duel,</I> Spielberg debuted as a feature film director
with <I>The Sugarland Express</I> (1973) starring Goldie Hawn, William Atherton,
Ben Johnson and Michael Sacks. He was then assigned to direct the film adaptation
of Peter Benchley's novel, <I>Jaws</I> (1975). This thriller about a shark
who terroizes a New England beach community marked the beginning of the
blockbuster, making $130 million and costing only $8.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
After <I>Jaws,</I> Spielberg had much more freedom in Hollywood. Therefore,
he chose to direct a science-fiction drama of his own writing, <I>Close
Encounters of the Third Kind</I> (1977). The film earned Spielberg his first
Academy Award nomination as Best Director. Another blockbuster under his
belt, Speilberg felt that it was time to do a different kind of story. Hence,
the little known screwball farce about a Japanese attack on the coast of
California just days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, <I>1941</I> (1979).
The film was a critical and box office bomb, but Spielberg didn't let that
bring him down. <BR>
<BR>
The new decade marked new blockbusters from Steven Spielberg. Teaming up
with his friend, George Lucas (Star Wars), the two created a fast-paced
adventure thriller about archeaologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford). <I>Raiders
of the Lost Ark</I> (1981), inspired by childhood memories of old cliff-hanger
serials, pitted Indiana Jones against the Nazis in a race to find the Ark
of the Covenant. The film was a box office smash, earning Spielberg his
second Best Director nomination. Since its release, <I>Raiders of the Lost
Ark</I> has been seen by millions and has become a classic of modern moviemaking,
for its technical and storytelling aspects. <BR>
<BR>
How was Spielberg going to top <I>Raiders?</I> The answer was simple. A
film about a boy and his alien friend. A film about childhood and growing
up, and, easily one of Spielberg's best films. <I>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial</I>
(1982), an imaginative, enchanting, wondrous science-fiction tale quickly
became the most successful film of all time. With this great opus, Spielberg
earned his third Best Director nomination, although the award still alluded
the young director. <I>E.T.</I> is one of the films Spielberg is most proud
of, &quot;the closest film to my own sensibilities, my own fantasies, my
own heart.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A week prior to E.T.'s opening, another Steven Spielberg film had been released.
<I>Poltergeist</I> (1982) was not directed by Spielberg (who was the writer-producer)
but instead by Tobe Hooper (<I>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</I>). During production
and afterwards there were stories of problems between the producer and director,
centering on the question of who the director actually was. (The Directors
Guild even launched an investigation.) <I>Poltergeist</I> was Spielberg's
fourth film he produced but did not direct, the other three being <I>I Wanna
Hold Your Hand</I> (1978), <I>Used Cars</I> (1980), and <I>Continental Divide</I>
(1981). <BR>
<BR>
With all the money he acrued from <I>E.T., Poltergeist,</I> and past blocbusters,
Spielberg formed Amblin Entertainment in 1984. Housed in a luxurious building
on the lot of Universal Studios, Amblin quickly became one of Hollywood's
largest and most successful production companies. Out of Amblin, Spielberg
produced such hits as <I>Gremlins</I> (1984), <I>Back to the Future</I>
(1985), <I>An American Tail</I> (1986), and collaborated with Disney in
producing the live-action/animated movie <I>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</I>
(1988), a film that helped revive Disney's animation department. <BR>
<BR>
Even though he was a successful producer, Spielberg continued to direct.
First, there was the sequel to <I>Raiders </I>,<I>Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom</I> (1984), another runaway success. The following year brought
the film adaptation of <I>The Color Purple</I> (1985). Based on Alice Walker's
Pulitzer Prize winning novel about the life of a black girl in the traditional
South, it was considered Spielberg's first &quot;adult film.&quot; Even
though critics attacked the director for sweetening up the storyline, audiences
felt that the film was touching and magnificently crafted. Nominated for
nine Academy Awards including Best Picture (but not Best Director) the film
did not receive a single statue. Later, in 1987, Spielberg was honored with
the Academy's Irving G. Thalberg Award for his body of work. <BR>
<BR>
Less successful, both from critics and audiences, was Spielberg's second
effort at a historical drama. <I>Empire of the Sun</I> (1987) follows the
story of a young British boy who is separated from his parents during the
evacuation of colonial China during WWII. Spielberg returned to his old
roots two years later when he again teamed up with Lucas to create the third
Indy film, <I>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</I> (1989), which introduced
such characters as Indy's dad (Sean Connery) and Young Indy (played by River
Phoenix and later spun off into a television show produced by Lucas and
starring Sean Patrick Flannery). That same year marked the release of <I>Always</I>
(1989), Spielberg's remake of Victor Fleming's <I>A Guy Named Joe</I> (1943).
Spielberg returned in 1991, directing such talent as Robin Williams and
Dustin Hoffman in the Peter Pan update <I>Hook</I> (1991). Although it seemed
to be a hit with audiences (the highest grossing film of the year) it was
considered a disappointment by critics and Hollywood. <BR>
<BR>
1993 marked two big milestones in Steven Spielberg's career and filmmaking.
First was the summer blockbuster <I>Jurassic Park</I> (1993), based on the
novel by Michael Crichton. The film, a thriller about a theme park where
genetically-engineered dinosaurs run amok, provided the classic Spielberg
blend of terror, special effects, and storytelling. The movie set new speed
records and became the most successful film in the world. The film is also
notable because of it's convincing use of computer generated dinosaurs created
by Lucas's special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic. Months after
the release of <I>Jurassic Park,</I> Spielberg released a film that was
completely different. <I>Schindler's List</I> (1993) was a holocaust drama
about Oskar Schindler, a man who saved over 1,000 Jews from death in concentration
camps. Spielberg had been wanting to make this film for many years, but
had never been emotionally ready to attack it. Shot and directed beautifully,
mostly in black and white, the film garnered critical praise and box office
success. This was the film that finally gave Spielberg his Academy Award
for Best Director. In a sense, Oskar gave Spielberg Oscar! <BR>
<BR>
In 1995, Steven Spielberg, former Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, and
Record/Film Producer David Geffen announced the creation of a new studio
which would churn out motion pictures (both live-action and animated), movies,
television shows, and multi-media. The three men named the new studio, <A
HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs13.htm#1343" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/dreamworks/dreamworks.html">DreamWorks SKG</A> and it is still in
its infancy. It's first production will be <I><A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs13.htm#1346" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/dreamworks/peacemaker.html">The
Peacemaker</A>,</I> starring George Clooney (E.R.). Already the studio has
produced a sitcom, <I>Champs,</I> which has since been canceled, but it
may have found a hit with the ABC series <I><A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#465" tppabs="http://www.highincident.com/">High
Incident</A>,</I> an ER-style cop show which is in its second season. The
partners have also purchased a Playa Vista site which was once owned by
Howard Hughes to serve as their studio. Even though Spielberg has DreamWorks
SKG, his production company has still been producing films under Universal
and Warner but will presumably be moving to DreamWorks. As for directing,
Spielberg is busy in post-production of <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs13.htm#1348" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/spielberg/lostworld.html"><I>The
Lost World</I></A><I>,</I> the sequel to Jurassic Park. In Febraury 1997,
he will begin shooting <I><A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs13.htm#1350" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/spielberg/amistad.html">Amistad</A></I>,
and when that is finished he will tackle <I><A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs13.htm#1351" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/spielberg/savingpr.html">Saving
Private Ryan</A></I>.<BR>
<BR>
Steven Spielberg is married to actress Kate Capshaw. They each have a child
from a previous marriage (his was to actress Amy Irving) and share a biological
son and daughter, and also an adopted son and adopted daughter. They just
recently had their fifth child together, a baby daughter named Destry Allen.<BR>
