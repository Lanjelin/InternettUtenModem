<P>PLOT:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Indy's fourth adventure. Rumors had said first it was about the lost
  city of Atlantis but then a script &quot;Indiana Jones and the Sons of
  Darkness&quot; was released over the Internet about Noah's Ark (both ideas
  have proven false).</P>

<P><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>DEVELOPMENTS:<BR>
<BR>
December 1996 --- Producer Rick McCallum says &quot;we have a great script
but it is difficult to determine a time to shoot due to George, Steven,
and Harrison's schedules.&quot;</P>

<P>August 1996 --- Producer Rick McCallum says &quot;we're still working
on the script...Harrison Ford has several films lined up and Steven has
his new company, Dreamworks, to deal with...There has been some press saying
it isn't going to happen, but it's not true.&quot;<BR>
