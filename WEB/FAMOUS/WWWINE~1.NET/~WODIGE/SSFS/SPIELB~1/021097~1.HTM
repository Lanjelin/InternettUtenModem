<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>NEW YORK -- Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops at the 1997 American
International Toy Fair, with appearances Monday by Jeff Goldblum and other
cast members, as it announced a licensing blitz for its biggest property
of the year, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park.&quot; The studio said
it signed up Burger King, Mercedes-Benz, Kodak and General Mills as part
of a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign for the dinosaurs of &quot;The
Lost World.&quot; The campaign could help revive what has been a tough property
to market. Dinosaurs are difficult to turn into a brand for kids because
one dinosaur looks much like another. As a result, Universal received less
than $100 million from the licensing of &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; according
to a source familiar with the licensing campaign. (Andrew Collier)</P>
