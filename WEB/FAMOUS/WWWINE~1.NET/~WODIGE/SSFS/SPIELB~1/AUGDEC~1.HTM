<H3>Spielberg Was Anonymous Buyer Of Gable's Oscar</H3>

<P><CITE>From Reuters/Variety:</CITE><BR>
By David Finnigan</P>

<P>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuter) - Filmmaker Steven Spielberg anonymously
purchased Clark Gable's 1934 Oscar for a record $550,000 at a weekend auction,
then donated it Tuesday to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</P>

<P>The academy, which hands out Hollywood's annual Oscars, had fought unsuccessfully
to bar Sunday's auction of the 12-inch gold-plated statuette that Gable
won for his role in the movie ''It Happened One Night.''</P>

<P>``Bless Steven Spielberg,'' an emotional academy president Arthur Hiller
told reporters. He said officials of the academy, which had argued the Oscars
were never meant as articles of trade, had no advance knowledge of Spielberg's
plans and were ''still reeling from the breathtaking generosity of Steven's
action.''</P>

<P>``The man has a hell of a way with a holiday gift,'' Hiller added.</P>

<P>In a letter to the academy after the auction, the Oscar-winning director
wrote: ``If not with the Clark Gable estate, I could think of no better
sanctuary for Gable's only Oscar than the motion picture academy.</P>

<P>``The Oscar statuette is the most personal recognition of good work our
industry can ever bestow, and it strikes me as a sad sign of our times that
this icon could be confused with a commercial treasure,'' he said.</P>

<P>Spielberg was also the anonymous bidder who bought Gable's personal script
for the 1939 film classic ``Gone With the Wind'' for $220,000 Sunday at
Christie's Los Angeles auction house. But there were no plans for Spielberg
to donate the script to the academy along with the Oscar, academy officials
said. Both were sold by Gable's estate.</P>

<P>Spielberg, the world's most commercially successful filmmaker who directed
such blockbusters as ``E.T.'' and ''Jurassic Park,'' won Oscars for best
picture and best director in 1994 for his Holocaust epic ``Schindler's List.''</P>

<P>Heaping praise on Spielberg, Hiller said: ``Steven not only epitomizes
filmmaking, he really epitomizes caring. Lots of people care, but Steven
does something about it.''</P>

<P>The identity of the buyer of Gable's Oscar was shrouded in mystery Sunday
when the winning bid was made by telephone during an auction of Hollwyood
artifacts and memorabilia.</P>

<P>The bid of $550,000 topped the previous record price for an Oscar of
$510,000, set in 1993 at Sotheby's auction house for the statuette given
to Vivien Leigh when she was named best actress for her role opposite Gable
in ``Gone With the Wind.''</P>

<P>Hiller said academy officials were contacted Sunday by Spielberg's office
and were told that he wanted to donate the Oscar to the academy. It was
turned over Tuesday, and Hiller said it would be placed on permanent display
at the academy's Center for Motion Picture Study in Beverly Hills.</P>

<P>Last Friday, the academy had asked a Los Angeles judge to block the sale
ofGable's Oscar. But the judge refused and the auction went ahead as planned.</P>

<P>Including auction fees, which are paid by the buyer, the Oscar was bought
for $607,500, and the script went for a total of $244,500.</P>

<P>Gable, who died in 1960 at the age of 59, won the Oscar for his role
as a wisecracking newspaper reporter in love with a runaway heiress, played
by Claudette Colbert. ``It Happened One Night'' swept the Academy Awards,
with Colbert, director Frank Capra and the film itself also being honored.</P>

<BR>
LOS ANGELES (Reuter) - Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg and his wife,
actress Kate Capshaw, have had their fifth child, a spokeswoman for Spielberg's
Dream Works SKG company said Monday.<BR>
<BR>
She said Capshaw, whose real name is Kathy Sue Nail, gave birth to a 7-pound,
12-ounce daughter Sunday. The baby will be named Destry Allyn, she said.<BR>
<BR>
The baby is the couple's fifth child together. They each have one child

<BR>
A group of filmmakers -- including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Bernardo
Bertolucci -- wrote to FCC commissioner Susan Ness Tuesday, stating opposition
to a Monday compromise over proposed digital TV standards that may favor
a 16:9 aspect ratio over alternate 2:1 aspect ratio. &quot;With the likelihood
of wider TV screens in the digital future, we are dismayed at the news that
the FCC has indicated that it may approve conclusions reached by negotiations
between computer industries, television broadcasters and television set
manufacturers that do not provide for redress of the grievance (regarding)
transmission in the digital world of the original aspect ratio of the motion
pictures we make,&quot; stated the letter by the Coalition of Film Makers.
Filmmakers fear most digital-TV broadcasts of their movies will continue
the historic alteration of theatrical-release images to fit on TV screens
of different proportions. (Carl DiOrio)</P>

NEW YORK -- Ford Motor Co. has signed on to be the exclusive sponsor for
NBC's February sweeps presentation of the broadcast television premiere
of the AcademyAward-winning theatrical &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; NBC
sought a single sponsor for the film because many advertisers were likely
to be inappropriate for the Holocaust drama directed by Steven Spielberg.
The film tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi party member and
war profiteer who saved the lives of more than 1,100 Jews. Ford is likely
to considercorporate messages or spots specially tailored for the broadcast.
NBC said it will have limited interruptions on the broadcast scheduled for
7:30-11 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 23. A Ford spokesman declined to say how much
the Ford sponsorship of &quot;Schindler's List&quot; cost the company.</P>

<BR>
HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - Steven Spielberg plans to follow his sequel to ``Jurassic
Park'' with a movie about mutinous slaves, a project that will mark his
first directing project for the DreamWorks partnership he co-founded last
year.<BR>
<BR>
``Amistad'' is the true story of a mutiny on a slave ship of the same name
in 1839, centering on Cinque, an African captive who led the rebellion.
When the captives' attempt to sail home failed, they were captured off the
Atlantic coast.<BR>
<BR>
The story follows their struggle in the U.S. as they fight their case in
the court. Former president John Quincy Adams defends them and takes their
battle to the Supreme Court.<BR>
<BR>
``Steven was taken from the outset with the possibilities of telling an
intimate story between two extraordinary men -- an African slave and an
ex-president of the United States -- set against an epic historical backdrop,''
the film's executive producer Walter Parkes said in a statement.<BR>
<BR>
Also known as ``Black Mutiny,'' ``Amistad'' is written by David Franzoni
(Citizen Cohn) and Steve Zaillian (Schindler's List), who is doing a rewrite.<BR>
<BR>
Production is expected to begin in February, with filming taking place in
Los Angeles, New England and the Caribbean. Spielberg is currently filming
``The Lost World,'' the sequel to ''Jurassic Park.''<BR>
<BR>
After ``<A HREF="AMISTA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/amistad.html">Amistad</A>,'' he will direct Tom Hanks in
``<A HREF="SAVING~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/savingpr.html">Saving Private Ryan</A>.'' Hanks will play a soldier
who is forced to undertake an unusual mission to save a private trapped
behind enemy lines during the Allied invasion of Europe.</P>

<P><CITE>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
By Victoria Batchelor<BR>
<BR>
WELLINGTON (Reuter) - A rugged wilderness area of New Zealand's South Island
will provide the scenic backdrop to Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park''
sequel.<BR>
<BR>
``Certainly, on a film of this kind, we had the option of shooting just
about anywhere and, after looking at a variety of sites, the area in New
Zealand was deemed to be absolutely the best,'' film publicist Don Levy
said on Wednesday.<BR>
<BR>
New Zealand's Department of Conservation on Tuesday approved an application
from Spielberg's company Amblin Entertainment to film in Fiordland, one
of the world's biggest national parks, for the movie: ``The Lost World:
Jurassic Park.''<BR>
<BR>
The original 1993 dinosaur blockbuster, which was filmed on the Hawaiian
island of Kauai, was the highest-grossing film of all time, earning US$913
million in worldwide box office receipts.<BR>
<BR>
Fiordland, a vast area of 1.2 million hectares (2.96 million acres) with
a population of barely 3,000, will offer a stunning backdrop of rainforest,
lakes, granite peaks and waterfalls hundreds of metres high.<BR>
<BR>
``We scouted locations quite literally around the world and are very pleased
to have settled the location in New Zealand,'' Levy said, adding the final
decision was Spielberg's.<BR>
<BR>
``We will shoot scenes that typically establish a sense of place. It doesn't
involve actors, but it expands the look of the film.''<BR>
<BR>
The film crew will shoot for five days in December, based in Te Anau, the
main town on the edge of the park.<BR>
<BR>
The ``Lost World'' sequel, starring Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore and Sir
Richard Attenborough, takes place on an island six years after the events
depicted in Jurassic Park.<BR>
<BR>
``Amblin first came here in January this year, so we've been dealing with
them for 10 months, but what has been impressive to us has been their previous
experience filming in national parks in the United States and Australia,''
said Conservation Department Southland regional conservator Lou Sanson.<BR>
<BR>
He described the area as ``very much dinosaur country.'' However, velociraptors
and brontosauruses will not be taking over New Zealand just yet.<BR>
<BR>
``Essentially the idea is to film the dinosaurs in Hollywood and splice
them into the scenery,'' Sanson said. ``But we understand Spielberg will
be here.''<BR>
<BR>
He said the crew was paying a standard fee for the privilege of filming
in the area. ``It's nothing different just because it's Steven Spielberg.''<BR>
<BR>
Locals are excited at the prospect of Hollywood coming to their doorsteps.
Money spent on accommodation, flights and food will boost the area's economy,
said Jan Wilson, chief executive of Fiordland Promotions.<BR>
<BR>
``It's a highlight for the area to have such a prestigious movie being filmed
here,'' she told Reuters.<BR>
<BR>
``But we'll take it in our stride. We had (British pop star) Cliff Richard
here for a week in 1990/91. We're quite excited, but life goes on.''</P>

<H3>Absentee Steven Spielberg lets writer do the helming</H3>

<P><CITE>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
Technological advancements in fiber optics made it possible for Steven Spielberg
to travel to Poland to direct his Oscar-winning ``Schindler's List'' while
simultaneously supervising the post-production on ``Jurassic Park.'' <BR>
<BR>
Now, as he directs the ``Jurassic'' sequel, ``<A HREF="LOSTWO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/lostworld.html">The
Lost World</A>'', technology again has come to his aid. When he was called
away to the Hamptons for several days, Spielberg didn't have to shut down
production. Instead, he had a monitor trained on the action, letting his
screenwriter, David Koepp, essentially be the first-unit director. A similar
monitor was set up in the Hamptons so Koepp could see him. <BR>
<BR>
A spokesman says Spielberg gave cues to Koepp, who recently made his directing
debut with ``The Trigger Effect'', and got the shots he needed without having
to be on the premises. The spokesman says it was just a few days and that
Spielberg is now back, directing in person once again. The film bows next
Memorial Day.</P>

<P>This month marks the re-release of Steven Spielberg's E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial
to home video. The new version will is THX Digitally Remastered for superior
sound and picture quality. The film is available in three different versions.
The first is the VHS pan-and-scan version which includes some new footage
and interviews. There is also a letterbox VHS version which comes in a foil
case and has added footage and interviews. Also available is the Special
Laserdisc Set which includes John Williams Academy Award Winning Soundtrack
and a 1 1/2 hour documentary on the making of E.T. with members of the cast
and the production team. <BR>
<BR>
It is highly recommended that you purchase either the letterbox VHS or the
Laserdisc set because you will be viewing the movie in its original theatrical
ratio. This is important because it preserves the artistic vision of the
filmmakers. The black bars at the top and bottom of the screen do not cut
off any picture, instead they add picture to the sides that would be cut
off in the normal pan-and-scan video.<BR>

<H3>Spielberg named to USC Board of Trustees</H3>

<P><CITE>From the USC Daily Trojan:</CITE><BR>
<BR>
Legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who has played a vital role in the
School of Cinema-Television, has been elected to the USC Board of Trustees.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am very enthusiastic about the appointment,&quot; President Steven
B. Sample said. &quot;The performing arts are a very strong department (at
USC), probably the strongest of any university in the country. Mr. Spielberg
is the first practicing artist to be appointed to the board and his experience
and notable success will be a great addition to the board.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;USC is widely respected for its cinema school, and it is an anchor
institution in the overall communications program,&quot; Sample said. &quot;The
board is trying to recruit more people with strong ties to the arts, and
Mr. Spielberg was a natural choice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Spielberg received an honorary doctorate of fine arts from USC in 1994.
He currently serves as a member of the School of Cinema-Television's Board
of Councilors, and has donated time, money, and leadership to the cinema
school. He funded the Steven Spielberg Music Scoring Stage, which was dedicated
in 1984.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Members of the board have legal ownership of the university...on behalf
on students, alumni and future studnets,&quot; Sample said.<BR>
<BR>
Spielberg has directed or produced five of the 20 top-grossing films of
all time, including &quot;ET: The Extraterrestrial,&quot; &quot;Jurassic
Park&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple.&quot; His most recent film was the
internationally acclaimed &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; which received seven
Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, at the 1993 Academy Awards.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, he founded the new studio DreamWorks SKG with Jeffrey Katzenberg
and David Geffen. He is currently directing &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic
Park II&quot; for release next summer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a member (of the board), Spielberg will help approve major policies,
choose officers, and set up chief standards for the university,&quot; Sample
said. &quot;We are delighted to have such a renowned artist with us.&quot;<BR>

&quot;DINO-MITE OPPORTUNITY<BR>
When the follow-up to <I>Jurassic Park</I> (currently titled <I>Lost World</I>
) hits theaters next summer, the dinos will be back, but Sam Neill won't.
Instead, look fo little-known Vince Vaughn, 26, as a nature photog ensnared
in a plot to clone the reptiles. It was Vaughn's first starring vehicle,
<I>Swingers</I> (due Oct. 18 from Miramax), that caught director Steven
Spielberg's attention. Based on Vaughn's real-life escapades with costar-screenwriter
Jon Favreau, Swingers is a comedy about the buddies' quest for fun and women
in the L.A. lounge scene. &quot;It's so strange to think, Okay, I'm going
to work with Steven Spielberg and Julianne Moore,&quot; says Vaughn. He'd
better get used to the idea: <EM><STRONG>Filming begins Sept. 3</STRONG></EM>

&quot;MR. SPIELBERG BUILDS HIS DREAM HOME<BR>
<BR>
Steven Spielberg recently unveiled several features of his latest playground,
the new DreamWorks studio complex. Located in Playa Vista outside Los Angeles,
the new moviemaking facility is the first studio to be designed with significant
input from a director, and it incorporates some unique features that were
added to Spielberg's specifications. The new soundstages will have built-in,
fully automated lighting grids, and the studio's production offices will
have a view of the films being shot on the stages.<BR>
<BR>
Playa Vista will also boast a tank custom-designed for underwater filming,
&quot;something all directors are crying for,&quot; says Spielberg, and
the stages will also have removable skylights that will allow sets to be
lit by natural sunshine.<BR>
<BR>
Construction on the new complex is scheduled to begin before the end of
this year.&quot;</P>

&quot;MONSTER DEALS<BR>
<BR>
The big money in movies nowadays is in merchandising, which is why Universal
Studios easily lined up an impressive list of retail partners for its upcoming
<I>Jurassic Park</I> sequel <I>The Lost World</I> . Licensing deals have
been finalized with Hasbro, DreamWorks Interactive, Fruit of the Loom and
Sega of America and are nearly complete with Burger King and Mercedes-Benz.
Along with producing toys and dino-meals and so forth, Universal's promotional
partners are also expected to get product placement in the film, which starts
shooting this September. For instnace, Mercedes-Benz hopes to showcase its
new sport utility vehicle in much the same way that the Ford Explorer got
exposure in <I>Jurassic Park</I> .<BR>
<BR>
As for those pesky last minute details - hiring human actors - Jeff Goldblum
and Julianne Moore (<I>Assassins</I> ) have been signed to star in the film,
and Peter Stormare, who played a thug in <I>Fargo</I> , may join the cast
as well. We hear some guy named Spielberg is directing.&quot;</P>
