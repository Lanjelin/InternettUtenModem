<H3>'Flintstones' slate another big screen run</H3>

<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>It's yabba-dabba doo time again at Amblin Entertainment, where the saber-tooth
pencils are being sharpened for another whack at the Bedrock folks. While
a <A HREF="FLINTS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/flintstones2.html">sequel to &quot;The Flintstones&quot;</A>
has been technically in the cards since the first film was released, Fred
and Wilma's second outing now appears chiseled in stone. Seems top screenwriters
Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. (&quot;Top Gun,&quot; &quot;Dick Tracy,&quot;
&quot;Turner &amp; Hooch,&quot; &quot;Sister Act&quot;) are chipping away
at a new screenplay. Amblin will produce for Universal Pictures. Sources
indicated that &quot;Flintstones&quot; helmer Brian Levant has been approached
to direct the new film. (Cathy Dunkley)</P>
