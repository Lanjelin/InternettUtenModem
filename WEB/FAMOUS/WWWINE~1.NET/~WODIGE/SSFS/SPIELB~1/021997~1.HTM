<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>DreamWorks SKG has finalized the cast of Steven Spielberg's historical
drama <A HREF="AMISTA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/amistad.html">&quot;Amistad,&quot;</A> which rolls this week.
Joining <B>Anthony Hopkins</B> are <B>Nigel Hawthorne</B> and <B>Pete Postlethwaite</B>.
The reported deals for <B>Morgan Freeman</B>, <B>Djimon Honsou</B> and <B>Matthew
McConaughey</B> also closed, and they have joined the cast. The film, directed
by Spielberg from a script by David Franzoni and Steve Zaillian, will be
made in association with HBO Pictures. Debbie Allen and Colin Wilson will
produce, with DreamWorks Pictures co-heads Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald
serving as exec producers. Set in 1839, &quot;Amistad&quot; is the true
story of a revolt on the Spanish slave ship by 53 Africans. Captured off
the coast of Connecticut, the Africans are forced to stand trial for the
murders of the crew that held them prisoner. Joining in their fight is former
U.S. President John Quincy Adams, who is willing to fight all the way to
the Supreme Court. (Kirk Honeycutt)</P>
