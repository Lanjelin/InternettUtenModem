Spielberg will direct beginning next month. While unconfirmed by DreamWorks,
it is believed the studio is in negotiations with Morgan Freeman, Matthew
McConaughey and Djimon Hounsou to play major roles in the slave-ship drama.
Hopkins, most recently Oscar-nominated for his performance in the title
role of Oliver Stone's &quot;Nixon,&quot; was last seen in &quot;Surviving
Picasso.&quot; His most recent projects are 20th Century Fox's &quot;Bookworm&quot;

Spielberg is exec producing. &quot;Amistad&quot; is a true story of the
1839 revolt aboard the Spanish slave ship Amistad. The Africans were captured
off the coast of New England and landed in a trial before the Supreme Court
in which Adams represented the Africans. Rick Nicita of CAA represents the
actor. (Kirk Honeycutt)</P>
