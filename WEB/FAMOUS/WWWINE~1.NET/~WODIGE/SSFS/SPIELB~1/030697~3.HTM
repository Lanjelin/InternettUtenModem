<P><I>From Judith Sisson, co-ordinator of the Official Anthony Hopkins Fan
Club:</I></P>

<P>Oz magazine carries two page spread titled &quot;Latin in Black Satin&quot;
mainly about Antonio Banderas. It tells of the Zorro curse...bouts of flu
in this case and tells how the production's first distant location in San
Blas came to a complete halt.</P>

<P>Here are some extracts :</P>

<P>&quot;Producer Steven Spielberg was called and told of the misfortunes,
and the film's big stars Antonio and Sir Anthony Hopkins were told they
couldn't leave Mexico. Luckily neither star came down with the flu, although
Antonio developed strep throat and was unable to do some of his speaking
parts......</P>

<P>The only person who was hanging in was Anthony Hopkins he was one of
the few who remained in perfect health and in great spirits, despite his
shaven head for the role of Don Diego. When asked how he did it Anthony
replied 'I went to the doctor and was shot up with everything before I left'
</P>

<P>Another source adds: 'The only thing he (Anthony) tried to avoid was
the director...even though they are both Brits, things are just so-so between
them. Tony is a pro and just wants to complete the role.&quot;</P>

<P>The spread contains no pictures of Tony (only Antonio and Melanie G)....however
in &quot;Last Word&quot; section there is a small pic of him complete with
shaven head, polaroids and blue sweatshirt...the caption reads... &quot;Hair
Raising : Anthony Hopkins is the chameleon of actors transforming his looks
dramatically for such roles as Picasso, Nixon and Hannibal Lecter. Now his
role in Zorro has gone to his head - perhaps he got too close to the masked
man's slashing blade.&quot;</P>
