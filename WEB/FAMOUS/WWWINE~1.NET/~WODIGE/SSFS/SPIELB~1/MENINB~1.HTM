<P>PLOT:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>From the Sony movies website:<BR>
  They are the best kept secret in the universe. Working for a highly funded
  yet unofficial government agency, K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith)
  are the Men In Black, providers of immigration services and regulators
  of all things alien on earth. While investigating a series of unregistered
  close encounters, the MIB agents uncover the deadly plot of an intergalactic
  terrorist who is on a mission to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing
  galaxies currently in residence in New York City. In order to prevent worlds
  from colliding, K and J must track down the terrorist before the earth
  is destroyed in the bargain. They are our best, last, and only line of
  defense. They work in secret and they dress in black. From the director
  of Get Shorty and the producers of the box-office smash Twister comes the
  sci-fi adventure-comedy MEN IN BLACK -- protecting the earth from the scum
  of the universe.</P>
