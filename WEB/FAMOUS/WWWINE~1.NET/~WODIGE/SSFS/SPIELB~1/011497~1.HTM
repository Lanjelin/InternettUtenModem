<H3>Spielberg eyes British outpost for 'Ryan' shoot</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>LONDON -- Steven Spielberg's World War II drama &quot;<A HREF="SAVING~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/savingpr.html">Saving
Private Ryan</A>,&quot; starring Tom Hanks, looks set to shoot in the United
Kingdom, possibly in a disused government Ministry of Defense property.
Scouts on the Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks co-production are currently
searching for locations and studio space in the United Kingdom, a British
Film Commission spokeswoman confirmed Friday. If it shoots here, &quot;Saving
Private Ryan&quot; will join a growing list of major U.S. films preparing
to shoot in the United Kingdom this year, including New Line Cinema's &quot;Lost
in Space&quot; and Warner Bros.' &quot;The Avengers.&quot; (Louise Bateman)</P>
