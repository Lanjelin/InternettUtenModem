<H3>Force feeds new 'Encounters'</H3>

<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>Columbia Pictures is preparing a theatrical rerelease this fall of its
own 20-year-old science-fiction blockbuster, &quot;Close Encounters of the
Third Kind.&quot; It's one of several movies that studios are pulling out
of their libraries and preparing for major new theatrical runs in the wake
of the phenomenal success of the 20th anniversary special edition of &quot;Star
Wars,&quot; which grossed $70.8 million in its first 10 days of rerelease.
Warners, which now controls the pre-1986 MGM library, is discussing a 30th
anniversary release of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; next year. Paramount,
which has already announced a March 21 rerelease of &quot;The Godfather,&quot;
is also beefing up its previously planned rerelease of &quot;Grease&quot;
next year for that film's 20th anniversary. Sources say Paramount is also
seriously considering a 20th anniversary rerelease of &quot;Saturday Night
Fever&quot; this year. (Scott Hettrick)</P>
