<P>AMISTAD: ON LOCATION IN NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND (Newport Daily News)</P>

<P>Steven Speilberg and the actors in Amistad, are expected to arrive from
principal filming in Los Angeles on Tuesday, March 4th.  Filming is expected
to begin on Wednesday, March 5th at the Old Colony House and in and around
Washington Square in Newport, Rhode Island.  </P>

<P>Dreamworks SKG location manager Nick Bernstein and crews have spent the
past weeks changing parts of Downtown Newport into a working set.. crews
began placing dirt on the sidewalks and have already completed the removal
of electrical fixtures and store signs.  Monday will be a busy day for crews
as they put the finishing touches on the set.</P>

and 'JCT' (sent in by JCT):</I></P>

<P>From all accounts, shooting on Amistad should begin Wednesday of next
week. Hundreds of local residents, who have been cast as extras, are gathering
on a daily basis in the Rotunda at Easton' Beach for costume fittings. 
Of the thousands of costume pieces being used in the film most came from
England and Italy though I did hear a rumor that Spielberg himself purchased
a few vintage hats and other pieces from local antique merchants. </P>

<P>Matthew McConaughey and Morgan Freeman are expected to come to Newport
to shoot scenes but Anthony Hopkins and Nigel Hawthorne are not scheduled
to be on location at the present time.  </P>

<P>Much of the historic district downtown is being renovated to look like
the 1840's which isn't too difficult because Newport has a wealth of well
preserved Early American architecture.  There has been a considerable stir
about the fake jail being built at Queen Anne Square.  Some (a stodgy few)
locals are in an uproar because &quot;nothing should be built on city property&quot;
but most residents have welcome the changes, especially the dismantling
of money eating parking meters and ugly signage.  Several parents of the
free-spirited teenagers who typically fill the lawn below Trinity Church
are secretly hoping the jail remains after filming is completed. (I count
myself among those parents!)</P>
