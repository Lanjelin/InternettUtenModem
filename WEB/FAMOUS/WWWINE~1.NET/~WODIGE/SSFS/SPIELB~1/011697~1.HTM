<H3>Storyopolis spins tales with Spielberg, Harlin</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P> A new book to be published in association with the Starbright Foundation
and its patron, Steven Spielberg; an animated movie that will be co-produced
with Renny Harlin and Geena Davis; and a feature film that has Anthony Hopkins
attached to star as Napoleon are among several new projects unveiled Wednesday
by Storyopolis, the family entertainment company founded by software billionaire
Paul Allen. Through his connection with Starbright, Spielberg is supervising
the development of an untitled book based on a fairy tale that will be authored
by several different celebrities, &quot;with each celebrity telling it from
a different character's point of view in a 'Rashomon'-like way,&quot; said
senior vp Fonda Snyder. Snyder is a principal of the company along with
Allen, president Abbie Phillips and executive vp Dawn Heinrichs. (Stephen
