<P><I>From The Hollywood Reporter:</I></P>

<P>WASHINGTON (Reuter) - A Republican member of Congress Tuesday criticized
NBC television's showing of the Holocaust movie ``Schindler's List,'' saying
its airing during Sunday family time should outrage parents.</P>

<P>Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma was quoted in a release put out by his Oklahoma
office as saying the airing of the highly acclaimed film took network television
``to an all-time low, with full frontal nudity, violence and profanity being
shown in our homes.''</P>

<P>His criticism brought a response from Sen Alfonse D'Amato, a New York
Republican, who told the Senate Coburn's statement was ``shocking.''</P>

<P>``To equate the nudity of the Holocaust victims in the concentration
camp with any sexual connotations is outrageous and offensive,'' D'Amato
said.</P>

<P>Coburn, co-chairman of the Congressional Family Caucus, said that while
the film was given a rating for mature adult audiences, ``the fact that
it aired on public television on a Sunday evening during a family time should
outrage parents and decent-minded individuals everywhere.''</P>

<P>He added: ``I cringe when I realize that there were children all across
this nation watching this program. They were exposed to the violence of
multiple gunshot head wounds, vile language, full frontal nudity and irresponsible
sexual activity.</P>

<P>``It simply should not have been allowed on public television.''</P>

<P>Coburn said the airing of the movie demonstrated that the new TV rating
system ``only encourages more sex and violence.''</P>

<P>In a later statement, the congressman said this issue was whether it
was appropriate for young children to see the violence and nudity in the
movie.</P>

<P>``Schindler's List,'' he said ``was an excellent and informative program
that should not have been aired on a network'' when it could have been watched
by children.</P>
