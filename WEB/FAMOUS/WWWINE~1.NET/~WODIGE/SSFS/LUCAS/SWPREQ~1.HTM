<P>PLOT (concerning Episodes II and III also):</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Straight from George Lucas (Star Wars Insider Issue #26): &quot;It's
  a story about Ben Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker and how we got to the point
  where Obi-Wan Kenobi was waiting in the middle of the desert for something
  to happen. It's also about how Darth Vader got to be who he is, and how
  the Emperor came to power. It starts out with the Emperor not in power,
  then it keeps progressing. It'll be one twelve-hour movie when it's all
  finished.&quot;<BR>
  <BR>
  &quot;In the first film, [the main characters] are very young, although
  Obi-Wan is thirtyish. In Episodes Two and Three, Anakin is around twenty.
  Anakin is about the same age as Luke in Episode Four, and Obi-Wan is about
  forty then. The second two films take place almost continuously, a couple
  of years in between. At the end of the third film, Anakin is twenty-two,
  so A New Hope is about twenty years later when Obi-Wan is in his sixties.&quot;<BR>
  <BR>
  Producer RickMcCallum says that C-3PO and R2-D2 will be in the prequels,
  but in a different form. Yoda will also be in the prequels.</P>
