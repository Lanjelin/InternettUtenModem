<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I><BR>
<BR>
Now that 20th Century Fox's rerelease of &quot;<A HREF="SWSE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/lucas/swse.html">Star
Wars: The Special Edition</A>&quot; has exceeded all boxoffice projections
in North America, Luke Skywalker and company are ready for global conquest.
Commencing this spring, Fox is gearing up for a massive international &quot;Star
Wars&quot; theatrical blitz in 57 territories that virtually mimics the
U.S. marketing campaign. Not a kid or parent or potential toy buyer in the
civilized world, it seems, will be ignored. As Fox International president
Jim Gianopulos mused: &quot;What's our demographic? The human race is our
demographic.&quot; As successful as &quot;Star Wars&quot; was when it was
first released, prospects are that the March rerelease will be as big a
surprise internationally as it has been domestically. George Lucas' trilogy
will greatly expand its universal appeal thanks to much-higher name recognition,
improved media communication, greatly upgraded movie theater facilities
and brand-new audiences that are galaxies apart from the world of exhibition
in 1977. (James Ulmer and John Burman)<BR>
