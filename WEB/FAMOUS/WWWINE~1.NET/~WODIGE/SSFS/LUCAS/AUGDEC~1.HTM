A group of filmmakers -- including Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Bernardo
Bertolucci -- wrote to FCC commissioner Susan Ness Tuesday, stating opposition
to a Monday compromise over proposed digital TV standards that may favor
a 16:9 aspect ratio over alternate 2:1 aspect ratio. &quot;With the likelihood
of wider TV screens in the digital future, we are dismayed at the news that
the FCC has indicated that it may approve conclusions reached by negotiations
between computer industries, television broadcasters and television set
manufacturers that do not provide for redress of the grievance (regarding)
transmission in the digital world of the original aspect ratio of the motion
pictures we make,&quot; stated the letter by the Coalition of Film Makers.
Filmmakers fear most digital-TV broadcasts of their movies will continue
the historic alteration of theatrical-release images to fit on TV screens
of different proportions. (Carl DiOrio)</P>

In January, 20th Century Fox will begin rolling out an updated version of
its sci-fi trilogy, Star Wars, in the form of ``Star Wars Special Edition.''
To promote the product, Fox is launching unprecedented promotional tie-ins
and a wide release of between 1,850 and 2,000 prints. The studio is gambling
that the 20-year-old film and its two sequels can still pack 'em in. But
there is more than a trip down memory lane in the Star Wars extravaganza.
Variety reports Fox is hoping to win the rights to distribute George Lucas'
next Star Wars trilogy, which is in development.</P>

More than two decades after &quot;Star Wars&quot; rewrote the boxoffice
record books and ushered in the era of special effects megamovies, George
Lucas will make his return to feature film directing. <B><EM>Lucas confirmed
Wednesday that he will direct as well as produce the first installment of
his three &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels, which are set to go into production
in fall 1997.</EM></B> The first of three &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;prequels&quot;
planned by Lucas will essentially be the first chapter in the &quot;Star
Wars&quot; story, documenting the background of the main characters through
an exploration of their family roots. Lucas has begun circulating among
his intimates a first draft of the script, which one insider said was sure
to make for some eye-popping cinema, with numerous computer-generated characters.
&quot;It's practically an animated movie,&quot; the observer noted. (Paula

George Lucas is at it again. And all the studio bosses in Hollywood are
hoping the Force will be with them as each pleads with the filmmaker for
the chance to release three upcoming new installments in the Star Wars epic.<BR>
<BR>
It's been a long, dry spell for Star Warshippers since the last movie, Return
of the Jedi, hit theaters in 1983 (Fox released the original films but has
no rights to any sequels). Lucas is now working on a three-part prequel.
A source close to Lucas says he believes he can make the pictures at bargain
prices by current Hollywood standards. The goal is to hold budgets at around
$70 million , a feat that would be accomplished by using little-known actors
and a lot of the computer wizardry that Lucas develops so brilliantly. Sets
are already under construction in warehouses outside London. The release
date is summer 1999.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile Fox is preparing to release the original trilogy in theaters early
next year, restored and improved with some brief new sequences (the cantina
scene in Star Wars now includes additional characters, and there is also
a confrontation between Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt that didn't make it
into the original). Lest anyone doubt the public's interest in the series,
Fox re-released the trilogy as a boxed set on video last August and sold
22 million units domestically in six months.<BR>
<BR>
But it's the prospect of three brand-new Star Wars movies that has Hollywood's
studios salivating. The leading contenders appear to be Fox and Disney,
although Steven Spielberg hopes he can prevail upon his old friend Lucas,
the two made the Indiana Jones movies together, to give a big bang to Spielberg's
new company, DreamWorks. Sources close to Lucas doubt he'll slip his babies
into the untested DreamWorks distribution pipeline. A Fox executive adds
that Lucas has a keen sense of competition with Spielberg and is eager for
the original Star Wars to pass Jurassic Park at the box office. (The score
in the U.S. is Star Wars, $322 million; Jurassic Park, $357 million.) In
fact, it was the special-effects breakthroughs Lucas' Industrial Light &amp;
Magic created for Jurassic that convinced Lucas he could realize his vision
for the new episodes, which he has been planning since he first conceived
Star Wars.<BR>
<BR>
The likely also-rans Paramount, Warner, Universal and the rest have begun
courting Lucas, who remains holed up at his Marin County office. &quot;He
ain't easy to woo,&quot; laments a studio chairman. &quot;he's not easy
to get to.&quot; Handicappers say Lucas talks first to Fox, which has shown
its good faith by lavishing millions on the video boxed set and on redoing
the original trilogy for theaters. Fox also has a big bargaining chip: Lucas
owns the copyrights to the Empire and Jedi installments, but Star Wars belongs
to Fox. A friends says Lucas wants to complete his collection; Fox might
be willing to trade its copyright for an international film-and television-distribution
deal. But Disney also has something to barter: Lucas has his theme-park
deal there, and a source familiar with his thinking says the terms could
be sweetened. StarTours remains one of the most popular attractions at the
Disney parks.<BR>
<BR>
Whoever wins, Lucas will dictate the terms of the deal, which will require
the winning studio to accept a distribution fee and then get out of the
way. That means the bulk of the box-office revenue (as well as licensing
and all other sources for what will presumably be a massive revenue stream)
will go to Lucas. The distribution fee will be but a percentage of the gross
and with grosses like these, it's a seller's market.</P>

<BR>
LONDON -- George Lucas' new &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels, one of the highest-profile
movie projects of the decade, will be filmed at Great Britain's Leavesden
Studios. An agreement was signed Friday between Leavesden, Britain's newest
film studios, and JAK Productions Ltd., the British production unit of the
&quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels. Preproduction started Friday as well. Principal
photography is expected to begin in fall 1997. The deal is a coup for Leavesden,
which has not yet been fully converted but offers one of the world's largest
studio facilities. &quot;Star Wars,&quot; which will be 20 years old next
year, set a film industry record when it grossed roughly $500 million worldwide.
It has since been surpassed by &quot;E.T. The Extraterrestrial,&quot; &quot;Jurassic
Park&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; Lucas also is spending millions
to revamp the original series, which will be rereleased with new footage
and digital effects. (Louise Bateman)</P>
