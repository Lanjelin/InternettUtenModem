'Star Wars' rules boxoffice galaxy<BR>
For the third consecutive weekend 20th Century Fox's rerelease of &quot;Star
Wars&quot; has captured the top spot, beating back those who would usurp
its throne with a dazzling estimated four-day gross of $21.8 million. Continuing
to astound, &quot;Star Wars&quot; has now become the highest-grossing domestic
film ever with an estimated $421.8 million in cumulative boxoffice for all
releases. Along with &quot;Star Wars,&quot; strong performances by wide
releases helped power the four-day Presidents Day weekend to a record estimate
in the $120 million area. Sony's &quot;Absolute Power&quot; flexed its muscle
in the second spot with a strong estimate of $16.8 million for the four
days. Universal's &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; held well in the third slot with
an estimated $14.3 million, upping its total to an estimated $36.9 million.
Warner Bros.' &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; took its holiday in the fourth
spot. The comedy, starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo, took a gamble
with an estimated $13.1 million for the four-day period Sony's romantic
comedy &quot;Fools Rush In,&quot; starring Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek,
counted up an estimated $10 million for fifth. (Brian Fuson)<BR>
