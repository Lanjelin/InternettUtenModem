<H3>'Jedi' pushed back: Fox makes room for 'Empire'</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I><BR>
<BR>
The powerful performance of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back: Special Edition&quot;
this weekend has set into motion a game of musical chairs in the marketplace.
20th Century Fox has decided, as expected, to <B>push back by one week the
release of the final chapter in the trilogy, &quot;Return of the Jedi: Special
Edition,&quot;</B> in turn opening the door for Buena Vista to move up its
Tim Allen comedy &quot;Jungle 2 Jungle&quot; into the spot vacated by &quot;Jedi.&quot;
&quot;Jedi&quot; will now go out March 14, providing a three-week window
for &quot;Empire&quot; to fully exploit its engagements. &quot;Empire&quot;
earned that right by returning $22 million during its first three days,
good enough for the top spot at the weekend boxoffice. The highly anticipated
&quot;Jungle&quot; was quickly moved into the March 7 slot, where it will
oppose Paramount's Howard Stern comedy &quot;Private Parts.&quot; This change
makes sense in that the two features will not substantially compete for
the same audience, with &quot;Jungle&quot; playing primarily to families
and younger kids while &quot;Parts&quot; works the male adolescent market.
