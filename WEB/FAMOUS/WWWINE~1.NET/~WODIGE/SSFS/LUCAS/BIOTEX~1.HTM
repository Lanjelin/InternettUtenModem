<FONT SIZE=+2>The Biography</FONT></H1>

<P>George Lucas was born on May 14, 1944 in Modesto, California. As a teenager,
Lucas was a racing car enthusiast, but gave up competitive driving after
a crash that crushed his lungs. For two years he attended Modesto Junior
college and then moved to Los Angeles to attend the Cinema School at the
University of Southern California. During school he made several prize-winning
films, including the short THX-1138: 4EB/Electronic Labyrinth which took
the first prize at the 1965 National Student Film Festival. Based on his
success at school, Lucas was awarded a scholarship which enabled him to
observe the production of Francis Ford Coppola's Finians Rainbow (1968).
He became Coppola's protege and was hired as a production assistant on The
Rain People (1969). During production, Lucas produced a two-hour documentary
about the making of the film, Filmmaker. Coppola then helped Lucas to finance
his first feature as a director, THX-1138 (1971), an expanded version of
his prize-winning science fiction short.<BR>
<BR>
Lucas' next film is still considered one of the biggest successes of low
budget filmmaking. In just 28 nights and on a budget of just over $700,000,
he directed American Graffiti (1973), a nostagic, highly autobiographical
recreation of adolescent life in the early sixties. It was a smashing success,
earning $55 million domestically, becoming one of the most profitable films
in history. Not only did the public enjoy the film, but critics did as well,
and the Academy nominated it for five Oscars - including Best Picture, Best
Director, and Best Screenplay.<BR>
<BR>
With a huge success under his belt, Lucas went on to create his most famous
project. Star Wars (1977), a space fantasy that had been in the director's
head since he became interested in film, was realized after three years
of prepartion and shooting. The film was given a tight budget, due to the
public's low interest in sci-fi features. Nevertheless, the film boasted
some of the most complex and imaginative special effects audiences had ever
seen. With its compelling story of good versus evil, George Lucas had created
a new mythological tale which captivated audiences everywhere. The film
eventually grossed $194 million and Lucas was again nominated for director
and screenwriter. The film garnered eight more - including Best Picture
- capturing Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Sound, Best Music Score,
Best Costume Design, and Best Editing.<BR>
<BR>
The Star Wars phenomenon was followed by two sequels which Lucas did not
direct, but executive produced and wrote the story. The Empire Strikes Back
(1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) again made huge profits and secured
Lucas' place as one of the most successful producers ever. With the money
from these blockbusters, Lucas was able to form his own production company.
He built a filming compound near San Francisco, Skywalker Ranch, which housed
Lucasfilm and his special effects company, Industrial Light &amp; Magic
(ILM). From the complex, he produced and inspired Spielberg's adventure
blockbuster, Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), which was followed by Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
(1989).<BR>
<BR>
Lucas also produced smaller features and also developed television films
and series. He has also created LucasArts which produces multimedia software
for educational and entertainment uses.<BR>
<BR>
During the 80s and early 90s, rumors kept surfacing and resurfacing about
new episodes in the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series. Lucas has finally
confirmed that the <A HREF="SWPREQ~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/lucas/swprequels.html">prequels to Star Wars</A> (Episodes
I, II, and III) will be produced and there has been talk of a <A HREF="../SPIELB~1/INDY4~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/spielberg/indy4.html">fourth
Indiana Jones film</A>. Lucas has spent the last year writing the next Star
Wars trilogy and has begun overseeing their production at Skywalker Ranch
and Leavesdon Studios in London. Lucas has also announced that he will end
his long directorial hiatus and direct the first of the new trilogy. Currently,
ILM is putting the finishing touches on <A HREF="SWSE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/lucas/swse.html">The Star Wars
Trilogy Special Edition</A>, a digitally enhanced rerelease of the original
