<H3>Star Wars 5th Weekend, Empire 2nd weekend report</H3>

<P><I>From the Hollywood Reporter:</I><BR>

'Brasco' plays against youth <BR>
The strong debut of Sony's &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; and the degree of decline
for 20th Century Fox's &quot;The Empire Strikes Back: Special Edition&quot;
during its second session were the big stories at the boxoffice this past
weekend. &quot;Brasco&quot; marshaled a mostly mature male customer into
a muscular $11.7 million three-day debut to take No. 2, while No. 1 &quot;Empire,&quot;
with a boxoffice take of $13.1 million, remained a family-oriented enterprise
augmented by sturdy teenage and young-adult attendance. Third place went
to &quot;Star Wars: Special Edition&quot; with $6.6 million. The other new
wide release for the weekend, Sony's &quot;Booty Call,&quot; raised $6.4
million. Sony's &quot;Absolute Power&quot; continued to contribute, returning
$5.7 million in its third weekend. (Roger Cels)</P>

<P>NOTE: &quot;Empire&quot; has now become the ninth-highest-grossing domestic
boxoffice earner in history with an estimated cume for all releases of $262.4
million, just behind $263.7 million for Fox's &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot;</P>

<P>NOTE:&quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;  together
made up 44% of the total of the top 10 films for the month of February.<BR>
