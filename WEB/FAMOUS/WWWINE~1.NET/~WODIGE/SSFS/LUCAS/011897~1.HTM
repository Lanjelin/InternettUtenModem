re-release of Star Wars on the morning of Saturday, January 18. The premiere
was seen by many as a belated one, because when the film was released in
1977, there was no such fanfare. Crowds of people flocked to see the celebrities
arrive at the Mann Westwood Village Theatre in Los Angeles, California.
Among the honored guests: George Lucas, Steven Spielberg (pictured), John
Williams, Ben Burtt (sound design for the new film and the special edition),
visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and
Sharon Stone. Also on hand were fan favorites Darth Vader, C-3PO, R2-D2,
Boba Fett, Chewbacca, Admiral Ackbar, and many other assorted alien creatures.
The film is released to the public on January 31, 1997. Many theaters have
begun to sell advanced tickets for opening weekend.</P>
