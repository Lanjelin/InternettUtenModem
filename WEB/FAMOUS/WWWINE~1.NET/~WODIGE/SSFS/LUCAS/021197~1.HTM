About the only thing that's had more publicity than Pat Boone in the past
couple of weeks is the return of ''<A HREF="SWSE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.inetworld.net/~wodige/ssfs/lucas/swse.html">Star Wars</A>'' after
20 years. The rerelease of George Lucas' classic film has created box-office
history, with the highest opening weekend of any reissue, and it's also
created a piece of history on The Billboard 200. For the first time, the
soundtracks to ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' appear on the
album chart simultaneously. Issued in deluxe editions by RCA Victor, ''Star
Wars: A New Hope'' moved from 68 to 50 and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' enters
at No. 60. The original ''Star Wars'' soundtrack peaked at No. 2 and was
on the chart for 53 weeks, last appearing the week of June 17, 1978. The
original ''Empire'' soundtrack debuted on May 17, 1980, and peaked at No.
