'The Empire' strikes gold <BR>
Striking another victory for the Force at the nation's boxoffice, 20th Century
Fox's rerelease of <B>&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; took in an estimated
bounty of $22.4 million</B> and did something no other film has been able
to do for the past three weekends -- take the top spot away from Fox's &quot;Star
Wars.&quot; &quot;Empire's&quot; weekend boxoffice gives it the biggest
February opening ever, surpassing Universal's &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; ($18.5
million), which only held the crown for two weeks. As the second film rereleased
in the trilogy, <B>&quot;Empire&quot; has now moved from the 15th highest-grossing
domestic film to the 11th, with an estimated total of $245 million for all
reissues.</B> Meanwhile &quot;Star Wars,&quot; already the top-grossing
domestic film ever, moved that bar higher with a new cumulative gross of
an estimated $438.7 million. Sony's &quot;Absolute Power&quot; commanded
the third spot with an estimated $9 million. Universal's &quot;Dante's Peak&quot;
garnered an estimated $7 million in its third weekend to flow into fourth.
Warner Bros. &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; held fairly well in its second weekend
with estimated winnings of $6.6 million betting on the fifth slot. (Brian

<P>'Empire Strikes Back' Tops At Box Office</P>

<P>LOS ANGELES (Reuter) - Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader ruled the U.S.
box office for the fourth consecutive weekend, but this time in a new movie
-- the re-release of ``The Empire Strikes Back,'' according to studio estimates
released Sunday.</P>

<P>The second movie in the ``Star Wars'' trilogy pulled in an estimated
$22.4 million during the Friday to Sunday period, setting a new record for
a February opener. The previous record was held by ``Dante's Peak,'' which
opened with $18.5 million two weeks ago.</P>

<P>``Empire'' averaged $10,592 from 2,110 screens. Meanwhile, ''Star Wars''
slipped to second with $11.0 million after three weeks at the top.</P>

<P>Originally released in 1980, ``The Empire Strikes Back'' has now earned
a total of $245 million at the U.S. box office. First time around, it opened
on a Wednesday (May 21) on just 126 screens and earned $9.6 million in its
first seven days.</P>

<P>The lifetime total for ``Star Wars'' rose to $438.7 million domestically,
which includes $115.9 million from the reissue. This weekend, it averaged
$5,000 after increasing its screen count by 96 to 2,200.</P>

<P>``If 'Star Wars' wasn't in the marketplace, 'Empire' would have done
more,'' said Tom Sherak, chairman of 20th Century Fox's domestic film group,
who said he was thrilled with the film's opening nonetheless.</P>

<P>The studio is considering delaying the secheduled March 7 re-release
of the third part of the trilogy ``Return of the Jedi'' to give ``Empire''
three clear weeks at the box office, Sherak said. At present, ``Jedi'' would
be competing with Howard Stern's ``Private Parts,'' while March 14 offers
Tim Allen's ''Jungle2Jungle.'' Jim Carrey's ``Liar, Liar'' opens March 21.</P>

<P>The top 10 contained just one other new entry, the historical race drama
``Rosewood'' from director John Singleton. The movie opened in eighth with
$3.2 million. Playing in 991 theaters, the movie averaged a reasonable $3,229.</P>

<P>Slipping one notch to third was the Clint Eastwood White House thriller
``Absolute Power,'' which earned $9.0 million in its second weekend. Its
10-day total is $28.7 million.</P>

<P>Also down one place each were ``Dante's Peak'' at fourth and ''Vegas
Vacation'' at fifth. The former, a volcano drama, earned $7.0 million to
take its three-week total to $45.4 million. ''Vegas Vacation,'' a comedy
starring Chevy Chase, earned $6.6 million, giving it a 10-day total of $21.4
million.<BR>
