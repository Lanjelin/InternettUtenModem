<P>Good Return on 'Star Wars'</P>

<P>The blockbuster revival of &quot;Star Wars'' is all the more remarkable
when you consider its humble and shaky beginning. The original was made
for a mere $10 million and the tuned-up version brought in $36 million over
the weekend, pushing its grand total to $359 million. George Lucas had to
rush to make the movie's premiere date 20 years ago. He reportedly was five
weeks behind schedule in filming when the studio gave him one week to finish.
Lucas had to beg for another $20,000 so he could film several key sequences,
including the now-famous bar scene. He spent 18- and 20-hour days putting
the film together and had to be rushed to the hospital at one point with
chest pains. The ordeal was so much that he swore he'd never direct another
movie -- and he hasn't.</P>

<P>Webmaster note: &quot;Star Wars&quot; is now the number 2 highest grossing
film of all time, jumping ahead of Spielberg's Jurassic Park ($357 million)
but still below E.T. ($399 million).</P>
