  STAR WARS: EPISODE IV A NEW HOPE<BR>
  Release Date: January 31, 1997</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>
The rerelease of the original film comes during its twentieth anniversary.
Industrial Light and Magic is restoring the actual original negative and
improving sound quality for THX and digital sound. In order to make the
film as close to George Lucas' original vision, some changes/additions are
being made and a total of four minutes (about 75 shots) are being added:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The scene where Jabba the Hutt confronts Han at Mos Eisley will be
  added. A computer generated (CG) Jabba will interact with 20 year old film
  footage of Harrison Ford. Boba Fett also makes a guest appearance in this
  scene.<BR>
  
  <LI>The Mos Eisley spaceport will look more like a spaceport. New computer
  generated creatures/aliens (a &quot;ronto&quot;) will be added, in addition
  to more spaceships taking off and landing at the spaceport.<BR>
  
  <LI>Digital effects showcasing the hovering effect of Luke's landspeeder
  will be added.<BR>
  
  <LI>When the stormtroopers are on Tatooine, we will be able to see them
  on moving dewbacks (the large green creatures glipsed briefly in the 1977
  version). There is also a CG stormtrooper which producer Rick McCallum
  says &quot;will blow people away.&quot;<BR>
  
  <LI>The matte lines around the spaceships in the end battle sequence will
  be removed.<BR>
  
  <LI>According to Rick McCallum, there are also &quot;other tiny little
  things that George has added that are really fun.&quot;
