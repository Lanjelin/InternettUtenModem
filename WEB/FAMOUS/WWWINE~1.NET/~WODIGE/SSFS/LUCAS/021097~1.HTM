<BR>
20th Century Fox's &quot;Star Wars&quot; cooled the boxoffice flow for Universal's
big-budget &quot;Dante's Peak&quot; as the classic sci-fi adventure blazed
to the top spot for the second consecutive weekend with a stellar estimate
of $22.8 million, besting &quot;Dante's&quot; strong opening estimate of
$18.6 million. The George Lucas-helmed reissue continues to defy naysayers
as the film dropped a modest 36% from its opening weekend and has amassed
a stunning total estimate of $69.3 million in 10 days. Its total domestic
boxoffice estimate, including all reissues, now stands at $392 million.
Other wide releases this weekend included Paramount's &quot;The Beautician
and the Beast,&quot; which debuted in the third slot with an estimated $4
million. Sony's long-legged &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; held the fourth slot
with an estimated $3.6 million. Dimension's &quot;Scream&quot; continued
its successful run, as the Wes Craven-helmed thriller was fifth with an
estimate of $3.5 million.<BR>
