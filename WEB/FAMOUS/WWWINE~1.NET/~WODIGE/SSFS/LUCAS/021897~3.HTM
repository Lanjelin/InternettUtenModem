20th Century Fox's &quot;Star Wars&quot; crossed the threshold of another
record on Thursday night as the classic sci-fi adventure became the highest-grossing
film in U.S.-Canadian boxoffice history, with its cumulative gross of all
six releases estimated at $421.8 million. &quot;Star Wars&quot; swept by
the previous long-held record of Universal's &quot;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,&quot;
which posted -- before now -- an untouched record of $399 million. The Fox
film doesn't show signs of slowing up, continuing to surprise industry analysts
as it easily took the top spot for the last three weekends. The latest four-day
weekend brought in an estimated $21.8 million, bringing its total for this
release to around $99.1 million in 18 days, a remarkable performance for
any film. Ironically, the only film that may be able to unseat &quot;Star
Wars&quot; from the top spot in the foreseeable future is the second film
in the trilogy, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; which is opening this
weekend. (Brian Fuson)<BR>
