<P><I>From the Reuters/Variety Entertainment Summary:</I><BR>
<BR>
``Star Wars'' regained the crown as the top-grossing film in North America
when it became the first film to break the $400 million box office barrier
Thursday (Feb. 13). The 1977 production ceded its crown to ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''
in 1982. It reached the new height of $400.1 million exactly two weeks after
its latest reissue. ``E.T.'' has grossed $399.8 million. ''Star Wars'' opened
to record business in May 1977, grossing about $279 million to dethrone
``Jaws'' as the domestic box office champ. A reissue the following year
added about $44 million to its gross, and the overseas box office put another
$200 million in the coffers. <BR>
