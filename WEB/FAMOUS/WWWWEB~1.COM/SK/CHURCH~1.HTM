Bishop Jakob Peter Mynster &#40;1775-1854&#41;
 </font></TR></TD></TABLE></CENTER><P>

 The  event  which  set  things in  train was  the death  of Bishop
 Mynster.  Mynster  had  been  Bishop   of  Sj&aelig;lland   and  Primate
 of  the  Church  of  Denmark  for  twenty  years.  He  had  been a
 great  influence on  old Michael  Pedersen Kierkegaard,  and part-
 ly in deference to  his father  the son  had continued  to respect
 the  great  prelate.  Mynster was,  first and  foremost, a  man of
 wide  culture  and  a  man  of the  world. There  is no  reason to
 doubt his personal piety, but it was inseparable from  his general
 culture, which drew  its strength  as much  from the  Classics and
 Goethe  as from  the Gospels.  In S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard as  the years
 pass  we  find  a growing  criticism of  the ageing  bishop, whose
 form  of  Christianity  seemed  to  him  an  adulteration. "Bishop
 Mynster's service  to Christianity,  really, is  that by  his considerable
  personality,  his  culture,  his prominent  position in
 fashionable  circles,  he  developed the  fashion, or  solemn convention,
  that  Christianity  was something  no person  of culture
 could  do  without.  To  an eternal  and Christian  view, however,
 this is  a rather  ambiguous service.  For surely  Christianity is
 much  too great  to be  patronized. And  in his  earnestness there
 is  something of  a  melange  --  so touched,  so deeply  moved, he
 is at the thought of its past glories, and yet,  when it  comes to
 the point,  so sensitive  about being  ever so  slightly belittled
 himself...  And  yet  I  love  Bishop  Mynster, and  it is  my one
 desire to do all that I can to enhance his reputation; for  I have
 admired  him,  and,  as  a  man,  admire  him still.  And whenever
 I  can  do  something  to  his  advantage, I  think of  my father,
 whom I think it pleases." <P>                                       

   That  was  what  Kierkegaard  wrote in  his journals  in 1848.
 Later  the  tone grew  sharper: "In  the splendid  Palace Chapel
 an  imposing  Court  preacher,  the  chosen  of  the  cultivated
 public, steps forward before a chosen circle of  the fashionable
 and cultivated public and  preaches emotionally  on the  text of
  the  Apostle:  'God  chose  the  mean and  despised' --  and nobody
  laughs!"  <P>

    Mynster, for his  part, did  not care  for Kierkegaard  and kept
  him  at arm's  length, rightly  seeing him  as a  dangerous rebel.
  But in spite of the latent conflict  between the  two, Kierkegaard
  continued  to  show  deep  respect  for  Mynster while  the bishop
  lived. He thought that he owed this to his father's memory. <P>      
    But  in  1854  Mynster  died  and  was  succeeded  by Martensen,
  a  man  of  some  standing:  his  Christian  Dogmatics  enjoyed  a
  European  reputation,  and  he  had  made  studies   of  Christian
  mysticism,  exemplified  especially  in   Jacob  B&ouml;hme,   who  had
  opened  up  new  vistas. But  he, too,  was an  orthodox Hegelian,
  having  the  self-assumed  task of  confuting the  subjectivity of
  Romantic  morals  through  a  "theoretical  knowledge   of  objectivity,
 of the absolute form of the State and religion, of science
  and   art."   Thus   his   theological  writing   became  markedly
  speculative in its character, culminating  in the  dogmatics which
  systematized  the  Christian  world  of  ideas  down to  the order
  of precedence among the angels. <P>                                  
    For  this man  Kierkegaard could  have no  sympathy at  all; and
  when,  in  his  memorial  sermon  on  Bishop  Mynster, he  went so
  far as to call  him "a  witness to  the truth",  thereby promoting
  the admired and idolized Mynster, in a  way, to  the ranks  of the
  martyrs,  Kierkegaard  could  contain  himself  no   longer.  This
  struck  him  as  blasphemy, and  as a  distortion of  every Christian value.
 There had to be a protest now! <P>                       
    It was the starting point of the final phase of  his authorship,
  in  which  Kierkegaard  abandoned  his   pseudonymity  and   in  a
  series of pamphlets addressed the general public direct,  in order
  to open its eyes to the falsification of Christianity that was being
 carried out by the clergy in Christianity's name.  The attacks
  culminated  in  the  publication  of  the  little  journal  called
 <i>&Oslash;jeblikket</i>  (The  Instant),  which  appeared  in nine  issues. The
  tenth was ready for publication  when he  collapsed in  the street
 and had to be  taken to  hospital, where  he died  shortly afterwards, 
shattered by the great internal strain imposed by  his recent activities.

  The last years of his life thus marked  an intense  outburst of
 production,  in  which  his  work  to some  extent acquired  a new
 content, and to a great extent a new form. In  his desire  to find
 an  audience  he  abandoned  his former  exclusive form  to become
 broad,  popular,  even  demagogic,  his  style coming  to resemble
 the journalism he had despised.  <P>                                

 As  regards content,  the last  publications added  nothing new,
 but  they  were  new  in  that  it  was  Kierkegaard  himself  who
 spoke, and not his pseudonyms. <P>                                  
   This  is bound  up with  the aim  he had  set himself.  He spoke
 in  his  own  name,  not  in order  to rebuke  the Church  and the
 clergy for not fulfilling the strict demands of  Christianity (for
 he was well aware that  neither they  nor he  could do  that), but
 because,  while  they  failed,  they  refused  to admit  that they
 neither  could  nor  would  conform  to  the  demands,  preferring
 to live in domestic comfort and prosperity and  worldly culture,
 while trying to make themselves and the world believe  that this
 was the meaning of Christianity.
