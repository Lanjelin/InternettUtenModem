Then she said to me: Forgive me for what I have done to you. I answered: It was I, after all, who should ask that. She said: Promise to think of me. I did so. She said: Kiss me. I did -- but without passion. Merciful God!

 In 1840 he  became engaged  to a  eighteen-year-old girl
 of  the  Copenhagen  upper  classes,  named  Regine   Olsen,  whom
 he  had known  and felt  drawn to  for a  year or  more. Scarcely,
 however,  had  the  engagement  taken  place  when  he   began  to
 have  scruples. To  quote the  journals: "On  the second  day (after  
the  engagement)  I  saw I  had been  wrong. Penitent  that I
 was -- my vita ante acta, my melancholy -- that was enough!" <P>

September 8 I left home determined to resolve the whole thing. We met on the street outside their house. She said that there was no one at home. I was rash enough to take this as the invitation I needed. I went in with her. there we stood, the two of us, alone in the parlor. She was somewhat restless. I asked her to play the piano for me as she usually did. She does so, but it does not interest me. I suddenly take the music book, shut it not without a certain vehemence, throw it on the piano, and say: O, what do I care about music, it is you I seek, for two years I have been seeking you. She was silent. <P>
... If I had not been a penitent, if I had not had my <I>vita ante acta</I>, if I had not had my depression --- mariage to her would have made me happier than I had ever dreamed of becoming. But being the person I unfortunately am, I must say that I could become happier in my unhappiness without her than with her --- she had touched me deeply, and I willingly, or even more than willingly, would have done everything.

   Kierkegaard  realized,  in  short,  that  he could  not overcome
 his melancholy, and he  felt unable  to confide  in the  girl what
 he believed to be its causes. The figure of his father  barred the
 way; and the tragedy of the family  curse was  a thing  that could
 not be revealed. He  was thrown  back upon  himself and  his solitude,
 and was  incapable of  "realizing the  universal" --  that is
 to  say,  incapable of  human relationships,  of opening  his mind
 to others, or even of taking Church  office, as  he had  often intended
 but never did. <P>                                           
   Two  months  later  he  had  made  up  his  mind  that he would
 not be justified in attaching this light-hearted girl  to himself,
 and  perhaps  making  her unhappy  by his  melancholy. Yet  a broken
  engagement  was  in  those  days  a  serious   matter,  which
 could reflect  unfavourably on  the woman  in particular.  To save
 Regine, Kierkegaard  therefore decided  to take  all the  blame on
 himself, and in  such a  way that  it would  be clear  to everyone
 that  it  was she  who had  broken off  the engagement,  and could
 hardly  do otherwise.  So for  several months  he played  the part
 of  an irresponsible  philanderer, noisily  showing off  in public
 and   seeking  by   every  means   to  turn   appearances  against
 himself.  <P>

The only drawing known from Kierkegaards hand. It is from a letter to Regine, written during the initial period of the engagement. "The person with the telescope is me", Kierkegaard wrote. Looking for his fiancee. </font></TR></TD></TABLE></CENTER><P>
                                                      
   In this  he succeeded,  except in  the eyes  of Regine,  who saw
 through  him and  refused to  accept the  breach. The  affair thus
 became  doubly  distressing  for  both  of  them.  When  the break
 was  a fact,  Kierkegaard wrote  in his  journals: "When  the bond
 broke, my feeling was:  Either you  plunge into  wild dissipation,
 or absolute religiosity -- of  a sort  different from  the parson's
 melange." <P>                                                       
   He chose the latter.  But at  the same  time he  chose something
 else:  he  chose  authorship.  It  was  in  November 1841  that he
 broke definitively with Regine.  Two weeks  later he  travelled to
 Berlin (the only place abroad that he ever saw, and that  he visited
 three times), so as  to escape  from the  scene of  these agonizing
  experiences.  And  there  he  began to  write. It  came over
  him  like  a  torrent, driving  him ceaselessly  on during  the next
  ten  years  --  the  most  concentrated  period  of output  ever displayed
  by  a  Danish  author, and  surely one  of the  most compact
  in world literature.<P>
