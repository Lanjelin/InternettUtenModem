Perhaps the most famous and certainly the most flattering portrait of S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard. Drawing by his cousin Niels Christian Kierkegaard.

   In  <i>Fear  and  Trembling</i>  he  again  considers  the relationship
 with  Regine:  a  relationship  which obsesses  him because  of an
 understandable  sense  of  guilt.  The  chief protagonist  in this
 short  book  is  Abraham,  who  was  ready  to  sacrifice  his own
 child  at  God's  command.  Kierkegaard's  father  had  sacrificed
 his child -- or at any rate  its happiness  -- for  God in  the same
 way; and  he had  been ready  to sacrifice  Regine for  the same
 reason. In his own  case, it  had meant  that he  had sacrificed
 what was most precious to him in this world; he had renounced.<P>
   But  Abraham  had  been  restrained  at  the last  moment, and
 after  he had  shown absolute  obedience to  God had  been given
 back his child.  And applying  this experience  to his  own personal
  case,  Kierkegaard  realized  the connection:  if Abraham
 had his son returned to him, while he had to renounce  his relations
 with  Regine, it  was because  Abraham had  understood the
  deepest  meaning  of  absolute  obedience  to  the  absolute.  That
  is what we call faith; and in  faith lies  the conviction  that for
  God  all  things  are  possible. It  follows that  the man  who has
  faith  does   not  need   to  renounce.   The  man   who  renounces
  proves in doing so  that he  lacks faith;  or, as  Kierkegaard says
  in the entry in the journals  dated May  1843, that  is to  say, at
  the  time  he  was working  on <I>Fear  and Trembling</i>:  "If I  had had
  faith  I  should  have  kept  to  Regine."  And  he  adds:  "Faith,
  therefore, has hope of this life as well, but only by virtue of the
  absurd,  not  because  of  human  reason;  otherwise  it  would  be
  mere  worldly  wisdom, not  faith." In  fact, he  now sees  that at
  the  time  when he  believed a  marriage to  be impossible  and renounced
  it  he  should  have had  faith, when  he would  have been
  filled with the conviction that  for God  all things  are possible,
  even, against all reason, the  ability to  make an  impossible marriage
 possible; and  in that  belief he  should have  remained true
  to  Regine.  This  idea  he  sets down  philosophically in  what he
  terms "the double movement  of infinity",  which consists  in first
  breaking   with   finiteness  but   being  then   enabled,  through
  religion, to recover it. Thus it is possible to  make life  in this
  world  compatible  with  life  in   God  after   all.  Renunciation
  brings  man  into  a  negative  relationship  with  the  world, but
  faith brings him back into a positive relationship with it.<P>

    This  whole  chain of  reasoning can  be said  to have  been suggested
  by  the  nod  which  Regine allowed  herself when  she happened
  to  meet  her  former  fiance  one  Sunday  morning  as they
  were  both  leaving  church.  The  consequence, as  he saw  it, was
  the  renewed possibility  of achieving  a marriage,  in one  way or
  another,  and  in  one  form  or  another;  a  consequence,  be  it
  noted,  of  the  absurd, by  which he  means by  virtue of  a logic
  outside  the  reach  of  human  comprehension  and   therefore,  to
  human eyes, absurd or paradoxical. <P> 
 
    The  paradoxical  aspect  of  religion   may  also   entail  that
  religion, in certain situations, can conflict with  ethical demands
 and  so  appear  immoral.  God's  commandment  to  Abraham  to
 sacrifice Isaac was requiring him to act like a  murderer; and
 when Kierkegaard  was obliged  to break  with Regine  this was
  contrary  to the  ordinary view  of ethics.  These are  the problems
  Kierkegaard  discusses  in  Fear  and  Trembling,  in   the  chapter
  which   carries   the   rather   involved   heading:  "Is   there  a
  teleological suspension of the ethical;  that is  to say,  are there
  situations  in  which  a  man  can  be  forced to  disregard ethical
  demands   for   a  higher   authority?"  Kierkegaard   answers  this
  question  in  the  affirmative;  and  it  is in  just this  that the
  paradoxical character of religion is made plain,  since it  can lead
  to  demands  which,  from  the  point  of  view of  ordinary ethics,
  are unethical. <P>

    We  should  remember,  however,  that  it  is  a  question   of  a
  suspension,  not  an  abolition  of the  ethical, and  suspension is
  temporary.  So  he  says:  "What is  suspended is  not lost,  but is
  preserved in the higher function  that is  its telos,  its purpose."
  The ethical thus asserts itself as the basis of human  life, lifting
  it out of the  aesthetic sphere  and bringing  it into  harmony with
  the  claims  of the  universal, which  in turn  are a  reflection of
  the religious claims.<P>                                               
    But  then  comes  the  question  of  why  some  people  are placed
  in such a situation by  God that  they have  to act  in a  way which
  must  bring  them  --  if  only  temporarily  --  into  conflict  with
  ethics.  And  who  are  they?  They  are  the  people  who,  whether
  by  a judgment  of God  or by  guilt, have  got outside  the universal,
 the ethical. That guilt puts a man outside the ethical is selfevident,
  guilt  being  by  definition a  breach with  the universal
  or  ethical.  The  judgment  of  God  is  another  matter,   for  it
  signifies  that  there are  men whom  God has  chosen for  a special
  mission,  and  who  cannot,  therefore,  be  measured  by  the  same
  yardstick as others. <P>                                               


    The  man  who  puts  himself  by  guilt  outside  the  universal --
  as indeed all  men do  -- can  bring himself  back within  the claims
  of  ethics only  by virtue  of the  absurd; in  other words,  by the
  faith that for God all things  are possible.  But he  cannot achieve
  this without first  learning to  renounce. For,  rightly considered,
 guilt consists in clinging to this world and setting it  above the
 kingdom  of  God;  that  is  to  say,  by  committing  oneself absolutely
 to the relative and relatively to the absolute.  Hence it
 is an essential  requirement that  one should  first learn  to renounce
 and  be willing  to abjure  the things  of this  world; and
  then, since  for God  nothing is  impossible, it  is possible  that by
  virtue   of  faith   in  God's   omnipotence,  which   can  accomplish
  what  to  the  human   mind  is   impossible  and   therefore  absurd,
  one  will  recover  a positive  relationship to  this world.  Faith in
  the  absurd,  in  other  words,  is  the same  as the  double movement
  of infinity.
