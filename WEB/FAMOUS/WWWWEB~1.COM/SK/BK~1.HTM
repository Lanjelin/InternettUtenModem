The contributors to this volume provide an objective presentation of the historical background and development of Kierkegaard's view of Christianity. Each author has drawn his own conclusions, and though their views may not always be in harmony, the editors have naturally not tried to unify them.

Kierkegaard's view of the Bible is treated from the standpoint of "revelation", his assesment of prayer and the life of prayer, his view of Christianity, from the perspective of the absurd, seriousness, inwardness.<BR>
Reference is made to Kierkegaard's views on Christian virtues, love, and mercy, and from the perspective of corrective is presented Kierkegaard's understanding of an apostle's role and the Christian who must deny himself in order to die from the world. - Did Kierkegaard wish to reintroduce asceticism? This volume deals with the problem together with the subject of death.

Kierkegaard's world of thought was affected by the philosophical streams and discussion of his time. He actively took part in the critique of philosophical systems as well as thinkers of his century. He evaluated them in his own way, both psychologically and philosophically, confronting them with older disciplines, i.e. Aristotelian logic, and with the values of Christianity.<BR>
This volume offers both longer and shorter articles, written by recognized Kierkegaard specialists, all presenting an analysis of a special concept or a distinctive problem, important for understanding the work of the Danish philosopher.

Kierkegaard and Speculative Idealism

This volume shows Kierkegaard's opposition to philosophical systems which reduced man to an insignificant non-entity and, with premature optimism, understood world historical development as a progress towards Utopia, an imagined paradise on earth.<BR>
History has confirmed the accuracy of Kierkegaard's criticism of speculative philosophy, a criticism which, hitting also at totalitarian political systems, thereby demonstrates his relevance for our time.

The articles in this volume are focused upon Kierkegaard's theological activity: his responses to theological issues which arose in the Church and University of his time. As a Lutheran Church, it also inherited the legacy of an older confessional tradition. In his theological writings, Kierkegaard confronted both this Lutheran theological tradition as well as the theological responses of the early nineteenth century Danish Church, often producing his own theological formulations.<BR>

Kierkegaard was neither a historian of philosophy nor a historian of theology. He did not read Plato or Aristotle, Augustine or Luther (to mention only the greatest names) for their sakes but for his own sake, in the service of his own purposes.<BR>
Kierkegaard was an extremely critical reader who kept his distance more often than he gave his endorsement. The first response and also the second are found in the articles in this volume.

Kierkegaard was a rebellious child of his time. Living in the culture of the nineteenth century, with its own particular political, philosophical and social outlook, he related to it in his own way. He dealth with its aesthetic and ethical-religious values in theory and experiment, handling such themes as human responsibility and egoism, love despair, loneliness, and crime. All these topics and many more are fully treated in this volume.

The theme of this volume is one of the must difficult, because it requires from the authors of the present studies a summit of erudition and understanding of their topics.<BR>
The editors of this series succeeded in gathering such specialists. The reader can find here the results of their penetrating studies of the influence and interpretation of Kierkegaard in America, England, France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden, in addition with separate studies of Kierkegaard in relation to Sartre, Karl Barth, Bultmann, and others.

Belles-lettres was extremely important for S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard. He was inspired by it, and it offered him images and figures, problems and solutions of life, playing the role of a life-experience, as good literature always does.<BR>
But Kierkegaard was a writer himself, choosing his own style, creating his own command of language.<BR>
About the must important literary influences - namely the Danish ones, and about other ones, the reader can find some examples in this volume.

The articles in this volume present some of the teachers in Kierkegaard's life. These he met at school, at church and in the university, while he became acquainted with others by reading their books and letters.<BR>
Only few of these teachers had any deep or lasting influence on Kierkegaard. Just as he did not want to have disciples, he was not a disciple of any teacher himself.<BR>
As a son of his age, Kierkegaard knew his teacher's way of thinking and expression of problems, but he made his own original formulations and answers.<BR>
Everything made an impression on his sensitive genius, but no teacher could call him his disciple.<BR>
Two philosophers in different ways significant for Kierkegaard are dealt with in other volumes in this series: Hegel (vol. 4) and Socrates (vol. 14).

The personal aspect of Kierkegaard's life forms the background to his thought and view of existence. His attitudes and battles (especially those with the Press), were influenced by a combination of factors: his family, his one and only love, his best friend, also his school, his university and his choice of books.<BR>
The influence of all these is to be found reflected not only in his work as an author, but also in his private prayers as they are known to us and in his entire attitude as a Christian which, as with everything else about him, was also dialectical. Even his death is not without an element of mystery.

Anyone who has ever read Kierkegaard or merely knows him by reputation is aware that he employed the full extent of his powers in an unrelenting struggle with "Christendom" which in his own time was especially represented to him by the Danish Church. Far fewer would have any concept of what this Church was like as an institution, which theological theories predominated in its teaching,and how it generally functioned. It will scarely be possible to present even an approximate understanding and evaluation of Kierkegaard's own interpretation and evaluation without knowledge of the actual conditions of the time.

Classical literature was close to Kierkegaard's heart. Not only his contemporaries, his school, but also his teachers, taught him to appreciate antiquity. Figures such as Antigone in mythology, and particularly Socrates, in the platonic or the aristophanic form, played a central part in his thought, and of course Plato himself.<BR>
On Plato and Aristotle, see also vol. 6 and 10 in this series.
