 <I>Fear  and  Trembling</i>  and  <I>The  Repetition</i>  appeared  together in
 October  1843.  In the  same way,  in June  1844, with  only four
 days   between   them,  Kierkegaard   published  the   two  books
 <I>Philosophical  Scraps;  or  a  Scrap  of  Philosophy</i> (Filosofiske
 Smuler eller en  Smule Filosofi),  "by Johannes  Climacus, edited
 by  S.  Kierkegaard",  and  <I>The  Concept  of  Dread</i>,  "a  simple
 psychological-demonstrative  reflection  regarding  the  dogmatic
 problem of original sin, by Vigilius Haufniensis". <p>

The painter Wilhelm Marstrand made many sketches of Kierkegaard in the early 1870th, about 15 years after Kierkegaards death.

   The  many  pseudonyms  can  seem  like  an affectation  but indicate
 a deliberate strategy, by which Kierkegaard aims  to avoid
 teaching  or  preaching; nor  can the  opinions expressed  in his
 books  always be  definitely ascribed  to him.  When a  work like
 Philosophical Scraps is described as "edited by  S. Kierkegaard",
 we may be sure that it is to  a special  degree an  expression of
 his own  thoughts; but  only in  those cases  where he  is shown,
 not as editor, but as  author of  the work  in question,  can the
 opinions in it be ascribed to him  with certainty.  This applies,
 on  the  whole,  only to  the many  collections of  sermons which
 he published between the literary and philosophical works.<P>      
  <I> Philosophical Scraps</i> is an  attempt to  elucidate Christianity.
 It is, in other words, a work of dogmatics,  though, to  be sure,
 a  work  of  an  altogether  undogmatic  character.   Perhaps  it
 would be more correct to  say that  it is  an attempt  to present
 Christianity as it should be if it is to  have any  meaning. Here
 Kierkegaard's  ideas  on the  paradox as  adumbrated in <I> Fear and
 Trembling</I> come to  full flower,  because Christ's  incarnation is
 itself a paradox; partly because it means  the appearance  of the
 infinite in time,  which no  human mind  can compass,  and partly
  because  God,  as  guiltless,  must  be  absolutely  different  from
  man, whose destiny lies in falsehood, since he lives in sin.<P>        
    <I>The  Concept  of  Dread</I>  is  concerned  with  sexuality,  taken as
  the constituent element  in the  concept of  original sin.  This extraordinarily
  penetrating work,  perhaps the  first work  of depth-psychology  in  existence,
  is  based  on  the  previously mentioned
  concept  of  man  as  a  synthesis  of soul  and body,  temporal and
  eternal,  freedom  and  necessity;  and dread  is the  feeling which
  grips  and  dominates  the  man  whose  synthesis  is  threatened by
  the fact that one  aspect of  it --  the body,  the temporal  and the
  necessary  --  is  gaining control.  Dread is  thus a  warning voice,
  though  it  can  be,  as  well,  a  temptation to  new sin;  for, as
  Kierkegaard  says,  in words  which anticipate  Freud's view  in Das
  Ich  und  das  Es,  and  in  Uber  das  Schuldgefiihl,  "Man  is not
  conscious of  guilt because  he sins,  but sins  because he  is conscious of guilt."  <P>

  The  man  who,  through  the  voice  of  dread,  has  realized the
  inadequacy  of  the  aesthetic,  sensory  sphere  has   reached  the
  maturity  to  choose something  else and  enter the  ethical sphere.
  This is marked by the assertion of  its claims  by the  eternal. But
  as was the case in the aesthetic sphere, so in the ethical: we rnust
  distinguish  between  different  stages.  At  its  lowest  stage man
  still believes that he can,  alone, meet  the requirements  of eternity
 in the world of  time. At  its highest  stage, the  ethical man
  has  discovered how  little he  can achieve  by his  own endeavours.
  The  man  who  has  realized  this  has  become  mature   enough  to
  cross  from  the  ethical to  the religious  sphere, which  is based
  on   this   very   recognition   of   the   inadequacy    of   human
  endeavour. <P>                                                         
    This  idea,  which  had   been  implicit   in  all   the  previous
  publications  from   <I>Either/Or</I>  onward,   dominates  the   next  major  work,
<I>  Stages  on Life's  Way </I>(Stadier  paa Livets  Vej; 1845),
  a  voluminous  book  that  is  perhaps  Kierkegaard's  maturest  artistic
 achievement. In a way  it reiterates  the idea  of<I> Either/Or</I>,
  just as the title is a  variation on  that of  the debut  book; but
  with the vital difference that in the new work the religious stage,
  as  a  logical  consequence  of  the ideas  embodied in  the former
  works  exposing  the  impotence  of  human  ethics,   is  separated
  into a special stage.  <P>                                            


<I>   Stages on Life's Way</I>,  a work  of art,  and perhaps  the maturist
  expression  of  Kierkegaard's  ideas,  is  a  major work  in Danish
  literature.  Before  seeing it  through the  press, however,  he was
  already  at  work  on  yet  another  great  book,  this time  a work
  of  philosophy,  and  nothing  less  than   a  reckoning   with  the
  predominant       contemporary      school       of      philosophy,
  Hegelianism,  which  he  feared  and  opposed  with all  his energy,
  because  it  represented  a  backward  step  towards   paganism  and
  saw  the  whole  development  of  the  world  as a  manifestation of
  a necessary logical -- or as they said  then, dialectical  -- process,
  with  Christianity  an  inferior  part.  Had  Hegel's   system  been
  anti-Christian  it  would  not  have  given  such  great  offence to
  Kierkegaard;  but  just  because  it  accepted Christianity  and incorporated
  it  in the  system it  was dangerous,  and in  the great
  work  with  the  singular  title <I>oncluding  Unscientific Postscript
  to  the  Philosophical  Scraps</I>  (Afsluttende  uvidenskabeligt Efterskrift
 til de filosofiske Smuler), of 1846, he settles accounts with
  Hegel's   doctrine   or   system.  It   is  probably   the  wittiest
  philosophical  work ever  written.

 In  the first  place, Kierkegaard
  attacks  Hegel's  tendency  to systematize  the whole  of existence,
  declaring that  a system  of existence  cannot be  constructed since
  existence  is  incomplete   and  constantly   developing.  Likewise,
  he  attacks  Hegel's  confusion  of  two  things which  are entirely
  unconnected:    namely,    logic    and    existence.    Hegel   had
  endeavoured   to   introduce   mobility   into   logic;  Kierkegaard
  demonstrates  the  mistake  of  trying  to  mix the  categories into
  a  single  hotch-potch.  Hegel  thought  he  had created  the objective
  theory  of  knowledge;  Kierkegaard,  sharply  opposing  this,
  put forward the thesis  that subjectivity  is truth,  or --  to quote
  his  own definition  of what  is truth  -- "the  objective uncertainty,
 maintained  possession of  the most  passionate fervour,  is the
  truth,  the  highest  truth, for  one existing".  To which  he adds:
  "But  the  given  definition  of  truth is  a paraphrase  of faith".
  Kierkegaard  deduces   one  further   consequence  of   his  definition
 of  truth: "When  subjectivity, intense  fervour (inderlighed),
  is the truth, then truth objectively fixed is paradox." <P>            
   The  threads  are  thus  brought  together  in this,  the most
 systematic work of the  great system-hater.  It is  certainly no
 system; but those who have the jaws to bite  on this  vast work,
 and  the  teeth  to  crush  its  tough  nuts,  will  there  find
 Kierkegaard's ideas in their most consistent and  coherent form.
