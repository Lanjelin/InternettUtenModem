<P>
In order to allow you to more easily respond to posts in this BBS, we implement "magic cookies" 
as <A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs14.htm#1428" tppabs="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">described by Netscape Communications Corporation</A>. Basically,
a "cookie" is a piece of information (in this case, your username) that is stored semi-permanently 
by your browser. Quite a few browsers support cookies, such as: Netscape Navigator, 
Microsoft IE, GNNworks 1.2, OmniWeb 2.0, Netcruiser 3.0, and SpyGlass 2.11 (win32).
</P>

<P>
When you register a username for our BBS, we store your username in a magic cookie in your browser. 
Whenever you press the "Reply" button of a post, your browser sends that one cookie to us. 
We then extract your username out of the cookie, so that you don't have to bother typing it in the 
response form. <B>Your browser will only send a cookie to the same server/path that created the 
cookie, so you don't have to worry about anyone (including us) extracting sensitive information (if any 
exists).</B>
</P>

<P>If you would like to see all of the cookies that are stored in your browser, look 
for a file in your browser's directory (or folder) called "cookies," "cookies.txt," or 
even "MagicCookie." The cookie we stored in your browser looks something like this:</P>
<P>
<SAMP>www.webcom.com FALSE /cgi-bin FALSE 946638779   LavaBBS  <I>yourusername</I></SAMP>
