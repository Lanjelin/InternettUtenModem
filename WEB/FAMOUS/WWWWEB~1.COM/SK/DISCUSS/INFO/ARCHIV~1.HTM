<P>When the BBS' Main Read Page contains 100 posts, it is automatically "archived"
and the Main Read Page is cleaned of all listings. The listings are added to an
"archive page," and that archive page is numbered based on the last archive's number.
</P>

<P>
Automatic archiving provides many benefits, the greatest being that your download time (of the Main Read Page) is dramatically
decreased, and the BBS thus becomes much easier to navigate.</P>

<P>You'll notice links to all of the archives at the bottom of the Main Read Page. 
You can navigate the archives in thread-sorted or date-sorted mode, by clicking the
appropriate link at the top of the page. While reading through the archived pages, you 
can always get back to the current main read page by clicking on the hyperlinked BBS 
Name (Kierkegaard Discussion) at the top of the archived page.
</P>

<P>
Archives can be easily .zipped up and distributed for use on a person's local hard drive.
Contact the maintainer of this BBS if you're interested in getting an zipped archive.
</P>
