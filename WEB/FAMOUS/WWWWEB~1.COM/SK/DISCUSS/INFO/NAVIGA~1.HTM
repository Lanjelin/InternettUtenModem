<P><FONT SIZE="2">Navigating through this BBS is quite intuitive. Chances are, you can find
your way around very easily, without reading this document. If you plan on becoming an active reader/poster
on this BBS (and we hope you do!), then you will probably get a lot out
of this page -- so keep reading. I guarantee even a "seasoned veteran" will learn something about navigating the BBS that he/she didn't know before they came here.</FONT></P>

<HR SIZE="5">

<P>There are three main types of pages you deal with when navigating the BBS:
The <B><A HREF="../READ/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/Read/">Main Read Page</B></A>, the <B><A HREF="../READ/1~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/Read/1.html">Message Post</B></A> page, and the <B>Archived Main Read Page</B>. This document breaks down those three sections, and explains the various
links/buttons that you will encounter.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">The Main Read Page</FONT></B><BR>
The Main Read Page is the "bulletin board page" where the messages are listed. You have two
choices when browsing through the Main Read Page: the <B>Thread Sorted</B> version (the default) or the <B>Date Sorted</B> version. There is a link to the other version at the top of each of those
pages (i.e. if you're on the Thread Sorted page, there is a link to the
Date Sorted page, and vice-versa). </P>

<P>The Thread Sorted page sorts messages according to subject, with the replies
falling in an organized fashion BENEATH the original posts. The latest message
post is always at the top of the current grouping.</P>

<P>The Date Sorted page is sorted as you might imagine, with the newest message
post listed at the very top. Both of those versions contain the same basic
"header" of helpful links:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs17.htm#1741" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/username.html">UserName (Optional)</B></A> - Click on this link if you'd like to register a username, to make frequent
posting much more enjoyable. Registered users experience <A HREF="USERNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/Info/username.html">many benefits</A>. 
<LI><B><A HREF="../POST~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/post.html">Post a Message</B></A> - If you'd like to post an original message (i.e. start a new thread).
<LI><B>X-sorted posts</B> - (Where "X" is either "thread" or "date.") This link will take you to the other version of the Main Read Page, where message
posts are sorted by either <I>thread</I> or <I>date</I> (depending on what the link states).
<LI><B><A HREF="../INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/">Documentation</B></A> - This link will take you to the front page of our BBS Documentation, which
you're reading from <I>right now</I>!
</UL>

<P>The Main Read Page also contains target links: <B>Down</B> (appears above the message-posts), and <B>Up</B> (near the bottom). They do exactly what they say. If you click on the former
("Down"), you'll shoot down to the bottom of the page, if you click on the
latter ("Up"), you'll shoot back up to the top of the page. This can be
quite handy when the page gets lengthy.</P>

<P>There is one more section on the Main Read Page: The Archive List (near
the very bottom of the page). As the Main Read Page fills up with posts,
it automatically archives at a set interval (every 100 posts). Each time
it archives, the current posts are moved to an archive page ... numbered
accordingly. You can navigate to the various archive pages using The Archive
List. If you're interested, you can read more about <A HREF="ARCHIV~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/Info/archival.html">The Archival Process</A>.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">The Message Post</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT></B>Arguably the most important aspect of the entire BBS, a Message Post is
quite obviously a <B>message</B> that a person <B>posts</B> to the BBS. When a message is posted, it is automatically assigned a "Post
Number" and is listed in the proper place on the Main Read Page. For navigation
purposes, each Message Post contains a header section of links that exactly
mirrors a footer section; both contain the following important links:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Previous Thread</B> - This link will take you to the top of the thread that appears directly
before yours. A "thread" is a term used to refer to <I>a branch of discussion on a set topic</I>. If you reply to a post, you've added a message to a current thread. If
you post a new message, you've started a new thread.
<LI><B>Next Thread</B> - This link will take you to the top of the next thread in the BBS. Please
note that if you attempt to navigate to a thread that doesn't exist, you
will be sent to the Main Read Page (and an explanatory message will appear
at the top of the BBS).
<LI><B>Thread Sorted Posts</B> - Works exactly the same as the "X-sorted posts" link (described above.)
It displays the most current "Main Read Page," with message posts sorted
by <I>thread</I>. 
<LI><B>Date Sorted Posts</B> - Works exactly the same as the "X-sorted posts" link (described above).
It displays the most current "Main Read Page," with message posts sorted
by <I>date</I>. 
<LI><B>Previous Message</B> - Will take you to the message posted <I>chronologically</I> before the post you are currently reading. That is, if you're reading post
number 100, the Previous Message link will take you to post number 99, which
isn't necessarily in the thread (subject) you're currently reading. 
<LI><B>Post a Note</B> - If you'd like to post an original message (i.e. start a new thread). 
<LI><B>Next Message</B> - The exact opposite of the Previous Message link, this pointer will take
you to the message that was posted <I>chronologically</I> after the post you're currently reading. That is, if you're reading post
number 100, the Next Message link will take you to post number 101, which
isn't necessarily the next message in the thread (subject) you're reading. 
</UL>

<P>If there have been any replies to the message you're reading, you'll see
a section near the bottom of the current post that says "<B>Replies to this message:</B>" and beneath that, you'll see a listing of one (or more) replies, including
the author's name and the time/date posted. In this manner, you can very
effectively navigate an entire thread.</P>

<P>If you would like to post a response to the message you're reading, simply
click on the "Respond" button at the top of the page. The default is to <I>post</I> your response <B>only</B>, but you can choose to either post, post <I>and</I> email, or <I>just</I> email the response using the checkboxes to the right of the button. When
the Response form is displayed, you'll also notice that you have the option
of sending a CC (carbon copy) of your message to one (or more) email address(es). <B>All email options are available for <A HREF="USERNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/Info/username.html">registered users</A> ONLY.</B></P>

<P>When reading a message response (that is, a response to an original post),
you'll notice a line that looks similar to the following:</P>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE="4">At 23:17:39 PST on 05-03-96, Scott wrote:</FONT></TT></P>

<P>The words "Scott wrote" will be a link to Scott's original message. If you
are reading a message response that is quite a ways into a thread, you can
easily navigate up to any of the posts in that thread (assuming that everyone
has left the "headers" intact).</P>

<HR SIZE="5">

<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Archived Main Read Page</FONT></B><BR>
Whenever a Main Read Page is archived, the current posts are "sucked" off
the main page, and placed in the archived page. This allows us to keep the
main read page at a very minimal size, which lets you download it quickly.
More <A HREF="ARCHIV~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/Discuss/Info/archival.html">information on the archival process</A> is available.</P>

<P>Each archive is numbered; the lower the number, the older the archive. Each
archived page is almost identical to the Main Read Page. There are two new
links added to the top of these pages, and the Archive Listings do not appear
at the bottom of these pages.</P>

<P>The first new link is the <B>Archive N</B> link(where "N" is the number of the next oldest archive). If you click
on this link, you'll go to archive number N. Just as with the Main Read
Page, you can view archived pages in thread or date sorted mode. The second
new link is the title of this BBS, <B>Kierkegaard Discussion</B>. When you click on it, you will be taken to the Main Read Page of the BBS.</P>

<HR SIZE="5">

<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">A word on cached-pages and reloading</FONT></B><BR>
This BBS was created with the idea that it could be very busy; new messages
being posted all the time. In light of this, whenever you click on a link
that loads the Main Read Page, you are actually running a "script" (or "program")
that displays the most current page. In effect, it is as if you went to
the Main Read Page and pressed the Reload button on your browser. Likewise,
whenever you post a message or response, the Main Read Page is displayed
... this too is the most current form of the page. For the most part, you
should always be seeing the most current page available. If you are using
Netscape Navigator, you should turn on "Verify document every time" under <B>Options &gt;&gt; Network Preferences &gt;&gt; Cache</B>.</P>
