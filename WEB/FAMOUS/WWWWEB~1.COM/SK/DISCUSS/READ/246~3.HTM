<BR>
<BR>Bruce,
<BR>
<BR>How is it possible for "objective facts" to exist outside of consciouness? 
<BR>
<BR>Bruce, my friend, you must take it as a given that objective facts exist outside of human consciousness.  Think about it, could they be in a human consciousness?   If so, then they would be subjective, right?  Maybe you could define subjectivity in another way, but the way Mr. Dean defined it -- as the INTERSECTION between a human consciousness and objective facts -- well, I think the definition is very solid and quite clear.  If you accept that definition there is nothing tricky going on here*.  
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR> After all, doesn't a person have to be conscious, to be aware of facts?
<BR>
<BR>This sentence is much like the first.  Please follow along to check my detail:  A conscious person who is aware of the facts supposes an INTERACTION between a human consciousness and objective facts -- hence it falls under the forementioned definiton of subjectivity.  Unless you are prepeared to say that the act of 'a human consciousness becoming AWARE of something' is something other than 'a human consciousness INTERACTING with something' -- which, I suppose you could do, but then you would have to explain to us what else it could be besides an INTERACTION and I fear that your response would be something akin to the PURE EXPERIENCE that occurs in that magical 1/30th of a second, an idea that Mr. Dean brought forth and later reniged on.
<BR>
<BR>  
<BR>How can anybody dispute solipsism?
<BR> 
<BR>How can anyone dispute solipsism?      
<BR>Well, anyone can dispute anything, the trick is getting someone else to believe you, to follow along.
<BR>What is solipsism?  It is the agreement that I cannot communicate with you and you cannot communicate with me.  Now, if I tell you that your shirt is on backwards and you look down to find that the tag is sticking out from under your chin and you run to the bathroom to fix it, would you then say we have communicated?  YEs, yes, we have communicated, but this is somehow not the type of communication solipsism is concerned with.  It is of little concern whether or not he has his shirt on inside out.  The thing that solipsism is concerned with is much more important than that.  Shhh!  You can't even mention it.  You'll loose your membership -- and isnt membership in solipsism a curious thing.  Shhh!  Its a secret.  Shhh!  They are going to get you!   What is this thing that we cannot say?  Is it that we are unable to say it?  If so, then why all the commotion about secrecy?  It is indeed something real important.  But what is it?  I may not know what it is but so not doubt I have angst over it. Agnst!  Pain!  
<BR>So, I'm terribly curious now, what is this thing that is the source of so much angst & pain?  
<BR>This is precisely what the Solipsist can't tell you.  Why can't he tell you?  MAybe he doesn't know.  Or maybe he knows but has promised not to tell.  I wonder who it is that he has promised?  Maybe he forgot who he made the  promise to, maybe he never really even knew him, maybe it was a stranger who passed in the night under the shade of a cloak, a stranger who wispered something to him.  "Psst. Hey you." And the solipsist realizes that the stranger is pointing at him (wow, me, this guy wants to talk to me?)  "Don't tell anyone, you're a solipsist now." And what a mean trick this stranger plays on this poor solipsist, for, if nothing else, in this interaction, there is room for a most unfortunate misunderstanding -- What is it that the stranger told the solipsist not to tell anyone?  (I see two possible answers.) 
<BR>Answer #1: _______.
<BR>First the solipsist think of it as two distict sentences, the first being -- "Don't tell anyone _______ ."  Where the blank is left blank.  And upon the understanding of this first sentence, perhaps the solipsist initiate got a solidly blank look in his eye, and upon seeing the blank look the stanger cracks a wry smile and promptly welcomes the inititate him into the fold with the second sentence-- "You are a solipist, now.  Welcome aboard". 
<BR>But remeber, the initiate, does not know what goes into this blank, (or if he did know he must be assumed to know before the stranger told him).  [And also, please remember he still does not know who this stranger is, as the stranger promptly hurried off into he night -- I bet these two things he does not know must bother him.  And so I would not be suprised if the solipsist confided in me that this lack of knowledge is precisely the source of his pain and agnst -- its tough to be a solipsist].  Years pass and on an insignificant lazy afternoon the solipsist reflects on those words he heard so long ago, and gets a jolt down his spine, he happens upon a second meaning. "Don't tell anyone that you are a solipsist".  
<BR>Answer #2: you're a solipsist.          
<BR>     Either answer is cruel.
<BR>Here is where the solipsist gets really dpressed and suicide someitmes comes in.  Well, I tell you, instead of suicide I would spend my time chasing down this stranger, this joker, I'd grab him by the shirt and get a good look at him, and demand that he tell me what he meant, "What can't I tell anyone, what is this solipsism anyway!"
<BR>And if these word from me did not make him burst into laughter, I bet I could find some other stranger who initiated him, or the person who initiated him, or back and back -- Someone back there has to be laughing.
<BR>This solipsism reeks just like one of those pyramid schemes, where indeed you can make good money but (1) there is no work to be done, because (2) the money comes in from the new initiates, and (3) you have to keep getting new initiates telling them that its easy money, but the difficult part is getting new initiates, who you tell that its easy, and then they have to get new initiates, who they tell tell that its easy...  the first guy is laughing, because he fooled the second, and made the second fool the third... by the time it gets to 345th level... what then?
<BR>
<BR>I will now resign because I fear I am digressing from our point.
<BR>
<BR>Sincerely, 
<BR>CAry Cortese
