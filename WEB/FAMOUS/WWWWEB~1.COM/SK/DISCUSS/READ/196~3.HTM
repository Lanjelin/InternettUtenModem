<BR>I am having real problems trying to understand the part of "Truth Is Subjectivity" where  it goes into truth and into the quote "Faith is an objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation-process of the most passionate inwardness".  I am totally lost!!!  Can someone explain this to me???
<BR>
<BR>Lets asume you are looking for truth.  You ask the question what is truth.  Now SK is giving you the objective answer -- truth is subjectivity.  He is trying to be funny, seriously.
<BR>
<BR>OK.  Let me try to explain again.
<BR>Hmmm...
<BR>
<BR>Lets say you weren't concientious enough to persue this question this far, to post it up here in this SK discussion group, lets say you didn't actually care to try to undertand that truth is subjectivity.  Lets say it was enough for you that if someone asked you what the truth was, say on a PHL test, you could respond SUBJECTIVITY and you would get an A and both you and your professor would be happy.  But this won't happen, I mean, you will obviously be expected to explain further.  And if in your further explanations, be they two or three more sentences or 45 pages, if all you did was pull out different ways of saying the same thing that thing you don't understand, namely that truth is subjectivity, then even if your impress many fellow students and get a big A on your paper you will till not be any closer to your goal, which was to understand what SK meant by saying that the truth is subjectivity.  
<BR>
<BR>You see, objectively knowing that the truth is subjectivity can get your much deserved glory in your philosophy class, it can get you a big A on your paper, and to stretch things a bit, maybe the A will get you into law school and buy you that nice BMW you always wanted; and SK is not saying that these are bad things.  He is not saying that these are not worthwhile.  He is not saying that you either should or shouldn't persue them.  What he is saying is that you will not be any closer to understanding what the truth means until you understand it subjectively, until you appropriate it into what you believe.  
<BR>
<BR>What were we talking about again?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR> "Faith is an objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation-process of the most passionate inwardness".
<BR>
<BR>Now in the spirit of JC, I'll try to make things a bitmore difficult and leave you with the following; this might be misquoted, but its as close as I remeber it, its an issue taht SOCR made a big stink about-- Are they Good because they are Gods
<BR>or are they Gods because they possess the Good?  
<BR>If you use it in your paper you'll be sure to get an A.
<BR>Trust me.
