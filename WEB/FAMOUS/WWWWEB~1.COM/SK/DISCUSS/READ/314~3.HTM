<BR>
<BR>OK.  First, let me apologize:  I have read very little SK.  A little from the "Upbuilding Discourses," some of "Practice In Christianity," and that's it.  So I may make some fundamental mistakes by not properly appreciating the context.  Sorry.
<BR>
<BR>In "Practice In Christianity," SK goes into a lengthy examination of Mat 11:6.  (SK's translation is "Blessed is he who is not offended at me."  Variants include these: KJV:  And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me; NAB:  And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me;  NIV:  Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.)  His examination works on the concept of offense (shock) that God would be a man such as Jesus.  SK asks that we view Jesus first as his contemporaries did, and peel away the subsequent centuries' acceptance of His divinity.  A contemporaneous view of Jesus woudl be aware of His lack of importance, His poverty, in order to understand the wonder of HIs being God.  SK seems to see faith as being sourced in our arriving at a crossroads:  do we view this man Jesus and become offended at the idea of His being God, or do we embrace him, accepting his Divinity?
<BR>
<BR>SK also goes through lengthy examples (some quite funny) of how various members of contemporary society might have reacted to his message.
<BR>
<BR>At one point (p. 128 of the Princeton paperback), SK writes:  "The majority of people living in Christendom today no doubt live in the illusion that if they had been contemporary with Christ they would have recognized him immediately despite his unrecognizability.  They utterly fail to see how they betray that they do not know themselves;  it totally escapes them that this conviction they have, whereby they presumably think to glrify Christ, is blasphemy, contained in the nonsensical-undialectical climax of clerical roaring: <EM>to such a degree</EM> was Christ God that one could immediately and directly perceive it, instead of:  he was true God, and therefore to such a <EM>degree</EM> God that he was unrecognizeable - thus it was not flesh and blood that inspired Peter to recognize him."
<BR>
<BR>Now, SK does not go into the irgin conception in this discussion, nor does he talk about the limits of Jesus soci-demographic lowliness.  To swing thins back to a comparison of Raymond Brown, he does not discuss rumors of Jesus' illegitimacy, and whether that might provide additional ofense to the potential believer.  But, to me, it sounds consistent with what SK writes about our needing to grapple with the 'insignificance' of Jesus as we accept HIs divinity.  (Interestingly, Joseph Meier, who is also published by Anchor Doubleday, has titled his series on the historicity of Jesus "A Marginal Jew."
