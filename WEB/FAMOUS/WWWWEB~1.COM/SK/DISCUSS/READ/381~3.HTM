<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>In your earlier note, you wrote that a contemporary of Jesus had the advantage of being able to question Him. I am sincerely interested in knowing what questions you would pose to Jesus to determine whether he was God, because I can't think of any.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I suppose it is important to recall that those who were next to Him not only asked the questions, but did not recognize Him when He appeared after Easter.  So who <EM>could</EM> really hope to come up with a good series of questions?  Any answer would have to be proven false in order to disprove that the answerer is God;  the higher power that proves the first answer false then has to move on to the bonus round and be subjected to the same test.  If not proven false, is God verified?  I don't <EM>think</EM> so.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Good point. Another problem: If the question is to reveal that someone is God, then the answer must be one that only God can give. But if only God can give the answer, then only God must know the answer. Otherwise someone other than God could fool us into thinking he was God by giving the God-answer.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But if only God knows the answer, then I don't know the answer anymore than does anyone else. So how do I know if I have heard it if I don't know what it is?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>But, still, the questioner has asked a question and received an answer (or not), and that particular experience becomes part of the basis for his or her faith.  Each single individual who makes the leap of faith makes it on the basis of facts encountered in the realm of the immanent, and so his or her particular experience in the imminent is an inescapable element of the absolute relation one is called to.  If true faith could be achieved by logic and a priori principles, Incarnation would not be needed.  But we are told that Incarnation _was_ necessary, as were the Passion and the Resurrection.  Each of these was a trans-historic event, if the Christian faith is true, but also one that had either to occur or not occur in the realm of the immanent, in sight of potential witnesses or not.
<BR>
<BR>The witness to Jesus Christ's life would have different factual issues to resolve before determining to make the leap of faith. For example, a first century Palestinian might struggle to know what JC meant when he said, "No sign will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah" -- Was he really claiming to be a prophet?  Was he claiming more? What was the sign?  We, many generations removed have to ask first whether JC really said that (Or did some later follower interpolate it as foreshadowing the Resurrection?), and also what it meant, and whether it still holds (Can we still see the sign in some meaningful individual way, or is the sign something that was available only to the eyewitnesses of the Resurrection?).  The undiscussed question is, do the particular experiences and contexts in which the leap of faith is made affect the leap of faith in a substantive way, or are all leaps of faith qualitatively identical?
