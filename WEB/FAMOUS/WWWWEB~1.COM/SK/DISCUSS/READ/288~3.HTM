(varying the name for variety, so I won't respond twice to the same post)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Since we changed languages from subjective/objective into "That it is" and "What it is", the old magical 1/30th of a second has appeared again -- it is in the first step of your two step process:
<BR>
<BR>["That it is"] is the way in which things seem to be given to us; ie it is the aspect of actual things that are not subjective, not dependent upon us...  ...That this particular thing is, there is no question.  It is here.  But, what is it?  It is in this second move that subjectivity enters the picture, and in fact produces a picture: an experience for a consciousness.
<BR>
<BR>The objective things that are given to us, i.e. not subjective, not dependant on us, this is unfetterd vision of objective truth?  Objective truth as a given!  And then, in the second step, we quickly pour our subjective molasses over it.  Oh, to get back to the first step, is this not the goal?  Our lost paradise!  How does the first step slip away?  Is it due to our ignorance?  Our imperfection?  Our original sin?  (Aha! Mr. Dean, if you are reading along this is perhaps how sin figures in.)  
<BR>
<BR>Following along withthe post, I then get lost when SK's existence is described as an aspect of actuality.  I am not entirely clear on the meaning of these two words, except for my gut feeling that SK's existence should be larger than actuality, not a fraction of it.  I may be way off here.  I n either case, I need some guidance if I am to be bale to follow further.  
<BR>       
<BR>But, through my ammendment (the Socratic intentions ammendment), I can see what you are saying about Plato and Kant each opting for one side or the other -- in other words, if you accept the border as simular enough to the ditch, neither Plato or Kant appear to be jumpers -- they are content with their contemplation.   And your point is well taken about SK's critique of them -- for them existence vanishes, and with it the difficulty -- and without the difficulty the highest sphere accesable is the universal.  You may not want to blend the metaphors, your fear of loosing important distinctions, but I do not see the danger in doing so, because I think Sk's metaphor accounts for Plato and Kant you speak of rather neatly -- in the second thier of a three tiered system.  He gives them their due repect...       
<BR>
<BR>So, can we blend the border and the ditch?
<BR>
<BR>And now I am a bit confused about who is blending the subjective/objective and who is not.  I'd say that SK doesn't blend them, he seperates them.  And I'd say Kant probobly had them sepereate too, and so did Plato... 
<BR>Could you say what Socrates did?
<BR>
<BR>And in conclusion, to the Jesus Christ as given suggestion -- well,  
<BR>please reread the opening paragraph and see if that does not compromise the miracle of Jesus in a roughly simular manner as the 1/30th of a second.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>An attempt to clarify some more...</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;This is not a specific response to your amendation above.  I need to give the Socratic thing a thought or two.  I believe what I write hereinafter might be applicable, though.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But as to the rest, I take it in sum that you are saying that SK and Socrates/Kant/Plato are all talking about one thing, subjectivity, but just looking at it from different perspectives.  And there could be something in what you say; someone (I think it was Whitehead) once said that all philosophy is but a footnote to Plato.  However, I believe that SK was onto something genuinely new and vital, and to merge his views with the others is to lose some very important insights and distinctions.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In order to compare and contrast anything, there needs to be some archimedian point of comparison.  I propose we use Schelling's distinction between the "what" and the "that."  He said that everything actual has a double aspect: what it is and that it is.  "That it is" refers to the aspect of an actual thing that is external to us and out of our control.  It is the way in which things seem to be given to us; ie it is the aspect of actual things that are not subjective, not dependent upon us.  "What it is" refers to the aspect of an actual thing that we bring to it, in response to it.  It is our own subjective conceptual determination of the thing.  That this particular thing is, there is no question.  It is here.  But, what is it?  It is in this second move that subjectivity enters the picture, and in fact produces a picture: an experience for a consciousness.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Now, the aspect of an actual thing "that is" is what SK refers to as "existence," Kant refers to as the "thing in itself," and Plato refers to as "appearances."  They are all terms which are used by the three as conceptual placeholders or markers for that in an experience which is not conceptual - which is outside the conceptual determination, which is objective and given to the subject.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Note how Schelling's distinction is carried through by all three: Kant insists that nothing can be said about the thing in itself - that it is, is given, but nothing else.  "What it is" is a determination of the subject, not of the thing in itself.  Plato insists that appearances are deceptive and illusory.  That they are, is given, but what they are is not determinable.  Knowledge is to be found not in the appearances themselves, but within our own subjectivity as a recollection of the formal ideas.  SK describes existence from the side of thought (ie, from the side of conceptual subjectivity) as "a vanishing thing."  That something exists is given, but what it is is not given.  What it is comes from consciousness, from subjectivity.  To sum up: all three posit a strong distinction (in SK's term a "qualitative distinction) between the conceptual/subjective and the existence/objective.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;From this perspective, I think you can see (I hope) why I said that Kant and Plato did not fuse the subjective-objective, but only opted for one side or the other.  Kant rejected any attempt to speculate about the thing in itself - the existing objective thing.  All enquiry was to be of and about the object as it was subject to (larded over, in your terms) the personality's own conceptual categories of space, time, and the like.  Plato proposed a program of disregarding appearances - existing objective things - and recollecting the formal ideas.  All progress was to be measured by how well one was able to forget appearances and remember the truly Real structures imminent within us, within subjectivity.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Thus, Plato and Kant posited this barrier between the subjective and objective, and specifically rejected any attempt to cross it.  SK, however, posited the barrier, but did propose a way of crossing it.  SK struck a distinction between contemplation and action.  Contemplation was the mode and manner in which Plat and Kant were operating (in the above context), and also the mode and manner of anyone who approaches knowledge objectively.  If one is in this mode, SK is in essential agreement with Kant and Plato: the barrier cannot be crossed (see, eg, in the Postscript wherein he describes such objective theorizing as "approximation" only).  But in the leap, the barrier can be crossed.  What is the leap?  It is a movement of the personality from this objective contemplation mode, to the active/action mode of the ethical and religious.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In the ethical, the existing objective thing, the thing in itself, is still given.  But the ethical personality does not ask "what (who) is it," for this is a contemplative question.  The ethical personality acts in a response to that which is given to it, in accordance with its own internal ethical idea.  The result is real action/real motion in actuality, unlike contemplation/objective theorizing in which physical motion is not essential.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In the religious, the existing man, the thing in itself which is given, is Jesus Christ as God.  The religious personality (the one who has made the leap to the religious mode and manner) does not ask "what (who) is it (He)."  The religious personality has accepted His claim and commits to accept His claim and to do all as He commands.  The result of this commitment (the "fruits of the spirit") is action/real motion in actuality, in temporal space-time, again unlike contemplation/objective theorizing.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Long-winded?  I think so, and I apologize.  But this was as concise as I was able to make it.  Hope this bears upon your concerns.</I></FONT>
