<BR>Interesting paper!  This question that you've been arguing is really interesting, and so important to Christians today.  For example, a Bible Scholar who states that Christ perhaps said only 20% of the quotes ascribed to him in the Gospels came to Tucson recently, and he claimed that his work brought people closer to Christianity; to my mind, though, by dripping away pieces of the Bible, one is taking people farther away from faith, by giving them "historical evidence" in place of it.  Obviously, the Bible was written by humans with the same kind of limitations as the rest of us have, and is therefore not a perfect document, but it's purpose is give a foundation for each individual's relationship to God; for a lot of people, though, issues about the authenticity of the Bible are a way of skirting having individual faith (in my opinion).
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;James Smith's comment raises a point that often troubles me, both in thinking about SK and in trying to maintain my Christian faith.  There is no question that SK, and all of us, had to recognize that the sources of his faith were open to question on scientific and historical grounds.  SK did not believe the story of the Fall in Genesis, and his discussion of anxiety effectively says that the idea of sin coming into the world through one man (as the Roman Catholic mass has it) is illogical, and leads to all sorts of wrong questions about sin, sinfulness and the psychology of anxiety.  I agree with SK's analysis of sin and anxiety.  I also agree, because I am persuaded by human investigation of evolution as recorded in fossils and other physical evidence, that there probably was no historical Adam or Eve.  The results of other human inquiry have persuaded me that the gospels were probably not put into written form for thirty years after the events they recount, and that a number of the most compelling passages are historically inaccurate.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>This leads us to the troubling question (again, troubling for SK study and troubling for life), what is the basis of faith?  If every element of the gospel account is false -- if Christ never rose from the dead, if he never spoke the Beatitudes -- then what is the basis for SK's leap of faith?  Is SK inviting us to leap into something that has a basis in objective, verifiable reality or is his leap the same sort of useful illusion as Newton's belief in ether, or Ptolemaic astronomy?
<BR>
<BR>If God did not become incarnate, then there is no fact to support the idea that the leap of faith leads somewhere, because there is no basis to believe that every single individual is invited into an absolute relation to the absolute.  That is, there is no basis to believe that we are all, like Abraham, invited to have faith.  It is of course possible to believe this without believing in the incarnation, its just that the data to support the belief is negted. The Christian is then left in the position of the person who told Bertrand Russell that the universe was really the back of a giant turtle, standing on another giant turtle.  You may recall the response when Russell asked what that second turtle was standing on: "It's turtles all the way down."
<BR>
<BR>I reject the idea that Christian faith is turtles all the way down, just as I reject the thought that it doesn't matter whether the universe is filled with ether, or whether the earth moves and rotates. Objective reality matters because we have nothing else.  A reliance on subjective beliefs that are not grounded in the verifiable always leads to chimerical beliefs -- turtles, ether, phlogiston, homunculi.
<BR>
<BR>To say the question in another way: How do we know if there *is* an absolute relation to the absolute? In Fear and Trembling, is SK right to say Abraham was obeying the imperative of a higher morality in deciding to sacrifice Isaac?  Or it wrong place a chasm between Abraham's gory intention (which is oh so right), and the petty bourgeouis who can achieve only resignation (which an expression of the universal)?  How do we know if we have no basis to know whether reality will support a relation between the single individual (any single individual) and the absolute?
<BR>
<BR>The answer, whatever it is, is bound inextricably to the answer to where the line is drawn between acceptable and unacceptable doubt about the facts underlying faith. Must Christ have said certain of the words attributed to Him for faith and its leap to have meaning?  Must He have truly, physically, and verifiably risen from the dead?  Can we believe he was the incarnation of the Divine in a unique way that changed humanity's position with respect to the absolute, if nothing we are told about the events that effected that change can be verified?  What must be verifiable?  If nothing that took place can be verified at this remove of time and space, then what facts must we believe, what is the proof to support that the absolute and the individual can meet beyond the universal?
<BR>
<BR>This proof seems very important to me, because if there is no absolute that each of us must find for him or herself, then we seem to be blocked from transcending the universal.  If everyone has access to the "absolute" in the same way as everyone else (because the absolute has no objective reality), and the relationship we perceive is merely the (universal) human need for religious belief, then aren't we really talking about the universal, only in disguise as the absolute?  Isn't the possiblity of transcendence removed if the relation into which we enter is not with another single individual, but rather with an abstract concept that is the same for all?
