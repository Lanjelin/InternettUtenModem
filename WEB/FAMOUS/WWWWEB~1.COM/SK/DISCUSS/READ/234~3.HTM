<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Let me ask a similar set of questions, more central to my real concerns, using the Christian structure as context:  Can you have a Christian faith if Christ didn't preach "the meek shall inherit the earth" and if He didn't really rise from the dead?  Wouldn't the negation of these few external, objective and particular facts call into doubt (indeed defeat) one's belief that kindness is better than conquest, and that we can live forever?  And if you can have a Christian faith on such terms, what is its benefit (other than its pain-killing effect)?  If your faith won't _really_, literaly save you from death, what do you want it for?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>I'd first of all like to note how enlightening this entire conversation has been to me!  Tom Dean's first question was: how can we have a faith based on subjectivity, even if the particular fact on which that faith is based (such as, the existence of Christ) is disproved.  But my relationship with God (I'm now confused as to whether that would be defined as subjective or objective) confirms, at  least for me that Christ existed; it furthermore confirms that we can trust New Testament accounts of Him (in so far, as they are accounts by imperfect humans trying to explain Him and His life).  Thus, because I have a relationship with God, I trust that I will live forever.  So much of this, for me, is based on trust, that it is difficult for me to explain, much less attempt to make any logical arguement in favor for.
<BR>  As for the preacher who said she didn't believe in the God of Isaiah--well, one can make tons of arguments against such a position, but such dismissals of the Old Testament are becoming a bit more common place evidently.  Perhaps a better way for her to phrase it is to say that she had some disagreements with Isaiah's position on certain issues, just as I wouldn't agree with Isaiah or Paul or even SK on certain issues.  But all of those three people I would guarantee knew more than I about any of the issues discussed here (there are three Isaiahs according to Biblical scholars, so, correction--those five people all know more than I).
