<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>	I think viewing Abraham as a model of correct behavior is to attempt to recast his actions in an ethical framework.  I think the point of Abraham's dilemma is that the demands of faith are incommensurate with a life in, as you say, the polis.  As a professor of mine once said, there is little to extract from the Abraham/Isaac story except maybe:  It is a terrible to be in the presence of the Living God.  For me, the story of Abraham, to the extent that it can be made into any kind of sense, is that the demands of God and faith will always be outside the matrix of conceptual thought.  Ethical categories simply don't apply.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I believe the Abraham/Isaac story is one that might only be viewed as being the ultimate example of ethical behavior and the relativity of ethics. The term ³ethical behavior² in my mind is a misnomer, and should rather be termed ³cultural behavior,² as the mindset of the peer is the mindset of oneself. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Abraham was and for all time will be an example of God¹s influence on the thoughts of man, and the willingness of man to choose his ethical philosophy based upon not his own thoughts, but upon others¹, in this case - God¹s.</I></FONT>

<BR>	It's hard for me to see how Abraham can be an example of ethical behavior, regardless of whether it's termed cultural behavior or what-have-you.  It's that why SK refers to it as the teleological suspension ofthe ethical?  I think it poses a question similar to that addressed in Plato's Euthyphro: What is the source of goodness?  Is goodness what is loved by the gods or is do the gods love it because it is good?  I think dilemma of Abraham, and Kierkegaard's fascination with it, is that there is no correct answer.  Thou shalt not kill, especially one's own son -- that's a categorical imperative if ever there's been one.  But it's equally imperative that one obey the whims of the living God?  But can the living God command that I violate a categorical imperative?  Does the fact that he commands it somehow sanctify it and make it right?  Or are we to believe that it was just a test, that placing one's faith in God is all that's required because God would never ask you TRULY to do something unethical?  But is it really a test of faith if you know that God will stop me before I do anything so heinous?  Perhaps then I just pretend to be going through with it, pull the knife back and motion as if to drive it home, knowing full well that God will intervene and prevent it.  Is that really a test of faith?  Would that be a telelogical suspension of the ethical?  In fact, in such a scenario, we would never leave the realm ofthe ethical because we wouild never really be expected to do something that offends the categorical norm -- we would merely be pretending to do so.  Whatever astonishing, frightening beauty there is in the Isaac/Abraham story, it cannot be that it is a a morality tale, something upon which to model our lives.  It is, as I said, merely a frightening, exhiliarating, awe-inspiring experience to be in the presence of the living God.
