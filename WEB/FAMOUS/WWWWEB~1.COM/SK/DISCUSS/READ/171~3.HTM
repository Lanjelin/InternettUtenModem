First of all, to those who care, I am Robin Hood (see previous posts).
<BR>
<BR>I have a question concerning the role of the historical in Kierkegaard's Christian faith.  Actually, I am attempting to write a paper on it and would like some feedback.
<BR>
<BR>To what extent is it necessary for a Christian to affirm the historical narrative?  Clearly, the question can not be whether or not the event occurred, this leads only to approximation in the realm of possibilities.  But on the other hand, it is important that the eternal has existed -- historically.  On page 326 of the Hong translation of Conc. Unscientific Postscript, Climacus says, "But the object of faith is the actuality of the teacher, that the teacher actually exists.  Therefore faith's answer is absolutely either yes or no.  Faith's answer is not in relation to a doctrine, whether it is true or not, not in relation to a teacher, whether his doctrine is true or not, but is the answer to the question about a fact: Do you accept as a fact that he actually existed?"  The bottom of the paragraph: "The object of faith, then, is the actuality of the god in existence, that is as a particular individual, that is, that the god has existed as an individual human being."
<BR>
<BR>This is the paradox.  The important thing is my relation to it.  But the paradox seems to rest on the acceptance of a "fact".  But insofar as this fact is historical, that it took place in time, how can it resist the criticisms of historical research?  This question has been addressed by many theologians (Barth, Bultmann, Tillich, to name a few), but what do you think?
<BR>
<BR>Some say that it is not necessary to affirm that the Christ event actually occurred at all.  All that is needed is to internalize the meaning that you gain from the story as a story ultimately about yourself.  While an interesting idea, I don't see that this view can be called Christian.  Furthermore, I think it is subject to just the sort of abstraction that Kierkegaard criticized in the Hegelians.  I think that the motivation for such an idea is that saving faith should not be based upon something that may ultimately turn out to be false. What if, say, archeologists uncovered evidence that the apostles made the whole thing up?  Kierkegaard would say that there is no evidence that can shake faith, because it was not founded upon evidence in the first place.  But if faith entails belief in the content (historical), how can it avoid the results of critical and historical scholarship?
