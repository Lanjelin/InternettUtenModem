Mr. Dean,
<BR>I am not irked at all at your cataloging of your argument with Mr. Tillet.  It was a good idea.
<BR>In trying to follow along with this long posting and I have seen the importance of the word "immanence".  I would be grateful if you could explain to me why it is so important.  This could help me to understand your tryst with Mr Tillet more satisfactorily.  
<BR>Sincerely,
<BR>CAry Cortese

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>[Dean] There is no consciousness of standing outside oneself without referent, because one is always physically inside oneself, and trapped within a bodily referent.  Just as faith without works is dead, so transcendece without immanence is meaningless in humans.  We cannot escape our immanence.  For us, transcendence without immanence is mere angelism, a disorder.  We are not angels, but body and soul, and each body is rooted in the immanence of its own thing-ness.  A human motion (even interior) is the motion of a thing, which by definition is an action with respect to the immanent and the universal, and with respect to a referent.  It is exactly in SK's blindness to his own and our thing-ness that he "drifts away."</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>[Tillett] But there most certainly is a consciousness of standing outside of oneself without referent - in what might be called pure negation of the universal, of immanence.  "Alienation" might be a term in various contexts which explicates this consciousness; "depression" sometimes maybe also; and of course sin/despair in Sickness Unto Death  and faith in Fear and Trembling are specific renditions of this consciousness.  It is critical to SK's whole formulation that we cannot escape our existing selves - he is no apostle of some mystical out-of-body transcendance potential.  In this context, faith is the inward negation of the existing self and the universal; and in faith this "tension of the contrasting form" is both manifest at its highest and preserved.  Without an existing self and a concrete universal to contrast against the inward movement of faith, there would be no sense to the concept of faith.  And not all motions of a thing are by definition immanent.  The question, and the distinction SK tries to draw, is >>how<< the motion is conducted inwardly.  Esthetically?  Ethically? or Religiously?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;[Reply]  Yes, this is what SK does, but I object to the concept of a tension of contrasting "forms."  SK is, as I said in my preliminary reply a week or two ago, falling prey to the same "ghost in the machine" fallacy that damages Descartes' usefulness.  There is no evidence of a caesura between human body and soul in the world, and indeed, as we learn more about the human body, we learn more clearly how deep its effects on human consciousness (or psyche or soul) are. Even so, many philosophers (not just SK or Christian thinkers) who otherwise consciously choose to live in a Newtonian or Einsteinian universe somehow permit themselves to use the terminology of Aristotle and Aquinas in discussing the thing-ness of humanity.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;[Reply]  Aristotle and Aquinas understood the soul by analogy to physics, but a physics which permitted an almost mystical rift between "form" and "substance," that cannot be captured again under our present understanding of the universe.  For example, it gave rise to the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, because it permitted the form of the bread which is consecrated at communion to be entirely unrelated to its substance.  That is, it did not offend the laws of physics that the consecrated host, which remained bread in every measurable way, was _really_ body, blod, soul and divinity, Jesus Christ.  I use the word offense deliberately, because I would be interested to discuss RC doctrines regarding the sacraments in light of the discussion of offense going on in another thread on this page.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;[Reply]  My discomfort with SK's refusal to discuss human thingness is that I perceive him to be adopting Aristotelian physical assumptions without analyzing whether they are still appropriate in a Newtonian age, and without explaining to us how one can know that there _is_ a contrasting form in tension with the universal or immanent.  As I have said before, I think his failure to address the physicality of human nature in any context except that of original sin, taints his understanding of how the Absolute contacts the Universal.  Hint: it takes on flesh, at least in this era.  So has our consciousness taken on flesh, and while it may be teleologically directed toward the realm of the absolute and transcendent, yet consciousness is intimately linked to brain function (immanent).  Therefore, it seems less than self-evident to me that faith can be entirely interior, or that the transcendent has to be at war with the immanent.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;[Reply]  SK, rather than address these issues, uses an outmoded analogy to create (of all things!) a Hegelian thesis-antithesis (a negation," in Mr. Tillett's words, between universal/immanent and absolute/universal).  I don't think SK's willingness to distinguish between aesthetic and religious was warranted until he had first explained what he thought the nature of the thing making the movements was.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>[Dean] The will -- our determination of our own telos -- injects the (only, limited) possibility of the transcendental into human life.  In our selection of our telos, we are free to define ourselves, and to some degree, free from physical external determination.  For example, Kant observes in the Grounding for a Metaphysics of Morals that the swimmer swimming out to rescue a floundering man does a different act from the act of one swimming out to drown the floundering man.  SK, too, in the beginning of Fear and Trembling, appears to recognize that Abraham might have done the sacrifice of Isaac in many ways that would not have effected the same end.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>[Tillett] The two cases seem different in an important way: in the first, the swimmer is doing two different acts; but in the Abraham case, the act is the same but the inward standpoint with respect to the act is different.  And there is SK's thesis again: it is inwardly that the distinction must be drawn, between being a murderer (an inward intent to kill Isaac in violation of the universal) and a hero of faith (an inward intent to obey God - which is coincident with negating ones existing given self, ones existing given wants, needs, and desires, ones existing concrete place within the universal).</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;[Reply]  I agree -- but remember, it is SK's blithe willingness to ignore the incarnational nature of the absolute's intervention in the universal, and his failure to develop a vocabulary to discuss it, that is my concern -- not his conclusionsabout values. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>[Dean] But, as soon as we have selected a telos, we must act upon it.  While we can assign meaning to our actions, it is within limits -- one cannot always claim to have chosen to be a rescuer while holding the floundering man's head under water. There are times when this is bad faith.  Action of one sort or another will sometimes be called for, sometimes not -- and our bodies must follow our will, if we are to be true to our telos.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>[Dean] In short, we are transcendent beings only with respect to our own individual teleology.  All that can be transcendentally transformed is the teleology of the will.  ("Lord, I do believe.  Help my unbelief").  As soon as we are caled to _act_ our will, it is upon and through the immanent pysical world.  Here, thing-ness often shows through and we cannot effect the end that we intended ("the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak).  This is the fate of the incarnate.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>[Tillett] But a teleology of the will "transcendentally transformed" is a marvelous thing.  Action per se is ambiguous, not univocal.  The question is: what is the status of the inward person?  Is it transcendentally directed (towards God) or immanently directed (towards the universal)?  I think these are very different things; you seem to be saying that simply because they each manifest real motion in real time that they are the same.  But if I save the swimmer for God and as a response to His call, I am doing something very different than saving the swimmer for the good of society. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;[Reply]  But this transformation inevitably impacts on the realm of the immanent, and that is where SK has failed to develop a vocabulary for further discussions.  Like it or not, the Incarnation has irrevocably changed the manner in which the Absolute enters the realm of the immanent, and while I admire SK for refusing to go "beyond faith" (as he opens _Fear and Trembling_), I still have to criticize him for failing to go beyond Abraham.</I></FONT>
