<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;If so, then I'll stick to my statement, that is that Quijote could get as much out of Wittgensteins toolbox (grear box) as he can get out of all of history -- and I am not saying it is right or wrong, or even that Quijote is sane; all I am sayingis that he has a replacement for "history", he has replaces it with "his own world", a world with no purpose, which spins uselessly, no engaged with the rest of us.</I></FONT>

<BR>Okay--Cervantes begins Don Quijote by telling us how he became "deranged" (by reading too many romance novels), but the entire novel brings up questions of how we judge sanity and normalcy in the first place and we could probably become a Cervantes discussion group if this went too far.  At any rate, Don Quijote was happier as a fake knight-errant; indeed, after he gave up his "knighthood," he died--it was an integral part of his life, an ideal which he could not live without.  So, one of the questions the novel brings up (as Tom Dean did, though I'll rephrase it) should what we believe be closer to the truth or closer to something which makes us happy?  Perhaps if I regarded the material world as ultimate reality, I would agree that we should suffer through all the misery it affords us; however, I don't believe that the material world is ultimate truth (and besides, I believe that humans are at fault for causing a great deal of humanity's suffering).  Therefore, as I was trying to explain in the post below (in response to Christopher Harless), I believe in Christianity because it is true to my soul (as well as giving me a more joyful outlook on life).  If you want to call me insane for holding this viewpoint, you may well have a valid case; I would then argue vociferiously that we should all try to be insane as such.  But really, to be happy, must we be oblivious to the real world?  (An issue never to be resolved, I know).
<BR>
<BR>By the way, I'm sorry for throwing the word "Absolute" around; I promise from now on, I shall abstain off jargon and simply call God "God" and not "the Absolute."  Very irresponsible of me, I know.
