<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>. . . .  SK['s] metaphysics includes an Absolute, from which (and perhaps by which) values are determined specifically for the single individual.  The individual may make the interior motion of the knight of resignation, or alternatively the leap of faith, but the individual may not decide what it is that will constitute the leap of faith (the motion an individual makes either is or isnt the leap of faith), and one may not make both motions at once.  The Absolute functions on the value of the motion as an external determination.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Thus, for SK, value is objective (an external determinative force) and not subjective (an internal subjective motion) . . . .</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;......"Absolute....from which values are determined" Please Please send me this new wine that I may drink of it. . . . What the hell is "faith" anyway? If I'm not mistaken from my sunday school days, faith is belief in that which cannot be seen, or proven.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Sounds like the definition of a psychosis to me.</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;..."Value is objective......a determative force"  How about: value is the actions and thoughts of a person. Generated from a person's beliefs, experienced in a social world.  Like a hypothesis it get's tested for truth. But truth is relative .... owing to the postulation of an antithesis. If freedom is pursued it leads to FOR GIVE NESS.  Similar to the absence of compulsion...stated above.                   </I></FONT>
<BR>I would like to reserve a discussion of faith for another time, as a system of value assignment doesn't seem to require that we agree on what faith is.  I agree with you that value must be tested for truth.  I would even go so far as to agree that the revelation of truth to an individual is so bound up with the person discovering truth that the experience cannot be shared in words.  I therefore agree not to argue about the truth, as it does have all the qualities of the relative. Like colors and tastes, there is little fruit to be borne by disputing "truth."  Let us, instead, dispute its underpinnings.
<BR>
<BR>Either there is an exterior, objective basis for the valuation of human acts, or there is not.  SK recognizes the two possibilities, and discusses a "universal" realm of valuation.  Because the universal was not his main interest, he mostly defined it by what it was not -- the Absolute (which I will return to).  In effect, the realm of the universal has enough characteristics in common with the Kantian categorical imperative that I will simply equate the two (and invite the serious scholars to split these hairs which I braid).  The imperative is not externally determined, as the ultimate test of value is what one individual would wish for others, and (one must assume).  One must also assume that the community in which the individual lives must to some extent ratify the value choice.  The individual is thus not entirely free to define value, but still is an active participant in its definition.  No exterior determination is necessary to enforce value in the realm of the universal.
<BR>
<BR>On the other hand, SK proposes a more intimate realm of valuation -- the Absolute, which is by definition something experienced by the single individual and not the community.  However, SK is not a solipsist, but to the contrary provides an external basis for this realm's valuation.  An individual interacts with (responds to) the demands of the Absolute.  SK pretty clearly is talking about the Christian God when he proposes this Absolute, although he generally keeps his language abstract in his discussions in _Fear and Trembling_.
<BR>
<BR>One need not accept SK's belief in God to understand the point of the Absolute.  The function of the Absolute is to create the possibility of one person being "right" in his valuation, even if he does not act consistently with the universal mores of his community.  If there is a fixed point from which values are determined then, you have the paradox of a "right" decision.  And, as SK observes, this puts one in fear and trembling of making wrong decisions.
