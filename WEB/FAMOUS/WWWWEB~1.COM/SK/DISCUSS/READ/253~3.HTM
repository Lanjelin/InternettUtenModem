<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Dear Cary,  Interesting! Very interesting! Maybe you can clarify a few points. Firstly, this intersection you alluded to, is it the same as saying - the subject embraces the object? [Yes, I think its alright to include an 'embrace' as a type of 'intersection' (intersection between subject and object.)]  And are you implying that subjectivity and consciousness are the same?  [Hmmm...  This is an interesting area to persue.  I don't really want to say that they are the same -- could you draw the distinction for me between subjectivity and consciousness?]  And what about this PURE EXPERIENCE  being initiated temporally?  1/30th of a second. This PURE EXPERIENCE being only a 1/30th of a second, can't really answer why it is only 1/30th of a second.  This is what Mr. Dean was explaining to me -- it was a magical moment where subject and object intersected, yet did not interesect-- its a paradox -- its a "pure experience" (subject experiences object with out subjectivity; pure objectivity) and according to him it only lasted about 1/30th of a second before it was tarnished by the subjectivity that we automatically lard over all things.  He was using the 1/30th of a second explanation only very loosely and did not want to defend it once its paradoxical nature became clear.  He says he doesn;tliek the lard, but for now, it appears he has resigned himself to its inevitability.]  Why is it we need a measurement to validate what is obvious?  I repeat...both subject and object are the same thing? Provocative enough Cary?  [So, you are disagreeing with Mr. Dean -- you think that the 1/30th of a second exists, and furthermore you think it it not restricted by that measurement -- you are saying that you are always in it, you are always in this 1/30th of a second of "pure experience".  Wow.  You should tell Mr. Dean about this.  He wants to find this "pure experience" but he cannot.  Maybe you can help him.]     As for solipsism, I understand your position and I just don't think it can be suggested that solipsism implies that " I cannot communicate with you and you can't communicate with me"  [OK, so you are saying that solipsists can communicate with each other].  Solipsism seems to me to be a profoundly honest appraisal of life.  Indicating that we have an awareness that is truely our own [excuse my interruption, but if it is truely our own doesn't communicating it, i.e. sharing it, pose problems?] and as such, we are granted the task of exploiting this - kinda like evolution. Infants are born solipsitic and as we grow we grow into awarness not out of it. And awareness belongs to consciousness and conciouness belongs to individuals and individuals communicate with each other because they are in their field of consciouness. [Whoa -- I got lost in those last few sentences]</I></FONT>
<BR>  Now tell me Cary, how can you dispute my suggestion to you, that you, and everthing including this text that you are reading NOW are in YOUR field or stream of conciousness.  [For now I'd say that I would not dispute you.  You think that everything I see is in my stream of consciousness -- OK, I can agree with that because surely I believe I am an existing person.  But again it returns to my confusion with solipsisma nd communication -- are the things in my stream of consciousness also in yours?  If each experience is uniquely my own, then are we on the same planet?  Are we reading the same text?  And if we are readingthe same text and are on the same planet, then don't you have to make room for an objective standards?]

<BR>
<BR>Bruce,
<BR>
<BR>Before I answer your question on Solipsism, please comment on the comments that I injected into your text to see if I am following along properly, and then take a gander at the two questions below.
<BR>
<BR>1. Could you talk more on solipsism in reference to how you were using 'awareness'.  Specifically, the baby's growing into 'awareness' and out of 'solipsism'.
<BR>2. And then please explain what it is to 'exploit our awareness', and how this coinsides with evolution.
<BR>
<BR>Sincerely, 
<BR>Cary
<BR>
<BR>PS.  I think we are getting somewhere.  I am anxious for your reply.
