<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I guess it's time to test my understanding of what I'm reading in "Practice iN Christianity"...  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;At the same time as I am reading this, I am reading Raymond Brown's "The Virgin Birth and Bodily Resurrection Of Jesus"  (Paulist Press, 1973)  As part of a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of belief in the virgin conception, Brown comments that Matthew seems to be replying to contemporary criticism that Jesus was born illegitimate, and the span of time between Mary's marriage and birth of Jesus was too short:  that if Matthew could simply have re-stated the months and the time span, he would have done so, but since he didn't, we surmise he -couldn't-.  Regarding the short time span, Brown writes "those who deny the virginal conception cannot escape the task of explaining how the rumor of illegitimacy and irregularity of birth arose and how they would answer it without accepting a very unpleasant alternative."  (p.66)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Although I don't know what SK believed regarding the virgin birth, SK's long treatment of "Blessed is he who is not offended in me" came to mind...  SK's insistence that we see Jesus first at a very low rung on the social ladder before approaching from faith seemed to tie in, and seems, in retrospect (anticipation?) an interesting commentary on how unpleasant the alternative might be...  Presumably it would have been embarassing to be illegitimate in Israel 2000 yrs ago...  Yet Brown's RC theology seems to want to deny Jesus a beginning so questionable...</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Any one else have thoughts?  Know what SK believed?  Wish to conjecture?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Fascinating thoughts.  I am somewhat familiar with the concept that Matthew "invented" the virgin birth to defend against Jesus illigitamcy.  (Of course, I've always wondered that if Matthew knew about Jesus illigitimate birth & thought this was a real problem, why'd he figure this guy was a Messiah?  But I digress...)
<BR>
<BR>I truly don't think that SK would have thought of an illigitimate birth as a grounds for "offense."  I only find this the case because SK had much too high a view of Scripture to conclude that it would have had such erroneus information.  (SK's thoughts on Scripture have been examined by Dr. Rosas and Dr. Emmanuel in recent books comparing SK & his thoughts on Revelation/Scripture)
<BR>
<BR>What I WOULD find interesting, however, is the thought that the miraculous nature of the birth itself may have been a point of offense to some.  In "Practice in Christianity" if I remember right, SK makes two major categories of offense, one of which would have major problems with a simple man having claims to deity.  I agree that many people at the time may have claimed that Jesus had been illigitimate (hence Matthew's choice to include this virgin birth story as an explanation [not to imply he made it up]) because they were too offended to accept the idea that his birth had been a miraculous incarnation.  They were offended that anyone could have been said to have had a virgin birth, and hence, they would rather point to Jesus having had an illigitimate birth than admit that he had divine & eternal origins.  (This may be similar to Brown's approach.)  Let me know what you think.
