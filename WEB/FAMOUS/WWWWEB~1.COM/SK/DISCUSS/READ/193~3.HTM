<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>James Smith's comment raises a point that often troubles me, both in thinking about SK and in trying to maintain my Christian faith.  There is no question that SK, and all of us, had to recognize that the sources of his faith were open to question on scientific and historical grounds.  SK did not believe the story of the Fall in Genesis, and his discussion of anxiety effectively says that the idea of sin coming into the world through one man (as the Roman Catholic mass has it) is illogical. . . </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>This leads us to the troubling question (again, troubling for SK study and troubling for life), what is the basis of faith?  </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I reject the idea that Christian faith is [without a basis in objective reality], just as I reject the thought that it doesn't matter whether the universe is filled with ether, or whether the earth moves and rotates. Objective reality matters because we have nothing else.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;At this point, you answered your own question, "What is the basis of faith?"  One way to define it is a belief in things that are beyond objective reality (if there is such a thing as objective reality to begin with).  We must depend on the subjective leap of faith to make it to the relation with the absolute.  To say that a reliance on the subjective always leads to chimerical beliefs is a generalization, and therefore not logical (right, philosphy students?)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; </I></FONT>
<BR>I strongly disagree that I have answered my own question.  The basis of faith has to be one of two things -- (1) a fact or dogma available through the universal (Jesus Christ died for your sins;  The Atman is the Brahma; you must will the infinite repetition of all things;  There is one God and Mohammed is his prophet), or (2) an individual experience of one's relation to the absolute (an experience like Abraham's, or an experience of the Buddha that doesn't involve seeing Buddha come down the road, or the experience of becoming a blond beast, or whatever it is that makes you say "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent").  The problem is, for any of these is either category to have any meaning, it has to be true.
<BR>
<BR>Subjective beliefs that have no grounding in objective fact, or absolute truth, always lead to chimerical beliefs because they are as free as dreams.  Take a look at anything complicated in the real world that you aren't relatively expert in, and try to guess how it works -- a computer disk drive or the torque converter in an automatic transmission or a ship's gyroscope -- and you will be wrong if you don't know a lot of objective information about it.  Why should the world of faith be any different?  If there aren't any objective underlying tenets to build on, what is to stop you from picking the wrong god?  What makes you think this is easy?  Why aren't you as worried about making a bad choice in your faith as we all are about buying a computer with a second-rate processor or picking a used car with a cracked engine block?  
<BR>
<BR>The fear that the absolute doesn't exist isn't a hypothetical.  The possibility of backing a loser isn't irrelevant.  We are all forced to gamble everything we have on getting it right, and we none of us has a guarantee that we were raised on the right continent or heard the right preacher.  If the clue to the absolute isn't imbedded in the universal (objective), I think we're in trouble.  And the first question in this awareness is, how much of the Cristian faith story has to be true for us to be reasonably reassured that we have picked an absolute that exists?
