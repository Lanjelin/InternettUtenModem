<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Subjective beliefs that have no grounding in objective fact, or absolute truth, always lead to chimerical beliefs because they are as free as dreams.  Take a look at anything complicated in the real world that you aren't relatively expert in, and try to guess how it works -- a computer disk drive or the torque converter in an automatic transmission or a ship's gyroscope -- and you will be wrong if you don't know a lot of objective information about it.  Why should the world of faith be any different?  If there aren't any objective underlying tenets to build on, what is to stop you from picking the wrong god?  What makes you think this is easy?  Why aren't you as worried about making a bad choice in your faith as we all are about buying a computer with a second-rate processor or picking a used car with a cracked engine block?  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The fear that the absolute doesn't exist isn't a hypothetical.  The possibility of backing a loser isn't irrelevant.  We are all forced to gamble everything we have on getting it right, and we none of us has a guarantee that we were raised on the right continent or heard the right preacher.  If the clue to the absolute isn't imbedded in the universal (objective), I think we're in trouble.  And the first question in this awareness is, how much of the Cristian faith story has to be true for us to be reasonably reassured that we have picked an absolute that exists?</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>The difference between having faith and building a computer is that, in faith, the Absolute seeks a relationship with each individual, wherein the computer or the car doesn't seek relationships.  Let's say some mysterious person wanted to make a friend of you.  So, you go out and seek facts on the fellow.  Whether these facts are good or bad, can we really say we know the person from objective facts?  I would argue not; but then again, as I type, I can see some objective facts that might make me think <I>very</I> badly of someone.  My point, though, is that the relationship is more important than any objective facts about the relationship (in my opinion).  It isn't about listening to the right preacher or believing the proper tenets isn't as important as having a relationship with the Absolute.
<BR>
<BR>So the question comes, as Christopher Harless said, about whether there is an Absolute at all.  I passionately believe in God, and I believe I have a relationship with God, but I can't prove any of those things.  Faith is a matter for each and every individual to grapple with.  All of this discussion has enlightened me about the importance of epistimology in philosophy, though.
