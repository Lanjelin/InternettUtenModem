I find it hard to foment credulity for the sake of happiness.  If there is a God, I believe he would like us to use our god-given powers of understanding rather than simply capitulate to a belief system merely because it is most apt to produce happiness.</I></FONT>

<BR> 
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;A sane person seeking faith, then, is required (I think) to care very much about whether his/her faith is in something that really exists.  And that is why your last post brings us full circle -- raising again the question of what the ground of faith must be. </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Reading this over, I see that I should clarify that "faith" as I'm using it, does not mean faith in a supernatural.  My definition of faith includes the underpinnings of a moral system, the conclusions we draw from our metaphysics (our conclusions about the nature of being), whether religious or atheistic.  Under my definition, one could have faith that rational scientific inquiry has defined the real world so completely that no revolutionary discoveries remain to be made.
<BR>
<BR>Faith is important, because it is the precondition of morals, those habits so deeply held that they merge into our identity.  We can live without faith, but then we live provisionally -- because so much remains unproven that without faith, our lives are always subject to radical change, and no morals can develop. Because we want our habits to be desirable and suited to our environment, it then follows that we want our faith to be grounded in something that gives us good morals -- the truth.
<BR>
<BR>But good morals might be morals that help us survive as individuals, or help our species propagate more effectively, or bring us closer to God, or even those that support ethnic purification (because only certain races should survive), or that seek to terminate all human life because bodily existence is evil (I'm overstating Catharism a little, maybe).  It's important to remember that people can reach very different conclusions about good morals.  Some moral systems are odious to others, and we cannot assume that everyone will reach a conclusion that is compatible with ours.  Even setting Hitler and Cathrism aside, think of Nietzsche's critique of Western culture.  He was righteously outraged at the very morality we most of us embrace -- he thought modern liberal society was destroying the human race.
<BR>
<BR>The grounding of our faith, our truth, our conclusions about metaphysics, deterine our morals.  Getting to the right truth matters, then, because we don't want to commit bad acts in the belief we are doing good.
<BR>
<BR>Truth's relationship with facts is problematic but strong.  For example, I was raised Roman Catholic, and taught that the bread and wine consecrated at Mass became the body and blood of Christ -- that this is literally true and not a metaphor.  This RC belief is based on Aristotelian physics, which permit the substance of a thing to be different from its affects.  The Protestants, faced with Newtonian physics and a renewal of belief in atomism, had to rephrase the truth to fit the facts of the new physics, and talk about consecration in metaphorical terms.  The new facts that couldn't be denied had an impact on the experience of the truth -- a Protestant communion is something completely different from a RC communion.
<BR>
<BR>Other new facts have changed the truths we can accept, sometimes radically, sometimes subtly.  Some of those truths impact some persons' faith.  Just to take one example, quantum mechanics has shaken the faith of those who hoped in a rational and deterministic universe which can be measured more and more precisely, subject only to the sensitivity of the measuring tool.  Now physics is split between the old guard materialists and young turks like Stephen Hawking, who is developing a sort of theology of the big bang, as I understand it.
<BR>
<BR>So, to say in a short paragraph what I've said in two pages, faith and truth and facts are all bound up together in a way that puts SK's Absolute, and the Chrstian God at risk of being overtaken by events.  How and why do we protect faith from being eaten up by conflicting facts, and how do we protect ourselves from falling into a faith that is solipsistic: not communicable because not based on universals, not absolute because it is not a relation to anything but ourselves?  Don't we all face, without anyone ever having an option to opt out, the dual risks of untrammeled subjectivity and bad faith (faith in what doesn't exist), and isn't the risk of getting the truth wrong a real problem raised by SK's leap of faith?
