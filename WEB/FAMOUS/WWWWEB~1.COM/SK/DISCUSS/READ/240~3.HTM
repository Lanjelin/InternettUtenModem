<BR>
<BR>Thanks for your post, which was enlightening as always.  I see now that my view on particularity may give rise to a an apparent circularity in my understanding of faith, which I haven't dealt with before.  I think (tell me if I'm wrong) that we both agree to the first conclusion I draw from particularity, that God's existence is a fact external to my own consciousness, and that because God can be wrongly apprehended, we live in fear and trembling of misunderstanding what God demands.  Faith therefore can be true or false (many shades of gray in between).
<BR>
<BR>I still disagree that faith itself is a subjective motion.  You may be right that I have drifted from a discussion of SK's subjectivity, to use the term merely as a synonym for opinion or belief.  I will accept your definition as truer to SK, and try to use it in expanding the discussion.  There are two reasons I believe that faith is an expereince of an objective thing.
<BR>
<BR>First, I will not exclude the possibility of a Christian God, if such exists, acting as an external determination and making Himself (gender of pronoun incidental) present to a single individual in an undeniable manner, in a way that has nothing to do with the individual's positive action.  For example, consider the case of Paul.  Paul's faith, if he told the truth, was based on an external determination that changed his physical self -- knocked him to the ground, struck him blind, and talked to him -- to say that Jesus was in fact God (I am He Whom you persecute).  Paul's faith, in my parlance, is particular and not subjective.  A force or object which was not a part of himself impacted on his consciousness to create a state he called faith (come to think of it, he defined the term in its Christian sense).  He just couldn't talk much about the experience of the thing itself, because it was not a universal experience.  An experience of the thing did, however, yield an understanding about universals, which was crystallized into dogma.  (I think the use of "universal" and "dogma" here is consistent with SK's usage).
<BR>
<BR>But, you will say, maybe it is different with us ordinary mortals or with respect to the relationship to the absolute.  I disagree, because faith is a _relationship_, and a relationship implies the existence of two things in context each with the other.  To say it more briefly, true faith in God has to be faith in something external, unless we claim that God is a sum of parts that can be contained in the human individual (I think that view is a form of pantheism, not Christianity).  If the external thing the Christian believes in does not exist, then what we are experiencing is an internal positive action, but the belief in the external thing is an error  (the faith is a delusion, or it is false faith).  If the external thing does exist, what we are experiencing is the effect of that external thing operating on our consciousness, even though we are not aware of its operation.  Again, more simply, we experience a call to faith even if we do not experience the One doing the calling.
<BR>
<BR>The reason this argument can appear circular is that we have no distant vantage point from which to view the interaction of the two parts.  I am hard pressed to find an analogy--let me try to compare faith to a hypothetical adapted from grade school physics.  Imagine standing on a platform with no atmosphere or other source of friction to affect it or the things around it.  For a long time you stand there, and the sky is empty and nothing moves.  Eventually, a large object moves past you at an apparently constant rate of speed.  If you cannot see evidence of engines internal to the object, you cannot determine whether (1) the object is being propelled by its own power, (2) it has been propelled backward by the force of something else pushing against it, or (3) you are accelerating at an imperceptible rate, and the object that was once moving at the same speed and direction as you now has gained relative velocity.
<BR>
<BR>As with the large moving object, faith can be apprehended in several ways.  However, the essence of faith, its meaning and usefulness, depend on which apprehension is accurate.  If it is indeed subjective, that is, not informed by external determination, then it is not the relationship which it appears to be, and which the Christian hopes it is.
<BR>
<BR>I hope we can continue this discussion when I return to my computer in two weeks.  In the meantime, I hope others will feel free to jump in with their views.  I apologize in advance for the typographical errors and non-sequiturs contained herein.  It is very difficult for me to proofread documents on screen.
