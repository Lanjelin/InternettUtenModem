<BR>
<BR>I think (and I say this cautiously) you are to some extent treating subjectivity as analogous/similar to personal opinion or belief.  Taken in this way, however, I think subjectivity becomes merely sub specie objectivity, as one pole of an objective experience: those objective facts which are not very amenable to substantiation or proof to another person (because they are in our own heads, derive from our particular perspective, etc.) in contrast to those objective facts which are for all practical purposes universal between people, communicable, provable, etc.
<BR>
<BR>But subjectivity in SK and my response refers to more the early 19th century notion of subjectivity, which in simple terms is whether or not the phenomena derives from an internal positive action of consciousness or an external determination.  SK's work can be seen as a presupposition that the phenomena is both, and also as a working out of the relationship between the two.  Thus, faith is subjective pure and simple, because it is purely derived from the internal passion of a commitment.
<BR>
<BR>But this does not mean that faith then devolves into a purely personal  arbitrariness.  For the commitment, internally motivated, is precisely to a singular existing object - Jesus Christ as God Himself.  The commitment, rendered correctly, is to believe that Jesus was God.  And, unlike a purely conceptual God (and this, I think, is the uniqueness of the Christian God) who one might worship but not have a public conversation with, Jesus was a man and communicated in actual words His desire for us - such as, for instance, "the meek shall inherit the earth."
<BR>
<BR>Again, faith is purely subjective because it is essentially an inward passion of committed.  But it is not externally arbitrary nor purely personal because Jesus was an actual man who spoke and told us certain things, some of them very definite.  Without faith (the commitment to believe He was God), then Jesus was just a man whom we can listen to or not, just like any other man.  With faith (the commitment to believe He was God), then Jesus was/is an objective authority whom we must obey.
<BR>
<BR>It is of course essential to Christianity and Christian faith that Jesus rose from the dead.  But this does not change faith into an objective fact; it just means: if there was no resurrection, then there was no revelation of God on earth, and thus no opportunity for faith (in the Christian sense).  In other words, you are presenting a hypothetical case, which is instructive, but only hypothetical.  In historical fact, it is claimed that Jesus did rise from the dead, and that He was God on earth.  And there is no certain proof that He did not and was not.  Presumeably, as to the first claim, some objective scientific experiment might have been devised at the moment of the resurrection to prove or disprove the same, but in fact that was not done.  As to the second claim, I do not think any experiment or theory could be done to prove or disprove it.  Thus, on the facts as we know them, we are faced with a pure subjective decision: to believe or not.  If we believe, the objective concreteness follows in obediance to Him and His words.  If we disbelieve, then - well, then we do whatever we thinks best.
