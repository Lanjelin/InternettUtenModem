<BR>I am sorry I have not replied sooner, but the end of the month was quite busy here.
<BR>
<BR>To get to your request first, the cites for K's entries about grief and the forms of despair are Pap. IX A 498-500 and Pap. IX A 421.  I found this in the paperback edition of the The Sickness Unto Death, Princeton University, KW XIX.
<BR>
<BR>The original question was, I thought, the relationship between the esthetic, ethical and religious stages in K's psychology.  Now I find myself hoping you are only accusing me of clunky writing.  For, the alternative is that you think I fail to recognize the importance of
<BR>living what one expresses.  
<BR>
<BR>I cannot imagine anyone who has taken any kind of an interest in K who would not at least recognize that there is a distinction between living and thinking about living.  Thinking is the cold grey essentialism of chemistry and physics, and of 18th Century metaphysics and ontology; what Schelling called a bunch of "dead concepts."  Living  is the vibrant, changing, exhilirating, and despair-provoking anxiousness of reality.
<BR>
<BR>But when I have only a few lines to impart meaning, I must turn to some short-hand tools which help me to finish the thought: thus I use Judge William in a forum about Kierkegaard because I assume most have read Either/Or; and by using him as an example, I do not have to try to explicate all the circumstances of my own grief which have led me to try to explain whatever it is I am trying to explain.  Judge William is a paradigm; a useful model which shortens explanations.  An auto-biography by me might explain grief better than I explained it in my post; but I suspect nobody here would want to read it.  And it is
<BR>highly doubtful that my life story, as written by me, a layman, would ever be an adequate explication of my own personal grief.  Better to turn to the work of a real poet.
<BR>
<BR>As to the question about whether we change as life proceeds, I stated that I thought K maintained the position that in the ethical-religious, one's life stays constant.  I think at least in part, he was going back to ancient Greek wisdom that there must be, in anything that changes, something that stays the same, for it is only in the contrast with the unchanging that change is noticed/perceivable.  Following this principle, personal change and growth must contain something constant, something which stays the same in the midst of the continuous tumult; and the ethical-religious provides just such a principle in the will or personal commitment.  With a singular subjective ethical-religious focus, growth and
<BR>change then become an actuality, a reality which is dynamic and changing and new each moment.  But only insofar as the commitment stays constant.  For if that waivers, then actuality itself crumbles, and reduces itself to the lowest common denominators of perception.
<BR>
<BR>But enough of that.  I thank you for your extended reply.  It has been very thought-provoking.
