<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;It is Mr. Paproski who seems to hold to the belief that we continuously live in that 1/30th of a second, not I.  He likes existentialism and zen and talks about no distinction between subject and object... all of these I take as paraphrases for what we were talking about earlier -- that "pure experience".  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;. . . .</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And now, you say that Mr. Paproski's idea of continuously living in that magical moment (pure experience; subject object in eternal union) is to brilliant to ignore-- well, okay -- but it suprises me a great deal to hear you say that.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Now, having go that off my chest, I can return to my questions.. in your treatment of the "magic moment in a reverie",  is the memory a memory of the intersection?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;If yes, then , this memory (rephrased "re-presentation"), is it really indistinguishable from the "original presentation"? . . . .</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;If I am following, you are asking if memory is as real as the first experience. . . .</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;That part about the infinate only shows up when you enter into the mirrors -- that is a wonderful observation.  And please tell me the titles of these books by Casidy -- I would like to look at his experiments -- are they good reading?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And is the fixed point the archimedean point?  I have heard it said that the Greeks could not concieve of a fixed point -- that the point is a thoroughy modern conception.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>Sorry to have bruised your feelings -- not an intentional slight.  I attributed the "perpetual magical moment" idea to you because it is the flip side of your favorite insight that external objects and forces, at the moment they are perceived, begin to be changed and take on to some degree the character of an interior motion.  I had not thought about the fact that the reverse is also true: the internal is always being re-presented and acting in the nature of an external determinative force.  That is, the subject's internal reality is not entirely within his/her control, but is "externally" determined by the quality of memory, and its mere event.  It adds to the complexity of making the subject/object distinction.
<BR>
<BR>As for Cassidy, he is the "Doc Moriarty" character in Jack Kerouac's _On the Road_, and shows up again in Tom Wolfe's _The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_.  I don't think he was published.  Cassidy and the other Merry Pranksters (led by Ken Kesey, author of _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_) engaged in a number of experiments with human consciousness, most of which strike me as thinly veiled excuses to get wasted.  But the fascination with decreasing the membrane between internal and external reality struck me as relevant to our objective/subjective project.
<BR>
<BR>The final preliminary -- the fixed point.  Aristotle conceives of the divine as the "unmoved mover," the thing which puts all other things in motion, and relative to which their movement must be measured.
<BR>
<BR>My objective/subjective point, has reduced itself (across the last three weeks) to epistemology.  The question we are discussing has moved from the nature of subject and object (somewhere between metaphysics and ethics), to considering how the object is apprehended by the subject, and whether the apprehension is reliable.  I think we have backed ourselves into a corner, as it seems only if Someone has the right to tell us authoritatively what the truth is, can we apprehend it.  Where are we in the discussion as you see it?  I'm sort of unsure what the next step in the conversation is.
