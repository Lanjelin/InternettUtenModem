<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;With respect to this point, however, isn't the point of the Philosophical Fragments that there are only accidental distinctions between the first generation of disciples and later generations?

<BR>
<BR>You have touched on my one deep disagreement with SK.  The Incarnation, it seems to me, has shot reality through with "particularity."  Particularity, as I use it, refers to those facts which happen once and are not readily repeatable or verifiable.  Particular facts are not the sort that can be tested in the laboratory, or which can be predicted a priori.  As I use the term, the particular is a species of objective fact (a fact which proceeds from the action of an external determinative force) whose truth is largely tested by the testing the reliability of the witnesses to it.
<BR>
<BR>SK does not appear to recognize the existence of the particular -- which seems odd to me, because it seems very compatible, as a category, with the Absolute.  That is, it is particular experiences and facts are the basis of any encounter with the Absolute.  Paul's experience on the road to Damascus, Abraham's sacrifice, the experience of the Apostles at the Transfiguration:  these are all moments of contact with the Absolute, and all by virtue of particular experiences -- not readily spoken of, because so difficult to verify and impossible to repeat  (the stories that come from these moments are full of facts so uncommon and non-universal that even believers still ask ourselves, "Was Paul an epileptic?"  "Is Abraham's sacrifice a myth?").
<BR>
<BR>The Incarnation, of course, is the ultimate example of particularity -- How are we to verify in any way that this man Jesus was in fact God?  And the answer seems clear that many more possibilities were open to the first believers than are available today.  One could, at minimum, follow this Jesus around for an extended period and judge whether his behavior was consistent with his claims.  One could ask direct questions and get answers.  Even the Gospel account has Jesus recognizing that the time of his Incarnation was unique -- remember the passage where he absolved his followers from fasting while the "bridegroom" was still with them?  It therefore seems meaningless to assert that the differences between generations' experience of Christ are "accidental."  Accidental, yes, and that's the very scandal of it, the scandal of particularity.  That it is accidental, however, does not reduce the impact on our faith of our modern inability to talk to Jesus face to face.
<BR>
<BR>I am puzzled why SK ignores the consequent importance of particularity, in this and other ramifications of the Incarnation.  His philosophical underpinnings (his "metaphysics," if you will) seem amazingly untouched by Incarnation, and this disconnect seems to me the the biggest weakness of his thought-world.  For example, SK spends long pages considering the subjective and the objective, and the tincture of the object which always interferes with pure human subjectivity, without apparently thinking about the fact that a human being, by definition, has an imperfect body (aging, mortal).  Nor, in his discussions of the immanent and the transcendent, does SK recognize that for a human being to truly experience the transcendent, his or her body would have either to be taken along or left behind.  And even when speaking about the offense of faith given by the Incarnation itself, he fails to consider that the Incarnation literally alters God.  That is, pre-Christ, God was not human in any way.  Post-Christ, God has taken on humanity  -- it is a shift in the underpinnings of philosophy, so that what could not be said about the Divine before now _must_ be said.
<BR>
<BR>Given the importance for generating a Christian metaphysics of the Incarnation in particular, and particularity in general, I cannot accept SK's claim that we are all equally in contact with the Incarnation.  That we are all equally loved, or all equally salvageable, I can believe.  But no one can claim that we are all called, like Abraham, to sacrifice a son.  No one can claim we could all be knocked blind to the ground and converted with the drama of Paul.  And if these particular events created special opportunities in faith for these particular individuals, how could the direct experience of the Incarnation fail to do so?
