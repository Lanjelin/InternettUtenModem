Mr. Dean,
<BR>
<BR>I still have questions, but first, I want to assure you that I mean no condescention with my comments about the lard.  The lard image is something that has stuck in my mind ever since you mentioned it.  It reminds me of SK's depiction of the objective task, to obtain a completely reliable report; figuratively speaking, to wipe all the lard from our glasses.  And lard works well because it sticks, and a hankerchief surely could not get it all off.  Even a towel would probobly leave SOME residue.  You could reduce the amount to something negligibe and then it is easily overlooked, but the clean will always be approximate. *  
<BR>
<BR>If you were able to get all the lard off, it would be something akin to returning to that pure 1/30th of a second.  
<BR>
<BR>But I am already digressing.
<BR>Back to th passage in question... 
<BR>
<BR>[Defining] The realm of the subjective [is difficult because that realm] begins at the intersection of objective facts with a human consciousness, and so [attempting to identify the border between the objective and the subjective] creates some confusion.
<BR>
<BR>Could you attempt to draw the border, and point out the confusion, showing exactly where it sets in; and maybe you could talk a bit about the objective realm, specifically where the human consciousnesses is in reference to it. 
<BR>
<BR>Sincerely,
<BR>Cary Cortese
<BR>
<BR>---------
<BR>*Maybe dunking the spectacles in the river would work, maybe the water could remove the lard completely.  (To expend all that energy to go all the way to the river would certainly be considered eccentric nowadays, with all our modern conveniences, one could simply walk three steps to the sink and clean ones glasses there, without even takeing ones eyes off the television set.)

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     Happy now?  All I have to offer in my defense for the dangling dependent clause in the original is that I get telegraphic when I'm going over concepts that I think people will accept as already settled.  Your parodied exegesis of how confusion relates to consciousness and the border between object and subject is frighteningly convincing (although the "lard" references are more condescending than I deserve).  To avoid being tarred as the progenitor of such monstrosities, I hereby disavow and recant a belief (1) in the existence of some sort of short-lived, naif "experience" of the objective that is prior to or purer than subjective "interaction" with the world or (2) that "confusion" is the inevitable result of human interaction with the world.  (And yet, I am heard to mutter, there is confusion, and it does seem inevitable.)</I></FONT>
