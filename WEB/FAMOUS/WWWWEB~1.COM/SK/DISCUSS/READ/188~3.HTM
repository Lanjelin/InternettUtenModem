<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;OK, This is what I mean by "concrete".  If you mean to imply that we can not understand human existence at all, much less in terms of subjectivity, I have no answer.  It seems to me that Existentialism is precisely the pursuit of answering the question, What does it mean for me to exist as an individual?  Kierkegaard and others do make use of abstract, ontological, concepts, but the real concern is the individual in his/her concrete existence.  Heidegger, for example, makes the well known distinction between the ontological/existential and the ontic/existentiell.  We can talk about human existence in abstract ways so long as we don not forget that it must apply to existing humans.  That is precisely what Hegel forgot.  He stopped with the abstract human "as such."  Kierkegaard noticed that Hegel's logic missed the boat because he thought that he could "mediate" the dichotamies in human existence.  Kierkegaard seeks to maintain the dichotamies (eg. possibility/necessity, finitude/infinitude) in dialectical tension.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Existentialism and the concrete individual are abstract concepts, right?
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I think what you mean to say (if so, I would agree) is that </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Existentialism isolates the individual and asks of him or her </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>questions of ultimate significance.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Touche!  Existentialism, of course, does not ask these questions.  It merely uncovers, defines, expresses the questions and what they mean.  Where the questions come from is precisely the mystery.  Self? God? the Universe?  Tillich says that human existence IS a question.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;For Kierkegaard, the individual </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>is further isolated before God.</I></FONT>
<BR>As I said above, our talk about human existence must always be in relation to actual existence in time.  It must recognize the dialectic of human existence.  (I realize I am beeing vague, sorry) "This" individual refers to the opposite of a merely abstract individual (which does not exist).
<BR>
<BR>True existentialism?
<BR>Concrete individual?
<BR>
<BR>The more I read your lines the more I feel drawn to Descartes' project.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I think this is what you are implying </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>by "almost objective." What is true is that Existentialism </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>communicates insights into the ontological structure of human</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>beings (despite Sartre's denial of ontological substance to por-soi).</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;This is an idea that would require more time and space to do justice. Sartre denies that there is any sort of ontological substance at the base of human consciousness.  There is no "thinking thing", ego, transcendental self, etc.  All there is is consciousness.  Consciousness by itself is empty, it is always consciousness of something.  Rather than being, consciousness is more like a negativity.  It is presence-to-self.  It is like a fissure in being which allows being to present itself to itself.  Having said this, he goes on to talk about structures of human consciousness, which I would argue are nevertheless ontological, though perhaps not metaphysical in the classical sense.  For more on this see, Being and Nothingness.  </I></FONT>
<BR>OK.  Eventually I will. Butnot soon.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I am surprised that you were able to read this out of what I said.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I don't know if more tradition is needed, but I do think tradition </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>has a valuable place. Kierkegaard did not discredit Religiousness A </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>with Religiousness B. Some think that in today's rationalized world, </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>there is no room for religious belief, especially if it deals in </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>metaphysical of mythical language. I, however, think that the jury </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>is still out. I'm not so sure that we can replace the meanings</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>involved in symbols with rational concepts. The goal, however, is to </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>constantly re-interpret those meanings. This is the task of Church </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Dogmatics and Systematic Theology. Kierkegaard might disagree on this</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>point. The job is never done, however, and here is wherer existential</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;> subjectivity can be employed to guard</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>against hegemony, fanaticism, etc. I think I know of a few quotes where SK is saying exactly what you are saying here.  The are in Postscript and it is when he has imaginatively constucted a conversation with God.  "It is a if God were to say... its jsut you and me, shhh, don't tell anyone..."</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Can it be done?  Can the thing forgotten stand by itself?  In Kierkegaardian terms, can one exist in the same religious passion without an external tradition.  Kierk. recognized that his generation lacked precisely religion, despite their outward religiosity.  But can you have religiousness without religion (tradition)? </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>Have you just coined a phrase -- "The thing forgotten"?  And yes, I would say that the thing forgotten does stand by itself.  It stands by itself for the subjective individual (and it is there for the objective individual even though he cannot see it; let the comedy begin).  The dificulty begins when the subjective individual tries to communicate this thing forgotten, when he tries to remind people.  Precisely by trying to remind others he exposes himself to the dangers of becoming objective himself and forgetting, i.e. becoming positive.  Because, you see, in Kierkegaardean terms, I suppose this thing forgotten would be negetive and inward, in contrast to outward/positive religiosity.  And the difficulty is the communication of this negetive, which the subjective soul desires to do, but not at the cost of making the negetive into the positive, which often happens right under our noses.  The entire postscript is SK shifting positive to negetive, negetive to positive; going through fits of rapture, technical detail, blabbering gibberish, and then back to rapture.  Do you know the sentence about the "...good advice, and also quite cheap"?  Its in postscript, its an amazing run on... 
<BR>  
<BR>So, in summary, the thing forgotten stands by itself, but there are those who cannot see it (although they areconstantly looking right at it -- let the comedy begin again), and then there is those who can see it and want to communicate it, helook what i got (and when they say thatits gone)-- and then there are those who learn to live with it, quietly.  (Bythe way, where do you think SK fit in?)   
<BR>      
<BR>P.S. Sarte, the unhappy consciousness -- very religious.
<BR>PSS. ANd the thing forgotten does not need organized religion, but neither does it shy away from it.  Note the sect of Gnostics, the Valentinians, who attended Tertulian type churches regularly -- then they had a secret private ceremony afterwards too.  (Elaine Pagels, Gnostic Gospels).  And I am not saying all Valentians had this thing forgotten.  the thing forgotten is very dangerous -- a la devilish even, very strong allure, but who can be sure if they have it?  Elusive it is.  Often times the only thing people lik the valentinians or Kierkegaard, or even Yoda or Pirsig are good for is a MYSTIFICATION.  Looking for him, found him you have! 
<BR>
<BR>So, int hte end, I agree with your reinterpretation idea, keep updating the system with reverence for the bugs --your plight is hopeless, but you will rejoice because it is the highest.
