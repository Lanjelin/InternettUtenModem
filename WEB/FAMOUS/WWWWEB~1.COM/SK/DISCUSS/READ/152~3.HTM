<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I think Existentialism is - in contrast to any east-asiatic view of world - a rather individualistic point of view and has a lot to do with the possibilities of shaping your own life, catching the possibilities which life offers to you (this is a very important topic  in Sartres "l«etre et le neant", for instance). This can also give an explanation, how Existentialism can be christian, and so: religious. The very special thing about christian religion in comparison to other world-religions is its individualism. One is responsible for fulfilling God«s will oneself, individually. One has to act like his conscience (which represents God) tells to him, and in special cases it is his duty to act against the common values and laws.(there are some very impressionable passages about this in the letters of Paulus) </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;> Kierkegaard gave a radical biblic example in "trembling and fear": The story of Abraham willing to sacrifice his own son. You can think about Abraham however you want, you can even call him a murderer who was ready to give his son for saving his own soul - still you must confess that he must have been a very RELIGIOUS person, and on the other hand he was in what really deserves to be called an EXISTENTIAL situation: imagine you are forced by your conscience to kill your own son; imagine to be hitler«s father, to give a non-religious example - this is much more an existential problem then what most (by far not all !) atheistic people today define as their "existential" question: how can I get the biggest quantity of joy out of my conditions ? - and they understand the existential phenomenons of anxiety and despair as the mere fear, that they eventually could fail in squeezing the last drop of juice out of the orange of life. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In Camus' The Stranger, the 'protagonist' killed a guy on the beach just 'cause it was too damned hot. This is living in the moment. It is an existential moment.It was not predetermined. He did it because, at that moment, he felt like it.This is Zen and existentialism. Abraham attempted to kill his son because God told him to. He was following orders.Therefore this is not an "individualistic" act, it is one of subservience.    </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>1. Abraham could not talk to anybody about his deed, not before and not afterwards. Nobody would have understood. In his decision to fulfill God´s will against all common values he was the most lonely person one can imagine.    
<BR> He could have betrayed himself by interpreting the appearance of God as an illusion. He could have said to himself that a God demanding such a cruelty is impossible. So it was HIS OWN decision to follow God´s order. There is no discrepance between individualism and voluntary subservience. 
<BR> 
<BR>2. In my opinion, Existentialism is more then "nunc stans". In K´s either/or (the papers of B) "the choice" is described as an existential situation. It is existential because in the moment you decide for either.../or... you are aware you decide about your future. This awareness of irreversibility creates an existential atmosphere which is quite different from the experience of contingency (is this the right term in english?) in Camus´ stranger.
