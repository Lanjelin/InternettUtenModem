SK says at the beginning of Part Two of _The Sickness unto Death_:
<BR>"Sin is: _before God, or with the conception of God, in despair not to will to be
<BR> oneself, or in despair not to be oneself.  Thus sin is intensified weakness or
<BR>intensified defiance: Sin is the intensification of despair.  The emphasis is on
<BR>_before God_, or with a conception of God; it is the conception of God
<BR>that makes sin dialectically, ethically, and religiously what lawyers call 
<BR>'aggravated despair.'"
<BR>
<BR>This definition has always struck me as somewhat circular.  It also seems to
<BR>put the job of defining reality and self entirely into "God's" part of the
<BR>equation.  This is consistent Christian with orthodoxy -- see, for example,
<BR>Augustine's discussion of sin in his Confessions, where he defines sin
<BR>as simply the failure to say yes to God.  For Augustine and SK both, sin is
<BR>the only thing (it seems to me) a person can do, since God is the source of
<BR>all virtue or right action, and a single human individual is faced with a 
<BR>choice between rubber stamping the ukase of the Divine (it shall be thus),
<BR>or violating the order of the universe.  Yet neither SK nor Augustine
<BR>provide a mechanism for determining what the Divine has decided in individual 
<BR>instances.  That is, when the good decision is a difficult balancing between
<BR>conflicting duties or values, SK's and Augustine's God seems to me to bow out
<BR>of the picture.  The God described in the quote is only good -- it seems to
<BR>me -- for John Wayne type conflicts, when it's obvious what's right, and when 
<BR>the challenge of right activity is only to determine one's proper place.
<BR>
<BR>SK's view seems to me altogether too safe and Victorian -- a tea party morality.
<BR>For example, despair as failure to be oneself as one is called to be by God
<BR>seems meaningless in trench warfare, when one has to balance the
<BR>(patriotic) evil of deserting your comrades against the (personal moral) evil of killing
<BR>others, and against the (anti-survival) evil of rotting in a trench.  In complicated
<BR>situations, the Absolute demand to be a single individual grows so faint that
<BR>I have trouble attaching a meaning to SK's definition of sin.  Again, it seems both
<BR>unduly simple, and it seems circular because the failure to find out God's
<BR>will is sin, and yet it is the necessary condition of human existence.
<BR>
<BR>This dovetails into the discussion in the "Faith and Objectivity" discussion
<BR>about subjectivity and objectivity being wed in SK -- It seems to me SK marries
<BR> subject and object at the expense of permitting the subject to define the object,
<BR>at some points.  While I remain a rabid SK fan, I really have trouble accepting
<BR>his views of sin.  I have railed against his definition of original sin in this forum
<BR>before, and now I am questioning his view of individual despair/sin.
<BR>Any takers?
<BR>
<BR>(Apologies for the typos -- I am doing this on my home terminal, which
<BR>makes proofreading very difficult because of the tiny screen display it gives me.)
