An entry in the "for what it's worth" file:  Mr. Lynch's post asks about the meaning for SK of the text "Blessed is he who is not offended in me," discussed in _Practice in Christianity_.  SK's other work under the Anti-Climacus pseudonym, _The Sickness unto Death_ (the edition I quote below is Hong and Hong, eds. and trans., Princeton U. Press, 1980), also has a relatively long discussion of "offense", at pages 83-87  (XI 194-199, for those of you with the standard pagination).  
<BR>
<BR>The discussion of offense is placed in the text after the story of an ordinary man, who is offered the chance to marry the king's daughter: Anti-Climacus says that disbelief and fear of being made a fool might lead him to reject such a gift as an impossibility, although the man in the story could look for other evidence in the king's behavior toward him that the king's offer is made in good faith.  In the realm of faith, however, the ordinary person who has been offered God's love can look for no such sign.  It is at this point in the text that Anti-Climacus adds an appendix on offense.
<BR>
<BR>Among other things, Anti-Climacus describes offense as "unhappy admiration." He goes on:
<BR>
<BR>Thus it [offense] is related to envy, but it is an envy that turns against the person himself, is worse against oneself to an even higher degree.  The uncharitableness of the natural man cannot allow him the extraordinary that God has intended for him; so he is offended.
<BR>
<BR>"Offense," as defined here, seems to bear some resemblance to "ressentiment" in the work of Nietzsche, and to "alienation" in the later existentialists (perhaps in SK himself).  The definition of offense also changes the flavor of "Blessed is he who is not offended in me," from a conscious and simple rejection of faith, to a more complex internal action, of which the subject may not even be aware.
<BR>
<BR>While I still quibble that faith is not doomed to exist in a vacuum devoid of (or at least, entirely separate from) eternal objective fact, I think the definition of offense leads forward to the issue of consciousness of psychic disorder -- the nature of such disorder in SK's thought seems to render the sufferor less than completely aware of it, even of its existence. Does SK ever offer something like a practical cure for psychic disorders, in light of this separation from self, in his other works?
