<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Thank you for clarification, Mr. Tye.  My confusion was that I had not known of Jesus' exemption to the doctrine of Original Sin. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The scandal (or offense)that I was attempting to refer to was not Mary's relationship to original sin, for you are correct that to say that claiming Mary was subject to Original Sin is not very scandalous as she is considered merely human (except maybe to the Catholics, who consider Mary as somewhat of an idol, an b/c of that let there be  scadal); I was attempting to bring foward the scandal of incarnation, that Jesus was subject to Original Sin -- but, as you have just stated, this scandal didn't exist, as the doctrine does not apply to him; a nuance that I was not aware of.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The reason for my attempt was in a vain attempt to borrow an idea without crediting the author if it, and now you have pointed out that I have misused what I have borrowed.  I believe it was Mr. Tillet who introduced the incarnation as the primary "offense" that SK addresses; the incarnation offence being primary in that it takes precidence over any discussion of adultry; so, my purpose in bringing foreward the offense of the incarnation was likewise to superseed the discussion on adultry.  But in my presentation of the offense of the incarnation you have taken away what I saw as the offensive part, that the God was made subject to Original Sin.  So, now, in light of your comments, I must say that I do not see how the incarnation is so very offensive, I cannot see how it is the primary offense.  CAn you see how it would be offensive, I believe it would fit in with what you have already stated (for God to come into the world through sin in order to cure sin -- you also mentioned it sounds like ends justifies the means), for God and to enter into the world as humans do, in human form, complete with Original Sin?  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Is there another way to make the offence at the incarnation more >important, that is more offensive, than the adultry issue?</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>SK means by "offense" something different from our common understanding of the term. We usually mean by "offense" something associated with moral scandal. What SK means by "offense" is "rebuke to the understanding." The occasion for offense occurs when our natural understanding collides with the divine. Since the divine transcends our intellects, it appears to us as incomprehensible. At such moments we are faced as individuals with a decisive question: Will we reject the divine as the absurdity it appears to be (this is taking offense) or humble our intellects in faith (this is responding with faith rather than offense).
<BR>
<BR>With respect to the Incarnation, the offense is based on the fact that one Jesus of Nazareth, the humble carpenter and son of Joseph, claimed to be God Himself. And not just any God, but Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Lord of the Universe and Creator of all that Is. This claim is the height of absurdity (offense) to the natural understanding. How can a particular man, born in a particular time and place, also be the Creator of time and of place? How is it that the Eternal God could possibly take on a temporal existence? 
<BR>
<BR>The basic theme of all of SK's writing was that 1800 years of Christendom had dulled our understanding of the deeply radical nature of the Incarnation. Over the years the radical break that Christianity posited with respect to natural ways of thinking had been forgotten. People came to take the idea that Jesus Christ is God as just one idea among many ideas. SK wished to wake people up to the truly startling character of Christian claims, and to the fact that the Incarnation is not just another idea among others, but one that can only be approached in fear and trembling. The Incarnation is not just a crazy idea, but an idea that is so crazy that it could never occur to the mind of man. And because it seems so crazy, the possibility arises that we will be "offended" when we realize just what the Incarnation entails. Basically offense is resting in the position that the Incarnation is just too ridiculous to believe.
