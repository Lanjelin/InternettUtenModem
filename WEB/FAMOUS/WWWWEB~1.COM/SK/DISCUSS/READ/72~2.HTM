<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Hmmm.  I guess I'm inclined to ask a slightly more fundamantal (dumb) question:  What is faith?  Is faith certainty?  Certainly, SK would say (did say): Without doubt, there would be no faith.  If that is so, does faith increase in proportion to doubt?  If my doubts are greater, do I have greater faith?  Or is my faith only potentially greater?  But even for those who have faith, isn't it (assuming SK's premise is valid) in their interest to increase their doubts and thereby (at least potentially) increase their faith?  Or is faith absolute?  You either have it or ya don't.  But can't there be degrees of faith?  And if, so aren't there degrees of doubt?  And, no, this isn't idle speculation for me.  Nor am I trying to play word games.  It's that I have a sincere, deep-seaated suspicion that doubt is a basic human condition.  Also, I guess I think that if there is a god who endowed me with critical intelligence, he/she must have done it for a reason.  Might it be that such a god wants me or anyone else to stretch to the very limits of my credulity before making that final (infinite) leap.  Just as the the king in Fragments wants the maiden to love him for himself, perhaps god wants to know that it's not just our interest in eternal life, salvation, all the perks of believing, that is motivating us.  Maybe he/she wants to be loved/worshipped for him/herself, not for what he/she can do for us hapless mortals.  OK.  I'm getting a little far afield.  But I would be interested to hear some opinions on what, exactly, faith is.  Tell me in practical terms -- how the world of the faithful man is simply different from that of the unfaithful man.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Dumb questions are often the most important.  First of all, I want to explain that
<BR>I'm not the philosophy person you are, Johannes, and I don't really believe that
<BR>faith can be explained or defined as such; indeed the pseudonymous author of "Fear and
<BR>Trembling" was Johannes the Silent, which sort of shows how much one can say about faith.
<BR>Faith, however, can be lived.  So: faith might mean a simple belief in God, or indeed,
<BR>in any divinity you care to choose.  In that case, doubting would be the obvious reaction
<BR>against, where faith is for believing in a divinity.  However, no matter how much you doubt,
<BR>a belief in a divinity in this view would simply be that: a belief.  One would never go beyond
<BR>it, no matter how much one doubts. This, to me, doesn't sound like a good deal.  However, if
<BR>one believes in a living God should probably respond to that God.  Thus, for me, faith means as
<BR>much a confidence in an active, loving God, and acting on that confidence.  (Which means, by the way,
<BR>that for me, faith and good works are one in the same--so all you fellows fighting in Londerry and Ulster
<BR>can stop, because I've just put you on the same page).  Faith means looking at the impossible and
<BR>the abusrd and knowing that God will get you beyond such a point, no matter how absurd it seems.
<BR>Perhaps here, I wish to skip Abraham and Job for a second and go to a point where God tests the faith
<BR>of all humanity--that is, if we have believe, no matter how absurd, that God sent His son to Earth and
<BR>raised Christ from the dead.  If we can believe such a thing, we need never worry about the absurd or
<BR>about God's goodness; He's willing to sacrifice on humanity's behalf.
<BR>
<BR>At any rate, I apologize for my thoughts being scattered; as noted, I meant this to be preliminary.  By the way,
<BR>one more point on doubting.  I don't know Greek, but an Instructor of mine one said that the word
<BR>"devil" comes from the Greek word "diablo," meaning questioner or doubter.  I by no means am calling you
<BR>a devil, Johannes--in fact, it's important to ask such things as "what is faith?" so you're really
<BR>doing us a favor.  It's just something to stir the discussion.
