<BR>Hello. I am new to the SK website. I think I have something
<BR>to contribute on the Virgin Birth discussion.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Although I don't know what SK believed regarding the virgin birth, SK's long treatment of "Blessed is he who is not offended in me" came to mind...  SK's insistence that we see Jesus first at a very low rung on the social ladder before approaching from faith seemed to tie in, and seems, in retrospect (anticipation?) an interesting commentary on how unpleasant the alternative might be...  Presumably it would have been embarassing to be illegitimate in Israel 2000 yrs ago...  Yet Brown's RC theology seems to want to deny Jesus a beginning so questionable...</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Any one else have thoughts?  Know what SK believed?  Wish to conjecture?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>The key issue here is that the "unpleasant alternative" hinted at is
<BR>a sinful alternative. The offense SK and the Bible talk about has its
<BR>root in the inability of our minds to comprehend the wonderfulness of
<BR>what God has done for us. This is "true offense", and the person is
<BR>blessed who does not reject God on account of his inability to 
<BR>comprehend how God could do such a thing. The paradigm case of offense
<BR>for SK is the Incarnation, as discussed in the Philosophical Fragments
<BR>and the Postscript. God loves us to such a degree that He does the
<BR>apparently impossible: The eternal becomes temporal, pure spirit 
<BR>becomes flesh. Jesus is the "occasion of offense" because he is the
<BR>concrete manifestation of God's love, a love that is an offense to
<BR>our reason because it transcends it.
<BR>
<BR>Mary is the first individual who is blessed because she does not take
<BR>offense. At the angel's announcement of the Virgin Birth (Luke 1:26-38) Mary expresses her puzzlement that she could become pregnant
<BR>without intercourse. This is the "occasion" of offense because Mary is
<BR>called on to suspend her reason and trust to God that He can do such
<BR>a wonderful thing. Mary shows she is blessed because rather than taking offense ("Get out of here angel, with your ridiculous notion!) she responds positively to God: "Let it be done to me as you say." (Luke 1:38).
<BR>
<BR>The notion you are floating would have "offense" based on the fact
<BR>that God came into the world through sin - to wit, Mary's engaging in adultery. And it certainly would be offensive if God, in order to
<BR>conquer sin in the world, chose sin as the method by which He did it.
<BR>This would lead us to an "ends justifies the means" moral philosophy,
<BR>which is certainly something SK rejected (see "Purity of Heart.")
<BR>
<BR>Taking offense is not always bad. The true lover believes all good
<BR>things about his beloved (see "Works of Love") and takes offense at
<BR>the suggestion that his beloved is not pure. This is a healthy offense
<BR>and is a sign of genuine love - "love believes all things." So it
<BR>is entirely appropriate for us to be offended at the notion that Jesus, our beloved, was the result of sin rather than Mary's loving response to God.
<BR>
<BR>The offense to be avoided is one that is rooted in putting limits on
<BR>love and the good. We can't believe that God would be so wonderful as
<BR>to take the form of man in Jesus, so we reject it as "irrational". Or
<BR>we can't believe that Mary would have such faith that she could say YES to God when the angel proposes the Virgin Birth, so we reject it as "myth". This is an offense that believes too little in love rather than too much.
