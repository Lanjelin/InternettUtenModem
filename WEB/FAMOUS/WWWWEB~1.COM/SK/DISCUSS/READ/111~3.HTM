<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In the Preamble to the Heart isn't god really just a circumstance? Isn't the point of describing the story of Abraham to depict a knight of faith whose defining relationship is to his son? God asked him to sacrifice what was most beloved by Abraham and it was Isaac. Abraham as a knight of faith, was so confident in the fact that he would receive Isaac again that he could kill him. To fully understand the idea of the knight of faith one has to view god's command as a circumstance of life. It is comparable to a life threatening</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;disease. The reason for the re-telling of the story in Problema I & II, as far as I see it,(having little to do with faith or resignation)was to describe the suspension of the ethical- The idea that what is ethical is pliable to the circumstance. Kierkegaard was a confused homosexual, I think trying to justify his feelings. (Not that homosexuality has anything to do with morals.) The real question that this poses, in my opinion, is "can there really be a suspension of the ethical? Is there no truth or is it really as adolescent as it sounds?" The existentialist will answer that question one way, the objectivist another. . . go ahead answer it. Please.</I></FONT>
<BR>Well,  I don't think SK wants us go through life bending the ethical simply because it meets our desires at that particular time.  If this were the case one can easily imagine mass chaos in the polis.  The point of Abraham's having suspended the ethical,  is not something that should be emulated,  in itself.  It is more along the lines that Abraham put his trust in God via the absurd. Your idea of what the ethical is,  in relation to circumstance is interesting.  I don't know, but I would guess that SK is not trying to say that you can tailor-fit the ethical to your circumstances if you need to acheive your particular goals. 
<BR>Also,  can we really assume that Abraham was assured he would get Isaac back?  If so,  this seems to mitigate Abraham's greatness within the context of the story. (If he knew he would get him back,  what makes A's act so great?)
