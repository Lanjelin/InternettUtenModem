<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     Let's talk about sin.  According to SK, the ethical implies the possibility of sin, but is powerless to deal with it. In other words, repentence is beyond the scope of the ethical. Does this mean that as long as you stay on the straight and narrow, you have no need to go beyond the ethical?  But once you screw up, you need religion and God in order to repent by establishing that one-to-one relationship with God?  I'm wondering if you can't expiate sin merely by expanding the universal.  For example: It is presumptively wrong to kill, but under these particular circumstances I can (a la Kant) will that the maxim of my action (killing in self defense) become a universal law.  And can't you repent by establishing a one-to-one relationship with the one you have wronged without bring God into the conversation.  </I></FONT>

<BR>Sorry I've been so busy and haven't replied to so much.  There's been a lot of interesting discussion, and I feel the duty to play part (which I'll discuss a little later).  Okay, Johannes, the point is that, not only is the possibility of repentance beyond the ethical, the possibility of true good is too.  Within the ethical, one can live a quiet little life, never getting into trouble, but never really accomplishing much either; it takes the spiritual to go beyond that.  As SK defined it in <I>Study of Anxiety</I> (did I get that name right?), morality was the process of bringing what is actual closer to what is ideal.  The ethical is purely within the realm of the actual, and never goes beyond it into the ideal, which can only be reached through a one-on-one relationship with God (or so I believe).  Thus, being a truly moral person can't be taught, although one can certainly try to guide any human (including kindergarteners) to become more spiritual.  This also brings out the point which I wanted to discuss in regards to other postings: ie, that one cannot serve God out of a sense of duty, because duty is the realm of the ethical.  Instead God wants us to do good out of a sense of fervor, which is a free manifestation and goes beyond mere duty.  At any rate, when one does good, one relates with God and with the rest of the world, as doing good is what God wants of us and also benefits humanity (perhaps "benefits" is the wrong word).  When one sins, one turns away from God.  Some sins are hurtful to others, but all sins are offenses to God (and all the times we hurt others, we offend God), and thus God must take part in repentance.  And finally, the spiritual has no need for logical dictums as Kant was  trying to create; that is purely ethical sphere.  I can tell you though, that a couple years ago when I was in ethics class, I was one of the two people who argued that killing in self-defense was unethical.  At any rate, that's my take on it all; please, everyone, feel free to respond.
