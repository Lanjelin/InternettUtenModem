<BR>
<BR>An attempt to clarify some more...
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Still holding to the simularities between the two  metaphors -- the 
<BR>border and the ditch...  I mean, they are not the 
<BR>same metaphor in that they are different words, and a border is not a
<BR>ditch, and a ditch not a border, vice versa etc etc-- but I do 
<BR>see advantages in welding them  together as long as it can
<BR> be done well.  And I am far from an exacting welder, if it was my 
<BR>occupation I fear I would starve, but let it not be said I wasnt
<BR>conscientious...
<BR>
<BR>So, with that said, let me make a correction -- I was being inconsistent
<BR> when I took issue with this sentence of yours --"In neither 
<BR>of these [Kant or Plato] is there a leap to fuse
<BR> the subjective and objective, but only a program to opt for one 
<BR>side or the other".  After further reflection I can find nothing 
<BR>in it to disagree with.     
<BR>When I was disagreeing with it, I must have been thinking of SOcrates
<BR>instead of Plato and I took no account of Kant...  It is all so confusing
<BR>especially about Socrates and Plato, I've heard that some 
<BR>people even think that they were
<BR>the same person; Ive had a few philosophy professors who presented it as such
<BR>but Sk definitately makes a distinction... 
<BR>
<BR>So, in my head, I was using Plato's analogy of the cave in so far as 
<BR>it was written in homage(sp) to socrates (and I suppose 
<BR>I was talking of kant in  so far as he was writing in that same 
<BR>homage -- an aweful assumption  altogether). 
<BR>
<BR>To say it again, the two metaphors are welded only if they are a
<BR> Socratic metaphor (not kantean or Platonic) and a Kierkegaardean one.
<BR>Sk was jsut making certain things explicit that were implicit in 
<BR>the Socratic -- namely, the difficulty.
<BR>

<BR>  Your post presents a lot of issues which are giving me not a

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>I'm afraid I am never clear on what I mean, but here is </I></FONT>
<BR>another attempt:
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>It is a tricky buisness to try and figure out SK's intentions, </I></FONT>
<BR>and normally I would shy away from such attempting something so
<BR> foolish, but I think we are on to something.  Yes, I do think
<BR> that SK's intends something different with "his notion of 
<BR>subjectivity" than Plato or Kant intended with their respective 
<BR>notions, but I do think that their notions are notions of the
<BR> same idea -- "subjectivity".  Sk constanly refers to Socrates,
<BR> I see SK and Socrates standing next to each other in my front 
<BR>yard looking at the same "subjectivity", but using different 
<BR>metaphors and having different notions in their heads.  You
<BR> see a tree that I planted in my front yard differently than 
<BR>I do, but if we are standing next to each other in my front 
<BR>yard, and there is only one tree in my yard, and we are both 
<BR>looking at it, it should be clear enough that we are looking 
<BR>at the same tree, even if we have different notions/ metaphors 
<BR>for it.  This tree is subjectivity.  And I think SK wants to get
<BR> rid of subjectivity just as much as Socrates wanted to, but SK 
<BR>is concerned for the modern age, he think that modern man has rid
<BR> himself of subejctivity too easily, so he seeks to seeks to make
<BR> it more difficult again via the pseudonym of JC.  And realize 
<BR>that just because he makes the task more difficult doesn't mean
<BR> that he doesn't want you to complete it.  And SK writes his book 
<BR>for modern man so maybe he is not making it more difficult at all,
<BR> maybe it is just that we have misunderstood, and our misunderstanding
<BR> has made it much too easy -- maybe we have lowered the standard and
<BR> JC is pointing out how it was/ still is.  
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>In Plato's rendition, subjectively chained, we struggle</I></FONT>
<BR> towards pure objectivity.  This was a difficult enough 
<BR>task for the Greeks.  Could you even say that even Socrates,
<BR> a man who had dedicated his entire life to the task had achieved it?
<BR>  (Well Plato might go as far to say, or at least hint that Socrates
<BR> had achieved it, but note that Kierkegaard prefers Aristophanes' 
<BR>account of SOcrates to Plato's, claiming Plato's account is too 
<BR>idealistic).   
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Today, almost every modern man, merely by virtue of being a</I></FONT>
<BR> modern man, has broken his subjective chains and become purely
<BR> objective.  Could one not say it was too easy?  
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>So, JC comes along to make it difficult again.     </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>In this sentence of yours:</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>"In neither of these [Kant or Plato] is there a leap to fuse</I></FONT>
<BR> the subjective and objective, but only a program to opt for one 
<BR>side or the other" I have to disagree. 
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Again, it is not that Socrates is correctling hte Greeks, itis </I></FONT>
<BR>that he is correcting our interpretation of them. 
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Remember that the virtue of the Greeks was that they knew they </I></FONT>
<BR>existed.  IT is not something that they could forget.  But we, meaning
<BR> Modern Man, you and I, easily forget.  When we forget, the becomes
<BR> easy, because we can objectively appropriate the objective (meaning 
<BR>we never enter into the equasion); when we are reminded its difficult
<BR> again for we must do the task subjectively.  Jc is that thorn in our
<BR> side that wont let us forget.  He wrked hard to be that thorn.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Lets say someone walked up to you, a man with a huge beergut,</I></FONT>
<BR> claiming that exercise is a scam.  You ask him if he does situps
<BR> and he says he  can do 100 situps in 60 seconds and furthermore 
<BR>he does this twice a day every day and it doesnt help him in the 
<BR>least.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;> Well, you are eager to help, so you ask him to show you.  So </I></FONT>
<BR>he drops and starts doing situps... And you are quite disappointed 
<BR>yet amazed to see that he did more than 100 situps in 60 seconds, 
<BR>he did 110 -- but you have to note that he didn't bend at the waist
<BR> even once -- all he did was move his neck, shaking his head violently
<BR>, and counted aloud everytime his chin touched the top of his chest. 
<BR> >>You would indeed be doing this man a favor by holding his knees
<BR> and leading him to bend at the waist and bring his chin all the way 
<BR>up.  You would be making the exercise more difficult, but isnt this 
<BR>what is needed?
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>So, have I changed your opinion about he simularities between the</I></FONT>
<BR> chasm and the barrier?
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>It might help to say that the intentions of each metaphor come </I></FONT>
<BR>clear in the word chosen to explain each -- the leap and the barrier.
<BR>  The barrier intends to remind us of the task at hand -- to cross 
<BR>the barrier.  The leap intends to remind us that we, each individually,
<BR>  are the ones who must do it, it being the task, the task being 
<BR>to cross the barrier, leap over the chasm, or it is the barrier, 
<BR>or it is the chasm -- either/or.   The main point of our discussion
<BR> here is that Sk's subjectivity (a widening of the ditch, a 
<BR>heightening of the barrier) is an added difficulty when attempting to
<BR> rid oneself of "subjectivity sub species objectivity" (leave the
<BR> cave, experience the noumena).

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Did I jam everything in there?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Maybe I could make it all clearer if I got a big grant and spent</I></FONT>
<BR>the time to exand this thought out into 26 volumes?
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>IF I wer to do this I would need your help.  My writing is so very</I></FONT>
<BR> far from precise.
