<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I don't buy that there is a distinction between Apostles and others, or that there is a radical distinction among personal experiences of God/the Absolute to be drawn, except perhaps between those who are not invited into an absolute relation to the Absolute, and those who are.  Among those so called, the relationship of one individual to the Absolute is not qualitatively distinguishable from other such relationships, because the relationship is immediate and transcendent and thus not subject to qualitative distinctions.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>But Jesus specifically says that there is a distinction between the Apostles and others. Mark 4:10,11 - "When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. He told them, 'The secret of the Kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside everything is said in parables...'" Or Mark 4:33-34, "With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything."
<BR>
<BR>When the Transfiguration was over, "Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead." (Mark 8:9) You can open just about any page of the Gospels and find Jesus granting special experiences to the Apostles or explaining things to them that he explains to no one else. At the end of the Gospel of John, he secures Thomas's faith with a post-Resurrection appearance and then says "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and have believed." (John 20:29) This is about as clear a statement as one could want that the experiences of the Apostles put them into a peculiar category with respect to Faith.
<BR>
<BR>I just don't see how this is deniable. If everyone's experience of the Absolute is qualitatively the same, then why did Jesus (the Absolute) grant privleged experiences to some people, experiences that He says gives them belief in a different manner than everyone else? Why are the people "blessed" who have believed without seeing what Thomas saw?
<BR>
<BR> SK appears expressly to recognize this in _Fear and Trembling_  (or, at least, I have always believed that is the point to  the brief anecdote of the bourgeouis knight of faith whose act of relinquishment and faith centers around a roast for the domestic table).  Even if this does not seem clear from the text of _F&T_, it is clear in SK's discussion in _The Consept of Anxiety_:  sin, an element (or absence) in the individual relation to the absolute, is described as immediate and transcendent, and not qualitatively different among individuals -- it seems impossible to hold this view and yet to distinguish among the quality of faith in functioning relationships with the Absolute.
<BR>
<BR>For SK, his literature was as much a path of self-education as an enlightenment to others. _Fear and Trembling_ was not his final word on faith; in fact it was his first word and his views on faith developed over time. _The Concept of Anxiety_ is also an early work.
<BR>SK was not a systematic philosopher who had a "master plan" with respect to his literature, such that it would all fit together nice and tidily. Perhaps he had not considered the problem of the Apostles at the time he wrote _Fear and Trembling_. In any case, _Fear and Trembling_ does not claim to be an exhaustive study of Faith. It was his first dialectical exploration into the problems of faith.
<BR>
<BR>In the Postscript and other later works he explicity states (not just implies) that the Apostles are a special case with respect to Faith. 
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I also cannot accept the concept of "special revelation," although Mr. Tye may not have intended to use the term in its technical sense of a private gift of Divine understanding to one individual, which is not available to others.  My understanding of general Christian doctrine on this point is that no one has a true "special revelation" after the Ascension. </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I intended to use it as a private gift of Divine Understanding. What else is Mark 4:11? If special revelation ended with the Ascension, then we have a problem with Paul since he claims to proclaim a Gospel  that "I did not receive from any man, nor was I taught it; rather I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ." (Gal 1:12) A revelation that occured well after the Ascension.
<BR>
<BR> Christ has been fuilly revealed to all, and the Divine is now as fully accessible to any baptized Christian as to any other -- no favorites in the heart of God.  Thus, while one Christian might have a more intense experience of the Divine than another, that experience reveals of God only what has already been taught in the Passion, Death and Resurrection.  The subjective intensity of feeling, however, does not qualitatively affect the individual's relationship to God.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;It seems to me therefore that both SK and general Christian doctrine militate against the Apostles, or anyone, having a qualitatively different experience of God or the Absolute.  (I leave to one side SK's assertion that the Apostles were subject to another dialectic of faith, for now.)  The point to my argument is not that we all have the same experience of God or the Absolute -- far from it.  The first century Palestinians had data available that we do not have. We have data they did not.  My point is that _DATA MATTER_.  The experience of God we have, and so the outlines of our relationship to Him, are drawn differently for different individuals, and are based in concrete objective (particular) experiences that are not readily shared with others.  The faith we have is shared -- it comes, however, from unrepeatable, but real, experiences.  Faith is not an a priori concept, but a relationship, and so the result of experiences.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I don't think SK would disagree with this. The point I have been making (and it is one SK makes) is that the Apostle's relationship in Faith to Christ was qualitatively different than others precisely because they had different data and data matters. The Gospels make clear that Christ gave them special experiences (data) so that they would have a special relationship to Him. It is the apriori position on Faith which is driven to obliterate the distinction between the Apostles and others, not SK's - which I don't think was apriori in the sense you are describing, if I understand you correctly.
<BR>
<BR>The Philosophical Fragments never says that the contemporary generation of disciples' experience of Christ was identical to later generations. He points out that being in each generation has both advantages and disadvantages peculiar to each. His thesis is that the (non-Apostolic) experience of first-century Palestinians was not decisively better than ours with respect to Faith. In other words, the data first century Palestinians had about Jesus (his height, weight, hair color, body odor (probably bad), how long he slept, the eloquence of his speech,etc.) doesn't help them decisively in determining whether Jesus was God. 
<BR>
<BR>In your earlier note, you wrote that a contemporary of Jesus had the advantage of being able to question Him. I am sincerely interested in knowing what questions you would pose to Jesus to determine whether he was God, because I can't think of any.
<BR>
<BR>You also wrote that we could see whether His actions were consistent with His claims. I am still perplexed as to how this test would work. What actions would you be looking for Jesus to do and not to do?
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;My dispute with SK is that if he wants to speak philosophically about an Incarnational theology, it seems paradoxical that he chose a metaphysics which so excludes the immanent from the transcendent as to make the two concepts polar opposites.  The important effect of individual human data on individual lived faith is one of the places where the _necessity_ of the action of the immanent for the true experience of the transcendent is evident.  I chose this as a starting place for my argument because SK himself recognized it and rejected it -- in _The Sickness unto Death_, Anti-Climacus analogizes the Gospel message to a message brought from the King to a commoner that the commoner may marry the King's daughter.  Anti-Climacus recognizes that the commoner will seek verification of the King's true intnet from his other actions -- does the King bring his son-in-law to the palace?  Invite him to prepare for a feast?  But Anti-Climacus (paradoxicaly, to my mind) insists that these secondary verifications are unavailable to the Christian.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I haven't read the Sickness Unto Death in a while, so I can't comment on it. I will review it tonight.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Yet verification is exactly what the Apostles sought (and received in a unique way, as you point out), and exactly what we seek.  How many people have you heard who reject Christianity because of the Christians they know?  Verification is the human response to a claim of truth -- and in an Incarnational religion, there is no need to bar the way to verification. Certainly, a philosopher writing before the Incarnation could not have predicted it.  But once it has occurred and been revealed, we are no longer in the same straits.  We know that Incarnation is part of reality because we have been told, and _have seen it with our own eyes_.  It seems odd to pretend that we need to reject the obvious simply because it could not have been guessed before it was revealed.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I'm not sure who you are talking about here. I haven't seen the Incarnation with my own eyes. The first-century Palestinians (other than the Apostles) saw a poor carpenter from Nazareth who got crucified by the Romans. They didn't see the Transfiguration or the Resurrection - they only heard about them after Pentecost. And this was specifically so they might "believe without seeing." SK's point is that whether what you saw was just a poor carpenter from Nazareth or God Incarnate is ultimately a matter of Faith.
<BR>
<BR>The whole question is how we know the Incarnation is part of reality.
<BR>We have been told, yes, but does the mere fact of telling make it so?
<BR>Does this claim need to be verified? If so, how is it verified? This is a sincere question, one that has greatly troubled me, and the main reason I got into SK in the first place. I would really like to know how one goes about this verification.
