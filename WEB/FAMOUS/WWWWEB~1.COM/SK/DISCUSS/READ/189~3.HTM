<BR>Are you saying that you do not see any point to rational discourse?  SK was not altogether anti-rationalist, he was not even against objective truth, not even of the "philosophical" sort.  His project shows that there is a subjective side of tuth, that must be included in the discussion -- at least regarding topics of subjective concern.
<BR>
<BR>Yes, "concrete individual" is an abstract idea, just as is any idea.  Granted, it is a loaded term.  But what does it signify?  The thing that "concrete individual" signifies is anything but abstract. 
<BR>
<BR>Are you against all attempts to theorize about human existence?  It seems to me that the problem is not so much the theorizing, but making sure our theories "jive" with what actually goes on in the world.  Not only that, but many people (I myself am new to this area of discourse) have done work on the relationship between theory and praxis (action oriented towards a goal).  I think this discussion is relevant to Kierkegaard because he is clearly engaging in theory, but he is also concerned with application (especially in his personal life as a pamphleteer). 
<BR>
<BR>Where does SK fit in?  You are right to point out that he does not believe that one can directly communicate the truth that has decisive significance for an individual.  This is not to say, however, that it cannot be communicated at all.  He has this notion of indirect communication.  Irony and humor are essential elements to this mode of communication.  Certainly SK did not think that one should learn to live with the truth quietly!  That is like saying nothing when a group of 10-year olds ransack your apartment.  There are too many injustices in the world to sit comfortably, self-satisfied with our "truth."
<BR>
<BR>Subjectivity cannot be taught.  Inwardness cannot be taught.  The existence of any absolute cannot be demonstrated.  "It's not the what but the how."  How do you relate to the absolute?   That's the question.  Now, if I am authentic in my relating, I cannot help but notice that there are a lot of "posers."  The role of irony and humor is to point out inconsistencies in people's thought and lives.  The underlying truth of subjectivity is thereby communicated.
<BR>
<BR>Your reference to Descartes is interesting.  Kierkegaard's beef with him was not that he was too rational; not even that he started with a subjective starting point.  Rather, his "self" was not "imbedded" to use your terms.  Do you agree?  Or do you think that SK, or at any rate we, should be cautious of all attempts to discuss truths about the world which rely on abstract ideas?  Maybe we should be cautious of the "spririt of seriousness" regarding these ideas?  Maybe all our ontological theorizing is not grounded in reality at all -- a postmodern position.
<BR>
<BR>What was the original question?  Christian Existentialism?  I don't know if I am getting you right at all, but some of your comments remind me of deeper concerns.  Certainly, some trends within the deconstructionist school try to undercut all of what Western philosophy has been about, including Existentialism.  The jury is still out concerning their lasting contribution, though.  In the meantime, I see nothing wrong with taking Existential themes and relating them to Christianity.  On that level, there is a lot we can talk about.
