<BR>Kierkegaard understands sensuality as the orignal sin.  In his discussion of anxiety and original sin, he expressly says that anxiety is the end of innocence, and that from innocence, sensuality is the entry into the first sin.  SK goes so far as to imply that the first sin was Adam wanting to sleep with Eve (I will bring in the cite on Monday -- my references are at home today).  It isn't. of course, surprising that a Victorian bourgeouis connects the first sin to bodily desire.  What is surprising is how disconnected this view is from orthodoxy, and from SK's own hierarchy of virtues.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The more orthodox view is that the human individual's desire to be other than, and more than human -- pride -- is the first sin.  The myth of Adam and Eve eating the fruit in the garden includes the serpent saying, "If you eat it, you will be like gods."  Christian theologians usually understand this to mean that the original temptation was to aspire beyond our place in the universe.  Humanity has, in this view, always been afflicted with a little megolomania.  This view of the basic ground of human discontent with human fate isn't confined to the Christian tradition.  Even F. Nietzsche seems to have been aware that our fate to be all too human is at odds with our first ambition and best hopes.  And SK himself, in Sickness unto Death, understands despair (which sounds like the ultimate, although apparently not the original, sin) as the refusal to accept one's identity as it is given to one.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;An individual in despair can either insist on keeping all his or her options open, and try to be many selves at once (feminine despair), or become so much one self that all responses to the absolute's absolute demand are foreclosed (masculine despair).  I assumed when first I read this view of despair that it also was the original sin.  But SK unequivocally tells us it is sensuality.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Why isn't the source of anxiety in the awareness that we can't get out of despair, absent an absolute relation to the absolute?  It seems pretty lightweight if anxiety, SK's basis of human psychology, or at least psychopathology, is the awareness that we must lose our sexual or sensual innocence.  If despair is the block between us and the absolute, why isn't it also the original sin?  The elimination of the original sin should be the necessary condition to the complete engagement with the absolute (as perfect humility is the necessary step to true knowledge of God in the Roman Catholic contemplative tradition).</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;My point here is only that the original sin should be intimately tied to the ultimate virtue.  But SK has linked original sin to nothing, and the original sin is a mere itch, compared with hatred and greed and pride.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The idea that sensuality is the original sin even seems to conflict with the leap of faith.  Indeed, the bourgeouis knight of faith in Fear and Trembling stands outside the butcher's window, both forsaking the roast and being sure that he will have it.  Isn't the hope for -- and delight in -- good food, also sensuality?  What is SK thinking to juxtapose an expression of the leap of faith and an experience of the ur-sin?  Any helpful comments -- other than "Go home and sleep it off?".</I></FONT>

<BR>Anxiety, I think, is K's foundational presupposition that moves a human being from a state of innocense to a state of conscious decision; aka to a state in which he is actual as a human individual.  By definition, if Adam is first innocent, then he has no motive power or purpose to change, or grow, or differentiate himself from his milieu.  In relevant part, he would have no consciousness of the differences between himself and Eve, nor of the sexual attraction which implies their separation.  Sex between them would be just instinct, with no consciousness either before, during, or after the act of their separateness and nor their momentary unity within the act.
<BR>
<BR>But anxiety appears in this state of innocense, and actually brings to consciousness the fact that there is a decision to be made; that if the decision is not made right now, in this moment, that the freedom to make the decision, and consequently the freedom itself, might be lost. The decision is not to have sex or not to have sex, as a victorian bourgeousie might suppose, but whether to obey God or not.  This fundamental crisis permeates the innocense of Adam, and dispels it: he is now conscious of himself and his decision-power, aka his own freedom.  And implied within his own new consciousness of his own freedom is his individuality and therefore his separation from Eve.  What was once joined together in innocense, is now torn asunder.
<BR>
<BR>  K ties the entire knotted web of sexual relations to this singular fundamental moment of anxious consciousness - but I don't think he intends to align sin with sex, but with the moment before the consciousness of sex, wherein Adam, in discovering himself as a freely acting agent, discovers before God that he might lose his freedom and therefore himself.  Sin consciousness is the moment when we have chosen freely but wrongly - and such wrong is irreversible.  
<BR>
<BR>But The Concept of Anxiety is a singularly difficult book.  In a certain sense, there is no telling what K actually meant by it.
