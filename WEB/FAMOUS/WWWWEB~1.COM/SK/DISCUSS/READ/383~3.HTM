<FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>But if only God knows the answer, then I don't know the answer anymore than does anyone else. So how do I know if I have heard it if I don't know what it is?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But, still, the questioner has asked a question and received an answer (or not), and that particular experience becomes part of the basis for his or her faith.  Each single individual who makes the leap of faith makes it on the basis of facts encountered in the realm of the immanent, and so his or her particular experience in the imminent is an inescapable element of the absolute relation one is called to.  If true faith could be achieved by logic and a priori principles, Incarnation would not be needed.  But we are told that Incarnation _was_ necessary, as were the Passion and the Resurrection.  Each of these was a trans-historic event, if the Christian faith is true, but also one that had either to occur or not occur in the realm of the immanent, in sight of potential witnesses or not.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The witness to Jesus Christ's life would have different factual issues to resolve before determining to make the leap of faith. For example, a first century Palestinian might struggle to know what JC meant when he said, "No sign will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah" -- Was he really claiming to be a prophet?  Was he claiming more? What was the sign?  We, many generations removed have to ask first whether JC really said that (Or did some later follower interpolate it as foreshadowing the Resurrection?), and also what it meant, and whether it still holds (Can we still see the sign in some meaningful individual way, or is the sign something that was available only to the eyewitnesses of the Resurrection?).  The undiscussed question is, do the particular experiences and contexts in which the leap of faith is made affect the leap of faith in a substantive way, or are all leaps of faith qualitatively identical?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Yes, this is the question. This thread started with my response to your statement that the Incarnation was more clear to the first-century Palestinians than it is to us. I understood you to mean that it was easier for the first-century Palestinians to believe that Jesus was God than it is for us today, in other words that the leap of faith was easier for them. Is this what you meant? If so, why was it easier? If not, what do you mean by saying that the Incarnation was more clear to first-century Palestinians?
