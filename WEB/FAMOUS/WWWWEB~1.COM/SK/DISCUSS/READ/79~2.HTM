<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Oh, hey, I've been called much worse than the devil, and by people who know me a lot better than you do, my friend.  Which reminds me of the old saw: The devil is in the details.  I'm not really a detail person, but I find the level of detail in most expositions on the topic of faith to be lacking in something. I suppose what I'm looking for is some sort of 12-step plan, religion by numbers, which, if followed correctly, will lead a person to belief in god.  Of course, that is a pedestrian notion, and one I would not attempt to defend, but one that still drives me at some level.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Perhaps we don't really disagree all that much.  I guess your point about faith, and about Abraham, is that faith is the ability to believe that god will work things out in some satisfactory fashion, even when his requests seem a little cockeyed.  But I think my point is: Where do we get the criteria for what we are willing to count as satisfactory vs. what strikes us as cockeyed.  I think it's all well and good we enlightened 20th century sophisticates to view the story of Abraham as a quaint morality tale because Abraham placed his faith in god and everything turned out OK.  But, once again, what is the source of our sense of OKness?  Would it have been not OK if god hadn't stayed Abraham's hand when he raised the knife?  If Abraham had been allowed to kill Isaac, would that still be all right?  Can we honestly say that would be an acceptable result, even if we believe Isaac would have been whisked into heaven to lead a better life?  Hasn't Isaac still suffered an injustice?  The point I'm groping for is that we, as independent moral agents, simply cannot consign all moral responsibility to god.  And in that sense, our faith must be limited by our own sense of right and wrong.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>But we <I>can</I> assign, not our personal moral choices to God,
<BR>but what <I>is</I> moral to God, since, assuming, again, that God created
<BR>the universe (which we could argue at until God uncreates the universe),
<BR>then I think we must assume that God posited God as the source of good,
<BR>or at least has built the universe so that "good" aligns with God's plans.
<BR>Yes, we are independent moral agents, but that doesn't give us the ability
<BR>(at least in my view) to define, for God, what is good and what is evil
<BR>in the universe.  However, your question about what we think is cock-eyed
<BR>is an interesting question; let me think about it.  And if you do want
<BR>a more logical, stricter sense of faith than the ones we talk about here--
<BR>I've read the Catholic Cathechism, and to my mind, it's logic is as solid as
<BR>a rock (I just don't agree with defining Christianity in terms of logic;
<BR>though questions are important).
<BR>
<BR>By the way, a "diablo" might have meant one who questioned without ever
<BR>wanting an answer; one who doubts, but without ever wanting to believe.
<BR>Just a thought I had yesterday; it's obvious you want to believe, Johannes,
<BR>and thus wouldn't fall into that category at all.
