<BR>I disagree that faith leads to solipsism.  This is a wrong view of subjectivity.  Subjectivity is the way that we relate to truth, and as we know from SK, it's not the what but the how.  This doesn't deny, however, that there is a "what."  There must be a truth to which one is relating subjectively in order to be inward.  But for SK, the most important question is not what that truth is, but what you do with it.
<BR>
<BR>T. Dean is right that the question about the absolute cuts even deeper than the question of the historical in Christianity. But I'm not so sure that it is as difficult as it seems.  It seems to me that logically Christianity could be wrong.  Jesus may not have even existed, etc.  But what does this due for faith?  I think we are all agreeing that Christian faith requires acceptance of this risk.  Paul Tillich makes a distinction between the risk of historical uncertainty and the existential risk of faith.  I argue in my paper ( <a href="../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS11.HTM#1170" tppabs="http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~charless/kierkegaard.htm">http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~charless/kierkegaard.htm</a> if you care) that Christian faith requires acceptance of both risks.  This discussion has moved interestingly from the risk of historical uncertainty to the existential risk of faith.  The question now is, why have faith in an absolute, Christian or otherwise.
<BR>
<BR>What is meant by "absolute?"  The best definitions seem to be negative: that than which nothing greater can be conceived (Anselm)
<BR>The horizon of possibility (Karl Rahner)
<BR>The ground of Being (Tillich)
<BR>The Logos (Heraclitus)
<BR>The foundational principle of the universe
<BR>
<BR>It seems to me that these formulations are much less problematic than "God."  I think this is the kind of thing that SK was shooting for with "Absolute."  Peple all over the world seem to have this feeling (religious sentiment, maybe Schleirmacher's God-consciousness) that there is something at the base of it all.  There is a Supreme meaning to the universe.  Maybe we are wrong in that sentiment, maybe it is wishful thinking in order to "ground" believe in a big brother of a deity who helps me face the stark reality of existence.  But then, it is extremely difficult for the human mind which experiences things like beauty and has an idea of justice, to shake such sentiment.  I think this is what is meant by "The fool says in his heart that there is no God."  It just seems to fly in the face of experience.  Kierkegaard in the Postscript (I don't have it with me) acknowledges that there is a revelation of God in nature, but we don't always recognize it as such.  Paul says that we have suppressed this truth.  What does this mean?  Certainly it is not anything like objective knowledge.  Nevertheless, it seems available to all 'rational' people.  The hard part comes in characterizing the Absolute.
<BR>
<BR>What is the absolute?  Maybe it is nothingness (the Kyoto school).  Maybe it is Brahman.  Maybe it is the wholly transcendent other.  Perhaps the absolute is coextensive with the world (Whitehead).  Maybe it is the world (pantheism).  Maybe matter is all there is (materialism).  It seems to me that most atheists I have met, when pressed, do not deny an absolute in these terms, they simply deny that the idea of God accurately describes it.  This is the question about ultimate reality, the answer to which proposes to be the source of meaning.  It seems to me that if one truly believes that there is no absolute in this abstract sense, suicide through starvation is the only option.  This is what I have alluded to early in that Sartre has a kind of a-theology.  From whence meaning?  A: the absolute.  
<BR>
<BR>Ahh, now the angst-- we cannot know anything about the absolute.  Camus rightly says that we ask the question of the world and the world responds in silence.  This is the absurd fact of existence.  But maybe this is really an answer of sorts.  Shouldn't the absolute somehow be related to this absurdity?  Enter Kierkegaard.
<BR>
<BR>OK, so any positive statement about the absolute is subject to uncertainty.  But can we doubt that there is an absolute?  I think if you try, you are performing a contradiction.  This is what the ontological argument was trying to get at.  Well for that matter, all of the arguments which try to prove the existence of God are really trying to show that the absolute is indubitable.  Of course the problem is that in order to get off the ground with the argument, one must define the absolute in such a way that it loses this abstract character.  Usually, it is assumed that the absolute is something like God (not a bad assumption), which cannot itself be proved.
<BR>
<BR>What is important, from a Kierkegaardian perspective is not one's conception of the absolute (T. Dean's 'delusion') but rather one's relationship to it.  What characterizes this relaitonship?  Pathos, passion, suffering.  Remember SK's comparison in the Postscript (this is not the only work I have read, but my favorite) between the person who prays to an idol and the person who prays to the Christian God in untruth?  He says (paraphrased) that the one prays in truth to God, though his eyes are focused on an idol.  The other prays in untruth to the true God, and therefore is praying to an idol.  The content, then, cannot be the most important thing, otherwise God would descend right now and give all of us indubitable proof.  What does God want?  Isn't it Micah that says he doesn't want our burnt offerings or our festivals, but rather a contrite heart?  Its the attitude!
<BR>
<BR>So what about Christianity?  Why belive in this form?  I have thoughts on this, but I will save them for later, as I have already writen my share.  What do you all think?  Why believe in Christianity?  Why make the leap in this way?
