<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;There is some confusion (at least for me) about whether SK's spheres of existence are developmental, sort of like Maslow's and Erikson's models, or whether they occur simultaneously.  I mean, once you've graduated from the aesthetic to the ethical, do you ever return to the aesthetical?  And does the ethical encompass the aesthetical or merely supplant it?  Are the spheres mutually exclulsive?  I guess I used to think so, but I've more recently come to think that although they are mutually exclusive, they still exist simultaneously in all of us, sort of like the "doublethink" or Orwell's "1984."  And I guess I also think that at different times, one's focus is perhaps more driven by the parameters of one sphere over another, but that the primary spere will shift back and forth over time.  I've always viewed the ethical as a sort of codification of one's own pleasures.  THIS is what makes me happy, so I will structure my life in such a way that this particular pleasure is included.  The difficulty, I think, is that you can never entirely understand your own pleasures, or at least those pleasures are apt to evolve over time.  So, the self I choose as a 20-year-old may be very unsatisfactory to me as a 40-year-old (ergo: the so-called "midlife crisis").  Part of the problem is that I think we all have the potential to be more people that society (the universal) is willing to tolerate.  Perhaps that's where the infinite resignation comes in.  Anyway, enough.  Sorry to ramble.   Thoughts?</I></FONT>
<BR>The way I've always seen it, Johannes, the aesthetic and the ethical are two opposite answers to the same question: how should one choose to act?  Therefore, I thought that one didn't graduate from the aesthetic into the ethical.  The answer of the spiritual sphere transcends both answers; it doesn't answer, "One should act out of individualized desires" nor "One should act as the majority says to act" but rather "Concentrate on one's relationship with God, and one will understand how to deal with others."  Whereas Erikson and--I forgot your other, so I'll Piaget, or goodness, even Freud--the developing child takes the skills learned from a previous stage into the next stage, like the trusting infant who then knows he or she can explore their world (Stage 1 to 2 in the Erikson model).  Perhaps it's the same with SK, but to my mind, you can't take any of the skills one gets as either an aesthetic or a ethicist into working on faith--it's a whole new world.  This may smack of Hegel (I don't mean to do that!) and it may smack of Aladdin, but, basically, it's how I see it for now.  I don't know whether one's actions in the spiritual change from the time one is 20 until the time one is 40; but the ethics of a particular culture change over such a time, as does the relationship of the 20-year-old to society and the 40-year-old to society.  Hope I've brought up some points you can dispute, Johannes (and everyone else).
