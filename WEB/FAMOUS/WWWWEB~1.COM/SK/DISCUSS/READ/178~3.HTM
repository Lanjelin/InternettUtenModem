<BR>I couldn't agree more. The insights of existential thought are 
<BR>universal because they have to do with what it means to exist as 
<BR>a human.  If you, too, are a human, then we can talk. The question
<BR>remains, how much can we talk about? Traditional philosophy had tried 
<BR>to speak about mankind from a purely objective standpoint. Even though 
<BR>it was recognized that one perceives the world as a subject, the 
<BR>question of subjectivity never arose. Trying to talk about a human 
<BR>subject as an object (a cogito, ego, etc.) does not get us very far.
<BR>As Kierkegaard has pointed out, the Hegelian system, the highpoint of 
<BR>this approach, completely missed the point. What is needed to truly 
<BR>understand human existence is an understanding of subjectivity in a 
<BR>concrete individual. 
<BR>
<BR>OK.  Great!!!!  
<BR>Let me quote you...
<BR>
<BR>"Trying to talk about a human subject as an object
<BR> (a cogito, ego, etc.) does not get us very far..."
<BR>
<BR>I love this line.  I thnk it is wrong, but wrong in a good way. 
<BR>I think talking about a human subject as an object takes us VERY FAR.
<BR>Perhaps too far, at least farther than we ORIGINALLY intended to go.
<BR>	IF we are all sitting in front of a chasm, as SK imaginatively 
<BR>constructed, and there is a leap to be taken, a leap for the 
<BR>individual-- the SUBJECTIVE indidvidual.  Now, TALKING ABOUT THE 
<BR>SUBJECTIVE INDIVIDUAL AS OBJECTIVE allows the individual to approximate 
<BR>his way across that chasm.  In this way he enters the realm of 
<BR>approximation,  i.e. he crosses the chasm but only approximately, 
<BR>that is he doesn't cross it at all.  But insofar that he has crossed it,
<BR>he has left what is essential, what is essential to one who is infinately 
<BR>concerned, he has left that back on the other side.  And instead of 
<BR>turning back to rectify the situation, he keeps going, going and going;
<BR>indeed modern man has gotten very far inthis manner -- he is very 
<BR>"sucessful".  Modern MAn has become objective, meaning he does not 
<BR>realize the importance of APPROPRIATION.  And something who does not
<BR> know appropriation cannot feed itself, therefore it goes on and on,
<BR>eating away, further and further...GET IT? No consumation,  no rest.
<BR>	
<BR>
<BR>OK, now here is your paragraph again:
<BR>
<BR>I couldn't agree more. The insights of existential thought are 
<BR>universal because they have to do with what it means to exist as 
<BR>a human.  If you, too, are a human, then we can talk. The question
<BR>remains, how much can we talk about? Traditional philosophy had tried 
<BR>to speak about mankind from a purely objective standpoint. Even though 
<BR>it was recognized that one perceives the world as a subject, the 
<BR>question of subjectivity never arose. Trying to talk about a human 
<BR>subject as an object (a cogito, ego, etc.) does not get us very far.
<BR>As Kierkegaard has pointed out, the Hegelian system, the highpoint of 
<BR>this approach, completely missed the point. What is needed to truly 
<BR>understand human existence is an understanding of subjectivity in a 
<BR>concrete individual. 
<BR>
<BR>Where can you find a concrete individual?
<BR>(I suppose you'ld have to pour one?)
<BR>
<BR>------------------------
<BR>
<BR>Next paragraph:
<BR>
<BR>More to the point, to say that we are atomic rather than imbeded, 
<BR>or to try to view the individual in this way, I think, is to fall
<BR>back into the same reified Hegelianism that Kierkegaard protested. 
<BR>YES YES YES.  SK ESPECIALLY HATED HEGEL'S PURE ATOMISM. YES, WE ARE 
<BR>IMBEDDED.
<BR>
<BR>I think what you mean to say (if so, I would agree) is that 
<BR>Existentialism isolates the individual and asks of him or her 
<BR>questions of ultimate significance.
<BR>OK.  BUT DOES "EXISENTIALISM" REALLY DO THIS?  
<BR>WHERE DO THESE QUESTIONS COME FROM? 
<BR>DESCARTES' EVIL DEMON, MAYBE?
<BR>
<BR>For Kierkegaard, the individual 
<BR>is further isolated before God.
<BR>
<BR>But the individual must still be regarded as "this" individual.
<BR>WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "THIS"?  I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN 
<BR>BY THIS SENTENCE.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>You bring out an interesting point 
<BR>though. If you take what I said to the extreme, then all we can do is 
<BR>turn inward and know ourselves, with no common understanding.
<BR>YES YES YES.  THISIS THE POINT AT WHICH REAL COMMUNICATION CAN TAKE 
<BR>PLACE.
<BR>What do we do, then, with Kierkegaard's writings? 
<BR>SK GOES TO GREAT PAINS TO BRING YOU TO THE POINT HTA YOU CANNOT UNC
<BR>DERSTAND HIM< AND PRECISELY AT THAT POINT HE TELLS YOU SOMETHING.
<BR>Obviously he felt there was some common ground.
<BR>YES AND NO
<BR>
<BR>I think this is what you are implying 
<BR>by "almost objective." What is true is that Existentialism 
<BR>communicates insights into the ontological structure of human
<BR>beings (despite Sartre's denial of ontological substance to por-soi).
<BR>I aM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS ASPECT OF SARTE. COULD YOU EXPLAIN?
<BR>
<BR>But how? Kierkegaard would say INDIRECTLY. The truth of what I say
<BR>about how I understand myself only has meaning in terms of how you 
<BR>ultimately appropriate it.
<BR>YES YES YES.  WONDERFUL.  GREAT CAN OF WORMS.  THISIS THE CAN THAT 
<BR>OBJECTIVE PEOPLE DONT UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE THEY DON'T APPROPRIATE, 
<BR>BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT HUMAN, THEY ARE PURE SPECULATIVE THOUGHT! 
<BR>
<BR> This is another can of worms, though, 
<BR>regarding language, interpretation, and truth. 
<BR>HOW COULD YOU TALK ABOUT IT OBJECTIVELY?  (I AM INTERESTED)
<BR>
<BR>----------------------
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT CHRISTIANS NEED MORE TRADITION? I SAY LESS TRADITION AND MORE SELF</I></FONT>
<BR>EXPLORATION WOULD BE A GENERALLY GOOD IDEA. 
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; </I></FONT>
<BR>I am surprised that you were able to read this out of what I said.
<BR>I don't know if more tradition is needed, but I do think tradition 
<BR>has a valuable place. Kierkegaard did not discredit Religiousness A 
<BR>with Religiousness B. Some think that in today's rationalized world, 
<BR>there is no room for religious belief, especially if it deals in 
<BR>metaphysical of mythical language. I, however, think that the jury 
<BR>is still out. I'm not so sure that we can replace the meanings
<BR>involved in symbols with rational concepts. The goal, however, is to 
<BR>constantly re-interpret those meanings. This is the task of Church 
<BR>Dogmatics and Systematic Theology. Kierkegaard might disagree on this
<BR>point. The job is never done, however, and here is wherer existential
<BR> subjectivity can be employed to guard
<BR>against hegemony, fanaticism, etc. 
<BR>
<BR>Comments:
<BR>--------
<BR>TRadition or no tradition is not the question 
<BR>(tradition will be there,how well it is kept up is another Q)
<BR>My question is how will I relate to the tradition.  what were the original
<BR>intentions of that traditon, etc.
<BR>--------
<BR>What do you mean by: 
<BR>"I'm not so sure that we can replace the meanings
<BR>involved in symbols with rational concepts".
<BR>
<BR>I like that sentence.  Rational concepts are without motion, right?
<BR>Static rational concepts versus dynamic language... dance of meaning...
<BR>---------------
<BR>
<BR>Have you read the POWER OF MYTH?  Joseph Campbell?  EAsy pleasurble 
<BR>read.  The myth of money, the scientific myth, etc.
<BR>
<BR>----------------
<BR>
<BR>THE MOST DEVIOUS ARE OFTEN THE MOST RELIGIOUS. 
<BR>
<BR>What do you mean? 
<BR>
<BR>OK, here is what I mean...
<BR>Something says, "I am the most religious."  If I think that this
<BR>something that made this claim is not so religious, that it is missing 
<BR>something crucial; furthermore, if I think the thing that it is missing
<BR>is perhaps the MOST IMPORTANT PART -- then I might go out and vehemently
<BR>renounce everything that that something stands for, and embrace the
<BR>thing that they had forgotten, thething that I thought was the most
<BR>important, to see for myself, ifmy prior assertion was right, to see
<BR>if the thing forgotten could stand by itself, if it was the most important.
<BR>
<BR>Thenm nomatter what I found, if I was the most religious or the 
<BR>most wretched, either way I would be by their terms the most devious.
