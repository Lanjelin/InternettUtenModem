What if there is no Absolute?
<BR>This question cuts to the heart of the matter, doesn't it?
<BR>
<BR>The difficulty is that it cannot be answered, at least not objectively.  More importantly, we cannot prove that whatever is absolute is worthy of worship.
<BR>
<BR>The question has also been put in terms of a "totalizer" of human history.  That is, a transcendent Other who gives the last say on what it all means when all is said and done.  For an atheist, like Sartre, there is no "truth" to history in this sense.  There is no ultimate reason, except, of course, the reasons we project and the meanings we create.
<BR>
<BR>Why does one choose to believe?  Bertrand Russell says religion is based on fear, the desire for a "big brother" to hold one's hand through life.  Schleirmacher bases it on something more basic to human nature, the "god-consciousness".  This idea has always intrigued me.  What is compeling about SK's description of sin as "before God to will to do away with oneself, or before God to will to be oneself" (loosely quoted from SUD).  It's almost like a knowledge we have from behind.  
<BR>
<BR>Doctrines like Creation (taken not as anti-evolution) and Preservation of the World by God, also strike my finite, frail heart as so true.  Although the Argument from Design for the existence of God ultimately fails, even David Hume recognized that it seems somehow right as an explanation for one who already has faith.  I mean, God is the best explanation for beauty, goodness, snowflakes, hands, children, sunsets.  On the other hand, we have hurricanes, torture, wars, etc.  But still, from the standpoint of faith, even these seem perhaps tragically meaningful.
<BR>
<BR>Maybe that's all there is to it--a quest for meaning.  Don't ask, is there an absolute?  Ask, what gives my life the most meaning?  Whatever your answer is what you will place in the space of the absolute.
<BR>
<BR>The next question is, What do I do with this story about Christ?  The historicity cannot be proven either way.  But, what does the passion narrative do to your heart?  What makes Christianity a daring venture is the uncertainty coupled with the fact that it proposes to "have decisive significance for one's eternal happiness," to SK's lingo.  Can it be?  But the story is too good to be true.  But then, what other kind of story would be worthy of such a role in my life?  I really like SK's example of a king who promises to give his daughter as a wife to a pauper.  Should the pauper believe it?  If it is a hoax, he will be a laughing stock for believing such an incredible promise.  If it were true, it could be the most important thing to have come his way.  I think at some level, people are drawn by the power of the story, the hope that it promises, etc.  Through the eyes of faith, it becomes apparent that God is himself the condition for belief.  The very power of the story is the power of God.  What if they are wrong?  That's part of the risk.  What if they are right?  
<BR>
<BR>I sound like Pascal.  But the decision is more passionate than a weighing of the alternatives.  I have great respect for someone who passionately rejects Christianity, such as Sartre.  He actively decided; he made his own leap in another direction.  A lot of people never decide in this manner.  The least they could do is passionately abstain from decision, rather than passively avoiding the issue.  The more I think about all of this, though, from my Christian perspective, the more I am persuaded that there will be more people in heaven than we could ever dream!
<BR>
