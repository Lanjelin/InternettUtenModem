   Well, I'm not really sure whether I'm addressing an individual or
<BR>the generic Christian faith; but in any event, a few observations.
<BR>    First, I'm wondering how we are to take the Abraham/Isaac story
<BR>if we believe that god would never command us to break one of his 
<BR>laws.  Did Abraham know that?  Was he just pretending to be ready to kill
<BR>Isaac, knowing the whole time that, as you say, god would never really
<BR>ask him to do something so heinous?  And, if so, what kind of a test
<BR>is that?  We imagine Abraham, tongue firmly in cheek, grinning to
<BR>himself and perhaps feeling like he's humoring the big Guy.  This is not
<BR>exactly a teleological suspension of the ethical.  It is really just
<BR>play acting, sort of like the bland re-enactments of the transubstantion
<BR>playing everywhere at a cathedral near you.  
<BR>    And, besides, if god knows everything, doesn't he know how Abraham
<BR>will react?  Usually, when a teacher gives a test, it's to find out
<BR>what you know.
<BR>    Criminals, you say?  I would doubtless agree, but how do they differ
<BR>from Abraham?  How does one distinguish the words of the true god from
<BR>the posers who are tempting you to do something fiendish?  Isn't one 
<BR>burning bush like any other?  Oh, but you say they should know that it
<BR>couldn't be god if you're being told to do something so patently wrong.
<BR>Well, but what about Abraham?  Wasn't that the real god speaking?
<BR>
<BR>     As for comparing a forbidden dance (comic relief, I realize) to
<BR>murdering Isaac, I think there is at least one important difference.
<BR>Doing the lambada or even the twist for that matter involves only oneself; th
<BR>the consequences of breaking that law involve only the lawbreaker. 
<BR>Killing Isaac involves the sacrifice of an innocent.  I would feel less
<BR>cynical of an order from a god that, however wrong it may be, involved
<BR>harm only to myself.
<BR>
<BR>    As for hanging out with god, I was making an attempt to be jocular,
<BR>which is maybe a little risky when the subject is Kierkegaard (although
<BR>I think SK might appreciate it).  Be that as it may, I have to ask:
<BR>If god is so perfect, wouldn't he have a perfect a sense of humor as
<BR>well? ("I could only believe in a god who could dance.")  Wouldn't he
<BR>be the life of the party, someone we'd WANT to  hang out with?  And
<BR>even if having a divine sense of humor is not part of the godhead, 
<BR>isn't it true that there are a few prerequisites to worship?  If we 
<BR>are satisfied that we are dealing with the god of our fathers, is that
<BR>enough for us to bow down?  What if this god also seems to have some
<BR>very wrongheaded notions (e.g., like ordering people to kill their
<BR>only sons)?  My point is that it seems that in order to worship, one
<BR>must first respect, love and admire.  God must earn our respect.  And if
<BR>he does, then we might first want to hang with him.  And then we can
<BR>at least discuss the possibility of worship.
<BR>
