<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;		There are some assumptions that don't figure into my analysis and the existence of god is not one of them, at least not in any traditional sense.   [Was it Newton who said god was an unnecessary hypothesis in his physics?]  My aversion to the traditional formulation of  God (big "G") is that the notion a being who is all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good leads to incoherence.  "Can God create a stone that is so heavy that he couldn't lift it?" is kind of the classical nay-sayer's query. So, I'm more inclined toward a god that at least doesn't entail a  contradiction.  A more modest concept of god might something more akin to a cosmic chairman of the board, one with great powers, great wisdom, great knowledge, but one with foibles as well.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; 	[A friend of mine had a dream in which she got a chance to ask god a burning question: Why are men and women so different and why are women treated so shabbily?  In the dream, god grinned somewhat sheepishly and admitted he'd screwed up (so to speak) and apologized. However, god did reassure her that he felt her pain and admonished her that we're all in this together and, with any luck, all will turn out for the best.] </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Anyway, that's a long wind up to my first point which is: God  may be just as clueless as we are about a lot of things, so consigning moral decisions to him may be no better than consigning them to Ann Landers. </I></FONT>

<BR>Well, then, there's little else I can tell you about faith, save to explain that I believe in a God who created and is outside our own temporal reality.  In my view, to say "Can God create a stone so big He can't lift it?" is a dumb question, in a way--God has no physical prescence to lift a stone.  Besides, God, even if He isn't a necessary formulation for physics, He is necessary for morality.  So, it all gets to a basic quesiton: if good doesn't come from God, then where does our conception of good come from?  Tradition?  Logic?  Why should <I>I</I> be good in the first place, if I have no inherent reason to be so?  (Remember, Johannes, I've given up logic as a way to understand spiritual issues, and therefore, I don't go to logic to explain what is moral, and therefore, I may be some kind of criminal if morality is based entirely on logic).  At any rate, my point here is not to get you to agree with me, Johannes; as long as we disagree in a way that keeps the discussion interesting.
