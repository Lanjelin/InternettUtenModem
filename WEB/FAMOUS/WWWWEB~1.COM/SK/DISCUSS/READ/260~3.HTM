<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Mr. Tillett,</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I was asking Mr. Dean about a particular sentence in his post and he refered me to you with great deference.  The first two paragraphs of your post seem to be addressing the very sentence that I was confused by. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;------------------------</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Here is the sentence I was confused by...</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Mr. Dean:  "the realm of the subjective begins at the intersection of objective facts with a human consciousness, and so creates some confusion". </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And, this is what I think addresses my confusion...</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Mr. Tillett:  "...you are to some extent treating subjectivity as analogous/similar to personal opinion or belief.  Taken in this way, however, I think subjectivity becomes merely sub specie objectivity, as one pole of an objective experience: those objective facts which are not very amenable to substantiation or proof to another person (because they are in our own heads, derive from our particular perspective, etc.) in contrast to those objective facts which are for all practical purposes universal between people, communicable, provable, etc.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>But subjectivity in SK and my response refers to more the early 19th century notion of subjectivity, which in simple terms is whether or not the phenomena derives from an internal positive action of consciousness or an external determination.  SK's work can be seen as a presupposition that the phenomena is both, and also as a working out of the relationship between the two.  Thus, faith is subjective pure and simple, because it is purely derived from the internal passion of a commitment."</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;-------------------------------------------</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;My confusion did spark from the apparent dissimularity between how SK uses the term subjectivity and how Mr. Dean was using it.  Your drawing a distinction between the two has helped immensely.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;When reading your classification of Mr. Dean's use of subjectivity as "sub specie objectivity" it occured to me that maybe SKs objectivity was "sub specie subjectivity"?  Does this work out?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I think it does.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Mr. Dean and I came up with what I think is a nice image (although I had some trouble convincing him that I was not mocking the simplicity of it, the simplicity is exactly what I like about it), the image of lard, lard that we as human beings automatically slop over the pure objective external world.  Lard being unecessary and wrong, it is what we are tring to do away with to obtain pure objectivity.  Wipe the lard from our glasses to reveal pure objectivity.  ** In other words, lard is analogous with subjectivity, subjectivity that clouds our objective glasses, in other words a subjectivity that is sub species objectivity.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And now onto SK's idea, 19th century subjectivity.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;First, I am curious about the following terms:  internal positive action of consciousness & external determination.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Here is your definition:</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;"...the early 19th century notion of subjectivity, which in simple terms is whether or not the phenomena derives from an internal positive action of consciousness or an external determination."   </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;  By internal positive action of consciousness are you suggesting that the subject can yield its own object -- that God is only there for the believer; which, on a side note, reminds me of the man who knew God, whom Zarathustra meets in the wood at the begining of the first book; Zarathustra, upon hearing that this Man knows god, quickly yet politely darts away, saying, "I have nothing to give you, but I must leave you quickly, lest I take something from you.")</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;   </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And one last thought, if subjectivity sub species objectivity subjugates subjectivity to objectivity (as I tried to show in the first paragraph up above), then does objectivity sub species subjectivity do the reverse?  And isn't this extrememly dangerous a la Don Quijote?  Isn'this what Zarathustra mocks when he hurries passed the abovementioned man in the forest who knows God?   </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Sincerely,</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;CAry Cortese</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;P.S. What do you think of the term: "Secular Christian"?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;----------</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;** Do you remeber when SK talks of the man who by a miracle came to believe in Hegelianism, a doctrine that makes no room for miracles?    </I></FONT>
<BR>I am sorry not to respond to your post sooner; I have been shut-out of the Webcom server for this forum, apparently, for some reason, longer than the rest of you have.
<BR>
<BR>Your lard metaphor has some merit; it reminds me a bit of Plato's metaphor of the cave: the human personality (subjectivity in our useage)covers up or degrades the pristine clarity of reality objectivity); in Plato's sense, via being chained in a cave, in your useage, via having one's glasses covered over with lard.  Its also reminiscent (to me) of a Kantian perspective: subjectivity imposes its own categorical structures on reality, and thereby closes off any knowledge at all about the things in themselves apart from subjectivity.  Again, there is a sense of a barrier between the self and objectivity, a barrier which feels like it needs to be surmounted.
<BR>
<BR>However, SK's idea and the 19th Century notion of subjectivity referred to in my post is different from all of this in  at least this respect: subjectivity affects objectivity, but not in a bad sense, but in a higher sense.  In this, subjectivity is something to be attained, rather than something to wipe away or discard.
<BR>
<BR>And in this sense, I think you have a good point in calling SK's objectivity "sub-specie subjectivity."  This is a nice contrast to my formulation of subjective belief or opinion as sub-specie objectivity.  In the latter, one's belief or opinion is denominated as such because it is not amenable to being proven on an objective scale.  Thus, the subjective opinion is held up to the standards of objective criteria and argument, found wanting, and is thereby determined to be a mere "belief."  By the same token, SK's objective knowledge is compared by him to true subjectivity - ie, ethical or religious commitment - and found wanting, and is thereby determined to be (by SK) appoximate, impersonal, and productive of no more than a trivial actuality.  In this he is certainly assigning subjectivity to a higher plain of "knowledge;" and at least by implication is holding it up as something we ought to strive for.
<BR>
<BR>I was not suggesting in my post that the "subject can yield its own object" by an internal positive action of consciousness.  In SK's formulation, the internal positive action of consciousness is an ethical or religious commitment per se.  The object which the commitment relates to in an essential way is not produced by consciousness, but given to it more or less accidentally as an item of interest in temporal existence.  Upon meeting the object in historical time, the personality may be presented with a choice: to commit, or not to commit.  The object is not produced by consciousness, nor is the object altered; rather the commitment is an internal change of the personality.
<BR>
<BR>"Secular Christian" seems to me to be an oxymoron.  What do you think?
