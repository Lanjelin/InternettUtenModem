That is quite a bit to chew on. 
<BR>
<BR>Is it fair to say that in the sinner's range of motion he cannot release himself from his self inflicted torture; that while he cannot escape from sin becaue the person who would help him escape is himself who is precisely who he is trying to get away from, precisely the person who is torturing him, yet there is the salvation, if you will, that our sinner could rest transparently in God through a complicated procedure of self negation.
<BR>I fear I bastardized the issue.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>Sin is defiance.  In the context through which and by which K. asserts the despair of the self in despair is in a state of assertive separation from God.  The idea of an immanent, ineffable God Who is eternal being involved in the affairs of a temporal, declensive world, is, as K. pointed out, "a logical absurdity."  This means that: A) sin is the result of defiance--a willful declension or decision to be apart from God; B) a willingness to continue in that decision (i.e., to be "in" the world in despair) and C) the despair itself implies the absence of God.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>K.'s brilliance, if you will, comes from a thoughtfulness that considers the condition of man as a totality of despair.  It is absurd to petition a God you have yourself rejected.  This means that the world is not the result of God's creation, but the result of a decision of the mind.  "He began with the infinite abstraction of the self,and now he has finally become so concrete that it would be impossible to become eternal in that sense; nevertheless, he wills in despair to be himself. What demonic madness--the thought that most infuriates him is that eternity could get the notion to deprive him of his misery (Sickness Unto Death, p. 72)."</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>Working through Kierkegaard is working through the original existential deconstructionist.  If sin is "real" it must be eternal; thus, it is the role of victim and victimizer that won't be relinquished by the sufferer.  Because he is so far from the idea of eternity, it doesn't occur to him that sin is no more than a mistaken formation in the mind ("inwardness" in K.'s terms).</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>The "sinner" cannot relinquish anything.  The despairer in despair must first realize the despair, as it is.  The construct of philosophy is doubt.  For doubt to be at all, first there must have been certainty.  To return to the safety of certainty, sin must obviously be relinquished.  The sinner is first of all a despairer.  The concretization of the natural state of the mind led to despair.  This means that whatever the mind sees as "real" denies its opposite (sin denies God; God does not "see" sin).  If sin is real, God is not; if God is real, sin is not.  Which position the mind identifies with determines its existential condition.  An eternal God cannot be in time.  That which is in time is mortal, in despair, in defiance, in "sin", if you will.  Thus, the situation is not only absurd, it must be illogical.  Relinquishment begins with the mind that was once certain but now doubts.  The doubt turns on the doubting whether sin is real or not.  That is the beginning stage of the reversal K. aims at.  Theology will not do it.  Philosophy will not do it.  No technique the mind in despair utilizes to rid itself of its despair will work.  Why?  Because the mind that made the despair real is interested only in continuing the despair.  K. makes that quite clear.  Thus, the mind must be induced in some way to not see any value in judgment, condemnation, or sin.  It changes the status of these tautologies to that of non-value, or simply a mistake in mental perception.  The perceiver receives "faith" but only to correct the mental state of despair.  To be in that position of faith requires the complete recognition that nothing in the state of despair, even when it seems most logical, makes any sense at all. The synthesis is a relation between two selves.  Yet, the human "self" is not the human "being."  The difference is that being is busy being being.  The self is only interested in self-continuance, as thought, as idea, as self.  What is made up in the self is very powerful since the mind identified with the doubt, the uncertainty.  Thus, the thought of "self" as "self" must be negated.  It cannot relinquish, it can only see something that perceives itself in another way.  That other way is the active agent of faith, as K. sees it; it introduces another way of perceiving and only acceptance can be required, whether conscious of it or not, by the self that is not.  (Cf. K.'s discussion of "possibility" & "actuality" in Sickness unto Death).  This is tough, tough, material.  Clearly, the contradictory self is not the self who will release it from its contradiction, since it is in a relation with itself to another who views the relation in the same sense.  Or, as K. puts it:</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;"If the despairing person is aware of his despair, as he thinks he is, and does not speak meaninglessly of it as of something that is happening to him . . . and now with all his power seeks to break the</I></FONT>
<BR>despair by himself and by himself alone--he is still in despair and with all his presumed effort only works himself all the deeper into deeper despair. . . .  The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this:  in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it (The Sickness unto Death, p.14 [Princeton University Press, 1980)."
