Hello. 
<BR>Thanks so much for responding to my cry for help. I'm not sure I agree with
<BR>what your interpretations however. (Hey, but what do I know? I'm the one who
<BR>publicly announced that I don't "get it.")
<BR>
<BR>The way I see it (and as I've been told) Kierkegaard claims there are
<BR>different classes of people: those in lower immediacy, the ethical, knights
<BR>of resignation and knights of faith. God is only a representation of your
<BR>duty towards... yeah towards what? 
<BR>
<BR>Well, here's that defining relationship thing again. What I mean by that is
<BR>the absolute commitment (to a finite being, thus VULNERABLE) that tells you
<BR>what to do everyday, rules your world. This is all in the Preamble.
<BR>Kierkegaard was committed to Regina (to whom this was all written in an
<BR>explanation as to why he broke off their engagement) Abraham was committed
<BR>to Issac, The prince to the princess and so on. It has to be something that
<BR>cannot be explained too (good thing 'cause I can't do it). Like SK couldn't
<BR>explain to Mr. X why he was absolutely committed to R. SK writes as a knight
<BR>of resignation so he has accepted the fact that he can live without R and
<BR>does. Abraham was a knight of faith so he lives with Issac realizing that he
<BR>is vulnerable (and that he could live without him) but still lives as if he
<BR>is the most sure thing in the world.
<BR>
<BR>There is nothing great about what Abraham did. Not to me anyway. I see it as
<BR>a demonstration only of Abrahams Faith in Issac. Abraham experiences a
<BR>conflict between his ethical duty (duty to neighbors, world, christian) and
<BR>his "faith duty" toward Issac. The ethical duty is not to kill Isaac. Makes
<BR>sense. Somehow Abraham's faith duty was to kill him. (Don't ask...I have no
<BR>answer.) The reason I say Abraham was sure he would get Issac back is
<BR>because he was a knight of faith "living as if Issac was invulnerable."
<BR>Paradoxical Faith in the ABSURD.
<BR>
<BR>So, I think God is only a representation of your duty toward the object of
<BR>your absolute commitment.
<BR>
<BR>RE: RE: RE: EXERCISE IN FUTILITY
<BR>
<BR>I don't think Kierkegaard wants us to do anything. I think he's pointing out
<BR>how he sees it. Ask the question "Is there a teleological suspension of the
<BR>ethical?" Get an answer. Lower immediacy: OF COURSE they'll do anything to
<BR>serve themselves. Ethical:NO. unless it is for the higher ethical (steal
<BR>medicine to save life) Knight of Faith:YES. They can suspend the ethical for
<BR>the sake of their commitment (Watch the old Orson Welles flick, The Third
<BR>Man). Here the individual is higher than the universal.
<BR>
<BR>Its hard for me to "get."
<BR>
<BR>I cannot accept a philosophy that is based on the existence of God so
<BR>easily. (Doesn't matter if I believe in God or not it just seems cheap). So,
<BR>the surface reading is about god but I think when explored in depth its
<BR>about ethics relating to other people. Not that I'm accepting Kierkegaard.
<BR>Writing this made it make a little more sense to me though. Sorry if it
<BR>doesn't make sense to you. That is, my writing.
<BR>
<BR>Please feel free to share your thoughts. Email any time or post. Feel free
<BR>to send your paper on over too I'd love to read it, yeah, just read it, I
<BR>wouldn't try and pass it off as my own, no sireee, that'd be an unjust
<BR>suspension of the ethical, and I'd NEVER.
<BR>
