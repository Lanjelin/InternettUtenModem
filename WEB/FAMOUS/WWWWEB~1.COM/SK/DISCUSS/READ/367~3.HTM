<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I am asking, selfishly, for my own benefit; and am trying my best to stay solely with Kierkegaard's meaning for offense as you have presented it.</I></FONT>

<BR>
<BR>I understand. What I am trying to say is that the question of whether Jesus was subject to Original Sin is a question that primarily interests Christians. Non-Christians don't care one way or another or about it, and it typically is not an issue that stands in the way of their becoming Christians. I have never heard a skeptic say that he didn't believe Christianity because Christianity says that Jesus was not subject to Original Sin.
<BR>
<BR>Kierkegaardian "offense" relates to the intellectual objections non-believers have to Christian doctrines, in particular the existential meaning of those objections.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Secondly, I say, yes, precisely, I did mean the "worldly understanding" as opposed to "divine understanding" (divine understanding seems something of a connundrum to me, but that is another discussion).  Getting back to my original question of how the complex interelationship of JEsus, Original Sin, and degrees of offense (SK) work -- namely, if Jesus is exempt from ORiginal Sin is that more offensive or less.  (Offensive in SK's terms, offense to understanding, worldly undersanding, as opposed to divine; not offensive as in waht you ahev discribed as scandal). And then you answered my question with, "To the worldly understanding, all of the major Christian doctrines are unpalattable by their very nature".  By this, I assume you mean to refute the possibility of degrees of palatability(sp)OR perhaps you mean that there are degrees and it is just that they are so slight that they are not worthy of our attention; either way it seems obvious that my question is misguided, something I will fully admit; but I still say, which is it?, I am more curious now than before; is Jesus's exemption or inclusion in Original Sin have any effect to the degree of offence at all?  If it does have even in the slightest amount, can you tell in what direction it is affected?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>SK discusses in the Fragments and the Postscript the notion of "degrees of palatibility" with respect to Christianity. If I understand him, the upshot is that there aren't any. The notion of God Incarnate is essentially offensive to the worldly mind, such that nothing added to or subtracted from it will either deepen or lessen the offense. In other words, if you are willing to buy into the notion that Jesus of Nazareth was the Living God Incarnate, how could you then get hung up on whether He was subject to Original Sin or not? It's the old "swallowing the camel and choking on a gnat" phenomenon. With Christianity, the Incarnation is the camel and everything else is a gnat.
