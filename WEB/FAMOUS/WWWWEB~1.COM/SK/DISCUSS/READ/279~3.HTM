<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;OK.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I'm afraid I am never clear on what I mean, but here is another attempt:</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;It is a tricky buisness to try and figure out SK's intentions, and normally I would shy away from such attempting something so foolish, but I think we are on to something.  Yes, I do think that SK's intends something different with "his notion of subjectivity" than Plato or Kant intended with their respective notions, but I do think that their notions are notions of the same idea -- "subjectivity".  Sk constanly refers to Socrates, I see SK and Socrates standing next to each other in my front yard looking at the same "subjectivity", but using different metaphors and having different notions in their heads.  You see a tree that I planted in my front yard differently than I do, but if we are standing next to each other in my front yard, and there is only one tree in my yard, and we are both looking at it, it should be clear enough that we are looking at the same tree, even if we have different notions/ metaphors for it.  This tree is subjectivity.  And I think SK wants to get rid of subjectivity just as much as Socrates wanted to, but SK is concerned for the modern age, he think that modern man has rid himself of subejctivity too easily, so he seeks to seeks to make it more difficult again via the pseudonym of JC.  And realize that just because he makes the task more difficult doesn't mean that he doesn't want you to complete it.  And SK writes his book for modern man so maybe he is not making it more difficult at all, maybe it is just that we have misunderstood, and our misunderstanding has made it much too easy -- maybe we have lowered the standard and JC is pointing out how it was/ still is.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In Plato's rendition, subjectively chained, we struggle towards pure objectivity.  This was a difficult enough task for the Greeks.  Could you even say that even Socrates, a man who had dedicated his entire life to the task had achieved it?  (Well Plato might go as far to say, or at least hint that Socrates had achieved it, but note that Kierkegaard prefers Aristophanes' account of SOcrates to Plato's, claiming Plato's account is too idealistic).   </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Today, almost every modern man, merely by virtue of being a modern man, has broken his subjective chains and become purely objective.  Could one not say it was too easy?  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;So, JC comes along to make it difficult again.     </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In this sentence of yours:</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;"In neither of these [Kant or Plato] is there a leap to fuse the subjective and objective, but only a program to opt for one side or the other" I have to disagree. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Again, it is not that Socrates is correctling hte Greeks, itis that he is correcting our interpretation of them. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Remember that the virtue of the Greeks was that they knew they existed.  IT is not something that they could forget.  But we, meaning Modern Man, you and I, easily forget.  When we forget, the becomes easy, because we can objectively appropriate the objective (meaning we never enter into the equasion); when we are reminded its difficult again for we must do the task subjectively.  Jc is that thorn in our side that wont let us forget.  He wrked hard to be that thorn.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Lets say someone walked up to you, a man with a huge beergut, claiming that exercise is a scam.  You ask him if he does situps and he says he  can do 100 situps in 60 seconds and furthermore he does this twice a day every day and it doesnt help him in the least.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; Well, you are eager to help, so you ask him to show you.  So he drops and starts doing situps... And you are quite disappointed yet amazed to see that he did more than 100 situps in 60 seconds, he did 110 -- but you have to note that he didn't bend at the waist even once -- all he did was move his neck, shaking his head violently, and counted aloud everytime his chin touched the top of his chest.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;You would indeed be doing this man a favor by holding his knees and leading him to bend at the waist and bring his chin all the way up.  You would be making the exercise more difficult, but isnt this what is needed?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;So, have I changed your opinion about he simularities between the chasm and the barrier?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;It might help to say that the intentions of each metaphor come clear in the word chosen to explain each -- the leap and the barrier.  The barrier intends to remind us of the task at hand -- to cross the barrier.  The leap intends to remind us that we, each individually,  are the ones who must do it, it being the task, the task being to cross the barrier, leap over the chasm, or it is the barrier, or it is the chasm -- either/or.   The main point of our discussion here is that Sk's subjectivity (a widening of the ditch, a heightening of the barrier) is an added difficulty when attempting to rid oneself of "subjectivity sub species objectivity" (leave the cave, experience the noumena).</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Did I jam everything in there?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Maybe I could make it all clearer if I got a big grant and spentthe time to exand this thought out into 26 volumes?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;IF I wer to do this I would need your help.  My writing is so very far from precise.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I anxiously await your precise summary of my bombast presentation.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>To your question: I do not think SK's leap is the same as the barrier between the subjective and objective in Plato, Kant, et al.  To the contrary, I think SK intended something quite different.  In Plato, the effort was to disregard the appearances of things and return via a recollection into the formal ideas.  In Kant, the effort was to disregard the illusory habits of the mind which push the personality to say something about things in themselves, and to be satisfied with the phenomenal appearances.  In neither of these is there a leap to fuse the subjective and objective, but only a program to opt for one side or the other.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But in SK, the leap marks a fundamental change of the personality in its relation to the world, and is a bona fide attempt by SK to formulate, I think, the way in which a fusion of subjectivity and objectivity takes place.  It is in the leap that the personality transcends the self-absorption of an ironic esthetic relation to the world, and becomes the self-actualized ethical individual.  It is also in the leap that the personality leaves aside the self-actualization of the ethical, and becomes the self-negating religious individual in an absolute relation to the Absolute.  In both of these leaps, there is a fusion of the subjective committed personality with the objective: in the case of the ethical individual,  the subjective commitment is fused with the objective existing self, and the self is thereby made actual in time (hence SK's famous statement: "truth is subjectivity ... ").  In the religious commitment, the subjective commitment of faith to Jesus Christ gives rise to the actuality of the self and the self's relation to the world  as a gift from God; aka the "second immediacy" of Fear and Trembling.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>The leap is also for SK a conceptual presupposition, which he feels is necessary to preserve the freedom of the individual in making the transitions.  That one must leap means that the transitions from stage to stage are "beyond reason," in that the individual is not moving through the stages by virtue of a reason, but by virtue of a passionate commitment.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>You ask some good questions.  But after writing all of this I do not feel as if I am on to the point you are really after.  Can you clarify at all?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>A quick note to let you know I am not ignoring your post.  Your post presents a lot of issues which are giving me not a little difficulty, and the holiday schedule has thus far prevented me from giving you the considered response you deserve.  I hope to respond to you soon, if I can get clear on what it is I want to say.
