I have been off and on trying to formulate a response to your very complicated post on sin and the function of God - and, by the way, all the time hoping someone else would respond and give me a feel for what to say - when I noticed in this thread your statement: "I think SK drifts away at times from recognizing that there is a necessary step through the realm of the universal on the way to the absolute."
<BR>
<BR>But, that is precisely what the concept of sin, and sin consciousness,  does: it prevents (it >>is<<) the isolation of the individual from the universal; the individual made purely alone, before God.  SK does not "drift away from recognizing" this necessary step.  He specifically rejects any step through the universal (the imminent) to God (the transcendant).  Thus, Abraham's position is "fear and trembling:"  his utter isolation in a moment of critical decision; he has no universal to appeal to.  He is alone.
<BR>
<BR>And there it is, my response to your post.  Sin is the consciousness of God, of standing before God; sin is the consciousness of the universal, of standing outside the universal; sin is the consciousness of oneself, of standing as and outside of oneself, purely, with no other referent.  All of these refer to the same thing, are encompassed in one personality at the moment of recognition of sin.  Sin is eo ipso despair, which is the state of loss, but loss aggravated because the stakes are so much higher: for one is alone before God.  And the "aloneness" is critical to SK's position, because (at least in part) it prevents the Hegelian system from overcoming the individual.  Permit the universal to bear positively upon the Absolute God in any sense whatsoever, and you will shortly slide down the slippery slope to a human egoistic or nihilistic position.
<BR>
<BR>And here is the response to this post (pardon me if this has been a rude interjection, Mr. Lynch; I did not intend it): SK did not, as much as I have read of him, deal with such detail as the Virgin Birth.  But he did deal with the destruction of the personality which is the decision inherent in the offense of Jesus Christ.  And the result of such a decision, a decision for faith in Christ, makes issues like the Virgin Birth rather insignificant.  You make a good point, which is essentially contra Brown's Matthew: it would have been more proper (given SK's interpretation of the significance of Christ) to have Jesus be born illegitimate, as that would have been consistent with the "offensiveness" of Christ manifested in other ways (lowly; poor; a carpenter without work; no place to call His own).  But I think you will find that SK does not place the essence of the offense as His physical/social circumstances; these are more preliminary considerations.  It is the manifestation of God, pure and simple, as a  particular man that SK tries to explicate as the offense.  On this level, the Virgin Birth becomes a matter of faith because it is given to us by the Scripture, which is accepted as such because of a prior acceptance of Christ as God.  To the person of strong (perfect?) faith, like Anti-Climacus, it would be, I think, unimportant to determine the "truth" of the Virgin Birth; for true or untrue, the commitment of faith in Jesus would remain.  He would, I think, believe in the Virgin Birth simply because Matthew said it, and Matthew would be assumed to be empowered by God.  But whether true or not, Anti-Climacus' faith would be unwavering.
<BR>
<BR>If all of you do not have a real feel for why the issue of the Virgin Birth is "rather insignificant" in comparison to the issue of offense and faith, I would suggest that you may read Practise in Christianity again; as near as I can fathom, that is the primary purpose of this great work.  And, although it came later in his authorship, I feel it is central to (my understanding of) SK's work overall.
<BR>
<BR>But, I am one without authority.
