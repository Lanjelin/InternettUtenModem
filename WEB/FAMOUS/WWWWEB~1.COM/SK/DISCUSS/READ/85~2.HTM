<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;and/or one's own ethical sensibilities. It has to be so.  Our prisons</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;are filled examples of people who, in their own estimation, heeded the</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;call of god -- people who killed their children because they believes </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;it was god's will.  We rightly condemn these people.  But why?  Well, we </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;want to say it's because they were wrong -- that they really were not</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;acting on god's orders.  But how do we know that if the example of Abraham</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;pass of flunk?  Or is it that they heard god rightly when he gave the</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;the order?  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     I simply could not believe in a god who would order me to kill my son.  Even if he didn't mean it, even</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;if it was a test, it shows a callousness that strikes me</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;as somewhat less than divine.  It makes god into a mean-spirited </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;practical joker.  Which, at least by some Old Testament accounts, may </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;be somewhat accurate. (Job, for instance.) Such a god is much more interesting, because more</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;human, but not someone I'd want to hang out with.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>For the sake of the Judeo-Christian faith, I feel that I should point
<BR>out that God has been defined (so to speak) as benevolent, omnipotent,
<BR>omniscient, etc., which makes it very easy to dismiss these people to whom
<BR>you refer that have filled our prisons by committing crimes by edict of God.
<BR>The Christian God would never cause a human being to hurt another human being,
<BR>simply because God would be violating his own laws of ethic.  These criminals
<BR>were, from a Christian standpoint, mistaken.  It's as simple as that.  You might
<BR>say they were coersed by the Devil, who knows.
<BR>
<BR>You see, it is very important to see that Abraham did not kill his son because
<BR>God stopped him.  These criminals you talk of did kill their children, which is
<BR>something God would not allow.
<BR>
<BR>For the sake of argument, it is also important to acknowledge that Abraham placed
<BR>the word of God above everything else.  It could be said that there would be no
<BR>difference between God asking Abraham to offer his son in sacrifice or to dance
<BR>the lambada (that's the forbidden dance!), because Abraham would have done
<BR>either without question as an act of faith.  This is faith that most cannot
<BR>concieve of.  This is faith that required you to put God first in all things.
<BR>This was the faith of Abraham, thus an example to the rest of humankind.  This is
<BR>the faith of SK's third stage of existence.
<BR>
<BR>As for not hearing the cancelling order, if God were truly talking to you, you would
<BR>most certainly hear.
<BR>
<BR>God is allowed to be callous.  He supposedly created the world and you.
<BR>
<BR>God is someone you are supposed to worship, not hang out with.
