<BR>Kierkegaard understands sensuality as the orignal sin.  In his discussion of anxiety and original sin, he expressly says that anxiety is the end of innocence, and that from innocence, sensuality is the entry into the first sin.  SK goes so far as to imply that the first sin was Adam wanting to sleep with Eve (I will bring in the cite on Monday -- my references are at home today).  It isn't. of course, surprising that a Victorian bourgeouis connects the first sin to bodily desire.  What is surprising is how disconnected this view is from orthodoxy, and from SK's own hierarchy of virtues.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The more orthodox view is that the human individual's desire to be other than, and more than human -- pride -- is the first sin.  The myth of Adam and Eve eating the fruit in the garden includes the serpent saying, "If you eat it, you will be like gods."  Christian theologians usually understand this to mean that the original temptation was to aspire beyond our place in the universe.  Humanity has, in this view, always been afflicted with a little megolomania.  This view of the basic ground of human discontent with human fate isn't confined to the Christian tradition.  Even F. Nietzsche seems to have been aware that our fate to be all too human is at odds with our first ambition and best hopes.  And SK himself, in Sickness unto Death, understands despair (which sounds like the ultimate, although apparently not the original, sin) as the refusal to accept one's identity as it is given to one.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;An individual in despair can either insist on keeping all his or her options open, and try to be many selves at once (feminine despair), or become so much one self that all responses to the absolute's absolute demand are foreclosed (masculine despair).  I assumed when first I read this view of despair that it also was the original sin.  But SK unequivocally tells us it is sensuality.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Why isn't the source of anxiety in the awareness that we can't get out of despair, absent an absolute relation to the absolute?  It seems pretty lightweight if anxiety, SK's basis of human psychology, or at least psychopathology, is the awareness that we must lose our sexual or sensual innocence.  If despair is the block between us and the absolute, why isn't it also the original sin?  The elimination of the original sin should be the necessary condition to the complete engagement with the absolute (as perfect humility is the necessary step to true knowledge of God in the Roman Catholic contemplative tradition).</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;My point here is only that the original sin should be intimately tied to the ultimate virtue.  But SK has linked original sin to nothing, and the original sin is a mere itch, compared with hatred and greed and pride.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The idea that sensuality is the original sin even seems to conflict with the leap of faith.  Indeed, the bourgeouis knight of faith in Fear and Trembling stands outside the butcher's window, both forsaking the roast and being sure that he will have it.  Isn't the hope for -- and delight in -- good food, also sensuality?  What is SK thinking to juxtapose an expression of the leap of faith and an experience of the ur-sin?  Any helpful comments -- other than "Go home and sleep it off?".</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>1. go home and sleep it off.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>2. Q:Why isn't the source of anxiety in the awareness that we can't get out of despair, absent an absolute relation to the absolute? 
<BR>
<BR>Lets say Anxiety arises from the belief that one should be able to do something, coupled by the feeling that one is not doing what is necessary, alongside the existence-fact that one is not really doing anything but worrying about the problem.  Think of it in terms of procrastination -- I should be doing something, but I'm not doing it, as a result I'm anxious.
<BR>
<BR>Next, complicate the issue by relating procrastination to despair.  Lets assume that you can either (a) be in despair, or (b) you can be procrastinating, i.e. not really be in despair; (Sickness Unto Death, that the person who does not know he is in despair is in the worst despair). Now the problem is that there is no difficulty (SK is tryingot make things difficult) because to be anxious and in despair, well, frankly itis not possible, you must not really in despair -- you are a procrastinating despairer.  Ans as a procrastinating despairer you have aomething going for you, at least you know you are in despair--  this knowledge makes you paradoxically both less and more in despair.  'Less' because you are not in as much despair as the man who does not know he is in despair; and 'more', because you have mitigated your despair by realizing that you are really in despair -- i.e. to the degree that you have realized you are in despair you haved moved away from the worst despair, or in other words, to the degree that you have stopped procrastinating and started desapiring you have lightened your despair.  But I must renig: because you were never really in despair, you were procrastinating, remeber? --(follow the logic closely, its faulty).
<BR>So, to clarify, you get out of despair by going into it.  Think of the comic and the tragic, one gets to the comic by exausting the tragic, so one could get out of despair by exausting it, by delving into it with that infinate inwardness, in an absolute manner.
<BR>      So, it is when you delve into in and realize that there is probobly going to be no end to it, that is the end to procrastination.  When one procrastinates usually because one cannot see an end to what one is doing and the thought of jumping into it without seeing how to get out is frightening -- one doesnt want to drown in the muddle, or in SK's analogy, one doesn't want to leap across a chasm until one definately knows wide the chasm is (sees how far it is to the other side, sees the ending point).  So, one patiently waits next to the water, waits next to the chasm -- one procrastinates, witing for the chasm to shrink to the pointit dissapears (somethingit will never do)--(a note for later: original sin may shrink to an itch, but its still there, yes?).
<BR>      So, from my point of view, abstractly and artificially constructed, I would say that realizing that one cannot get out of despair is a good way to stop being anxious as opposed to vice-versa. I think that is my attempt on the first half of your Q, but Idon't know what you mean by "absent an absolute realtion to the absolute", how does that fit in?
<BR>
<BR>And yes Despair is very similar to original sin, we all have it, we can't get rid of it -- were all human, right?. (Human all too human!! (Hey, who let Freidrich in here?))    
<BR>
<BR>3.  My point here is only that the original sin should be intimately tied to the ultimate virtue.  But SK has linked original sin to nothing, and the original sin is a mere itch, compared with hatred and greed and pride. 
<BR>
<BR>I forgot what this is -- what is unltimate virtue?
<BR>
<BR>Yes, original sin is an itch.  And chrstians get very offended if you don't realize that you too itch.  It is a christian no no to exempt yourself from Original Sin.  (I'm jewish, I should know -- I am a christian  no-no; In fact I remember my mom telling me when I was very young, we are raising you as a jew because we don't believe in original sin, we believe in a clean slate -- but thats a personnal aside.)    
<BR>And about the comparison of despair with hatred greed and pride -- well, yes they are serious offenses, but I think those are offenses for the judge to deal with, ethics and such.  Big offenses, they just come up in a different arena.  Or amybe, you can put them in despair -- maybe you could say that thisis why the personis in despair, becasue he knows he has no case before the judge, because he is full of hatred, greed and pride...  he is infinately in despair in reguard to his eternal happiness.
<BR>
<BR>OH!!! TELL ME ABOUT SK LINKING ORIGINAL SIN TO NOTHING.  I aM VERY INTERESTED.  maybe even email it to me.  id really appreciate it.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>4.The idea that sensuality is the original sin even seems to conflict with the leap of faith.  Indeed, the bourgeouis knight of faith in Fear and Trembling stands outside the butcher's window, both forsaking the roast and being sure that he will have it.  Isn't the hope for -- and delight in -- good food, also sensuality?  What is SK thinking to juxtapose an expression of the leap of faith and an experience of the ur-sin? 
<BR>
<BR>The width of the chasm varies according to who is standing at it edge.  the knight of faith makes the ditch infinately broad and commits to jumping it anyway.  Where someone else might try to make the chasm smaller and smaller, and it will keep doing that, doen to .000000001 error, and then to .000000000000000000000000001, and then to .000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001, and on and on, buthte chasm is still there.  
<BR>So connect the width of the chasm to the amount of desapir one is in. and connect the person doing the leap to ... well... to leap acrosst he chasm is to get out of despair...  (from above) to exaust your despair.  But the way out of despair is not to deny that you are guilty of ORiginal Sin, right?
