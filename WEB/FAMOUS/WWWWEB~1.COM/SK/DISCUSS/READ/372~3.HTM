<BR>
<BR>I don't buy that there is a distinction between Apostles and others, or that there is a radical distinction among personal experiences of God/the Absolute to be drawn, except perhaps between those who are not invited into an absolute relation to the Absolute, and those who are.  Among those so called, the relationship of one individual to the Absolute is not qualitatively distinguishable from other such relationships, because the relationship is immediate and transcendent and thus not subject to qualitative distinctions. SK appears expressly to recognize this in _Fear and Trembling_  (or, at least, I have always believed that is the point to  the brief anecdote of the bourgeouis knight of faith whose act of relinquishment and faith centers around a roast for the domestic table).  Even if this does not seem clear from the text of _F&T_, it is clear in SK's discussion in _The Consept of Anxiety_:  sin, an element (or absence) in the individual relation to the absolute, is described as immediate and transcendent, and not qualitatively different among individuals -- it seems impossible to hold this view and yet to distinguish among the quality of faith in functioning relationships with the Absolute.
<BR>
<BR>I also cannot accept the concept of "special revelation," although Mr. Tye may not have intended to use the term in its technical sense of a private gift of Divine understanding to one individual, which is not available to others.  My understanding of general Christian doctrine on this point is that no one has a true "special revelation" after the Ascension.  Christ has been fuilly revealed to all, and the Divine is now as fully accessible to any baptized Christian as to any other -- no favorites in the heart of God.  Thus, while one Christian might have a more intense experience of the Divine than another, that experience reveals of God only what has already been taught in the Passion, Death and Resurrection.  The subjective intensity of feeling, however, does not qualitatively affect the individual's relationship to God.
<BR>
<BR>It seems to me therefore that both SK and general Christian doctrine militate against the Apostles, or anyone, having a qualitatively different experience of God or the Absolute.  (I leave to one side SK's assertion that the Apostles were subject to another dialectic of faith, for now.)  The point to my argument is not that we all have the same experience of God or the Absolute -- far from it.  The first century Palestinians had data available that we do not have. We have data they did not.  My point is that _DATA MATTER_.  The experience of God we have, and so the outlines of our relationship to Him, are drawn differently for different individuals, and are based in concrete objective (particular) experiences that are not readily shared with others.  The faith we have is shared -- it comes, however, from unrepeatable, but real, experiences.  Faith is not an a priori concept, but a relationship, and so the result of experiences.
<BR>
<BR>My dispute with SK is that if he wants to speak philosophically about an Incarnational theology, it seems paradoxical that he chose a metaphysics which so excludes the immanent from the transcendent as to make the two concepts polar opposites.  The important effect of individual human data on individual lived faith is one of the places where the _necessity_ of the action of the immanent for the true experience of the transcendent is evident.  I chose this as a starting place for my argument because SK himself recognized it and rejected it -- in _The Sickness unto Death_, Anti-Climacus analogizes the Gospel message to a message brought from the King to a commoner that the commoner may marry the King's daughter.  Anti-Climacus recognizes that the commoner will seek verification of the King's true intnet from his other actions -- does the King bring his son-in-law to the palace?  Invite him to prepare for a feast?  But Anti-Climacus (paradoxicaly, to my mind) insists that these secondary verifications are unavailable to the Christian.
<BR>
<BR>Yet verification is exactly what the Apostles sought (and received in a unique way, as you point out), and exactly what we seek.  How many people have you heard who reject Christianity because of the Christians they know?  Verification is the human response to a claim of truth -- and in an Incarnational religion, there is no need to bar the way to verification. Certainly, a philosopher writing before the Incarnation could not have predicted it.  But once it has occurred and been revealed, we are no longer in the same straits.  We know that Incarnation is part of reality because we have been told, and _have seen it with our own eyes_.  It seems odd to pretend that we need to reject the obvious simply because it could not have been guessed before it was revealed.
