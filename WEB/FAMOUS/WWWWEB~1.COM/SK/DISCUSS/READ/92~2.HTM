<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;My sense is that you are right, that Kierkegaard believed there was an objective truth, but that it was inaccessible from the finite perspectives of humanity.  On the other hand, SK also seems to stress passionate beliefs as somehow providing a conduit to truth.  By this, I don't think he means we can, if we believe hard enough and passionately enough, make 2 + 2 equal anything but four.  But once we get beyond mere tautologies or perhaps brute facts such as the height of Mt. McKinley, there is a lot of wiggle room.  Certainly, there is a lot of wiggle room when it comes to God.  So, perhaps what Kierkegaard is saying is that the only truths worth getting worked up about are those that one MUST get worked up about.  "Truth is an objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation process of the most passionate inwardness."  I think that's why he reacted so strongly against the institutionalized religion of his day.  God was simply too important to simply be pocketed along with algorithms and other items of common sense.  For a human being, this process is the most important avenue to the truth.</I></FONT>

<BR>Excellent thoughts!  But I have one point with which to get your further opinions.  You mentioned that " Kierkegaard believed there was an objective truth, but that it was inaccessible from the finite perspectives of humanity."  I think I agree, but I hoped you would detail your thoughts here further.
<BR>
<BR>In a sense, the "objective truth" that I am right now typing a message onto my computer is inaccessible to me.  And, in that sense, any real objective truth about God, etc. is as inaccessible.
<BR>
<BR>But here Kierkegaard seems to radically part ways with the existentialists that followed him; both the religious (Bultmann, Tillich), and the non-religious (Camus, Sartre) at this crucial point:
<BR>
<BR>Although, in a sense, the objective truth on such matters was inaccessible, Kierkegaard did not construct the "impenatrable wall" that later existentialists seemed to between each individual's subjectivity and God. In that for those later existentialists, objective knowledge about God (if they acknowledged him at all)  was completely inaccessible to humanity.  In contrast, for Kierkegaard, while each individual was his own individual, SK still believed very strongly that through the God-man, and through the Word of God which testified to him, one could truly know God.
<BR>
<BR>(Again, of course, SK's emphasis was incredibly balanced toward responding subjectively to that objective truth, but here again I'd point out that he strongly believed that such objective truth was, in a certain sense, accessible enough for us to know it and thus to respond.)
<BR>
<BR>OK, just some more random thoughts.  Any thoughts & critiques would be most welcomed!
<BR>
