<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;"I stick my finger into existence- it smells of nothing"</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Nicole...
<BR>
<BR>I cannot say, for lack of knowledge, that I know who or what wrote the quote, nor can I say that I have a firm grasp on its original intented meaning...but I will try a stab at it.
<BR>
<BR>Seemingly, it is a nihilistic quote because mainly of the no-thing attribute to existence.  For if existence were to have qualities such as smell as the author believes it should, or even sight, feel, sound, etc., and since it doesn't have the attribute of smell, then a nihilistic approach seems salient.
<BR>
<BR>Let's try an analogy...and this hasn't been thought out diligently, so it may not work, but let's try anyway shall we?---
<BR>
<BR>Let's parallel existence to strawberry jam.  I have in front of me, hypothetically, a jar of strawberry jam.  It is existence.  The reason I use a physical model to represent existence is because for something to smell it should be of material matter...no?
<BR>
<BR>Ok, I'm looking at my strawberry jam and I'm contemplating the meaning of jam.  What does it mean to be jam?  What are the qualities of jam?  I see that it is red in color, it is translucent, it makes no sound by itself (unless shloped with a spoon), I cannot smell it from far away, so to get a better smell, I am going to stick my finger in it...
<BR>
<BR>I stick my finger into the jam...
<BR>
<BR>It's gushy.  I pull out my finger and I sniff it...it smells like strawberries!  And sweet sugary strawberries at that too!  I like this jam, I will want to make it a sandwich!
<BR>
<BR>Ok, now let's go back to where I stuck my finger into the jam.  I stuck it in, it feels gushy, I pull it out, I sniff my finger.  It smells of nothing.  I smell nothing, it has no smell, it isn't exciting my senses at all, I'm feeling no need to taste it, endure it, make it into a sandwich...it isn't pleasant to me at all, nor is it unpleasant, its just...nothing.
<BR>
<BR>So, to say that after sticking my finger into existence and it smells of nothing, would be to say that I experience living, it does not excite me, I am not impressed.  Possibly I am disappointed at its nothingness qualities and I am stuck with it as long as I continue to exist.
<BR>
<BR>Add or take away whatever you wish from my analysis, granted it isn't a complete analysis but I hope it will give you a better grounding to start your own thoughts about the quote...
<BR>
<BR>Write me if you wish to talk about it...or anything else philosophically.
