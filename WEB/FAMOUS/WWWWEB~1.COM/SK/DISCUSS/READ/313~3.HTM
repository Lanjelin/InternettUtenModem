<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Where is the long treatment of "blessed is he who is not offended in me"?  I'm not familiar with it. I'd love to read it and conjecture.</I></FONT>

<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Second question, re Brown's exegesis -- It seems to proceed from an assumption that 1st century Palestine had a greater concern with background biographical data than I can believe.  For example, I can accept the argument that Matthew generally wanted to show Jesus as the fulfillment of Hebrew messianic prophecy, and therefore took support from Isaiah's teaching that a "virgin shall be with child."  This seems in line with the cultural concerns of the time  like the Essene community's focus on the Apocalyptic tradition (with an emphasis on exactly the fulfillment of messianic prophesy).</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>***Well, as for 1c palestine's concerns with biography, here's a few:  there are passages where Jesus' audience questions the reality of Jesus' preaching by saying things like "don't we know this guy?  Isn't he the carpenter's son?"  There is another where the audience retorts "at least we were not born illegitimate" (or something like that;  I regret I cannot cite the verse, but will try to later if need be.)  As  for concerns with illegitimacy, Brown is not the first exegete to delve into the rumor's possible impact on Matthew.  (Brown has a fuller discussion in his "The Birth Of The Messiah,"  Anchor Doubleday.)
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But who is the community that need to hear an explanation for an early birth in another town, in the 1st century?  Brown's suggestion seems to assume transmission of discrete biographical data across distance (Bethlehem to Nazareth and on to Jerusalem and beyond)  and time that I don't buy.  The idea that Matthew was acting as a revisionist on a discrete body of biographical data seems anachronistic -- I don't believe Matthew would care.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>***Well, as for transmitting information over space and time, many believe that Matthew's gospel was written a generation or two after Jesus' life, and that it was written after Paul's epistles (which were doing a pretty good job of communication, too)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Does Brown think the Wise Men were cobbled up to explain why Jesus was the beneficiary of foreign contributions to his cause?</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>***Perhaps not cobbled up, but they seem to fit Matthew's theme of Jesus acceptance by the gentiles (as represented by the wise men) vs. rejection by the Jews (as represented by Herod wanting to snuff 'im out)
