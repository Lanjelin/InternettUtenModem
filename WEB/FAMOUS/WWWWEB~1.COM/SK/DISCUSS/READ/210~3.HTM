<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;    I believe in happiness, as in life, liberty, etc.  But is it OK to sacrifice truth in exchange for happiness?  There are all sorts of happy thoughts -- everything from Hobbits to UFOs to ESP -- that have little basis in fact.  And yet believing in these things seems to add a poetry  to life that is otherwise lacking.  But maybe that's enough.  We imagine Don Quixote to be happy in his obliviousness to the real world.  As a purely personal preference, I find it hard to foment credulity for the sake of happiness.  If there is a God, I believe he would like us to use our god-given powers of understanding rather than simply capitulate to a belief system merely because it is most apt to produce happiness.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>     Your post seems to have brought us full circle.  This "thread" began with a discussion of whether there has to be an objective, historical basis for Christian faith.  You raise the same issue regarding the absolute.  I agree that if there is a God, faith does not exist in conflict with reason, and facts will not reveal faith to be false.  The quandary, then, is to identify what must be real to support faith.
<BR>
<BR>The question of the absolute raises similar questions, perhaps because it is related to the problematic issues of the nature of reality and the existence of the divine.  The Absolute, it has always seemed to me, is really SK's code word for a unique and individual knowledge of God (which TV evangelists have vulgarized as a "personal relationship with Jesus").  I'm not sure, by the way, whether SK conceptualized God as a person, necessarily.
<BR>
<BR>But SK clearly thinks a personal relationship with the Absolute is possible -- or that a single individual can enter into an absolute relation.  He also tells us, through the myth of Abraham, that a really personal relationship is not going to be based on universally applicable rules, although the relationship will be Absolute.  I think I understand this idea, in some small measure, and why it is linked to the spiritual position that SK calls faith.
<BR>
<BR>Faith in God, or faith in the existence of an absolute, can't require us to shut our eyes to reality -- for the simple fact that faith is belief in a relationship.  If we say we have faith, but really our only relationship is with a mental construct of our own, we havn't got faith, we've got a delusion.
<BR>
<BR>A sane person seeking faith, then, is required (I think) to care very much about whether his/her faith is in something that really exists.  And that is why your last post brings us full circle -- raising again the question of what the ground of faith must be.
