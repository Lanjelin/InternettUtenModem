<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I was speaking of "moods" in the sense of those ramdom emotions arising essentially from our personal biological circumstances.  In a rough sense, I am referring to those moods we experience because of our accidental historical, bio-chemical, and genetic make-up.  These are moods that we experience as given to us rather than that we create or make.  As random, these emotion would be not understandable, by definition.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I think one of the focuses Kierkegaard had was that he tried to precisely distinguish between different emotions.  He did this in part based on a view that our life circumstances are essentially random or contingent, and that our accidental circumstances includes a set of given emotional states which are peculiar to each of us personally.  The distinction to be made between moods, then, he made based on the type of response we would each make to these random circumstances.  And in the ethical and religious, as opposed to the esthetic, the response to changing life circumstances is that the individual will be unchanging; that he will be resolved to hold fast to that which he has committed to.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;For example, Judge William was ethically committed to his wife.  In this, he recognized completely the contingent nature of his first love for her: perhaps when they met the light was right, his mood happened to coincide with hers, she might of unconsciously reminded him of someone else he loved or respected.  But in any case, the original circumstances do not matter to him now, for he has committed to her.  And this committment means not just to hold onto a legal relationship, but to hold onto his original mood, his original love of her.  Thus, even if she changes, even if she becomes someone different then she was when he married her, as so often happens in a marriage, he will affirmatively hold fast to his original love, now and forever.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In his journal entries, K stated that he might write about what he called "the most beautiful and noble, humanly speaking, forms of despair ... "  One of these forms was grief.  I puzzled over this for a good while.  Why grief?  What is it about grief that makes it so much higher than other human emotions?  I now think it relates to the point I just made.  Suppose, for example, that Judge Williams wife died.  What would happen to his commitment to hold onto his original mood, his original love for her?  Well, his commitment would still remain, but the content would change to grief.  It is precisely the fact that he maintains the commitment to remember his love of her that makes him grieve.  Grief is the emotion which remembers a lost loved one, not just as a memory, but as one who was treasured, and still is in the remembrance.  And so, Judge William, who committed to love her forever, will now, if he is true and unchangeable in that committment, grieve for her.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I think the poetic moods you are referring to K would categorize as esthetic-ironic in nature.  He seemed to have a strong sense of the power of the poet to take his own random, accidental life circumstances and moods and idealize them into a recollection which not only made him able to communicate his personal insights to others, but also made his moods capable of being maintained or repeated at will.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But I go on too long.  I hope some of this makes sense.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;A technical question: when I type these posts, each paragraph is one long sentence across the page.  My postings are formatted correctly, so it must be my browser.  What am I doing wrong?  I am using Nescape 2.0.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>I will respond to your last item first so as to let you know
<BR>that I have read your entire letter with great detail and
<BR>attention.  I don't quite understand your question.  If they
<BR>are formatted correctly, then what exactly is the problem when
<BR>you indicate "...it must be my browser..."?  (Feel free to reply
<BR>to this agenda via e-mail so as not to abuse the forum;  However,
<BR>in a short note, I use a curser return deliberately at each sentence (about 64 characters long) so as to control the formatting.  What
<BR>you see when reading an "already posted post" as opposed to reading
<BR>that same post in "response mode" is a matter of how the browser
<BR>and/or web site formats full strings of text in "reading mode" and
<BR>then again in "response mode."  That is why I deliberately use a
<BR>curser return at the end of each sentence, which, however, is
<BR>cumbersome when writing off line.)
<BR>
<BR>Now please take this as a heartfelt reply:  You speak of the
<BR>emotions, at least in my mind, as if you are speaking of greek
<BR>or chinese (neither of which I know) or as if you are speaking
<BR>of advanced chemistry or higher mathematics (neither of which
<BR>I am minutely versed in either).  Your relationship, or should
<BR>I say description, is totally foreign to me.  But please don't
<BR>expound further, for I am NOT contesting your view or your mental
<BR>mode of construction here.
<BR>
<BR>Given (moods) verses created or made, which results from
<BR>accidental historical, bio-genetic, and genetic make-up
<BR>sounds not only strangely artificial, but it also sounds
<BR>like a superficiality contrived means to explain what one
<BR>being is unable or unwilling to fruitfully live/relive within
<BR>him/herself.  Without defying or denying a broad-minded
<BR>scientifically based credence to the manifestation of myriad
<BR>streams of consciousness, of which moods are indeed not a small
<BR>part, where is the capacity to fathom, feel, and to be illumined
<BR>by the innumerable intricacies of the soul?  I don't think you
<BR>will find this in the science books, yet there is a plethora of
<BR>"information" (poor choice of word) by which these evanescent
<BR>subtleties can be more thoroughly and humanly explained (or should
<BR>I say lived?).
<BR>
<BR>For one thing, the "spirit of the poet" has more to offer than
<BR>a mere codification or the ability to "take his own random,
<BR>accidental life circumstances and moods and idealize them
<BR>into a recollection..."  The poet imbues feeling with the
<BR>intimate livingness of being, and not for him/herself, but
<BR>for his readers, too, if he is indeed a true poet.
<BR>
<BR>What is "given" is a matter of bio-chemical, physical, and
<BR>temporally based ingredients animated by flame or spirit.
<BR>Neither the former or latter alone (or even together) can
<BR>fully define the ontology of the human species, let alone
<BR>being, but the latter is the essence of the field from which
<BR>the former has its provenance, hence a more in-depth,
<BR>picturesque panorama of the human subject in question.  
<BR>
<BR>What we "create and make up" is another visceral realm
<BR>from which a material study alone will never suffice,
<BR>especially and specifically because it engenders the
<BR>arena of mind, will, intellect, and imagination, together
<BR>with bio-chemical and physical make-up.  With respect to
<BR>"moods," no fine line can be drawn here, nor should one be:
<BR>Moods are what we feel and hopefully understand by "living
<BR>them"; they, the moods, are not digested or fathomed, whether
<BR>random or contingent (this is another writing), by the
<BR>banal means of this or that of the trite psychologies alone.
<BR>And they communicated to others best within the realm of
<BR>aesthetics, meaning the poetics of being: The moods are most
<BR>definitely understandable whether random or contingent.  My
<BR>research (literary endeavors) bears witness to this most
<BR>definitively.
<BR>
<BR>I will not argue Kierkegaard's views here, but merely attest
<BR>to what has been lived through the life of my being.  But do I
<BR>hear you espouse the direct relationship of random to the
<BR>aesthetic and contingent to the ethical or religious
<BR>(paragraph 2)?
<BR>
<BR>Put Judge William aside for a moment.  Tell me about YOU!
<BR>What are your personal experiences concerning YOUR contingent
<BR>moods that are unchanging?  What have you lived here that I
<BR>may learn from?
<BR>
<BR>Kindly site for me K's journal entries concerning ..."forms
<BR>of despair ..." (paragraph 4).  "What is it about grief that
<BR>makes it so much higher than other human emotions?" you ask.
<BR>Then you continue, "Suppose, for example, that Judge William's
<BR>wife died...."  No! I will not suppose.  Tell what YOU know
<BR>of grief.
<BR>
<BR>Without having truly grieved in terms of the loss of a living,
<BR>loved mate, I grieve deeply for loss of full Self, yet this
<BR>grieving is not unchangeable -- not because it is a random or
<BR>contingent mood, but rather because of the dynamic nature of
<BR>being.  Am I correct? wrong?  Is this a contingent mood or random
<BR>one?  It is ethical/religious or aesthetic?  Does this coincide
<BR>with Judge William or must I really lose a true, life-long love
<BR>to "learn" or live this as you describe it?  I know only what I
<BR>have lived and feel what I have lived -- hence share the feeling
<BR>of "mood" through the scribe of poetry, not science.
<BR>
<BR>"But I go on too long.  I hope some of this makes sense."
<BR>No.  You have not gone long enough.  Yes, it makes sense,
<BR>but not reverie.
