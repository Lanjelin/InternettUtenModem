I don't know how much of this thread you have read, but I would like to say something here:
<BR>
<BR>It is Mr. Paproski who seems to hold to the belief that we continuously live in that 1/30th of a second, not I.  He likes existentialism and zen and talks about no distinction between subject and object... all of these I take as paraphrases for what we were talking about earlier -- that "pure experience".  
<BR>
<BR>It is indeed paradoxical to talk of an intersection between the subject and the pure untainted experience, to talk about bringing the subject together with this pure experience, and then also hold that the very intersection taints the pure experience -- thisis indeed confusing hwen the entire point of the meeting was to bring the subject and this pure experience together, something thta now appears, in strict terms, impossible.
<BR>
<BR>You, I think, follow and appreciate this difficulty -- while Mr. Paproski has thrown caution to the wind and presents the magical Subject/Object union with reckless abandon. 
<BR>
<BR>And now, you say that Mr. Paproski's idea of continuously living in that magical moment (pure experience; subject object in eternal union) is to brilliant to ignore-- well, okay -- but it suprises me a great deal to hear you say that.  
<BR>
<BR>Now, having go that off my chest, I can return to my questions.. in your treatment of the "magic moment in a reverie",  is the memory a memory of the intersection?
<BR>If yes, then , this memory (rephrased "re-presentation"), is it really indistinguishable from the "original presentation"?  This original presentation -- this is the intersection we talked of earlier, right?
<BR>
<BR>If I am following, you are asking if memory is as real as the first experience -- well, maybe in the case of severe trauma(sp) patients (and maybe Sarte and the like worked very hard their entire lives to achieve severe trama), but even in the case of severe trauma I suspect the memory must be a bit less real thatn the original; and if it is not, if when the recollection is over the victem cannot again referece where he is in time and make a distinction between what is going on in his own head and the reality of everyone else, then, I am afraid, he gets locked up, he ends up in a hospital retained against his will, either that or he retires into the forest in quiet seclusion and perfect bliss a la Rousseau...   
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>That part about the infinate only shows up when you enter into the mirrors -- that is a wonderful observation.  And please tell me the titles of these books by Casidy -- I would like to look at his experiments -- are they good reading?
<BR>
<BR>And is the fixed point the archimedean point?  I have heard it said that the Greeks could not concieve of a fixed point -- that the point is a thoroughy modern conception.
<BR>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;What is memory, and where is the magic moment in a reverie?  Memory isn't the magical 1/30th second, because the storage is entirely subjective.  But it is the magic moment because its storage is of the objective past (engulfed in subjectivity -- all right, Mr. Cortese, LARDED over with subjectivity), and because the re-presentation is indistinguishable metaphysically from the presentation that causes it.  Is memory then an illusion of the objective?  A new objective?  Subjective?  Dove sia?  Dove sia?  Nessuno sa.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Hume struggles with this idea, Sartre struggles with it, and so does Cassidy (of the Merry Pranksters).  Hume cobbles up a distinction without a difference to explain that the objective/subjective divide (he uses other words which I forget) depends on whether the external thing is really happening.  But he forgets to consider for whom a thing happens and what "really" means.  Sartre uses a mirror analogy -- place an object between two mirrors so that they create an infinite series of images, and look at the reflections.  Where is "reality"? It's both obvious and impossible to say.  (The mirror is interesting, because the only way to see the infinite reflection is to enter the picture oneself -- something JPS apparently ignores).  Cassidy decides that he is always popping along just behind _NOW_ and tries all sorts of experiments to bring himself closer to the absoute instant of experience.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;There doesn't seem to be a now, or a distinction between subject and object that we can confortably point to.  And yet we know these things when we see them.  None succeed in slaying this giant.  Shall we embrace nihilism and decide that All is One, that the Atman is the Brahma?  Or do we become playful like Nietzsche and hint at what we cannot express?  Or accept Wittgenstein's suggestion that whereof one cannot speak, thereof we must be silent?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;There is one escape it seems to me -- find a Definer.  Find a fixed point, or a primum mobile, an Absolute, from which the meaning of terms can be determined.  The difficulty here is that the exercise is meaningless, (oh, I think you guessed it) UNLESS THE FIXED POINT "really" EXISTS.  Can we never get ourselves loose from these shackles, Mr. Cortese?</I></FONT>
