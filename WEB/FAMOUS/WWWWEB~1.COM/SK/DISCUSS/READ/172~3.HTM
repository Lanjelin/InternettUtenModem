<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I have a question concerning the role of the historical in Kierkegaard's Christian faith.  Actually, I am attempting to write a paper on it and would like some feedback.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;To what extent is it necessary for a Christian to affirm the historical narrative?  </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>. . . .  Some say that it is not necessary to affirm that the Christ event actually occurred at all.  All that is needed is to internalize the meaning that you gain from the story as a story ultimately about yourself.  . . . .  [I]f faith entails belief in the content (historical), how can it avoid the results of critical and historical scholarship?
<BR>
<BR>___________________
<BR>
<BR>     SK's conceptual separation of the universal from the absolute seems to put SK's "faith" beyond the argument that the objective reality of the Christ event is irrelevant to Christian belief.  You surprised me when you said you think SK's faith requires belief even if the external facts on which faith is predicated were proven false.  I would be interested to know from where in SK's writings you draw that conclusion.
<BR>
<BR>    In my response here, I am going to borrow Walker Percy's vocabulary (yes, I know -- it's like citing Will Durant to explain Plato).  I think SK sees the life of Christ as a piece of news. It is an account of a single, unrepeatable event, that is difficult (maybe impossible) for us to verify now.  But this does not mean, I don't think, that the accuracy of the news account is beyond SK's concern.  I think SK is so focused on the contact of the single individual with the absolute, that the importance of the initial news (not its accuracy) is of less concern to him.  An individual in relation with the absolute quickly enters an unreportable state, like Abraham in Fear and Trembling.  He has an experience that is beyond becoming news, that is not susceptible of being shared (universalized), and this absolute experience is the goal and core of faith.
<BR>
<BR>   The fact that the relation to the absolute supplants the relation to the universal does not, I believe, vitiate the value of the universal.  I don't think SK carefully considered the possibility of discovering Christ's bones in a tomb in Jerusalem (that preoccupation seems to have developed post-SK, as a reaction to form criticism's demonstration that much of the Bible is not intended to be historical, and that much of what is is mistaken), but if SK had considered this particular risk, I do not think he would have brushed it aside as irrelevant.  In another instance where the Bible's accuracy had been impeached, SK did find a way to work with (or around) the gap.
<BR>
<BR>     The historical accuracy of another piece of news, Adam's first sin had already been questioned in SK's time.  In his discussion of original sin (the book in translation has "Anxiety" in the title and "Psychology" in the subtitle,but it's been a while and I've forgotten), SK did not, however, fall back on the claim that we could know the universal from a false set of news-type information --  I hope you'll pardon my unkind summary of the claim that Christ's corpse wouldn't affect the value of our Christian faith.  
<BR>
<BR>    SK, instead, effectively ignored the legend of the Fall (the false set of news-type information), and constructed a Christian theory of sine based on the universal.  You may argue that he would have been able to do the same with the Christ narrative, but I think the fact that he did not is important, and indicates his belief in its accuracy.
<BR>
<BR>   Based on SK's handling of the myth of the Fall and his dependence on historical narrative in other writings, it seems that he was alive to the importance of the veracity of the pieces of news on which we base faith or belief in the world.  If you're not ashamed to quote Walker Percy in a paper (I used him, with good results, in a law school essay on copyright, so try him in philsophy), take a look at his non-fiction.  There are two books of essays, one called Lost in the Cosmos, which is too precious for academic use, and a better one, the title of which I have, of course, forgotten, in which WP discusses the importance of the accuracy of news, a view which he apparently drew from SK.
<BR>
<BR>   I would appreciate it if you tell me the source of your impression that SK doesn't care about the objective accuracy of the death and resurrection accounts.
