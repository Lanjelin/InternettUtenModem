<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>Faith is an inward commitment rendered unto Jesus the man, as God Himself.  Jesus as a man is/was certainly an objective fact, and as a man is as factual as any other person is.  But Jesus as God is in no sense objectively determinable or factual.  That determination is and must be done faithfully, not factually.  Again, this would coincide more nearly with your definition of subjective facts as it relates to the one rendering faith.  Jesus is certainly unique, and would thereby constitute a particular fact within your definition, but His uniqueness in this respect derives from His claim to be God.  Thus, the essential thing in this "particular fact" is the decision to believe or disbelieve Him.  The decision to believe Him is precisely the commitment of faith, and we are back to a subjective activity rather than an objective fact as the ground of the situation.</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;SK says somewhere that faith, rendered correctly, yields its own object.  I think in this statement he is implicitly contrasting faith to an ethical commitment which yields the actuality of the person who is acting ethically, but not the actuality of the object that is his telos.  If so, then faith would seem to be more correctly termed personal and subjective than objective or objectively-derived.</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>I agree that the occurrence of faith is a matter only within the subject.  However, the actuality of the object that is the faithful person's telos, and the particular fact of the Incarnation (which notifies one _Who_ precisely that telos is) are the objective facts that must be accurate for faith to have a context and a meaning.  For example, this Sunday I attended a service where the minister declared that the God of Isaiah is not "her God."  She went on to define the parameters of a deity which met with her approval.  All this is well and good, I think, but only so long as there are no deities to be offended.
<BR>
<BR>If there is a deity -- if there is a real End to all ends, a real Christ Who whips moneylenders and chastises Pharisees,but forgives repentant tax collectors and loves Paul enough to knock him blind off his ass -- then an incorrect apprehension of that deity is fatal.  A relationship with real people depends on understanding and accepting them as they _are_.  I have to love my wife or not love her -- I can't make my life easier by deciding to define my wife as only those traits I approve of.  If I want a relationship with my friend who listens to me patiently, I have to accept the relationship with my friend who drives me crazy with her endless telephone calls.  I do not have the freedom to say, "The woman who makes long phone calls is not the wife I love."  Likewise, my refusal to accept God will only prevent me from having a relationship with the real God.  I will be worshipping an image of God that doesn't comport with reality (a small sort of idolatry).
<BR>
<BR>It is only if there is no real God that we can live without Fear and Trembling.  Then we can pick and choose the hygenic aspects of Deity -- the Disney version of the Divine, where glowing sunsets hang beind every cross, and Jesus comes with the skin shade we most prefer among our friends'.
<BR>
<BR>In Christianity, however, the God we are offered presents us with the scandal of particularity.  God has a personality, God has a particular way of doing things and acting.  God expressly prohibited work on the sabbath, apparently never said a word in favor of free self-expression, or ever invited criticism.  We live in Fear and Trembling not only because we might not perceive God accurately (the firt vulnerability of the singularity of the Incarnation), but also because we may find we don't like God.
<BR>
<BR>This second vulnerability of particularity, that we might not like the God we get, is an insight SK made use of in explaining the Absolute.  The knight of faith also suffers the scandal of particularity -- what Abraham is called to do is, after all, a terrible crime (unless he has really been told to do it by Someone who has authority to suspend the universal).  God (and the Absolute) might be shocking -- God's incarnation looked and spoke a certain way, maybe even wasn't very handsome, maybe spoke annoyingly slow or too fast.
<BR>
<BR>We need these particular characteristics, though, if our relationship to an ultimate telos (which we call faith), is going to be absolute or personal.  If faith is a relationship we have only with those parts of God that we find resonating in ourselves, the relationship is merely unversal, since we will each worship the things in ourselves that we are taught to admire.  A subjective faith leaves no one to demand admiration and worship of the particular traits of the one who calls the Christian or pulls the knight of faith into the absolute.  Faith of this sort will not create radical change in the individual.  Under these circumstances, there is no New Life in Christ.
<BR>
<BR>Does anyone believe that a faith primarily directed to subjectively chosen ends, which does not need a real, external goal to give it meaning can be life-changing, and not merely self-serving?  If so, how do you know that it isn't best to be self-serving?
<BR>
<BR>Let me ask a similar set of questions, more central to my real concerns, using the Christian structure as context:  Can you have a Christian faith if Christ didn't preach "the meek shall inherit the earth" and if He didn't really rise from the dead?  Wouldn't the negation of these few external, objective and particular facts call into doubt (indeed defeat) one's belief that kindness is better than conquest, and that we can live forever?  And if you can have a Christian faith on such terms, what is its benefit (other than its pain-killing effect)?  If your faith won't _really_, literaly save you from death, what do you want it for?
