Mr. Tillett,
<BR>
<BR>I was asking Mr. Dean about a particular sentence in his post and he refered me to you with great deference.  The first two paragraphs of your post seem to be addressing the very sentence that I was confused by. 
<BR>------------------------
<BR>Here is the sentence I was confused by...
<BR>Mr. Dean:  "the realm of the subjective begins at the intersection of objective facts with a human consciousness, and so creates some confusion". 
<BR>
<BR>And, this is what I think addresses my confusion...
<BR>Mr. Tillett:  "...you are to some extent treating subjectivity as analogous/similar to personal opinion or belief.  Taken in this way, however, I think subjectivity becomes merely sub specie objectivity, as one pole of an objective experience: those objective facts which are not very amenable to substantiation or proof to another person (because they are in our own heads, derive from our particular perspective, etc.) in contrast to those objective facts which are for all practical purposes universal between people, communicable, provable, etc.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But subjectivity in SK and my response refers to more the early 19th century notion of subjectivity, which in simple terms is whether or not the phenomena derives from an internal positive action of consciousness or an external determination.  SK's work can be seen as a presupposition that the phenomena is both, and also as a working out of the relationship between the two.  Thus, faith is subjective pure and simple, because it is purely derived from the internal passion of a commitment."</I></FONT>
<BR>-------------------------------------------
<BR>
<BR>My confusion did spark from the apparent dissimularity between how SK uses the term subjectivity and how Mr. Dean was using it.  Your drawing a distinction between the two has helped immensely.
<BR>When reading your classification of Mr. Dean's use of subjectivity as "sub specie objectivity" it occured to me that maybe SKs objectivity was "sub specie subjectivity"?  Does this work out?
<BR>
<BR>I think it does.
<BR>
<BR>Mr. Dean and I came up with what I think is a nice image (although I had some trouble convincing him that I was not mocking the simplicity of it, the simplicity is exactly what I like about it), the image of lard, lard that we as human beings automatically slop over the pure objective external world.  Lard being unecessary and wrong, it is what we are tring to do away with to obtain pure objectivity.  Wipe the lard from our glasses to reveal pure objectivity.  ** In other words, lard is analogous with subjectivity, subjectivity that clouds our objective glasses, in other words a subjectivity that is sub species objectivity.  
<BR>
<BR>And now onto SK's idea, 19th century subjectivity.  
<BR>
<BR>First, I am curious about the following terms:  internal positive action of consciousness & external determination.
<BR>
<BR>Here is your definition:
<BR>"...the early 19th century notion of subjectivity, which in simple terms is whether or not the phenomena derives from an internal positive action of consciousness or an external determination."   
<BR>
<BR>  By internal positive action of consciousness are you suggesting that the subject can yield its own object -- that God is only there for the believer; which, on a side note, reminds me of the man who knew God, whom Zarathustra meets in the wood at the begining of the first book; Zarathustra, upon hearing that this Man knows god, quickly yet politely darts away, saying, "I have nothing to give you, but I must leave you quickly, lest I take something from you.")
<BR>   
<BR>And one last thought, if subjectivity sub species objectivity subjugates subjectivity to objectivity (as I tried to show in the first paragraph up above), then does objectivity sub species subjectivity do the reverse?  And isn't this extrememly dangerous a la Don Quijote?  Isn'this what Zarathustra mocks when he hurries passed the abovementioned man in the forest who knows God?   
<BR>
<BR>Sincerely,
<BR>CAry Cortese
<BR>
<BR>P.S. What do you think of the term: "Secular Christian"?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>----------
<BR>** Do you remeber when SK talks of the man who by a miracle came to believe in Hegelianism, a doctrine that makes no room for miracles?
