<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     My point is that the adjective "ethical" doesn't seem</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;to apply when we're talking about god in the Abraham story.  It's not</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Abraham/Isaac story because of its maddening amorality.  For the Christian,</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;it is an unsolveable dilemma.  For me, it shows the complete autonomy</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;of my role as a moral agent in the universe.  I can make up my own mind</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;on matters of right and wrong and don't need the input from some cosmic</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;intermeddler, especially when his ideas of right and wrong are so out of</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;sync with my own.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;      Would (will?) he punish me for such insolence?  Perhaps.  But I'd</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;rather burn than take the life of son.  </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Granted, certainly.  This is certainly a difficult dilemma, one that presents an incredible paradox to the whole Christian understanding of God.
<BR>
<BR>I would say that, had Abraham slew Isaac, it would have been an unsolvable paradox.
<BR>
<BR>But, as it turned out, God truly did not command Abraham to do something that was truly considered "unethical."  Had he truly done so, then he would not have been worthy of the title, God.
<BR>
<BR>But here I think is the point of the story, at least in the Scripture.  It comes as the angel stops Abraham from moving the knife, and God says, "Now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me."  The point was certainly not, and I hope that I didn't give that impression, that some incredibly heinous action becomes good once God commands it.  No, of course not.
<BR>
<BR>But humanity is, as you've pointed out before, working from a very limited perspective.  Let me try this very hypothetical:
<BR>
<BR>You mentioned in a later discussion that there are times when it may be ethical to kill a son.  Now suppose (incredibly hypothetically, of course) that Isaac was, internally, in such agony all he could desire was to die, and God, in pity, wanted Isaac to die.  But for whatever very hypothetical reason, Abraham could not percieve his son's suffering, but he heard God say "Kill your son."
<BR>
<BR>Or another hypothetical would be if God knew Isaac would grow up to be a Hitler, or something worse.  Abraham wouldn't have seen anything ethical in killing his son from that point of view.  But from another perspective, many Jews after the holocost would have seen Hitler's father slaying him at 13 to be an incredibly ethical act.
<BR>
<BR>Yes, of course, this is very hypothetical.  My point is only that, hypothetically, since we are coming from such a limited perspective, we, in doing what is ethical, should trust the direct voice of one who knows all and is all good above our own ideas or perspectives on what "good" or "ethical" is.
<BR>
<BR>The teleological suspension of the ethical, therefore, I might rephrase as the choice to follow one who you know to be truly ethical, rather than follow one's own definition of what ethical is.
<BR>
<BR>But the real issue involved is, are we willing to give up our own point of view and our own sense of control in order  to do what God commands, whether we understand it or no?  
<BR>
<BR>Again, any critiques are most welcomed!
