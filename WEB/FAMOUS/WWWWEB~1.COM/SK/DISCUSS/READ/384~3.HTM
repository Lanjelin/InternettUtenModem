<FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;. . .This thread started with my response to your statement that the Incarnation was more clear to the first-century Palestinians than it is to us. I understood you to mean that it was easier for the first-century Palestinians to believe that Jesus was God than it is for us today, in other words that the leap of faith was easier for them. Is this what you meant? If so, why was it easier? If not, what do you mean by saying that the Incarnation was more clear to first-century Palestinians? </I></FONT>

<BR>Well, I confess I assumed it would be easier, until someone put me in my place by pointing out that SK provided a special category for the apostles, and that Christ kept some secrets from ordinary persons did until after the Resurrection.  I decided not to snivel that SK is cheating by creating a special category for persons who are only different from us accidentally and not substantively -- I foresaw that I could be hoist on that petard, too, since my argument is precisely that accidental differences are (or may be) substantive.  Still, my core point in that post was not to envy first-century Palestinians.  Rather, it was (and remains) to start a conversation on how the particular experiences of life as an em-bodied person affect the ways in which each single individual comes to faith and interprets the demands of faith, and whether those particular differences make it difficult or impossible to talk about faith purely in the realm of the transcendent.
<BR>
<BR>All faith is a response to a call heard in one's own particular life, and the particular lives are clearly different.  Different to see and hear Jesus Christ directly and later find out He claimed to be God.  Different too, to be Augustine of Hippo and hear a voice in the garden bidding him to pick up and read the Bible; or Joan of Arc, who reportedly heard other voices; or Francis of Assisi, who reportedly bore the wounds of the cross.  Still different to find and keep the faith in Vietnam under pain of imprisonment; or to receive faith as a given from your parents and grow up in a town where everybody goes to a Christian church on Sunday; or find faith as a surprise at a tent revival with big-haired preachers where you went against your better judgment.  
<BR>
<BR>The question is not whether one of these has an easier time coming to faith than another.  It is how an em-bodied person involved in a relationship with an Incarnate deity can be called to transcend the realm of the immanent.  Hasn't SK missed a clue -- indeed, hasn't he refused to learn the lesson of the Incarnation?
<BR>
<BR>A priori, without knowledge of the Incarnation, Incarnation gives offense to the pre-faithful and the unbeliever.  Fine.  But after the Incarnation is revealed and an individual awakes to the fact that a leap of faith is called for, it does not necessarily remain offensive if that leap is largely encompassed in the realm of the immanent and fleshly.  SK seems to hold on to the offense of the Incarnation even after the individual has made an act of faith, and thus assumes that the leap of faith is somehow purely transcendent. But the very Deity inviting the leaper to make the leap has revealed Itself uniquely through the immanent, and the intial challenge of faith was to come to terms with this.  
<BR>
<BR>I'm not arguing that from the Incarnation one must understand that the leap cannot escape the immanent.  I am just pointing out that SK presumed that the leap could only to occur in the purest moment of transcendence, and that the immanent was somehow in opposition to the immanent.  This does not necessarily follow in a non-Platonic universe (a post-Paltonic, post-Greek universe, realy) where flesh in no longer corruption, but salvation.  The very offense of Christianity is that Divinity put on Humanity and the all-powerful took on weakness, and thereby sanctified and redeemed it.  Athanasius (of Alexandria, early fourth century, I think) goes so far as to teach that divinity took on humaniuty that humanity in turn might take on divinity.  All this is in direct opposition to the earleir, and consistent, philosophical ordering of the fleshly as lower than the spiritual -- it is a re-valuing of values, as Nietzche would see it.
<BR>
<BR>Not only do we have these strong pro-Incarnational teachings, we also have the unfied Church's express and repeated rejection, in the first seven truly Ecumenical councils, of a variety of teachings which sought to re-assert the priority of the spiritual over the fleshly.  JC was confirmed to really have a body, and really be human, and really to have redeemed the body, and the body was confirmed to be really immortal, and the idea that the human body really wouldn't rise again was also rejected.
<BR>
<BR>SK appears to have wanderd by all this doctrine, picked up the pre-Christian assumptions about the priority of flesh and spirit, and felt no need to explain himself.   SK retains the Platonic/Gnostic assumption that the highest contact with God must somehow happen in the realm of the purely transcendent, away from all the filth and embarrassment of the body, even while attempting to describe the nature of the truest relationship with an affirmatively _Incarnate_ Deity. From one perspective, one could say this is like trying to insist on using Newtonian terms to explain quantum mechanics.  Just as absolute space and ether do not have to be presumed, or even referred to, in order to explain the "spooky action at a distance" of quanta, so the leap of faith does not have to be categorized in terms of immanent and transcendent.  My quibble is, who exactly is making this leap of faith, if not a person, who by definition carries a little lump of the immanent around?  And who is calling for the leap of faith, except the Deity who expressly sanctified the immanent?  And how can the two meet in any context that is unconnected to the immanent, since the experience and its effects will inhere so much in the realm of the immanent?  And won't the facts of the particular life experience of the solely human half of the pair have an impact on the quality of the relationship?  If not, why?
<BR>
<BR>J'accuse -- SK starts _Fear and Trembling_ by mocking the "assistant professors" who have gone "beyond faith" without going _through_ it.  Yet, he has committed a similar mistake himself, defining (assuming) faith as something outside the realm of the immanent, unconnected to particular facts in the life of the single individual. SK conflates (without discussing why) the immanent and the universal, and never addresses the impact of the Incarnation on his assumption that the transcendent does't partake of facts (as opposed to truth).  By going "beyond" the particular facts in his introduction to faith without ever feeling obliged to pass through them, he, like his assistant professors, has missed a step.  My interest is in recalling him to it.
<BR>
<BR>And this is my point -- not whether it is easier to come to faith when you can question the Almighty live and in person, but whether it is different.  At bottom, a positive answer would perhaps indicate favorites in the heart of God.  Maybe Abraham had opportunities I will never have, no matter how much I want them.  But this also is not my immediate point.   The question is whether it has any meaning to say that Abraham made the same leap as the bourgeouis who looks in the window and sees a roast he can't afford, but which he knows will be his; and whether we think that Abraham's call to faith might ever have come through seeing a roast, or the bourgeois might ever be called to sacrifice his son.  The question, also, is whether we can properly acknowledge not only that God is a carpenter's son, but also that the carpenter's son is God.
