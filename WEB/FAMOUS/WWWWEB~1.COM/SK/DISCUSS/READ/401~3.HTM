<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;This is ". . .finitude's despair"; i.e., K. is clearly making a distinction between the true and the false.  At the level of the True (eternity), there is no false; therefore, if there is the not True, it must be something not created by the True -- and what could that be but temporality (finitude).  Also, a very important paragraph appears on page 35 in SUD:</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;"So it is with finitude's despair.  Because a man is in this kind of despair, he can very well live on in temporality [as the opposite of eternity--my note], indeed, actually all the better, can appear to be a man, be publicly acclaimed, honored, and esteemed, be absorbed in all the temporal goals.  In fact, what is  called the secular mentality consists simply of such men who, so to speak, mortgage themselves to the world. . . . ( . . .) themselves they are not; spiritually speaking, they have no self, no self for whose sake they could venture everything, NO SELF BEFORE GOD [emphasis mine</STRIKE>-however self-seeking they are otherwise.  God is Being being Being.  There is no "possibility" in God; also, no necessity--the soul in this world has the task of "becoming itself in freedom"--this implies a letting go of the self that is temporal, mortal, in despair, sinful, etc.--K. is just making it clear that the two (self/Self) cannot coexist just as what is eternal must not include the temporal, as the temporal cannot include the eternal.  It is not just a matter of nomenclature.  God did not create a [temporal] world because that means you have a temporal God who knows death, who dies.  This is logical, says K.  Therefore, it cannot be that a Logical, eternal God be involved in an illogical (despairing), temporal world.  Ergo:  God did not create this world (of physical manifestation which hides the Fact of God through negation).  Does that help?  It does take some working through and there is enormous resistance to this idea because it puts into question the entire meaning of human history, as such.  And we ain't just whistling metaphysics or simply bantering philosophical abstractions here.  If you take K. at all seriously, read him deeply, passionately, you will see that he is among the first to make this implicate tautology, either directly or indirectly.  (More later)</I></FONT>

<BR>I hope I don't just sound dense, but I'm still not following the logic of why an infinite God could not create something less than himself?  I am a personal being which can create (or at least make from pre-existing stuff) something which is not personal, i.e., less than me, so I don't see how God could not make something less than himself.  I would suggest that it *would* be illogical to suggest that God could create something greater than himself, or even something equal to himself (This would imply that he's not truly "God." -i.e., the Ultimate being) But, if given that he can't create something greater or equal to himself, if he also can't create something less than himself, what the heck can he do?
<BR>
<BR>I hope this clarifies my confusion.  I bring this up because this is standard Orthodox Christian doctrine, and this is hardly irrelevent because, whatever else SK may have been, he was extremely committed to the historical and orthodox Christian faith, which held that the infinite God created the finite creation.  K was aware that he was trying to apply the Christian faith to his world, but I simply have doubts that he would have made such a massive break with the tradition he held so vehemently on what was such a foundational point to that tradition.
<BR>
<BR>I looked at the quote you presented and its context in Sickness..., and it is a powerful argument against those who have no real connection against God, but I really don't see the connection of that and the idea that it is impossible that an infinite God created the finite world.
<BR>
<BR>Hope this all helps clarify my confusion.  Until Later!
