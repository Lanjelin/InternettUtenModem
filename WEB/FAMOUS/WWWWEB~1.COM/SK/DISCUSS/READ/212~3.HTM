<BR>"Gear box" , "tool box", so i talk recklessly, and I'm glad you listen recklessly.  Dissentary...  very disturbing.
<BR>
<BR>It would be self contradictory to 'capitulate to a belief system because it is most apt to produce happiness' -- doesn't capitualate suggest less than belief?  And do you think that Don Quijote was chasing dragons because it made him happy?  
<BR>And about fomenting credulity... something is creulous because it is believable.  Believable by others?  Or do you believe?  And how much of others do you hold in yourself?  Quijote apparently didn't hold very much of others in himself if he went off chasing windmills.  But reguardless of how much or how little of others you have in yourself you can only believe what you do believe, capitulation is something different, it seems to contain an implied self when it is a replacement for belief.    But what is believable?  We know its believable because we have reasons to believe it.  But will reasons ever get us there, get us across the gulf, to take SK leap?  REasons bring us closer and closer but never there.  Don Quejote perhaps had his reasons to believe in REALITY, but he never made the leap into it.  Did he not have his reasons?  
<BR>Did Don Quijote know, or think that he knew, something that we did not?  (He must have been disturbed by something?)
<BR>I haven't read Quijote, have you?  Could you tell me if he was disturbed?  To use SK's lingo, was he infinately concerned?
<BR>If so, then I'll stick to my statement, that is that Quijote could get as much out of Wittgensteins toolbox (grear box) as he can get out of all of history -- and I am not saying it is right or wrong, or even that Quijote is sane; all I am sayingis that he has a replacement for "history", he has replaces it with "his own world", a world with no purpose, which spins uselessly, no engaged with the rest of us.
<BR>
<BR>I don't think its a happiness issue, but I may be wrong.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;    I believe in happiness, as in life, liberty, etc.  But is it OK to sacrifice truth in exchange for happiness?  There are all sorts of happy thoughts -- everything from Hobbits to UFOs to ESP -- that have little basis in fact.  And yet believing in these things seems to add a poetry  to life that is otherwise lacking.  But maybe that's enough.  We imagine Don Quixote to be happy in his obliviousness to the real world.  As a purely personal preference, I find it hard to foment credulity for the sake of happiness.  If there is a God, I believe he would like us to use our god-given powers of understanding rather than simply capitulate to a belief system merely because it is most apt to produce happiness.</I></FONT>
