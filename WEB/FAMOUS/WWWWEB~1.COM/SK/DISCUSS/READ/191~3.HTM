<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;   </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Are you saying that you do not see any point to rational discourse?  SK was not altogether anti-rationalist, he was not even against objective truth, not even of the "philosophical" sort.  His project shows that there is a subjective side of tuth, that must be included in the discussion -- at least regarding topics of subjective concern.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Talking objectively about subjective concern!  Wonderful!  Infinate inwardness?
<BR>
<BR>Render to caesar what it Caesar's.  Those who master any area recieve the fruits of their mastery.  Mastering objective truth is one thing to master.  IT has certain rewards, and, of course, certain drawbacks. 
<BR>There are limits.  Where did you get that I thought there was no point to rational discourse?  Did I say that?  Like you said earlier about me, I'm suprised that you could read that into it (unless I said it directly earlier, which in that case I don't remeber sying it because you didn't quote it back to me, and since we are trying to communicate objectively all that I am is what I think you see me as, becasue I am trying to underestand how you understand me so that I can figure out what else you need to know an dwhat I need to correct -- but I am mistaken, becasue this conversation is not about me, butis instead abou this "concrete individual")... 
<BR>Maybe I'm off base on this but it is my impression that Rational Discourse can only be carried on by Abstract people, that in order to talk abstractly you must leave the medium of existence and go into the realm of pure being, you must become abstract (and you do become abstract whether you know it or not), and then you return from pure being with your knowledge and should putit to use in the medium of existence, i.e. appropriate it for concrete individuals -- whoever they are -- I still do not know what a concrete individual is.  CAn he go into the realm of abstraction, or do we leave him behind?  What is he conscious of that the abstract individual is not?  What is the difference between a concrete and an abstract individual?  Could you explain the tension to me?  
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Yes, "concrete individual" is an abstract idea, just as is any idea.  Granted, it is a loaded term.  But what does it signify?  The thing that "concrete individual" signifies is anything but abstract. </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Hmmm...  Insofar as the term concrete individual means something it signifies some number of characteristics that include this and exclude that.  Insofar as it has meaning its a classification.  And isn't that abstract -- a form; when I say chair I mena something but not any particular chair, more I mean the form of a chair, abstract chair; right?  Doesn't this work the same way for concrete individual?  
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Are you against all attempts to theorize about human existence?  It seems to me that the problem is not so much the theorizing, but making sure our theories "jive" with what actually goes on in the world.  Not only that, but many people (I myself am new to this area of discourse) have done work on the relationship between theory and praxis (action oriented towards a goal).  I think this discussion is relevant to Kierkegaard because he is clearly engaging in theory, but he is also concerned with application (especially in his personal life as a pamphleteer). </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>No, I am not against any attempts to theororize about human existence.
<BR>Everyone is constantly theororizing.  For me, its like someone took the lid off that box in my head where the theoroizing goes on and I have been enraptured with trying to figure ou thte goings on ever since.  And moreover in every conversation I try to look in to the other person's box, or at least poke at it... but I digress...  So, the theoroizing, while useless if not appropriated into existence (or maybe it has a potential value if left in the realm of being), the theororizing is not what I am against.  As far as praxis, well, sure, what do you want to do?  What do you do?  How do you do?
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Where does SK fit in?  You are right to point out that he does not believe that one can directly communicate the truth that has decisive significance for an individual.  This is not to say, however, that it cannot be communicated at all.  He has this notion of indirect communication.  Irony and humor are essential elements to this mode of communication.  Certainly SK did not think that one should learn to live with the truth quietly!  That is like saying nothing when a group of 10-year olds ransack your apartment.  There are too many injustices in the world to sit comfortably, self-satisfied with our "truth."</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Subjectivity cannot be taught.  Inwardness cannot be taught.  The existence of any absolute cannot be demonstrated.  "It's not the what but the how."  How do you relate to the absolute?   That's the question.  Now, if I am authentic in my relating, I cannot help but notice that there are a lot of "posers."  The role of irony and humor is to point out inconsistencies in people's thought and lives.  The underlying truth of subjectivity is thereby communicated.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Your reference to Descartes is interesting.  Kierkegaard's beef with him was not that he was too rational; not even that he started with a subjective starting point.  Rather, his "self" was not "imbedded" to use your terms.  Do you agree?  Or do you think that SK, or at any rate we, should be cautious of all attempts to discuss truths about the world which rely on abstract ideas?  Maybe we should be cautious of the "spririt of seriousness" regarding these ideas?  Maybe all our ontological theorizing is not grounded in reality at all -- a postmodern position.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Postmoderns, to say that we are not grounded in reality at all, are trying to be crazy.  They are making a political allience with the schitzofrenics -- who by the way don't really have any essential "medical" problems.  Have you ever watched a documented video of schitzofrenics?  
<BR>
<BR>Descartes not enbedded... hmmm...  Descartes left the world to enter the realm of being, and then when he left his bungalo, he had REASONED to the point that made the reasonable realm of being his birthplace.  Because of this Descartes brings us "the birth of modernity" -- man = abstact man.  
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;What was the original question?  Christian Existentialism?  I don't know if I am getting you right at all, but some of your comments remind me of deeper concerns.  Certainly, some trends within the deconstructionist school try to undercut all of what Western philosophy has been about, including Existentialism.  The jury is still out concerning their lasting contribution, though.  In the meantime, I see nothing wrong with taking Existential themes and relating them to Christianity.  On that level, there is a lot we can talk about.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>YEs, Christian existentialism was the topic now wasn't it.  
<BR>And abou tnot getting me right, and how my comments remind you of deeper concerns -- well, I think that this was SK's greatest contribution, his indirect theory of communication, and emphasis on miscommunication.  You do not get me "right", and I don't get you "right" --  could either of us even get ourselves "right" (well, maybe you could, you write so goddam clearly) -- but by getting each other wrong we make the first step in explaining how to get each other "right", right?  Think of JC's talk about never having results, constantly in the process of understanding, becasue with results you allow the world to cheat by looking at your answers (answers= gettting each other right). 
<BR>I think if these schitzofrentics could talk to SK, or talk to anyone who would employ  his methods of communication -- I really know that Sk's methods of communication would "get through" to some of the mentally ill.  Please note, I am not guaronteeing results. 
<BR>
<BR>And about nothing being wrong about relating existential themes to christianity... well... just nothing, or absolutely nothing?
