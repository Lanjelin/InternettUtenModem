<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;All right, I've gone back to the text, and I have a couple of quibbles with your take on anxiety.  (1) I may, of course, be misunderstanding SK, but he seems to identify, and maybe even equate, anxiety with sinfulness (as opposed to sin itself).  So, if sexual desire is bound up with anxiety, it can't be far from sinfulness.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;(2) More importantly, I think anxiety as pre-awareness of sensuality is dangerous to the value of The Concept of Anxiety, and threatens the coherence of SK's articulated world view.  As discussed in my earlier post, most philosophers from Plato to Nietzsche (and orthodox theolgogy) agree that humanity's consistent tinge of megolomania is its primary failing.  The link to (a) despair and (b) faith is clear if anxiety is grounded in the fear that my will to power (to coin a phrase) is going to be wrongly directed, and despair is my utter failure to choose a direction, or even to be conscious that there is a right direction for my will.  SK, however, says anxiety is primarily a reaction to a *bodily* inclination.  We then have to analogize it to the will (as Mr. Tillett did in his post) to make a coherent link between anxiety and human failing.  This bodily basis for anxiety is disconnected from SK's repeated teachings about human failing as despair, faith as virtue, the universal, the aesthetic, etc.  Anxiety doesn't seem necessarily relevant to despair.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Am I right to think The Concept of Anxiety ends up just being a detour from SK's central teachings like faith and despair, the ones that cropped up every time he set pen to paper?  Doesn't his whole oevre seem to require anxiety to be linked more closely to the will, and specifically the will to power?  Or can anxiety as an essentially bodily experience be integrated into the rest of SK?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Any thoughts on how anxiety as sensuality can be integrated into SK's "central" teachings would be greatly appreciated.  Alternatively, any discussions of why I'm dead wrong, and anxiety should not be susceptible of integration into SK's line of thought in The Sickness unto Death will also be helpful.</I></FONT>

<BR>I have not read the text in some time and do not have time to read it again at this time, so pardon me if I am rather loose in my  references.  But, I do not recall that SK said that anxiety was primarily a reaction to a bodily inclination.  Anxiety does not arise or react to anything; it has no psychological source in the sense that, eg, anger does.  It is a foundational presupposition that explains why Adam (or any member of the human race) would leave a state of innocense and become guilty.  For the concept of anxiety to function as such a presupposition, it has to be in some sense general enough to cover all cases.  Thus, to relate it, either in sympathy with or in a reaction to, something as specific as bodily inclination would be to render it useless as a general explanation.
<BR>
<BR>The presupposition of anxiety is not sin-in-man per se.  It explains the possibility of the choice that might give rise to sin.  God commands Adam not to eat a certain fruit.  In innocense, Adam has no reason to disobey God, which is also to say that assuming a state of innocense, there would be no adequate explanation as to why Adam would disobey such a clear command.  Thus, there must be something else present within Adam as a man per se, which sufficiently explains his subsequent disobediance.  SK puts forward the concept of anxiety, a "sympathetic antipathy and an autopathetic sympathy;" ie an emotion which is a union of opposite forces.  It is a motive force which is essentially ambiguous about an object: God points at the tree of knowledge and says: "Do not eat the fruit thereof."  Anxiety is that factor in Adam which is repelled by the fruit, because of the command, but also attracted thereto, but attracted precisely because Adam was commanded to stay away.
<BR>
<BR>In this way, anxiety produces the situation where there is a choice.  To repeat, in innocense, Adam would have no choice once he hears God's command.  But because he has anxiety, he becomes suddenly aware of a choice: to obey God or not.  The fruit becomes attractive precisely because God has forbidden it; the possibility of choosing against God's command thus becomes a real possibility.  But to choose wrongly is to lose one's relationship with God, and thereby to lose the freedom that one had before the choice to have a relationship with God.  Thus, the fundamental basis of anxiety, SK says, is not fear of any particular object, but the fear of loss of freedom, which is the fundamental fear in every choice.
<BR>
<BR>But  in the story of Adam, the specific fear of anxiety is the fear of the loss of a relationship with God by choosing wrongly.  And therein is at least in part the relationship of anxiety to despair.  The solution to despair, you remember, is that point wherein the subject relates himself to the "power which posits him" ie, to God.  Thus despair is the absence (or rejection) of a relation with God.  Anxiety, on the other hand, is that capacity within the individual which presents the possibility of not having a relationship with God; thus without it, there is no despair, no consciousness of the absence of a relation.  With anxiety, man gains the possibility of despair, but also that which is of supreme value: the power of the freedom to choose between God or himself.  If he chooses himself, he has essentially chosen sensuousness, bodily inclination, and all the other temporal capacities which make up a man, but he also gains despair.
<BR>
<BR>I do not find it easy to proof-read and revise my writing in these entry forms.  I hope the above is not too much of a mish-mash.
