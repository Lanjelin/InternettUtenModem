<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I am sorry not to respond to your post sooner; I have been shut-out of the Webcom server for this forum, apparently, for some reason, longer than the rest of you have.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Your lard metaphor has some merit; it reminds me a bit of Plato's metaphor of the cave: the human personality (subjectivity in our useage)covers up or degrades the pristine clarity of reality objectivity); in Plato's sense, via being chained in a cave, in your useage, via having one's glasses covered over with lard.  Its also reminiscent (to me) of a Kantian perspective: subjectivity imposes its own categorical structures on reality, and thereby closes off any knowledge at all about the things in themselves apart from subjectivity.  Again, there is a sense of a barrier between the self and objectivity, a barrier which feels like it needs to be surmounted.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;However, SK's idea and the 19th Century notion of subjectivity referred to in my post is different from all of this in  at least this respect: subjectivity affects objectivity, but not in a bad sense, but in a higher sense.  In this, subjectivity is something to be attained, rather than something to wipe away or discard.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And in this sense, I think you have a good point in calling SK's objectivity "sub-specie subjectivity."  This is a nice contrast to my formulation of subjective belief or opinion as sub-specie objectivity.  In the latter, one's belief or opinion is denominated as such because it is not amenable to being proven on an objective scale.  Thus, the subjective opinion is held up to the standards of objective criteria and argument, found wanting, and is thereby determined to be a mere "belief."  By the same token, SK's objective knowledge is compared by him to true subjectivity - ie, ethical or religious commitment - and found wanting, and is thereby determined to be (by SK) appoximate, impersonal, and productive of no more than a trivial actuality.  In this he is certainly assigning subjectivity to a higher plain of "knowledge;" and at least by implication is holding it up as something we ought to strive for.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I was not suggesting in my post that the "subject can yield its own object" by an internal positive action of consciousness.  In SK's formulation, the internal positive action of consciousness is an ethical or religious commitment per se.  The object which the commitment relates to in an essential way is not produced by consciousness, but given to it more or less accidentally as an item of interest in temporal existence.  Upon meeting the object in historical time, the personality may be presented with a choice: to commit, or not to commit.  The object is not produced by consciousness, nor is the object altered; rather the commitment is an internal change of the personality.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;"Secular Christian" seems to me to be an oxymoron.  What do you think?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>

<BR> Yes, I am glad to hear you say this, suggesting that subjectivity has its merits.  I was worried I was making an ass of myself; you see, in the above thread, I have been trying to convince Mr. Dean of the importance of lard.  And I feared he was taking offence at my use of so base a term, but I was having difficulty ans was unable to put the idea into another context.  While you are down here writing three or four convincing eloquent and well worded paragraphs, bringing in the famous cave analogy and Kant's noumena to try and give the idea of lard a little dignity, all I find myself saying in the above thread is "lard is good" and "please lets not stop talking about lard".  I'm not ashamed to admit that I had been quite depressed of late, and your posting has cheered me up considerably.
<BR>
<BR>and now a question:
<BR>
<BR>Is Sk's chasm analogous to your barrier between the subjective and the objective?  They appear simular enough -- a barrier that needs to be surmounted, a chasm that needs to be leaped -- both bring together the subjective nad the objective.
<BR>
