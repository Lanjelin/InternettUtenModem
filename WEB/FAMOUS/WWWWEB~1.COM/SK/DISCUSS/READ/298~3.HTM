<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But all existence is given, by definition.  SK's existence</I></FONT>
<BR> category is precisely that which is external to us/our subjectivity,
<BR> given to us, outside of our control.  As such, that things are given
<BR> is not a miracle but a fact/presupposition of our peculiar 
<BR>circumstances.  Your "miracle" category, I think, is not 
<BR>that things are given to us, but that they are given to 
<BR>us as objectively meaningful experiences.  But this is 
<BR>precisely the discussion we are having: is the meaning of
<BR> this  objective thing in the object itself, or is it in 
<BR>my own subjectivity?  And if either is the case, what is 
<BR>the relationship between my subjectivity and objectivity?
<BR>  "Miracle" describes the problem; I do not think it is a 
<BR>solution in a philosophic sense (although it could well be 
<BR>a solution in a personal sense).
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;As above, I think that if things carry the weight of their </I></FONT>
<BR>meaning with them, ie your miracle has occurred, then there 
<BR>is little place left for subjectivity, nor for a sure sense 
<BR>of what would constitute a concrete individual.  Subjectivity 
<BR>becomes a mere accidental receiving  point of an objective
<BR> manifestation.  So too, inasmuch as the meaning of the 
<BR>objective is "outside of us," then we are un-free: we can 
<BR>only accept the inevitable.  But note too that we too are 
<BR>existing.  In this sense, we have an aspect of ourselves which
<BR> is objective to us.  If our own meaning is carried in this 
<BR>objective part of us, then we are un-free with respect to 
<BR>ourselves, also.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Now, the SK formulation is: in contemplation mode (which is the</I></FONT>
<BR> mode we are in in this discussion), any determination of the 
<BR>meaning of an objective given is a subjective approximation.  
<BR>In ethical/active mode, any determination of one's own responsibility
<BR> to an objective given is a subjective certainty.  In the 
<BR>religious/active mode, any determination of one's own 
<BR>responsibility to an objective given is a subjective 
<BR>certainty as a response to a gift from God.  In all of these,
<BR> the relation of subjectivity to objectivity is given, but
<BR> freedom is not lost, or so SK wants to say.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I like your statement that Socrates "was being repelled." </I></FONT>
<BR>This is a neat way of putting it.  SK describes Socrates as
<BR> infinite negativity, which carries the connotation of a 
<BR>totally subjective act on Socrates part.  But in truth, a
<BR> commitment to ignorance seems to have just as much 
<BR>acquiescence to being repelled, as it does to an internal
<BR>subjective commitment.  Whence would come such a negative
<BR> commitment without a clear vision as to that which is being 
<BR>rejected?  This clear vision would be very close to "being repelled."
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But again, in what sense is "miracle" a solution?  </I></FONT>
<BR>In what sense, upon the occurrence of the miracle, is 
<BR>there room for subjectivity?  I do not mean to be obtuse 
<BR>here, so please be patient.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>I apologise for harping so long on a single word.  First it was "lard"
<BR>and now I am doing the same with "miracle".  Both of these words, have
<BR>acted as my archimedean point of departure and have launched me out 
<BR>into our conversation, which has covered quite a bit of ground, and 
<BR>been enjoyable -- and I do not consider you obtuse.  And since you ask,
<BR>I'll try again to explain. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Lard was the problem. Specifically, Mr. Dean wanted to get rid of the 
<BR>lard, he wanted to stop smearing lard on his goggles so that he could
<BR>get a clear view at the objective reality given us. He vehemently 
<BR>wanted to get rid of subjectivity.  And, I think, Mr. Dean, can be said 
<BR>share the same basic desire as the noble man stuck in Plato's cave -- to 
<BR>see the light.
<BR>
<BR>So, in comes the difficulty.  
<BR>
<BR>OK, well, according to the definiton of subjectivity -- that subjectivity
<BR>is the intersection between a consciousness and objective reality 
<BR>-- I came to the conclusion that if consciousness wants to come into 
<BR>contact with objective reality then subjectivity cannot be gotten 
<BR>rid of except by virtue of a miracle. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>The difficulty is in holding that two contradictory sentences are both
<BR>true -- that is, the difficulty is precisely the paradox (as you 
<BR>have already pointed out in your last post), its paradoxical that this 
<BR>can happen -- and to solve the difficulty would be a "miracle".
<BR> 
<BR>    
<BR>So, according to our text, we are in agreement -- "the miracle" is
<BR>a problematic solution to the problem of lard.  
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>>What is </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>>the relationship between my subjectivity and objectivity?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>>"Miracle" describes the problem; I do not think it is a </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>>solution in a philosophic sense."  </I></FONT>
<BR> 
<BR>So, maybe you have already presented it and I have accidentally 
<BR>looked passed it -- is there an unproblematic solution to be found?
