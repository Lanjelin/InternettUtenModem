<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Fascinating thoughts.  I am somewhat familiar with the concept that Matthew "invented" the virgin birth to defend against Jesus illigitamcy.  (Of course, I've always wondered that if Matthew knew about Jesus illigitimate birth & thought this was a real problem, why'd he figure this guy was a Messiah?  But I digress...)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I truly don't think that SK would have thought of an illigitimate birth as a grounds for "offense."  I only find this the case because SK had much too high a view of Scripture to conclude that it would have had such erroneus information.  (SK's thoughts on Scripture have been examined by Dr. Rosas and Dr. Emmanuel in recent books comparing SK & his thoughts on Revelation/Scripture)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;What I WOULD find interesting, however, is the thought that the miraculous nature of the birth itself may have been a point of offense to some.  In "Practice in Christianity" if I remember right, SK makes two major categories of offense, one of which would have major problems with a simple man having claims to deity.  I agree that many people at the time may have claimed that Jesus had been illigitimate (hence Matthew's choice to include this virgin birth story as an explanation [not to imply he made it up]) because they were too offended to accept the idea that his birth had been a miraculous incarnation.  They were offended that anyone could have been said to have had a virgin birth, and hence, they would rather point to Jesus having had an illigitimate birth than admit that he had divine & eternal origins.  (This may be similar to Brown's approach.)  Let me know what you think.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I can accept the possibility that SK would not have 'doubted' scriptural discussion, and so would not have included illegitimacy as a potential cause for our being offended.  I am afraid I have too little time to explore SK's thoughts completely on my own, and must rely on your contributions to this thread, as well as those of other contributors (what a long thread it has been, and very helpful).
<BR>
<BR>I am also not an authority on current "historical Jesus" writings, either, although I have read a lot here, and may be able to offer something...  Brown and Jos. Meier (and probably others) do not think that Matthew invented the nativity story himself, but set down extant traditions of the time.  And as to whether a virgin birth was cause for offense, that's not the feeling that I get from what I've read:  from what I've read, early Christianity began as a sect/cult <EM>within</EM> Judaism of the day, and was the target for criticism by other Jews.  (Some point to chronological trends in the way Jews are represented in the Gospels as a way of describing early Christianity's defense against the criticism of other Jews.)  But I must stop myself from digressing, too.  It sounds, from the orthodox RC books I've been reading, that stories of illegitmiacy may have grown out of offense that someone referred to as the Messiah left the Romans in power.  An added complaint, if you will.
<BR>
<BR>To your point that a virgin birth itself might be a cause of offense:  in a number of his books, Brown cautions against an <EM>a priori</EM> rejection of miracles from a predisposition that miracles (such as curing lepers, raising the dead, and virgin births0 <EM>do not happen</EM> and therefore God did not enact them.  Brown seems sensitive to the possibility of the God in man being an offense to us, even if he does not put it in SK's terms.
