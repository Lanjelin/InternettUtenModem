Do we, p'rhaps, employ an obtuse/verbose vernacular with it's own technical terms and references, masquerading as insight?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>     It is an interesting suggestion that we want to hear something from god to relieve our own personal responsibilities for our lives, which is in some ways the appeal of the Abraham story -- that we can be in situations where the situation is out of our hands ("Hey, I only work here, only following orders, etc.").</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>     Still, I do think of viewing god or encounters with god as an encounter with the unknowable to be incoherent.  (But then, there are those who seem to relish incoherence.)  Even the word, "unknowable," is to trick ourselves into thinking we understand something just becuase we have a word for it (e.g., "infinity," "omniscience," "omnipresent," etc.).  These words really do not have meaning, at least in the sense that the usual forms of conversation have meaning.  I can comprehend that certain things are really hard to understand; but "unknowable" is simply not intelligible; it is, as Wittgenstein says, a claim to map out the boundaries of coherent discourse by stepping beyond that boundary.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>>     Or, in yet another pregnant Wittgensteinian phrase, "a bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language;" it is language gone on a holiday.  And while I appreciate poetic ejactulations, I think there are losses of meaning and, therefore, lapses in discourse that make understanding more difficult.  Or, as another of my dumb professors once said:  "I can't read poetry because I always find myself looking for support for the assertions."</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	"The unknowable is intelligible by uncanny means."?  As usual Tony, you send me scurrying for the dictionary; not that Webster is an authority on the arcane vocabularies of us savants, but it is perhaps a good place to start.  </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>1.  Don't scurry for the dictionary; scurry for the territory of your
<BR>own mind.  Language is your servant, not your master.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Unknowable: Not knowable; esp : lying beyond the limits of human experience or understanding.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Unknown: Something that requires discovery, identification or clarification</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Intelligible: Capable of being understood or comprehended.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Uncanny: Being beyond what is normal or expected.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	(Advenient, I must report, does not appear to be a recognized term.)</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>2.  Recognized by whom? our ancestors or by the next generation?
<BR>They always manage to change language.  What happened to latin?
<BR>Did it not fit the expansion of thought?
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	Once again, I have to say that what is unknowable is just plain unknowable.   I think the word you're groping for is "unknown," since this at least allows us to talk about something OUT THERE that is currently under-wraps, but may, if we reach a certain state of enlightenment, be discovered, identified or clarified.  And, certainly, many sojourns into the unknown have come through "uncanny means," although I think it is open to question whether the means itself is not what shapes our sense that we've "discovered" something.  (I'm thinking paradigm shift, or perhaps even the phenomenon McLuhan (in perhaps his only memorable sound bite) described in the oft-quoted phrase: "The medium is the message.").</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>3.  Again, don't ask Mcluhan; ask yourself.  What would YOU like
<BR>to discover with thought or being?
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	I suppose what you're talking about is mystical states, and, once again, I'll buy the notion that there are insights available that are incommensurate with language.  But I do not think those insights can rightly be said to be "unknowable" although perhaps unknown or even known only to a select few.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>4.  Like present humanity: ever ready for battle of crumbs.  Would
<BR>you rather like to join forces for the great venture of true gain?
<BR><FONT  COLOR=116B08><STRONG>(What is gain? What makes me feel large? What makes me feel passionate and increase my energy?)</STRONG></FONT>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	I agree that it is important to state, as clearly as possible, what can be known.  I think that in that way we get clearer on that which is not known, maybe even that which is unknowable.  But can we really believe that in so doing we have given any "attributes" to this unknowable something-or-other?  Even to call it an "unknowable something or other" seems to go beyond what can realistically be said.  Perhaps that's why you stick with "the unknowable," brevity giving it at least the appearance of modesty.  But how can we even know it's unknowable?  How do we know anything is unknowable? </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>5.  Think of the word hope: What does it mean to you, not the dictionary?  How about hope being the entrance to the unknowable?
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;	On a final note, it seems quite unlikely to me that it is possible to experience anything outside language and thought (although it certainly seems possible that there are realms outside beyond or at least in addition to "rational" thought).  I have a vague recollection of Kierkegaard heaping scorn and ridicule on Hegel for the notion of "absolute thought," by which SK took him to mean that he had somehow forgotten he was a person existing at a certain period of time with pains, appetitites and perhaps even flatulence.  Even Hillary Clinton would find it challenging to reach that exalted state of forgetfulness.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>6.  SO we are more limited than animals? no experience without knowledge?
<BR>
<BR>Hagel and <FONT  COLOR=116B08><STRONG>Søren Kierkegaard</STRONG></FONT> --  The battleground is more
<BR>attractive to the EGO than joining forces: [Bsharing.</STRONG>
