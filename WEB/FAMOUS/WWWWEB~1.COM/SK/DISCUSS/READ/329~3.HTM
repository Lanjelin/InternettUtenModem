<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;There is no consciousness of standing outside oneself without referent, because one is always physically inside oneself, and trapped within a bodily referent.  Just as faith without works is dead, so transcendece without immanence is meaningless in humans.  We cannot escape our immanence.  For us, transcendence without immanence is mere angelism, a disorder.  We are not angels, but body and soul, and each body is rooted in the immanence of its own thing-ness.  A human motion (even interior) is the motion of a thing, which by definition is an action with respect to the immanent and the universal, and with respect to a referent.  It is exactly in SK's blindness to his own and our thing-ness that he "drifts away."</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>But there most certainly is a consciousness of standing outside of oneself without referent - in what might be called pure negation of the universal, of immanence.  "Alienation" might be a term in various contexts which explicates this consciousness; "depression" sometimes maybe also; and of course sin/despair in Sickness Unto Death  and faith in Fear and Trembling are specific renditions of this consciousness.  It is critical to SK's whole formulation that we cannot escape our existing selves - he is no apostle of some mystical out-of-body transcendance potential.  In this context, faith is the inward negation of the existing self and the universal; and in faith this "tension of the contrasting form" is both manifest at its highest and preserved.  Without an existing self and a concrete universal to contrast against the inward movement of faith, there would be no sense to the concept of faith.  And not all motions of a thing are by definition immanent.  The question, and the distinction SK tries to draw, is >>how<< the motion is conducted inwardly.  Esthetically?  Ethically? or Religiously?  
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The will -- our determination of our own telos -- injects the (only, limited) possibility of the transcendental into human life.  In our selection of our telos, we are free to define ourselves, and to some degree, free from physical external determination.  For example, Kant observes in the Grounding for a Metaphysics of Morals that the swimmer swimming out to rescue a floundering man does a different act from the act of one swimming out to drown the floundering man.  SK, too, in the beginning of Fear and Trembling, appears to recognize that Abraham might have done the sacrifice of Isaac in many ways that would not have effected the same end.  </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>The two cases seem different in an important way: in the first, the swimmer is doing two different acts; but in the Abraham case, the act is the same but the inward standpoint with respect to the act is different.  And there is SK's thesis again: it is inwardly that the distinction must be drawn, between being a murderer (an inward intent to kill Isaac in violation of the universal) and a hero of faith (an inward intent to obey God - which is coincident with negating ones existing given self, ones existing given wants, needs, and desires, ones existing concrete place within the universal).
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But, as soon as we have selected a telos, we must act upon it.  While we can assign meaning to our actions, it is within limits -- one cannot always claim to have chosen to be a rescuer while holding the floundering man's head under water. There are times when this is bad faith.  Action of one sort or another will sometimes be called for, sometimes not -- and our bodies must follow our will, if we are to be true to our telos.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In short, we are transcendent beings only with respect to our own individual teleology.  All that can be transcendentally transformed is the teleology of the will.  ("Lord, I do believe.  Help my unbelief").  As soon as we are caled to _act_ our will, it is upon and through the immanent pysical world.  Here, thing-ness often shows through and we cannot effect the end that we intended ("the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak).  This is the fate of the incarnate.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>But a teleology of the will "transcendentally transformed" is a marvelous thing.  Action per se is ambiguous, not univocal.  The question is: what is the status of the inward person?  Is it transcendentally directed (towards God) or immanently directed (towards the universal)?  I think these are very different things; you seem to be saying that simply because they each manifest real motion in real time that they are the same.  But if I save the swimmer for God and as a response to His call, I am doing something very different than saving the swimmer for the good of society.
