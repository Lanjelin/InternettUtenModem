<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;My confusion has gone on long enough, and now we have enough experience between us that you can see where my problem lies and if anyone can help me, you can.</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The 1/30th of a second is the meeting between the subjective consciousness and the objective world; what makes the meeting magical is that it occurs competely objectively (no larding over of this objective world with our subjective perceptions), which seems to be a contradiction insofar as the consciousness is subjective. </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I'll try to apply what I have just tried to enumerate, in terms of my confusion with reguard to the varied acknowledgement of what I see as a miracle, in my comments to your following responces.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>The fact that Jesus Christ as God is given does not bear upon any question of miracle, or the 1/30th of a second between the fusion of a concept [concept?, do you mean subject?] and object.  For His givenness is not in the nature of an indubitable fact that must be accepted, it is in the nature of a claim by a real human being that may be accepted or rejected.  To accept it is the definition of faith and obediance; to reject it is the definition of offense and disobediance.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;As a man, you hear the story of Jesus as God.  You have a subjective choice, not a magical one, to accept or reject him.  It is the third option, that he is given, this is the miracle!  </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>But all existence is given, by definition.  SK's existence category is precisely that which is external to us/our subjectivity, given to us, outside of our control.  As such, that things are given is not a miracle but a fact/presupposition of our peculiar circumstances.  Your "miracle" category, I think, is not that things are given to us, but that they are given to us as objectively meaningful experiences.  But this is precisely the discussion we are having: is the meaning of this  objective thing in the object itself, or is it in my own subjectivity?  And if either is the case, what is the relationship between my subjectivity and objectivity?  "Miracle" describes the problem; I do not think it is a solution in a philosophic sense (although it could well be a solution in a personal sense).
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>SK does, I think, separate the subjective/objective - and more radically than the other two, but then he fuses them again in his own unique way.  The absolute separation of the objective/existential and the subjective/conceptual is for him a necessary presupposition to permit freedom and a real possibility of individuality.  If our existence is essentiality related to any conceptual scheme, then our existence is necessarily determined and unfree.  Thus, SK insists either explicitly or implicitly in his works that there is a confirmed distinction between the "outer" and the "inner."  Without this separation, there would be no difficulty, no task, in which the individual could manifest himself.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The above paragraph cannot be clearly applied to my misunderstanding because the paragraph is unclear whether or not the fusion of the subjective/objective is done "magically". If it is done subjectively there is no magical confusion.  If it is done without subjectivity the contradiction sets in that only the miracle can cure.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>As above, I think that if things carry the weight of their meaning with them, ie your miracle has occurred, then there is little place left for subjectivity, nor for a sure sense of what would constitute a concrete individual.  Subjectivity becomes a mere accidental receiving  point of an objective manifestation.  So too, inasmuch as the meaning of the objective is "outside of us," then we are un-free: we can only accept the inevitable.  But note too that we too are existing.  In this sense, we have an aspect of ourselves which is objective to us.  If our own meaning is carried in this objective part of us, then we are un-free with respect to ourselves, also.
<BR>
<BR>Now, the SK formulation is: in contemplation mode (which is the mode we are in in this discussion), any determination of the meaning of an objective given is a subjective approximation.  In ethical/active mode, any determination of one's own responsibility to an objective given is a subjective certainty.  In the religious/active mode, any determination of one's own responsibility to an objective given is a subjective certainty as a response to a gift from God.  In all of these, the relation of subjectivity to objectivity is given, but freedom is not lost, or so SK wants to say.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>Socrates for SK represented a specific moment of individuality, a  possibility of a particular type of concretely defined self.  But I do not think Socrates blended the subjective/objective, nor jumped the border  or crossed the chasm.  To the contrary, he was committed to his own ignorance, which means he manifestly refused to say unconditionally what anything was.  His greatness consisted in his clarity of vision as to the distinction between concepts and existence (which loosely corresponds with our subjective/objective distinction), and to his ability to maintain an inward balance that refused to anull either side.  In irony, he floated between the two worlds, perfectly positioned right up until his death.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Socrates can be clearly connected to my misunderstanding because he, as a subjective individual, wanted to attain the objective.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;It is through his commitment to his own ignorance Socrates restrains himself, and remainsin the realm of subjectivity.  He was ignorant about the objective truth, yet he continually strove toward it, (and, again,  his striving was not subjective but objective) and because it was objective he repeatedly came up short.  His failure was not due to a lack of effort on his part, indeed his failure (i.e. ignorance) was due to his extraordinary skill, he was sensitive enough to feel that he was being repelled, something that can be seen clearly in conrast to the sophists, who never honored such a sensation.  It is entirely consistent than that when he talked withthe Sophists Socrates thought of himself as a gadfly.   Instead of forcing his way passed this repelling force (with the jingling of spurs and the voice of the master) he had a certain reverence for it.  Because his approach was objective, Socrates respectively stayed clear of the magical site which I am calling a miracle. </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I like your statement that Socrates "was being repelled."  This is a neat way of putting it.  SK describes Socrates as infinite negativity, which carries the connotation of a totally subjective act on Socrates part.  But in truth, a commitment to ignorance seems to have just as much acquiescence to being repelled, as it does to an internal subjective commitment.  Whence would come such a negative commitment without a clear vision as to that which is being rejected?  This clear vision would be very close to "being repelled."
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;></I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>You state: "The objective things that are given to us, i.e. not subjective, not dependant on us, this is unfetterd vision of objective truth?  Objective truth as a given!"  But the objective things given to us are given only in the sense of "that it is."  Nothing more is given.  Objective truth on the other hand would be the total resolution of something that is into "what it is."  Objective truth in this sense is most assuredly not given just by the fact that something is.  That seems to be precisely the situation we seem to be in: things are, we ourselves are, but we do not know what they are, nor do we know who we ourselves are.  The task of life seems to be to answer these questions.  If the objective truth of things were given along with the existence of things, then there would be no such task, and we would not be "beings like we are."</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;"Objective truth" being the total resolution into "what it is" is by nature subjective, (a paradox of phrasings) so the objective truth is either accepted by the individual or rejected -- no magic here.  The magic enters with this "objectively given"  phrase.  In so far as they are given to someone objectively and this transaction does indeed take place, something is given and something is recieved, there is an interaction, then this falls under what I meant by a miracle.   </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>But again, in what sense is "miracle" a solution?  In what sense, upon the occurrence of the miracle, is there room for subjectivity?  I do not mean to be obtuse here, so please be patient.
