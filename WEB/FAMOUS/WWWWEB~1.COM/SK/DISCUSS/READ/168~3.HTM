<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;YES, THE WAY YOUR PROF EXPLAINED IT, EXISTENTIALISM IS A GO BETWEEN -- IT IS UNIVERSAL, I.E. CAN BE ACESSED BY PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS, ITS NEUTRAL.  I CAN BE RAISED ONE WAY, YOU ANOTHER WAY, AND WE CAN WALK ONTO NEUTRAL GROUND AND SHARE OUR THOGHTS AND EXPERIENCES IN THE MODE OF EXISTENTIALISM.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I couldn't agree more.  The insights of existential thought are universal because they have to do with what it means to exist as a human.  If you, too, are a human, then we can talk.  The question remains, how much can we talk about?  Traditional philosophy had tried to speak about mankind from a purely objective standpoint.  Even though it was recognized that one perceives the world as a subject, the question of subjectivity never arose.  Trying to talk about a human subject as an object (a cogito, ego, etc.) does not get us very far.  As Kierkegaard has pointed out, the Hegelian system, the highpoint of this approach, completely missed the point.  What is needed to truly understand human existence is an understanding of subjectivity in a concrete individual.
<BR>
<BR>  EXISTENTIALISM MAKES US ATOMIC AS OPPOSED TO INBEDDED.  ITS ALMOST OBJECTIVE.  DEFINED THIS WAY, I THINK, THE WORD MEANS ALMOST EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO MEAN as FAR AS ITS RELAIONSHIP TO THE INDIVIDUAL.  AND THAT IS WHY IT IS AN INTERESTING WORD, BECAUSE IT IS CONTRADICTORY.   
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ABOVE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT PARAGRAPH?</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>This is an interesting twist.  Some people interpret existential individuals as atomic.  In the case of Kierkegaard, however, a good case can be made that a subjective individual presupposes social relations.  For expample, when I make the leap to a higher existence sphere (aesthetical, ethical, religious), the task is to re-interpret the previous one in light of the new.  I think we exist in all three spheres.   
<BR>More to the point, to say that we are atomic rather than imbeded, or to try to view the individual in this way, I think, is to fall back into the same reified Hegelianism that Kierkegaard protested.  I think what you mean to say (if so, I would agree) is that Existentialism isolates the individual and asks of him or her questions of ultimate significance.  For Kierkegaard, the individual is further isolated before God. But the individual must still be regarded as "this" individual. 
<BR>You bring out an interesting point though.  If you take what I said to the extreme, then all we can do is turn inward and know ourselves, with no common understanding.  What do we do, then, with Kierkegaard's writings?  Obviously he felt there was some common ground.  I think this is what you are implying by "almost objective."  What is true is that Existentialism communicates insights into the ontological structure of human beings (despite Sartre's denial of ontological substance to por-soi).  But how?  Kierkegaard would say INDIRECTLY.  The truth of what I say about how I understand myself only has meaning in terms of how you ultimately appropriate it.  This is another can of worms, though, regarding language, interpretation, and truth.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT CHRISTIANS NEED MORE TRADITION?  I SAY LESS TRADITION AND MORE SELF EXPLORATION WOULD BE A GENERALLY GOOD IDEA.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>I am surprised that you were able to read this out of what I said.
<BR>I don't know if more tradition is needed, but I do think tradition has a valuable place.  Kierkegaard did not discredit Religiousness A with Religiousness B.  Some think that in today's rationalized world, there is no room for religious belief, especially if it deals in metaphysical of mythical language.  I, however, think that the jury is still out.  I'm not so sure that we can replace the meanings involved in symbols with rational concepts.  The goal, however, is to constantly re-interpret those meanings.  This is the task of Church Dogmatics and Systematic Theology.  Kierkegaard might disagree on this point.  The job is never done, however, and here is wherer existential subjectivity can be employed to guard against hegemony, fanaticism, etc.
