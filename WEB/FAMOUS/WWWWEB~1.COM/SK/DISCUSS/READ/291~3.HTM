<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Since we changed languages from subjective/objective into "That it is" and "What it is", the old magical 1/30th of a second has appeared again -- it is in the first step of your two step process:</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;["That it is"] is the way in which things seem to be given to us; ie it is the aspect of actual things that are not subjective, not dependent upon us...  ...That this particular thing is, there is no question.  It is here.  But, what is it?  It is in this second move that subjectivity enters the picture, and in fact produces a picture: an experience for a consciousness.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The objective things that are given to us, i.e. not subjective, not dependant on us, this is unfetterd vision of objective truth?  Objective truth as a given!  And then, in the second step, we quickly pour our subjective molasses over it.  Oh, to get back to the first step, is this not the goal?  Our lost paradise!  How does the first step slip away?  Is it due to our ignorance?  Our imperfection?  Our original sin?  (Aha! Mr. Dean, if you are reading along this is perhaps how sin figures in.)  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Following along withthe post, I then get lost when SK's existence is described as an aspect of actuality.  I am not entirely clear on the meaning of these two words, except for my gut feeling that SK's existence should be larger than actuality, not a fraction of it.  I may be way off here.  I n either case, I need some guidance if I am to be bale to follow further.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;       </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But, through my ammendment (the Socratic intentions ammendment), I can see what you are saying about Plato and Kant each opting for one side or the other -- in other words, if you accept the border as simular enough to the ditch, neither Plato or Kant appear to be jumpers -- they are content with their contemplation.   And your point is well taken about SK's critique of them -- for them existence vanishes, and with it the difficulty -- and without the difficulty the highest sphere accesable is the universal.  You may not want to blend the metaphors, your fear of loosing important distinctions, but I do not see the danger in doing so, because I think Sk's metaphor accounts for Plato and Kant you speak of rather neatly -- in the second thier of a three tiered system.  He gives them their due repect...       </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;So, can we blend the border and the ditch?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And now I am a bit confused about who is blending the subjective/objective and who is not.  I'd say that SK doesn't blend them, he seperates them.  And I'd say Kant probobly had them sepereate too, and so did Plato... </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Could you say what Socrates did?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And in conclusion, to the Jesus Christ as given suggestion -- well,  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;please reread the opening paragraph and see if that does not compromise the miracle of Jesus in a roughly simular manner as the 1/30th of a second.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>Taking your points in reverse order:
<BR>
<BR>The fact that Jesus Christ as God is given does not bear upon any question of miracle, or the 1/30th of a second between the fusion of a concept and object.  For His givenness is not in the nature of an indubitable fact that must be accepted, it is in the nature of a claim by a real human being that may be accepted or rejected.  To accept it is the definition of faith and obediance; to reject it is the definition of offense and disobediance.
<BR>
<BR>SK does, I think, separate the subjective/objective - and more radically than the other two, but then he fuses them again in his own unique way.  The absolute separation of the objective/existential and the subjective/conceptual is for him a necessary presupposition to permit freedom and a real possibility of individuality.  If our existence is essentiality related to any conceptual scheme, then our existence is necessarily determined and unfree.  Thus, SK insists either explicitly or implicitly in his works that there is a confirmed distinction between the "outer" and the "inner."  Without this separation, there would be no difficulty, no task, in which the individual could manifest himself.
<BR>
<BR>Socrates for SK represented a specific moment of individuality, a  possibility of a particular type of concretely defined self.  But I do not think Socrates blended the subjective/objective, nor jumped the border  or crossed the chasm.  To the contrary, he was committed to his own ignorance, which means he manifestly refused to say unconditionally what anything was.  His greatness consisted in his clarity of vision as to the distinction between concepts and existence (which loosely corresponds with our subjective/objective distinction), and to his ability to maintain an inward balance that refused to anull either side.  In irony, he floated between the two worlds, perfectly positioned right up until his death.
<BR>
<BR>Actuality for SK was reserved for ethical or religious actuality.  Thus an actuality would always be such only for an individual person.  In this sense, then, existence is certainly bigger than actuality, for no one person could have an actuality embracing all of existence.  But in the sense of what an indiviual's actuality is composed of, existence would be a part thereof.  See my response to j. dooley with respect to this.
<BR>
<BR>You state: "The objective things that are given to us, i.e. not subjective, not dependant on us, this is unfetterd vision of objective truth?  Objective truth as a given!"  But the objective things given to us are given only in the sense of "that it is."  Nothing more is given.  Objective truth on the other hand would be the total resolution of something that is into "what it is."  Objective truth in this sense is most assuredly not given just by the fact that something is.  That seems to be precisely the situation we seem to be in: things are, we ourselves are, but we do not know what they are, nor do we know who we ourselves are.  The task of life seems to be to answer these questions.  If the objective truth of things were given along with the existence of things, then there would be no such task, and we would not be "beings like we are."
<BR>
<BR>I note elsewhere that you and Tom Dean are calling for an end to this thread.  Although I have found this discussion very valuable in forcing me to collect some of my own thoughts on this subject, I do not want you to feel obligated to continue this on my account.
