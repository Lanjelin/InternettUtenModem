<BR>Please help me here. Set me straight.
<BR>
<BR>My confusion has gone on long enough, and now we have enough experience between us that you can see where my problem lies and if anyone can help me, you can.
<BR>
<BR>The 1/30th of a second is the meeting between the subjective consciousness and the objective world; what makes the meeting magical is that it occurs competely objectively (no larding over of this objective world with our subjective perceptions), which seems to be a contradiction insofar as the consciousness is subjective. 
<BR>
<BR>I'll try to apply what I have just tried to enumerate, in terms of my confusion with reguard to the varied acknowledgement of what I see as a miracle, in my comments to your following responces.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The fact that Jesus Christ as God is given does not bear upon any question of miracle, or the 1/30th of a second between the fusion of a concept [concept?, do you mean subject?] and object.  For His givenness is not in the nature of an indubitable fact that must be accepted, it is in the nature of a claim by a real human being that may be accepted or rejected.  To accept it is the definition of faith and obediance; to reject it is the definition of offense and disobediance.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>As a man, you hear the story of Jesus as God.  You have a subjective choice, not a magical one, to accept or reject him.  It is the third option, that he is given, this is the miracle!  
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;SK does, I think, separate the subjective/objective - and more radically than the other two, but then he fuses them again in his own unique way.  The absolute separation of the objective/existential and the subjective/conceptual is for him a necessary presupposition to permit freedom and a real possibility of individuality.  If our existence is essentiality related to any conceptual scheme, then our existence is necessarily determined and unfree.  Thus, SK insists either explicitly or implicitly in his works that there is a confirmed distinction between the "outer" and the "inner."  Without this separation, there would be no difficulty, no task, in which the individual could manifest himself.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>The above paragraph cannot be clearly applied to my misunderstanding because the paragraph is unclear whether or not the fusion of the subjective/objective is done "magically". If it is done subjectively there is no magical confusion.  If it is done without subjectivity the contradiction sets in that only the miracle can cure.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Socrates for SK represented a specific moment of individuality, a  possibility of a particular type of concretely defined self.  But I do not think Socrates blended the subjective/objective, nor jumped the border  or crossed the chasm.  To the contrary, he was committed to his own ignorance, which means he manifestly refused to say unconditionally what anything was.  His greatness consisted in his clarity of vision as to the distinction between concepts and existence (which loosely corresponds with our subjective/objective distinction), and to his ability to maintain an inward balance that refused to anull either side.  In irony, he floated between the two worlds, perfectly positioned right up until his death.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Socrates can be clearly connected to my misunderstanding because he, as a subjective individual, wanted to attain the objective.  
<BR>It is through his commitment to his own ignorance Socrates restrains himself, and remainsin the realm of subjectivity.  He was ignorant about the objective truth, yet he continually strove toward it, (and, again,  his striving was not subjective but objective) and because it was objective he repeatedly came up short.  His failure was not due to a lack of effort on his part, indeed his failure (i.e. ignorance) was due to his extraordinary skill, he was sensitive enough to feel that he was being repelled, something that can be seen clearly in conrast to the sophists, who never honored such a sensation.  It is entirely consistent than that when he talked withthe Sophists Socrates thought of himself as a gadfly.   Instead of forcing his way passed this repelling force (with the jingling of spurs and the voice of the master) he had a certain reverence for it.  Because his approach was objective, Socrates respectively stayed clear of the magical site which I am calling a miracle. 
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Actuality for SK was reserved for ethical or religious actuality.  Thus an actuality would always be such only for an individual person.  In this sense, then, existence is certainly bigger than actuality, for no one person could have an actuality embracing all of existence.  But in the sense of what an indiviual's actuality is composed of, existence would be a part thereof.  See my response to j. dooley with respect to this.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I'll try to get at this in the dooley post.
<BR>But the basic question is how can your previous definition of existence hold if existence is bigger than actuality.  But this is on a different topic...  
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;You state: "The objective things that are given to us, i.e. not subjective, not dependant on us, this is unfetterd vision of objective truth?  Objective truth as a given!"  But the objective things given to us are given only in the sense of "that it is."  Nothing more is given.  Objective truth on the other hand would be the total resolution of something that is into "what it is."  Objective truth in this sense is most assuredly not given just by the fact that something is.  That seems to be precisely the situation we seem to be in: things are, we ourselves are, but we do not know what they are, nor do we know who we ourselves are.  The task of life seems to be to answer these questions.  If the objective truth of things were given along with the existence of things, then there would be no such task, and we would not be "beings like we are."</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>"Objective truth" being the total resolution into "what it is" is by nature subjective, (a paradox of phrasings) so the objective truth is either accepted by the individual or rejected -- no magic here.  The magic enters with this "objectively given"  phrase.  In so far as they are given to someone objectively and this transaction does indeed take place, something is given and something is recieved, there is an interaction, then this falls under what I meant by a miracle.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I note elsewhere that you and Tom Dean are calling for an end to this thread.  Although I have found this discussion very valuable in forcing me to collect some of my own thoughts on this subject, I do not want you to feel obligated to continue this on my account.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I like this thread.  Please don't end it on my account.
<BR>I dont recall calling for its end.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>P.S.
<BR>I will be absent for a while,  I'm moving to another city and will be offline for a few days while I set up my new apartment and have to reconnect my modem etc. etc...
