I don't think faith leads to solipsism either.  I probobly was unclear, as usual.
<BR>
<BR>I was trying to show where solipsism comes into the leap metaphor.  If solipsism is being subjectively isolated without hope for communication, then it is what Sk means when he says that the knight of faith makes the chasm infinately large (as opposed to those objective sould who are always ever so close to making the chasm into nothing at all, buthey are never quite there).  Another way of saing this is that the subject becomes more and more 'subjectively isolated'.  And he wants to communicate but he wants to communicate the inwardness...  this desire makes the leap impossible; basically solipsism.  And solipsism is broken, the leap is made, and the truth is subjectivity, by virtue of the absurd -- the leap of faith.  
<BR>Faith gets us out of solipsism.
<BR>
<BR>Maybe I should make adistinction between faith tht you can clear a 3 inch chasm and the kind of faith that sends you to leap across a chasm where you can barely make out the other side.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I disagree that faith leads to solipsism.  This is a wrong view of subjectivity.  Subjectivity is the way that we relate to truth, and as we know from SK, it's not the what but the how.  This doesn't deny, however, that there is a "what."  There must be a truth to which one is relating subjectively in order to be inward.  But for SK, the most important question is not what that truth is, but what you do with it.</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;T. Dean is right that the question about the absolute cuts even deeper than the question of the historical in Christianity. But I'm not so sure that it is as difficult as it seems.  It seems to me that logically Christianity could be wrong.  Jesus may not have even existed, etc.  But what does this due for faith?  I think we are all agreeing that Christian faith requires acceptance of this risk.  Paul Tillich makes a distinction between the risk of historical uncertainty and the existential risk of faith.  I argue in my paper ( <a href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs11.htm#1170" tppabs="http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~charless/kierkegaard.htm"><a href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs11.htm#1170" tppabs="http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~charless/kierkegaard.htm">http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~charless/kierkegaard.htm</a></a> if you care) that Christian faith requires acceptance of both risks.  This discussion has moved interestingly from the risk of historical uncertainty to the existential risk of faith.  The question now is, why have faith in an absolute, Christian or otherwise.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>yes, i read your paper when you first posted it.  
<BR>i liked it. i liked your read of SK.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;What is meant by "absolute?"  The best definitions seem to be negative: that than which nothing greater can be conceived (Anselm)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The horizon of possibility (Karl Rahner)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The ground of Being (Tillich)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The Logos (Heraclitus)</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The foundational principle of the universe</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;It seems to me that these formulations are much less problematic than "God."  I think this is the kind of thing that SK was shooting for with "Absolute."  Peple all over the world seem to have this feeling (religious sentiment, maybe Schleirmacher's God-consciousness) that there is something at the base of it all.  There is a Supreme meaning to the universe.  Maybe we are wrong in that sentiment, maybe it is wishful thinking in order to "ground" believe in a big brother of a deity who helps me face the stark reality of existence.  But then, it is extremely difficult for the human mind which experiences things like beauty and has an idea of justice, to shake such sentiment.  I think this is what is meant by "The fool says in his heart that there is no God."  It just seems to fly in the face of experience.  Kierkegaard in the Postscript (I don't have it with me) acknowledges that there is a revelation of God in nature, but we don't always recognize it as such.  Paul says that we have suppressed this truth.  What does this mean?  Certainly it is not anything like objective knowledge.  Nevertheless, it seems available to all 'rational' people.  The hard part comes in characterizing the Absolute.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;What is the absolute?  Maybe it is nothingness (the Kyoto school).  Maybe it is Brahman.  Maybe it is the wholly transcendent other.  Perhaps the absolute is coextensive with the world (Whitehead).  Maybe it is the world (pantheism).  Maybe matter is all there is (materialism).  It seems to me that most atheists I have met, when pressed, do not deny an absolute in these terms, they simply deny that the idea of God accurately describes it.  This is the question about ultimate reality, the answer to which proposes to be the source of meaning.  It seems to me that if one truly believes that there is no absolute in this abstract sense, suicide through starvation is the only option.  This is what I have alluded to early in that Sartre has a kind of a-theology.  From whence meaning?  A: the absolute.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Ahh, now the angst-- we cannot know anything about the absolute.  Camus rightly says that we ask the question of the world and the world responds in silence.  This is the absurd fact of existence.  But maybe this is really an answer of sorts.  Shouldn't the absolute somehow be related to this absurdity?  Enter Kierkegaard.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;OK, so any positive statement about the absolute is subject to uncertainty.  But can we doubt that there is an absolute?  I think if you try, you are performing a contradiction.  This is what the ontological argument was trying to get at.  Well for that matter, all of the arguments which try to prove the existence of God are really trying to show that the absolute is indubitable.  Of course the problem is that in order to get off the ground with the argument, one must define the absolute in such a way that it loses this abstract character.  Usually, it is assumed that the absolute is something like God (not a bad assumption), which cannot itself be proved.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;What is important, from a Kierkegaardian perspective is not one's conception of the absolute (T. Dean's 'delusion') but rather one's relationship to it.  What characterizes this relaitonship?  Pathos, passion, suffering.  Remember SK's comparison in the Postscript (this is not the only work I have read, but my favorite) between the person who prays to an idol and the person who prays to the Christian God in untruth?  He says (paraphrased) that the one prays in truth to God, though his eyes are focused on an idol.  The other prays in untruth to the true God, and therefore is praying to an idol.  The content, then, cannot be the most important thing, otherwise God would descend right now and give all of us indubitable proof.  What does God want?  Isn't it Micah that says he doesn't want our burnt offerings or our festivals, but rather a contrite heart?  Its the attitude!</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;So what about Christianity?  Why belive in this form?  I have thoughts on this, but I will save them for later, as I have already writen my share.  What do you all think?  Why believe in Christianity?  Why make the leap in this way?  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Sure.  Why not?  I mean, I was born a Christian wasn't I?  This is a Christian state, isn't it.  I'm obviously not a Muslim or Buddhist.  Of course I'm a Christian.
<BR>
<BR>Or am I a Christian only after I make the leap?
<BR>
<BR>Which is more important, the leap or Christianity?
<BR>
<BR>HERE IS MY QUESTION:
<BR>Is one Christian because one has made the leap, or has one made the leap because one is Christian?
