Thank you for clarification, Mr. Tye.  My confusion was that I had not known of Jesus' exemption to the doctrine of Original Sin. 
<BR>
<BR>The scandal (or offense)that I was attempting to refer to was not Mary's relationship to original sin, for you are correct that to say that claiming Mary was subject to Original Sin is not very scandalous as she is considered merely human (except maybe to the Catholics, who consider Mary as somewhat of an idol, an b/c of that let there be  scadal); I was attempting to bring foward the scandal of incarnation, that Jesus was subject to Original Sin -- but, as you have just stated, this scandal didn't exist, as the doctrine does not apply to him; a nuance that I was not aware of.
<BR>
<BR>The reason for my attempt was in a vain attempt to borrow an idea without crediting the author if it, and now you have pointed out that I have misused what I have borrowed.  I believe it was Mr. Tillet who introduced the incarnation as the primary "offense" that SK addresses; the incarnation offence being primary in that it takes precidence over any discussion of adultry; so, my purpose in bringing foreward the offense of the incarnation was likewise to superseed the discussion on adultry.  But in my presentation of the offense of the incarnation you have taken away what I saw as the offensive part, that the God was made subject to Original Sin.  So, now, in light of your comments, I must say that I do not see how the incarnation is so very offensive, I cannot see how it is the primary offense.  CAn you see how it would be offensive, I believe it would fit in with what you have already stated (for God to come into the world through sin in order to cure sin -- you also mentioned it sounds like ends justifies the means), for God and to enter into the world as humans do, in human form, complete with Original Sin?  
<BR>
<BR>Is there another way to make the offence at the incarnation more important, that is more offensive, than the adultry issue?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>In any case, we are in agreement that if it could be known objectively that Mary had committed adultry, then her social standing would definately have been lowered even more in the eyes of her contemporaries; and to go a step further, would it not also make liars out of the Church which upholds the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception?  To use Occham's razor, the simplest explanation that can explain the most, this would be to give creedence to "adultry"?
<BR>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I am not sure to what doctrine of Original Sin you are referring. The traditional and orthodox doctrine holds that Jesus, as the unspotted Lamb of God, was not subject to Original Sin. Roman Catholic belief holds that Mary was not subject to it either.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In any case, I don't see the relevance of Original Sin to Mr. Dean's point. He was hinting that the offense occasioned by Mary's low social standing would be intensified if her social standing were even lower due to some sort of scandal. If the scandal is merely that she was subject to Original Sin, I don't see how this could affect her social standing since everyone else was subject to it as well. I think he was hinting at some sort of scandalous sin such as adultery.</I></FONT>
