just two notes on your last post while I await you rresponce to the ammended version (I don't want ot go inot to much detail here as I fear it would send us off in too many directions at once):
<BR>
<BR>1.
<BR>For SK, is the (actual > existence) or is (existence > actual).  
<BR>You said, "The aspect of an actual thing "that is" is what SK refers to as "existence"." 
<BR>
<BR>2.
<BR>Do you really mean to say that Jesus Chrsit as God is given?  Well, if you do, then what does a good christian need to have faith in?   If its given why faith?    
<BR>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;This is not a specific response to your amendation above.  I need to give the Socratic thing a thought or two.  I believe what I write hereinafter might be applicable, though.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;But as to the rest, I take it in sum that you are saying that SK and Socrates/Kant/Plato are all talking about one thing, subjectivity, but just looking at it from different perspectives.  And there could be something in what you say; someone (I think it was Whitehead) once said that all philosophy is but a footnote to Plato.  However, I believe that SK was onto something genuinely new and vital, and to merge his views with the others is to lose some very important insights and distinctions.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In order to compare and contrast anything, there needs to be some archimedian point of comparison.  I propose we use Schelling's distinction between the "what" and the "that."  He said that everything actual has a double aspect: what it is and that it is.  "That it is" refers to the aspect of an actual thing that is external to us and out of our control.  It is the way in which things seem to be given to us; ie it is the aspect of actual things that are not subjective, not dependent upon us.  "What it is" refers to the aspect of an actual thing that we bring to it, in response to it.  It is our own subjective conceptual determination of the thing.  That this particular thing is, there is no question.  It is here.  But, what is it?  It is in this second move that subjectivity enters the picture, and in fact produces a picture: an experience for a consciousness.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Now, the aspect of an actual thing "that is" is what SK refers to as "existence," Kant refers to as the "thing in itself," and Plato refers to as "appearances."  They are all terms which are used by the three as conceptual placeholders or markers for that in an experience which is not conceptual - which is outside the conceptual determination, which is objective and given to the subject.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Note how Schelling's distinction is carried through by all three: Kant insists that nothing can be said about the thing in itself - that it is, is given, but nothing else.  "What it is" is a determination of the subject, not of the thing in itself.  Plato insists that appearances are deceptive and illusory.  That they are, is given, but what they are is not determinable.  Knowledge is to be found not in the appearances themselves, but within our own subjectivity as a recollection of the formal ideas.  SK describes existence from the side of thought (ie, from the side of conceptual subjectivity) as "a vanishing thing."  That something exists is given, but what it is is not given.  What it is comes from consciousness, from subjectivity.  To sum up: all three posit a strong distinction (in SK's term a "qualitative distinction) between the conceptual/subjective and the existence/objective.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;From this perspective, I think you can see (I hope) why I said that Kant and Plato did not fuse the subjective-objective, but only opted for one side or the other.  Kant rejected any attempt to speculate about the thing in itself - the existing objective thing.  All enquiry was to be of and about the object as it was subject to (larded over, in your terms) the personality's own conceptual categories of space, time, and the like.  Plato proposed a program of disregarding appearances - existing objective things - and recollecting the formal ideas.  All progress was to be measured by how well one was able to forget appearances and remember the truly Real structures imminent within us, within subjectivity.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Thus, Plato and Kant posited this barrier between the subjective and objective, and specifically rejected any attempt to cross it.  SK, however, posited the barrier, but did propose a way of crossing it.  SK struck a distinction between contemplation and action.  Contemplation was the mode and manner in which Plat and Kant were operating (in the above context), and also the mode and manner of anyone who approaches knowledge objectively.  If one is in this mode, SK is in essential agreement with Kant and Plato: the barrier cannot be crossed (see, eg, in the Postscript wherein he describes such objective theorizing as "approximation" only).  But in the leap, the barrier can be crossed.  What is the leap?  It is a movement of the personality from this objective contemplation mode, to the active/action mode of the ethical and religious.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In the ethical, the existing objective thing, the thing in itself, is still given.  But the ethical personality does not ask "what (who) is it," for this is a contemplative question.  The ethical personality acts in a response to that which is given to it, in accordance with its own internal ethical idea.  The result is real action/real motion in actuality, unlike contemplation/objective theorizing in which physical motion is not essential.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;In the religious, the existing man, the thing in itself which is given, is Jesus Christ as God.  The religious personality (the one who has made the leap to the religious mode and manner) does not ask "what (who) is it (He)."  The religious personality has accepted His claim and commits to accept His claim and to do all as He commands.  The result of this commitment (the "fruits of the spirit") is action/real motion in actuality, in temporal space-time, again unlike contemplation/objective theorizing.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Long-winded?  I think so, and I apologize.  But this was as concise as I was able to make it.  Hope this bears upon your concerns.</I></FONT>
