I had the feeling it might be so...  SK does <EM>not</EM> concern himself with these details in Practice In Christianity, obviously, and is more concerned with the broader issue of a faith based on recognition of just how far God lowered Himself in His incarnation.  SK does not discuss (yet, in my reading) something so specific as a virgin birth.  Thank you for your kind post.

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And here is the response to this post (pardon me if this has been a rude interjection, Mr. Lynch; I did not intend it): SK did not, as much as I have read of him, deal with such detail as the Virgin Birth.  But he did deal with the destruction of the personality which is the decision inherent in the offense of Jesus Christ.  And the result of such a decision, a decision for faith in Christ, makes issues like the Virgin Birth rather insignificant.  You make a good point, which is essentially contra Brown's Matthew: it would have been more proper (given SK's interpretation of the significance of Christ) to have Jesus be born illegitimate, as that would have been consistent with the "offensiveness" of Christ manifested in other ways (lowly; poor; a carpenter without work; no place to call His own).  But I think you will find that SK does not place the essence of the offense as His physical/social circumstances; these are more preliminary considerations.  It is the manifestation of God, pure and simple, as a  particular man that SK tries to explicate as the offense.  On this level, the Virgin Birth becomes a matter of faith because it is given to us by the Scripture, which is accepted as such because of a prior acceptance of Christ as God.  To the person of strong (perfect?) faith, like Anti-Climacus, it would be, I think, unimportant to determine the "truth" of the Virgin Birth; for true or untrue, the commitment of faith in Jesus would remain.  He would, I think, believe in the Virgin Birth simply because Matthew said it, and Matthew would be assumed to be empowered by God.  But whether true or not, Anti-Climacus' faith would be unwavering.</I></FONT>

<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;If all of you do not have a real feel for why the issue of the Virgin Birth is "rather insignificant" in comparison to the issue of offense and faith, I would suggest that you may read Practise in Christianity again; as near as I can fathom, that is the primary purpose of this great work.  And, although it came later in his authorship, I feel it is central to (my understanding of) SK's work overall.</I></FONT>
