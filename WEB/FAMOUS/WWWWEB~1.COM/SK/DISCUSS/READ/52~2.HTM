<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;And how, pray tell, do we "explore the unknowable"?  Or is it really sorta knowable?  And how do we express out encounters with the unknowable?  Do we, p'rhaps, employ an obtuse/verbose vernacular with it's own technical terms and references, masquerading as insight?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     It is an interesting suggestion that we want to hear something from god to relieve our own personal responsibilities for our lives, which is in some ways the appeal of the Abraham story -- that we can be in situations where the situation is out of our hands ("Hey, I only work here, only following orders, etc.").</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     Still, I do think of viewing god or encounters with god as an encounter with the unknowable to be incoherent.  (But then, there are those who seem to relish incoherence.)  Even the word, "unknowable," is to trick ourselves into thinking we understand something just becuase we have a word for it (e.g., "infinity," "omniscience," "omnipresent," etc.).  These words really do not have meaning, at least in the sense that the usual forms of conversation have meaning.  I can comprehend that certain things are really hard to understand; but "unknowable" is simply not intelligible; it is, as Wittgenstein says, a claim to map out the boundaries of coherent discourse by stepping beyond that boundary.  </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     Or, in yet another pregnant Wittgensteinian phrase, "a bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language;" it is language gone on a holiday.  And while I appreciate poetic ejactulations, I think there are losses of meaning and, therefore, lapses in discourse that make understanding more difficult.  Or, as another of my dumb professors once said:  "I can't read poetry because I always find myself looking for support for the assertions."</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>This is, at the least, an obtrusive subject, offensive to most
<BR>scholars.
<BR>
<BR>We must here deal together with notions of relative knowledge and
<BR>absolute knowingness much like relative and absolute truth, while,
<BR>at the same time, staying with in the domain of human knowledge,
<BR>which seriously and demonstratively posits knowledge other than
<BR>human.
<BR>
<BR>What is beyond creation in unknowable.  By this we signify and give
<BR>credence to "something" or "some other" beyond creation or
<BR>excluding creation (let's stay within the realm of "usable
<BR>language" for a moment).  That what is beyond creation is
<BR>unknowable can be modified and clarified by saying, "what is beyond
<BR>creation is unknowable to the human; hence indicating the potential
<BR>of knowingness to/by other than human comprehension.  Such a
<BR>figment (at the boundary of usable language) is within the domain
<BR>of what is humanly knowable...this "some other," or for the
<BR>faithful, a God of some sort (we stay away from this for the
<BR>moment).
<BR>
<BR>So I arrogantly rephrase the question: How is the human to know of
<BR>the possibility of an unknowable that is unknowable to the human,
<BR>while retaining human comprehension; and if such comprehension is
<BR>possible, is it then truly and rightly unknowable.  The answer,
<BR>which will appall most scholars, is yes and no!
<BR>
<BR>Our existence conforms to the laws that are confined to its domain,
<BR>but is it then infinite or finite?  It is infinite possibility
<BR>within a finite realm conforming to a domain, and for us, it is
<BR>existence.  That we posit that which is exterior to existence,
<BR>simply as a notion, is an unknowable that is presently unknown, but
<BR>which has a presence in human comprehension as a potentiality to be
<BR>know, but perhaps not by human means.  That it "the other' is
<BR>unknowable does not deny its existence or that "otherness" beyond
<BR>creation: we simply don't know of "that something" beyond the
<BR>boundary which IS by some other means.
<BR>
<BR>So now we have digressed to give attribute to an unknowable entity,
<BR>which has caused it to be known is some feeble sense--yet we have
<BR>not left the realm of human knowing, and here the venture
<BR>continues, or shall I say begins.
<BR>
<BR>I have discussed much in my writing of the mutation of the species,
<BR>of binary stars systems, and, poetically, of My Third Birth (in the
<BR>sense of humanity, collectively, not individually.)  Here I have
<BR>embarked upon a path wherein I posit the advenient possibility --
<BR>or potentiality -- of knowing, which is not of the human means as
<BR>it is presently understood.  Surely, however, anything occurring
<BR>within or from the human means (the human vehicle) is of human
<BR>source, for how can it be otherwise?  But there is more to be said
<BR>as to what is human as we know it, and what is human as a domain
<BR>that is presently unavailable to the babe as human seed: brute.  
<BR>
<BR>Now, you will find flaw in this argument as we begin to leave the
<BR>realm of language...but at the same time, never digressing from the
<BR>field of knowing, or potential knowing.  Then, treading clumsily
<BR>further, we enter the realm of pure experience, which is human by
<BR>virtue of the apprehending (or fathoming) human being, but is not
<BR>of human form in light of certain nebulous subtleties related to
<BR>human mutation and the potential of some other cognition which is 
<BR>not strictly human in relativity.
<BR>
<BR>For this we dispense with the tools of constructed language and
<BR>enter a realm of unknowable notions not spoken or thought of,
<BR>but experienced, hence leading to its knowingness (again from an
<BR>apprehending human vehicle).
<BR>
<BR>Yes, sorta knowable; and yes, a claim to map out the boundaries of
<BR>coherent discourse by stepping beyond as Wittgenstein says, but
<BR>there is no lapse of [internal] discourse or  loss of meaning. 
<BR>Quite the other way around!  (I maintain that the unknowable is
<BR>intelligible by uncanny means.)
<BR>
<BR>I can not and will not argue your world-view.  Exploration of
<BR>the unknowable is indeed that: an exploration.  When we find some
<BR>previously hidden artifacts, what do we do with them? how do we
<BR>interpret them in terms of "human" knowledge.  I leave that for
<BR>others, I simply collect with notation--and I tire easily.
<BR>
<BR>(There are some earlier works on this matter, not submitted for the
<BR>subject of approval.)
