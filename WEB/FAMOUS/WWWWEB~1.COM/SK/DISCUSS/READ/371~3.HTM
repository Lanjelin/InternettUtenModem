<BR>[snip]
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;You have touched on my one deep disagreement with SK.  The Incarnation, it seems to me, has shot reality through with "particularity."  Particularity, as I use it, refers to those facts which happen once and are not readily repeatable or verifiable.  Particular facts are not the sort that can be tested in the laboratory, or which can be predicted a priori.  As I use the term, the particular is a species of objective fact (a fact which proceeds from the action of an external determinative force) whose truth is largely tested by the testing the reliability of the witnesses to it.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I am interested in the dialectic involved in testing the reliability of witnesses, but I will save that for another thread.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;SK does not appear to recognize the existence of the particular -- which seems odd to me, because it seems very compatible, as a category, with the Absolute.  That is, it is particular experiences and facts are the basis of any encounter with the Absolute.  Paul's experience on the road to Damascus, Abraham's sacrifice, the experience of the Apostles at the Transfiguration:  these are all moments of contact with the Absolute, and all by virtue of particular experiences -- not readily spoken of, because so difficult to verify and impossible to repeat  (the stories that come from these moments are full of facts so uncommon and non-universal that even believers still ask ourselves, "Was Paul an epileptic?"  "Is Abraham's sacrifice a myth?").</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>This is a good point. Particular experiences do matter with respect to our individual relationships to faith.
<BR>
<BR>The New Testament incidents you cite (the Transfiguration and the Damascus Road) were special revelations peculiar to the Apostles. SK makes the point in a number of places that the Apostles are a special case and subject to their own peculiar dialectic of faith. Although SK doens't mention it, I would also put Mary in a peculiar category, one distinct from both that of the Apostles and of ourselves.
<BR>
<BR>When SK discusses disciples contemporary with Jesus vs. those of later generations, he is referring to everyone who is not subject to some special category of revelation. He is talking about the multitude that was not granted visits by Angels, experiences of the Transfiguration, or post-Resurrection encounters with Jesus. People like the Centurion or Nicodemus.
<BR>
<BR>It is clear from the NT that Jesus pursued different policies with respect to the Apostles and the mass of people. To the Apostles He granted special revelations that removed them from the ordinary dialectic of faith. He did what was necessary to secure their belief, going as far as inviting the skeptical Thomas to examine His wounds so the he might believe.
<BR>
<BR>To the mass of people he deliberately remained mysterious. He spoke in parables which he explained privately to the Apostles but no one else (Mark 4:11-12). He performed some mysterious deeds, true, but so did others (e.g. Simon Magus). And he performed these deeds only after people had manifested faith, not before. To the ordinary Palestinian He was a carpenter from Nazareth who taught in parables, performed some mysterious deeds, and made some extraordinary claims about Himself. And this was no accident. It was all part of the plan.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The Incarnation, of course, is the ultimate example of particularity -- How are we to verify in any way that this man Jesus was in fact God?  And the answer seems clear that many more possibilities were open to the first believers than are available today.  One could, at minimum, follow this Jesus around for an extended period and judge whether his behavior was consistent with his claims.  One could ask direct questions and get answers.  Even the Gospel account has Jesus recognizing that the time of his Incarnation was unique -- remember the passage where he absolved his followers from fasting while the "bridegroom" was still with them?  It therefore seems meaningless to assert that the differences between generations' experience of Christ are "accidental."  Accidental, yes, and that's the very scandal of it, the scandal of particularity.  That it is accidental, however, does not reduce the impact on our faith of our modern inability to talk to Jesus face to face.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I wonder what you believe one could secure by such a face to face encounter with Jesus. He had a deliberate policy of mystery with respect to non-Apostles. The Gospels are full of people who tried to get the better of Him in dialogue and trick Him into revealing Himself. The result was always that the interrogator stood revealed rather than Jesus. The very concept of trying to trick God into revealing Himself through an encounter has interesting implications. What sort of God is bested by one of His creatures? I am interested in what question followed by what answer is decisive proof that the respondent is God.
<BR>
<BR>I also wonder how we could judge whether His behavior was consistent with His claims. What is God Incarnate supposed to act like? Is he supposed to irritate the authorities and get Himself crucified? Everybody, including the Apostles, thought the answer was no. Jesus's behavior baffled everyone, not excluding His Apostles and His own Mother.  And well it should. There is no and could be no precedent for the life of God Incarnate.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I am puzzled why SK ignores the consequent importance of particularity, in this and other ramifications of the Incarnation.  His philosophical underpinnings (his "metaphysics," if you will) seem amazingly untouched by Incarnation, and this disconnect seems to me the the biggest weakness of his thought-world.  For example, SK spends long pages considering the subjective and the objective, and the tincture of the object which always interferes with pure human subjectivity, without apparently thinking about the fact that a human being, by definition, has an imperfect body (aging, mortal).  Nor, in his discussions of the immanent and the transcendent, does SK recognize that for a human being to truly experience the transcendent, his or her body would have either to be taken along or left behind.  And even when speaking about the offense of faith given by the Incarnation itself, he fails to consider that the Incarnation literally alters God.  That is, pre-Christ, God was not human in any way.  Post-Christ, God has taken on humanity  -- it is a shift in the underpinnings of philosophy, so that what could not be said about the Divine before now _must_ be said.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>The scandal of particularity is that the eternal became temporal, the univeral become singular, the Word become Flesh, the Truth become Man in Jesus Christ. It is this very reason why the attempt to capture Jesus immanently with respect to our universal categories of thought is a non-starter. With what truth would we question Truth Himself to determine whether He was Truth? A truth that transcends the Truth? This is what the Pharisees attempted to do. Or to what ideal life would we compare the Ideal Himself to determine whether He is really the Ideal? This was the mistake of Peter (Matt. 16:22-23).
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Given the importance for generating a Christian metaphysics of the Incarnation in particular, and particularity in general, I cannot accept SK's claim that we are all equally in contact with the Incarnation.  That we are all equally loved, or all equally salvageable, I can believe.  But no one can claim that we are all called, like Abraham, to sacrifice a son.  No one can claim we could all be knocked blind to the ground and converted with the drama of Paul.  And if these particular events created special opportunities in faith for these particular individuals, how could the direct experience of the Incarnation fail to do so?</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Because the ordinary first-century Palestinian was not knocked from his horse or privy to the Transfiguration. In some respects, we have an advantage over them because they wouldn't have even heard of the Transfiguration or the Resurrrection until after Pentecost - i.e. until Jesus was no longer present in human form on the Earth. What scandalized the Pharisees and everyone else was that this carpenter from Nazareth who claimed to be God seemed so much like everyone else. There was no direct transition from the external facts of His life to the truth that He was God. A subjective determination in faith was necessary.
