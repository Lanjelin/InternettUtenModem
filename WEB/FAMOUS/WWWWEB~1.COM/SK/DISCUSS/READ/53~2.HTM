Hi, everyone! This is a really exciting discussion, and I wanted to chime in--at this point in the conversation and not later, because I this is where I have my opinion.
<BR>	While I was gone I reread <I>Fear and Trembling</I>, and this time, I truly understood a lot more about it; I couldn't help but think of how brilliant SK was.  At any rate, I believe that Johannes Climacus is taking Abraham "out of context," as it was.  It, indeed is impossible to explain Abraham's actions in any ethical terms.  However, Abraham knew, as he was promised by God, that he would be the patriarch of a great and numerous family.  In that, Abraham did many things we would probably consider unethical--not only almost sacrificing Isaac, but also rejecting Ishmael.  And yet, even at the moment when Abraham had pulled his knife at Mount Moriah, he still knew God would keep his promise in the face of all impossibility.  I think what I'm trying to point out that it's impossible to look at the Abraham/Isaac story in ethical terms; one only understands it in the terms of faith, and faith is a constant suspension of the ethical--for in the ethical we go rules and logic and what we can understand; when we go by terms of faith, we deal with God.  However, since God is good (if one believes that God created the universe <I>ex nihilo</I>, one should believe that God is the source of all good, as it wouldn't make sense for God to posit Himself as the source of bad in the universe, would it?)  Thus, if one is a Knight of Faith, one can never do anything "bad," however unethical (or impossible, for faith also suspends the possible) such acts might be.  (I hope I'm not stealing Anthony's thunder, by the way; I think that, however cryptic he may be at times, he's really helped make this a forum for some very interesting conversation.  I just have to start reading his messages a couple times in a row, as one reads Shelley's "Mont Blanc").  To summarize, though: when we live in the ethical, we're like caterpillars: we scrounge along the ground, we hardly think we can fly; yet with faith, we see everything differently; what seemed impossible, is now a way of life.  I know that probably makes my point seem to simple, but,    hey, it's what I could think of.  It may be terrible, from the ethical point of view, to be in the          prescence of the living God, but with faith it is wonderful, and I'm currently trying to work with such faith in my own life.  I very much welcome responses, of course.
