<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Well, for me (as if you all wanted to know), because I agree with Christianity, because I see the importance of the individual to God and the life of active love, of a God who created the universe and every soul in it, as the ideals I think exists.  I have fundamental disagreements with how Buddha and Mohammed approached faith; obviously, they too dealt with subjective knowledge, so the basis of calling them wrong is very shaky, and I wouldn't do that--all I can say is that I am personally a Christian because it goes hand in hand with my observations about the world around me.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Of course, any of you can (and should) argue that this is truly silly; that I'm a Christian simply because I feel like being a Christian, etc., etc.  I'm going to try to defend my position in a discussion of Don Quijote up above; but I'm a Christian for purely subjective reasons.  At least it's the subjectivity <EM>I</EM> believe in.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>Very good.  This is a great start.  I share many of your sentiments.  But I still have a few questions.  The first one can be presented as: Which comes first, revelation or the soul's desire for it? In other words, do we simply realize how much better-off we would be if we believed, and then look around for the best story, picture, dogma, or belief that summarizes what we think would be the best thing to belief in?  
<BR>   I think it is, or should be the other way around.  Here I am in the United States.  I have heard the gospel story thousands of times, so many times, in fact, that it could be tempting (it is for some) to become hardened to it.  But instead, every time I here the story, when it is presented with passion, I cannot help but be moved.  The sacrifice of a father for me, and the other themes that speak of God's love--who can resist such emotional power?
<BR>    So I am presented with the story.  Like the peasant who learns that the king wants him to marry his daughter, I have a choice of believing it or not.  The reason the story has such power is precisely because my heart so longs for it to be true.  My heart longs to believe that God exists.  But what if he loves me with the love of a father who would sacrifice his only Son, indeed himself, for me?  Shall I believe this?  Faith is courageous hope in this sense. Hope beyond hope.  Hope where little hope is provided, other than the story itself.  But is that all?  What about natural revelation?  Indeed, the story even seems to coincide with my instincts concerning what has worth and meaning (roughly, natural revelation).  This is my starting point.  Faith or not faith.  (Tillich has said that we need a verb for faith -- faithing).  To leap or not to leap.  Can it be?  What if it isn't?  Can I stake my life on it?  I am reminded of the movie, Braveheart, which I think illustrates this.  Near the end of the movie, William Wallace had been betrayed by Robert the Bruce in a decisive battle.  Wallace receives word that the Bruce wishes to see him at Edinburgh (the handkerchief of Wallace's wife is presented as a guarantee).  Is it a trap?  Can he trust him, after what has happened?  He believes that the Bruce was sincere when he made his pledge.  But what about now?  He must decide whether to have faith in Robert's word or not.  Wallace decides to go ahead to Edinburgh, unarmed.  It turns out that this is his undoing, as the other nobles betray him without Robert the Bruce's knowledge.  The stakes were high; the outcome is tragic.  But we know that Wallace was right to trust the Bruce, his friend; the other noble's actions were unforseen.
<BR>   OK, now the application.  We have received this word.  If it is true, it presents the possibility of victory, the hope of our entire lives.  If it is false, and we believe it, we believed a lie and we are left with nothing.  I really think Pascal was on to something.  
<BR>   We believe because it "jives" with what seems true in our hearts.   The troubling question is what to do with these other religions.  It seems to me that they need not be considered until they present themselves as a real option.  What we need to ask ourselves is what is the truth we have been given so far?  Does it still present the opportunity of changing lives in this world?  If so, we can, with good conscience, offer the story to anyone else who might see a similar resonance in their heart.  Does Christianity have exclusive rights to religious insight?  Surely not.  But is it true for me?  Can it be true for others?  
<BR>   People in other cultures might feel similarly about their religions as I do about mine.  If so, I would like to hear their stories.  Honestly, though, I don't know how any story could impact me more than that God has become a man in a single individual.  This, I think, is the basis for the traditionally exclusive claims of Christianity.  It seems that once one makes the leap to the ultimate paradox, all other leaps seem, in at least this respect, inferior.  I'd like to offer this as a point of discussion -- Is there a distinciveness about Christianity, based upon the ultimacy of the paradox, that would seem to make it the basis for the salvation of the whole world (universally)?  I'm not intending to ask the question about universal salvation.  What I mean is this: Is is true that if any other people are to come into relaitonship with God, the fullest expression of that is in Christianity.  Furthermore, can people exist "Christianly" in a Kierkegaardian sense in other religions?
