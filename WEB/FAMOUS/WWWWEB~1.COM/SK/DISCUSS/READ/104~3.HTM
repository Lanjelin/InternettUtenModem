<BR>I was speaking of "moods" in the sense of those ramdom emotions arising essentially from our personal biological circumstances.  In a rough sense, I am referring to those moods we experience because of our accidental historical, bio-chemical, and genetic make-up.  These are moods that we experience as given to us rather than that we create or make.  As random, these emotion would be not understandable, by definition.
<BR>
<BR>I think one of the focuses Kierkegaard had was that he tried to precisely distinguish between different emotions.  He did this in part based on a view that our life circumstances are essentially random or contingent, and that our accidental circumstances includes a set of given emotional states which are peculiar to each of us personally.  The distinction to be made between moods, then, he made based on the type of response we would each make to these random circumstances.  And in the ethical and religious, as opposed to the esthetic, the response to changing life circumstances is that the individual will be unchanging; that he will be resolved to hold fast to that which he has committed to.
<BR>
<BR>For example, Judge William was ethically committed to his wife.  In this, he recognized completely the contingent nature of his first love for her: perhaps when they met the light was right, his mood happened to coincide with hers, she might of unconsciously reminded him of someone else he loved or respected.  But in any case, the original circumstances do not matter to him now, for he has committed to her.  And this committment means not just to hold onto a legal relationship, but to hold onto his original mood, his original love of her.  Thus, even if she changes, even if she becomes someone different then she was when he married her, as so often happens in a marriage, he will affirmatively hold fast to his original love, now and forever.
<BR>
<BR>In his journal entries, K stated that he might write about what he called "the most beautiful and noble, humanly speaking, forms of despair ... "  One of these forms was grief.  I puzzled over this for a good while.  Why grief?  What is it about grief that makes it so much higher than other human emotions?  I now think it relates to the point I just made.  Suppose, for example, that Judge Williams wife died.  What would happen to his commitment to hold onto his original mood, his original love for her?  Well, his commitment would still remain, but the content would change to grief.  It is precisely the fact that he maintains the commitment to remember his love of her that makes him grieve.  Grief is the emotion which remembers a lost loved one, not just as a memory, but as one who was treasured, and still is in the remembrance.  And so, Judge William, who committed to love her forever, will now, if he is true and unchangeable in that committment, grieve for her.
<BR>
<BR>I think the poetic moods you are referring to K would categorize as esthetic-ironic in nature.  He seemed to have a strong sense of the power of the poet to take his own random, accidental life circumstances and moods and idealize them into a recollection which not only made him able to communicate his personal insights to others, but also made his moods capable of being maintained or repeated at will.
<BR>
<BR>But I go on too long.  I hope some of this makes sense.
<BR>
<BR>A technical question: when I type these posts, each paragraph is one long sentence across the page.  My postings are formatted correctly, so it must be my browser.  What am I doing wrong?  I am using Nescape 2.0.
