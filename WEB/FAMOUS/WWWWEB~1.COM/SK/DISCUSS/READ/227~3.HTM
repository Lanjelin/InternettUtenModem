A number of posts here in the last few weeks have discussed the link between historical fact and faith.  The question, in general terms, has been whether we have to believe that certain things happened in order to have faith in related truths.  For example, must there have been a historical Jesus Christ, and is his death and resurrection required, for one to accept the existence of the Christian God?
<BR>
<BR>My understanding was that several people who wrote were arguing in favor of a subjective standard of faith, and denying the necessity of objective facts-in-the-world to support faith.  I disagree, and in the interest of clarifying the debate, I would like to define terms, and perhaps introduce a new term to describe a subset of objective facts. 
<BR>I. Objective Facts
<BR>
<BR>I understand objective facts as those which have an existence separate from an individual consciousness.  For example, the existence of snow on a ski slope, and its quality of coldness is relatively objective.  The snow is there for everyone, and while details of its qualities may be open to dispute, only personns with disordered senses will be unable to perceive it, or to determine that it is cold to the touch.  Of course, because the edges of the "objective" are blurred (precisely because perceptions are more in the camp of the subjective).  The essence of objectivity, or the realm of the objective, is its quality of "being there," and its ability to unfold into individual consciousnesses in very similar ways (snow, white, cold).  Objective facts are generally easier to turn into language, because they are common to many, if not all, persons with fully functioning bodies and minds.
<BR>
<BR>II. Subjective Facts
<BR>
<BR>The realm of the subjective begins at the intersection of objective facts with a human consciousness, and so creates some confusion.  While snow's whiteness and coldness may be beyond dispute, my reaction to it (snow, cold, bad; or, snow, white, pretty) is entirely up to me.  The realm of the subjective gets harder to talk about as it recedes from common experience, until at its last borders it becomes impossible to assign meaningful words to the subjective experience.  Again, my definition is not indisputable or beyond further clarification, but it does provide me with the basis to explain a new category of fact (as I am using the word "fact," by the way, it includes the ordinary meaning of "event" and "thing").
<BR>
<BR>III.  Particular Facts
<BR>
<BR>Particular facts fall within the category of the objective, in my understanding.  I think that some posts here have put particularity in the realm of the subjective, and that is exactly the source of my disagreement with the argument that faith must have a subjective basis.
<BR>
<BR>As moderns and Westerns we prefer our objective facts to be verifiable and repeatable.  Empirical sciense, indeed, cannot categorize and thus ignores the unique or unrepeatable event.  Because we are highly influenced by physical science's triumphs of discovery, we tend to follow the example of that discipline, and exclude the unique and unrepeatable from our consciousness.  We need something more than a report of facts -- we crave to fit things into a system, to find first principles from which we could have predicted facts.  There is, in short, a bias in our culture against giving too much significance to the singular, the particular.
<BR>
<BR>Inadvertently, perhaps, we have built a web of verification evices for all the facts we rely on in our daily cultural life, even particular facts.  For example, the assassination of John F Kennedy is preserved on film, and in books of evidence gathered from the crime scene and from witnesses.  We have preserved the assassination in a repeatable, verifiable form.  Things that we cannot so preserve, we doubt.  For example, we doubt eyewitness testimony as a matter of course (and of law) when there are no physical, verifiable facts to support the claims.  Particularity --  unrepeatability -- scandalizes us.  But particularity is the very stuff of daily life.  When the cameras aren't running and the facts relayed are personal, all we have is particularity, which as I say, we marginalize.  What happened once might as well not have happened at all.  
<BR>
<BR>Christian faith, unfortunately for us moderns, arose in a culture that had more comfort with the particular.  No one thought to save a piece of the cross, or a blood sample, to prove to us the underlying facts.  But the report we receive is not one of subjective facts, it is of particular facts.  The ministry, death and resurrection of Christ has been reported as something that happened in the world, in full view of many -- a piece of news to be accepted or rejected.  The facts claimed -- the stated basis for the demand on us: "You must believe these things" is not an appeal to the subjective, it is an argument based on particular fact.
<BR>
<BR>I say the response to this report has to be based on the objective (particular) facts claimed, because to do otherwise is to sunder faith from its own claims and to render it a fairy tale.  Faith in the Christian God is based on responding to the actual God who is summoning.  Morals (our daily habits) are the human response to faith.  The particular facts, however, must color our morals: was Christ truly human (and must the human form then be treated as sacred?) or did he merely appear to be (and is the body then evil?).  it is important to remember that people have disagreed about these things, and that repugnant morals have been exercised in the name of the same God. The Roman Catholics disagreed violently with the Cathars who condemned the body;  the Crusades exhibit a belief that evangelization can be accomplished with a sword.  Our own era thinks that just being nice and getting along well with other is the core teaching of the faith. These variations are based on overlays onto the particular facts preached.  As we recede more into these overlays, we increase the risk of worshipping an image in our mind, not the God who beckons, and slip quickly into crypto-idolatry: a form of despair.  Throughout history, people have struggled to uncover the historical and particular facts underlying the faith, in order to improve that faith (the Reformation, form criticism).
<BR>
<BR>Likewise, in SK's thought, a relation to the absolute also assumes the objective existence of an absolute, and the proper (particular) understanding of the knight of faith of his/her relationship to it.  Wrong beliefs about the absolute have consequences here, too:  Remember SK's reference to an ordinary person who wrongly adopts the chimerical belief that, like Abraham, he is being called to kill his child.  (Fear and Trembling, quite early on).
<BR>
<BR>The facts of faith are thus both objective and unrepeatable, and this scandalizes us.  It is, however, consistent with the doctrine of incarnation.  The word becomes flesh and dwells among us -- once, briefly, and never again.   The vulnerability of divine enfleshment is preciseley that it must have happened for Christian faith to have relevance.  The vulnerability is that we can ignore it.  Because it has happened but once (like any other human life), we are left free to decide that it might as well never have happened at all.  
<BR>Faith (in God or in relation to the absolute) is always at risk of being overtaken by the facts.
<BR>
<BR>Will someone please take the oppposite position and explain how faith can be defended as a subjective exercise?
