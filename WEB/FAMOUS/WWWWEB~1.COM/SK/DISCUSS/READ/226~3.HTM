<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Is it possible to love selflessly?  SK seems to think so, but it's hard for me to see this as anything but a pipe dream.  Certainly, there are works of love that are more or less selfless, but is it really possible to love everyone indiscriminately?  Is it even desireable?  Is this what Christianity requires, or is SK simply transmogrifying the message?</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Scheler writes in _Ressentiment_ that the Christian ideal of love inverts the pagan ideal.  Pagan love, according to Scheler, is the tendency of the lower to reach out to the higher.  Idealized pagan love is the striving of the human to be like the divine.  The ideal of Christian love (charity), quite to the contrary, is expressed by the divine reaching down and lifting up the human.
<BR>
<BR>As so often happens in matters of Christian morals, any possible human expression of love must by definition fall short of the ideal that is expressed in the divine.  The ideal in human expressions of love, of course, is the Christian who deliberately seeks to obscure himself in the transaction of charity in order that the recipient may experience the divine source of charity ("I must decrease that Christ may increase").  This self-abasement, however, can only be partial, as the kernel of the will that chose to be an imager of the divine remains, and remains in some ways imperfect. 
<BR>
<BR>It seems to me, therefore, that any human expression of charity has to be involved a little bit with the self who wills to offer love.  In expressing a love that originates with a perfect deity, I am to some extent measuring myself against that deity and the object of my charity, and by that second movement, am inexorably drawn back to myself.
<BR>
<BR>SK's knight of faith is the one who can perform the first movement without being drawn into the second.  This, for me, is where the division between the universal and the absolute is particularly helpful in understanding the demands of Christian faith.
<BR>
<BR>In the universal realm, I can only act like a Kantian -- I choose an act that comports with the universal: I measure the value of my choice against a shared human understanding of the absolute standard.  But the fact of measuring it against myself as one self among many pulls me away from an ideal expression of love.  If I could transend the universal, I might also transcend the self-measuring of myself and so achieve a (literally, almost) selfless act of love.
<BR>
<BR>The problem, as always, is finding the source of the absolute demand for acts of love, and defining love so that it is recognizable in both the realm of the universal and of the absolute.  I wonder whether love (of a sort that has any meaning to me as a human) might be native only to the realm of the universal.  Any thoughts on how to talk about love as part of the absolute relation to the absolute, without separating it so far from human expressions of love in the universal realm that it becomes unrecognizable as such?
