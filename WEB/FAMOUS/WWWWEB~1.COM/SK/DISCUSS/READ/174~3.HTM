<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;>. . . .  Some say that it is not necessary to affirm that the Christ event actually occurred at all.  All that is needed is to internalize the meaning that you gain from the story as a story ultimately about yourself.  . . . .  [I]f faith entails belief in the content (historical), how can it avoid the results of critical and historical scholarship?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;___________________</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;     SK's conceptual separation of the universal from the absolute seems to put SK's "faith" beyond the argument that the objective reality of the Christ event is irrelevant to Christian belief.  You surprised me when you said you think SK's faith requires belief even if the external facts on which faith is predicated were proven false.  I would be interested to know from where in SK's writings you draw that conclusion.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Perhaps that is part of the risk of the leap?  I think that Kierkegaard would say that no amount of historical information can prove anything decisively.  Historical investigation is based on probabilities.  He even says (I think in the Postscript) that the successes of historical research actually hinder faith, because it leads one to be tempted to found faith upon that "evidedence".  I get the feeling that he thinks that it would in fact be better for Christians if there were significant evidence against the historicity.  Then it would require greater risk.  But, maybe he doesn't have to go that far.  
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;    In my response here, I am going to borrow Walker Percy's </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;vocabulary (yes, I know -- it's like citing Will Durant to explain</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Plato).  I think SK sees the life of Christ as a piece of news. It is</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;an account of a single, unrepeatable event, that is difficult (maybe</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;impossible) for us to verify now.  But this does not mean, I don't</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;think, that the accuracy of the news account is beyond SK's concern.  </I></FONT>
<BR>I like this analogy of a piece of news.  I think you are right; in fact, the accuracy might even be of ultimate concern, but in a different way than what is normally thought.  In other words, whether the witness corresponds to a historical event can never be determined, however, that it does in fact correspond is the question which I can accept in faith or reject in offense. 
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I think SK is so focused on the contact of the single individual with</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;the absolute, that the importance of the initial news (not its</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;accuracy) is of less concern to him.  An individual in relation with</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;the absolute quickly enters an unreportable state, like Abraham in </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Fear and Trembling.  He has an experience that is beyond becoming </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;news, that is not susceptible of being shared (universalized), and</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;this absolute experience is the goal and core of faith.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I agree.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;   The fact that the relation to the absolute supplants the relation</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; to the universal does not, I believe, vitiate the value of the </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;universal.  I don't think SK carefully considered the possibility of</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; discovering Christ's bones in a tomb in Jerusalem (that </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;preoccupation seems to have developed post-SK, as a reaction to form</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;criticism's demonstration that much of the Bible is not intended to</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;be historical, and that much of what is is mistaken), but if SK had</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; considered this particular risk, I do not think he would have </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;brushed it aside as irrelevant.  In another instance where the </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;Bible's accuracy had been impeached, SK did find a way to work with</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;(or around) the gap.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>What do you mean in your distinction between the absolute and the universal?  (I have not yet read [i]Fear and Trembling[i]).  If he would not think that it was irrelevant, how would he respond?  I think that he would say that it is still necessary to believe that the event occurred, the historians must be mistaken.  They can never prove their claim any stronger than the Christians can.  I think it is part of the risk.  But the question arises, could a person believe if such underming evidence were found?  What would be the reason for believing? The beauty of the story? What it does to one's heart?  Maybe.  Actually, I think this is why people do believe.  Later they interpret, through the "eyes of faith", their spirit's uprising as responding to the Holy Spirit, "the god who provides the condition."
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;   ... SK, instead, effectively ignored the legend of the Fall (the</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; false set of news-type information), and constructed a Christian </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;theory of sine based on the universal.  You may argue that he would </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;have been able to do the same with the Christ narrative, but I think</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; the fact that he did not is important, and indicates his belief in</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt; its accuracy.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>Some people have done the same with the Christ narrative, treating it as a mere myth.  But even Bultmann recognized the need to loacate the truth in a historical event.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;   Based on SK's handling of the myth of the Fall and his dependence >on historical narrative in other writings, it seems that he was alive >to the importance of the veracity of the pieces of news on which we >base faith or belief in the world. </I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>Kierkegaard does acknowledge the importance of the object of our faith, subjectively, but the verifiableness of the documents, witnesses, etc. is unimportant for a believer.  
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;   I would appreciate it if you tell me the source of your impression</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;that SK doesn't care about the objective accuracy of the death and </I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;resurrection accounts.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>"Anyone who as a believer posists inspiration must consistently regard every critical deliberation -- whether for or against--as something dubious, a kind f temptation."  Postscript, p. 26, Hong tran., Princeton.
<BR>
<BR>"Thus everything is assumed to be in order with regard to the Holy Scriptures -- what then?  Has this person who did not believe come a single step closer to faith?  No, not a single step.  Faith does not result from straightforward scholarly deliberation, nor does it come directly; on the contrary, in this objectivity one loses that infinite, personal, impassioned interestedness, which is the condition of faith, ... the [everywhere and nowhere] in which faith can come into existence." -- ibid., p. 29.
<BR>
<BR>So my question remains, how can I avoid allowing critical, schollarly, historical, investigation to affect my faith, and still maintain that the object of my faith is historical?  (See the footnote on p. 24, if you have a copy.)
<BR>
<BR>--I will see if I can find Walker Percy's book.
