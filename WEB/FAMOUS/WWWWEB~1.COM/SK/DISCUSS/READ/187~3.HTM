<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;James Smith's comment raises a point that often troubles me, both in thinking about SK and in trying to maintain my Christian faith.  There is no question that SK, and all of us, had to recognize that the sources of his faith were open to question on scientific and historical grounds.  SK did not believe the story of the Fall in Genesis, and his discussion of anxiety effectively says that the idea of sin coming into the world through one man (as the Roman Catholic mass has it) is illogical, and leads to all sorts of wrong questions about sin, sinfulness and the psychology of anxiety.  I agree with SK's analysis of sin and anxiety.  I also agree, because I am persuaded by human investigation of evolution as recorded in fossils and other physical evidence, that there probably was no historical Adam or Eve.  The results of other human inquiry have persuaded me that the gospels were probably not put into written form for thirty years after the events they recount, and that a number of the most compelling passages are historically inaccurate.</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>I frankly don't know if the fall was historically accurate or not.  I think, though, that wondering "Did the snake talk?", etc., etc., and refuting the the whole story based on fossil evidence and the like takes away from the spiritual ideas that the story is trying to convey, about the imperfect state of humans, and so on.  The story of Job perhaps never happened, but we still must come to terms with what it meant.  What worries me about saying "Jesus never said this one," is not so much that the methods used to figure out of Jesus said something were shaky, but that this now means to people that they no longer have to deal with because "Jesus didn't say it."  "I bring not peace but a sword," for example, is something to be grappled with, not dismissed out of hand.  People who go constantly looking for historical evidence to prove their ideas, whether they are evolutionists or "scientific creationists" (to take one contraversy), both bother me.
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;This leads us to the troubling question (again, troubling for SK study and troubling for life), what is the basis of faith?  If every element of the gospel account is false -- if Christ never rose from the dead, if he never spoke the Beatitudes -- then what is the basis for SK's leap of faith?  Is SK inviting us to leap into something that has a basis in objective, verifiable reality or is his leap the same sort of useful illusion as Newton's belief in ether, or Ptolemaic astronomy?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;If God did not become incarnate, then there is no fact to support the idea that the leap of faith leads somewhere, because there is no basis to believe that every single individual is invited into an absolute relation to the absolute.  That is, there is no basis to believe that we are all, like Abraham, invited to have faith.  It is of course possible to believe this without believing in the incarnation, its just that the data to support the belief is negted. The Christian is then left in the position of the person who told Bertrand Russell that the universe was really the back of a giant turtle, standing on another giant turtle.  You may recall the response when Russell asked what that second turtle was standing on: "It's turtles all the way down."</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;I reject the idea that Christian faith is turtles all the way down, just as I reject the thought that it doesn't matter whether the universe is filled with ether, or whether the earth moves and rotates. Objective reality matters because we have nothing else.  A reliance on subjective beliefs that are not grounded in the verifiable always leads to chimerical beliefs -- turtles, ether, phlogiston, homunculi.</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>At this point, you answered your own question, "What is the basis of faith?"  One way to define it is a belief in things that are beyond objective reality (if there is such a thing as objective reality to begin with).  We must depend on the subjective leap of faith to make it to the relation with the absolute.  To say that a reliance on the subjective always leads to chimerical beliefs is a generalization, and therefore not logical (right, philosphy students?)
<BR> 
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;To say the question in another way: How do we know if there *is* an absolute relation to the absolute? In Fear and Trembling, is SK right to say Abraham was obeying the imperative of a higher morality in deciding to sacrifice Isaac?  Or it wrong place a chasm between Abraham's gory intention (which is oh so right), and the petty bourgeouis who can achieve only resignation (which an expression of the universal)?  How do we know if we have no basis to know whether reality will support a relation between the single individual (any single individual) and the absolute?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;The answer, whatever it is, is bound inextricably to the answer to where the line is drawn between acceptable and unacceptable doubt about the facts underlying faith. Must Christ have said certain of the words attributed to Him for faith and its leap to have meaning?  Must He have truly, physically, and verifiably risen from the dead?  Can we believe he was the incarnation of the Divine in a unique way that changed humanity's position with respect to the absolute, if nothing we are told about the events that effected that change can be verified?  What must be verifiable?  If nothing that took place can be verified at this remove of time and space, then what facts must we believe, what is the proof to support that the absolute and the individual can meet beyond the universal?</I></FONT>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;</I></FONT>
<BR>As "Johannes de Silento" says in <I>Fear and Trembling</I>, those with faith believe in the absurd, the impossible, because it is absurd and impossible, but for God all things are possible.  It's my contention that under such a view, historical facts seem just as subjective as a leap of faith.  Mathematics, which is as pure a science there is, eventually reduces to contradictory principles; mathematical systems without contradictory princples aren't very interesting; and thus, one is left with taking mathematics on subjective faith.
<BR>
<BR><FONT  COLOR=c0c0c0><I>&gt;This proof seems very important to me, because if there is no absolute that each of us must find for him or herself, then we seem to be blocked from transcending the universal.  If everyone has access to the "absolute" in the same way as everyone else (because the absolute has no objective reality), and the relationship we perceive is merely the (universal) human need for religious belief, then aren't we really talking about the universal, only in disguise as the absolute?  Isn't the possiblity of transcendence removed if the relation into which we enter is not with another single individual, but rather with an abstract concept that is the same for all?</I></FONT>
<BR>
<BR>In my opinion, accepting the Absolute on a leap of faith is much better than being stuck in the universal; but then, I believe in the Absolute.  But you raise an interesting, totally hypothetical question: if there was no Absolute, would there be a human need for religious belief?  Actually, I was discussing this with a friend the other day, and I believe that, even though God created us, some people just don't seem to have the need to come to terms with major questions about God and why they exist, and so on.  Perhaps it's just a front.
