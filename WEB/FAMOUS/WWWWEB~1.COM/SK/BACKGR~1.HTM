S&oslash;ren Kierkegaards father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard (1756-1838)<P>

S&Oslash;REN  KIERKEGAARD  was  born  in  Copenhagen  on  the   5th  of
 May 1813.  Both on  his father's  and his  mother's side  he was
 of  Jutlandish  descent.  His  father  came  from  a  poor moorland
 farm in a  small village  in West  Jutland, about  10 miles
 from  Ringk&oslash;bing.  As  a  boy  he  was made  to watch  the sheep
 on the  heath and  suffered cold  and hardship.  But at  the age
 of  12  years  he was  sent to  Copenhagen to  live with  a maternal
  uncle  who  was  a  prosperous  tradesman.  Here  he  received
 an education and  established himself  in his  24th year.
 He  made  his  way  with  astonishing rapidity  and was  able to
 retire from business  at the  age of  40 and  spend the  rest of
 his life as a wealthy man of leisure.  He did  not die  until he
 had  reached  his  82nd  year,  in  1838. At  that time  his son
 S&oslash;ren was 25 years old.<P>                                        
   His  mother,  too,  came  from  a  Jutland   moorland  region,
 where her father  was a  smallholder. She  was the  senior Kierkegaard's
  second  wife and  mother of  all his  seven children.
 She first came to the house as a servant  girl, but  married her
 husband  not  much  more  than  a  year after  the death  of his
 first  wife.  While  S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard,  time  and  time again,
 makes  mention  of  his  father,  who  was the  overwhelming influence
 in his life, he speaks of his mother hardly at  all. She
 has  been described  by other  people as  a kind,  cheerful, motherly
  woman.  It  would seem  that the  lighter side  of S&oslash;ren
 Kierkegaard's  nature  was  inherited  from  her.  She  died  in
 1834, when S&oslash;ren was 21.<P>

   S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard  was  the  youngest  of  the family  of seven.
  When he  was born  his father  was 56  and his  mother 45,
 and he often called  himself a  child of  old age.  The patriarchal,
 self-willed  father dominated  the home.  He was  a highly
 gifted  man,  self-taught,  but  well-read,  and  much  occupied
 with  spiritual  matters.  His  religious  denomination  was the
 pietistic  Herrnhuter  'fraternity'.  He  had  a sombre  view of
 life and brought up his children to a strict form  of Christianity,
  which  particularly emphasized  the sufferings  of Christ.
 He  suffered  from  periodic  attacks  of  depression, awareness
 of  sin and  scrupulosity. He  especially doubted  the salvation
 of his soul.   <P>                                                

   There  is  no doubt  that it  was from  his father  that S&oslash;ren
 Kierkegaard  inherited  the deepest  layers of  his personality,
 the  periodic  depressions  that  weighed him  down, as  well as
 the  outstanding powers  of thought,  both the  penetrating dialectic
  intelligence  and  the  passionate imagination.  In 'The
 Viewpoint  of  My  Authorship'  Kierkegaard  writes  in  a purely
 biographical vein: <P>                                         
   "As  a  child  I  was  strictly  and  earnestly brought  up to
 Christianity,  humanly  speaking,  insanely  brought   up:  even
 in  my  earliest childhood  I had  been overstrained  by impressions
  which  were  laid  upon  me  by  the  melancholy  old man
 who  was  himself  oppressed  by  them   --  a   child,  insanely
 travestied as a melancholy old man."<P>                           
   Elsewhere  is  written: "I  owe everything  to my  father from
 the very  start. When  he, melancholy  as he  was, saw  me looking
 sad, he would say, 'See that you duly love Jesus Christ.'"<P>
   It  was  particularly  the  suffering  Christ that  the father
 presented  to  the  child. His  son says  that from  boyhood upwards
  he  was  brought  up  to  the  view  that the  truth must
 suffer  and  be  derided and  scorned. He  mentions as  well the
 indignation  he  had  felt from  childhood because,  long before
 he had experienced  it himself,  he had  learned that  the world
 was  ruled by  lies, meanness  and injustice.  "Even as  a small
 child I was told, as  solemnly as  possible: that  everyone spat
 at  Christ  (who,  indeed,  was the  truth), that  the multitude
 (those who  passed by)  spat at  him and  said: 'Shame  on you.'
 I have kept this deep in my heart. This thought is my life."
   So it was. The picture  of Christ  which his  father impressed
 on  the  boy's  mind remained  with him  throughout his  life as
 the  dominating  experience.   In  several   places  Kierkegaard
 wrote  that  the  overwhelming  impression  of  Christ  made  in
 his  childhood  'humanly  speaking'  made  him  intensely miserable.
  "It  was  all  connected  with  the relationship  with my
 father,  the  person  I  have loved  most --  and what  does that
 mean?  It  means  thzt  he  is  just  the  person who  makes one
 miserable -- but out of love. His fault lay not in lack  of love,
 but  in confusing  an old  man with  a child."  But 'religiously
 speaking' in the long run  he was  grateful to  his father."From
 him I learnt  what paternal  affection means,  and thus  I was
 given the concept of divine paternal love,  the only  thing in
 life  which  is  firm  and  unshakable,  the  true Archimedean
 point."   <P>                                                    
                                                              
 In 1830 at the  age of  17, S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard passed  his matriculation
  examination  with  flying  colours  and  began at
 once to read theology. Very  little is  known about  his first
 years as a. student, but from  about 1834  begin the  first of
 his youthful notes that  have been  preserved. They  show that
 he was reading very widely  in the  spheres of  theology, philosophy
  and  aesthetics.  He  was particularly  interested in
 German  theology,  in  German  idealistic  philosophy  and romantic
 aesthetic literature.

In summers of 1834 and 1835 S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard  was in
 a state of violent mental unrest  and ferment. For a  time he
 was obliged to break off  his studies  entirely and  retire to
 Gilleleje, a coastal resort. There he attempted  to clarify  his thoughts
 and among other things wrote in his notes:                    
    "What I really need is to come to  terms with  myself about
 what I am to do, not  about what  I am  to know,  except insomuch
 as knowledge must precede every  act. It  is a  matter of
 understanding  my  destiny,  of seeing  what the  Divinity actually
 wants me to do; what counts is to  find a  truth, which
 is true for me, to find that idea  for which  I will  live and
 die." <BR>                                                        
 
When a  memorial stone  was erected  on Gilbjerg
 Head  at  Gilleleje in  1935 to  commemorate the  centenary of
 the  intellectual  emergence of  the young  Kierkegaard, these
 words  from his notebook were  inscribed on  the stone:
 "What is truth but  to live  for an  idea."
