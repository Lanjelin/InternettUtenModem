  <I>The  Repetition</i>  is  in  every  sense  an  extension  of  <I> Fear  and
  Trembling.</I>  The  concept  of  repetition is,  of course,  nothing else
  but  the  double  movement  of  infinity,  by  virtue  of   which  one
  repeats,  or  recovers,  the  world, after  first making  the negative
  movement  of  renunciation.  Yet  the  two  books  are not  alike. <I>The
  Repetition</i> treats faith psychologically. It is, as its sub-title says,
  "an   essay   in   experimental   psychology".   As   so    often   in
  Kierkegaard,  we  see  things  through  the eyes  of an  observer, and
  this  observer  is  a  man  interested  in the  problems but  not personally
  involved:  a  cool,  rather  ironic,   occasionally  somewhat
  cynical  philosopher  o f  life  who is  uncommitted to  religion, let
  alone Christianity.  <p>

One of the more authentic portraits of S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard is this drawing made i 1853. The artist was the lithographer H.P. Hansen, who is thought to have observed his subject from his window, which Kierkegaard passed daily on his walk through the city.

    Such   a   man   is   the   pseudonymous    character,   Constantine
  Constantius,   who   tells   the   story.  The   young  man   who  experiences
  a  love  affair  resembles  Kierkegaard  to  a   hair.  And
  the love affair resembles, to a hair, the one that he suffered.       
    The  book's  present  form  is  not,  however,  the   original  one,
  and  we  do  not  know  for  certain  how  the  first  version  ended.
  From  a  few  hints in  the journals  we may  conjecture that  it ended
  with  the  suicide  of  the  young man  in love,  probably because
  he  felt  unable  to  honour  the claims  of a  relationship initiated
  by  himself.  Thus  where  Kierkegaard  broke   off  and   went  away,
  his  alter  ego  committed  suicide.  These  are  two  different  ways
  of  solving  the  conflict:  the  conflict  which consists  in neither
  person   being   capable   of   making   the   double    movement   of
  infinity.<p>                                                             
    In  its  present  form,  however,  the book  has quite  another end-
  ing,   and  for   a  good   reason,  one   which  is   connected  with
  Kierkegaard's  own  experience.  We  must  remember  that  the  new
  phase in his production had been set  in motion  by the  little en-
  counter  outside  the  church,  when  Regine  had  nodded  to  him,
  filling  his  mind  with  ideas  which  both  alarmed him  and made
  him deepen  his concept  of faith  and visualize  it in  the double
  movement of infinity,  while maintaining  its intangibility  in the
  form  of  paradox.  When  can  a  smile  and  a  nod  have  had  so
  many consequences? <p>                                                
    But   returning   to   Copenhagen    from   Berlin,    with   two
  manuscripts  ready  for  the  press,  Kierkegaard was  staggered to
  learn  that  Regine  had  become  engaged. She  was engaged  to the
  young  man,  Fritz  Schlegel, who  had been  paying her  his attentions
  before  Kierkegaard  had  come  into  her  life,   and  with
  whom  she  had  become  reconciled.   To  Kierkegaard   this  meant
  that all he had envisaged after  that fateful  nod, all  the dreams
  he  had  dreamt  of  some  spiritual  marriage  between   them,  or
  at  least  mutual  loyalty,  married  or  unmarried, and  the whole
  system  of  thought  which  had  crystallized like  a pearl  in the
  mussel-shell of the  smile had  proved vain  and futile.  His world
  seemed  to crumble  and turn  to dust  at his  feet. He  would make
  a  laughing-stock  of himself  if he  were now  to publish  his new
  book,  in  which  the  hero   commits  suicide   from  disappointed
  love  --  because  his  own   loved  one   had  become   engaged  to
  another,  as  the  ending  of  <I>The  Repetition</i>  would of  course be
  maliciously  misinterpreted.  He  promptly tore  up the  last seven
  or eight pages  of his  manuscript (it  may even  have been  set up
  in  type) and  at top  speed wrote  a new  conclusion, in  which we
  learn that the girl  has married  another, and  in which  the hero,
  instead of  taking his  life, triumphantly  exclaims:<p> "I  am myself
  again; here I have the repetition; I understand all, and life seems
  finer  to  me now  than ever...  I am  myself again;  the machinery
  has  been  started  up.  Cut  are  the  meshes  I was  ensnared in;
  broken is the  spell that  had bewitched  me, so  that I  could not
  return to myself... It is over; my skiff is afloat. The next minute
 I  shall  be back  to where  my soul  hankered, where  ideas surge
 with elemental fury...  where a  man ventures  his life  every mo-
 ment, every moment loses it and regains it. I belong to  the idea.
 When it beckons  me, I  follow it  and when  it makes  an appointment
 I wait days and nights; there none calls me to  dinner, there
 none waits with supper. When  the idea  calls I  leave everything;
 or rather, I have nothing to leave; I betray no-one, I  grieve noone
 by being true; my spirit is  not grieved  by having  to grieve
 another.  When  I  return  home,  no-one  reads  in  my  look; noone
   questions  my   appearance;  no-one   demands  of   my  manner
  an  explanation,  which  I  cannot   even  give   anyone,  of
 whether I am blissfully happy or  deep in  misery, whether  I have
  gained life or lost  it. The  cup of  intoxication is  handed back
  to me again. Already I breathe in its  fragrance; already  I sense
  its effervescent music.  But first  a libation  for her  who saved
  my  soul,  which  lay  in the  solitude of  despair: praise  be to
  womanly  magnanimity!  Long  live  the  flight  of  thought;  long
  live danger in the service of the idea; long live the  hardship of
  combat; long live the jubilation of victory; longe live  the dance
  in the whirl of the infinite; long live the wave that hides  me in
  the abyss; long live the wave that hurls me up above the stars."<p>

This drawing of Kierkegaard was published in the Journal &#34;Ugens Nyheder&#34; October 11, 1889. It was told that the anonymous artist had known Kierkegaard for many years.

   This  ecstatic  outburst which  Kierkegaard substitutes  for the
  tragic ending was meant  as his  reply to  criticism. He  would be
  no ludicrous, piti ful fool. On  the other  hand, the  world might
  gain the impression, if  it liked,  that Regine's  engagement came
  as a relief to him. The reality, his true  reactions to  the news,
  can be gleaned from his journals, where,  after first  hearing the
  news,  he fumes  with rage  and scorn  for the  girl who  had once
  cried "It will be my death," and who yet,  two years  later, lived
  happily on, in the arms of another man.<p>                           
    Nevertheless  in  the  young  man's  ecstatic outburst  there is
  more  truth,  more  of  Kierkegaard's  own  inmost being,  than he
  was aware of  when he  set down  these words.  For what  the young
  man says, that he can  now feel  free of  all human  interests and
  can therefore devote himself  unreservedly to  the idea,  i.e., to
  his philosophical and artistic  work: that  was precisely  the impulse
  which,  deepest  down,  forced  the  break with  Regine, as
  he  was later  to realize.  The break  and its  final consummation
  in  Regine's  engagement,  shattering  every  dream of  a marriage
  of the spirit, had floated his skiff; except that it was no skiff,
  but a mighty liner,  which now  headed, under  full sail,  for the
  ocean of philosophy and literature. <p>                              
    The next few  years, indeed,  were to  witness his  most intense
  period  of  production  and  the most  brilliant successes  of his
  creative art.
