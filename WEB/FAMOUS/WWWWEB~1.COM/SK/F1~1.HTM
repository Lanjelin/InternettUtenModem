I hope that in coming to you I can get my question answered.  
To start off, I know nothing about SOREN KIERKEGAARD, and I 
only looked his name up for the simple reason that I received 
a card from a friend with a quote and Kierkegaard's name at 
the bottom.  "Life is not a problem to be solved but reality 
to be experienced"  Is this the same Kierkegaard "that has been 
an inspiration to people all over the world?" (Julia Watkin)  
If so, please let me know, and include other sites where I may
 be able to find more of his quotes.  Because that one quote did 
inspire me and now I do want know more about him.

Thank you,
Danielle Gonzales

I am a first year university student and am currently writing a paper 
on Kierkegaard's philosophy of Faith and History. I could really use 
some advice.  I've never written a philosophy essay before. Thank you.

A comment to another commentor:  In my analysis, "God" and "the Devil"
are relative to Kierkegaard only in that they are not relative.  A existentialist understands the constraints of both the ethical(objective) mode of living and the aesthetic(flowing) mode of life.  Kierkegaard rises out of the death of both of these and simply LIVES.  Common sense and simple logic are enough to live by.  If I hurt someone in my community I can no longer communicate, argue, or grow in reference to that person that I have killed.  God or SATAN, in my unhumble opinion, are for the following flock (Christiandom) that lack the integrity and determination that it takes to live subjectively with all the responsibility that this entails.  Nothing to fall back on except yourself. No one outside yourself to "blame" for a terrible life.  You are the decisions you make!  LIVE!  LIVE!  LIVE!         <HR>

   I like this paper very much. i am currently enrolled in religion
class here in Ft. Worth, Tx. It just so happens that I am doing a 
research paper on the Faith of Abraham. I am glad I found your paper.
I plan to use it as a reference when I begin the actual work of the
paper. My instructor may try and contact you or check out the val-
idity of my sources. He is one tough cookie!

Mr. Sands,<P>
I, of course, share your fascination with "Fear and Trembling" and its thorough probing of the meaning of faith. In these prosaic times, it is the strongest, most meaningful words that have suffered the most from secular humanist debasement, and the word "faith" is no exception. (I would, however, put "love" at the top of the list.) Faith, as it is commonly used today, is banal and ineffective. With the world in the shape it's in, who needs it? But when Kierkegaard plunges with us headlong into the richness of the paradox that is faith, we comprehend heretofore hidden mysteries. It's not that a whole new world is opened to us; it's that we begin to understand our world for the first time. And it occurs to me that many truths exist paradoxically, yet we have chased paradox away, replacing it with irony and contradiction.<P>

I have read Fear and Trembling and am troubled by the "leap of faith"
 concept. While it is wonderful if one touches God what happens to
those people who take the "leap of faith" and rise above the humdrum
 of rationalism only to leap into the arms of the Devil. Cases in
 point include the Dunblane massacre in Scotland and the Port Arthur 
massacre in Australia. Surely those people had also freed themselves 

of convential logic and believed themsleves right.
Alos if Abraham had not seen a sheep and had 
continued with his sacrifice of Issac would he not
be judged of the same ilk?  In general while it is
wonderful to rise above everyday thought we must always 
find a method to discern between god & the devil.


of the restraints of the convential and made the leap of faith except 
taht they had lept into the arms of the Devil. Is it that at the heart
of existentialism that the choice is between good and evil -  between
life and self pity? I would apprweciate your comments.
