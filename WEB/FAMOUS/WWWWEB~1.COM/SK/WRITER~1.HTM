Drawing by David Jacobsen: Kierkegaard as a student.

    The year of  his real  debut was  1843. Before  that he  had written
  only  a  few  occasional pamphlets  and his  University thesis,
 <i>On  the  Concept  of  Irony,  with  Constant  Reference  to Socrates</i>
  (Om  Begrebet  Ironi  med  stadigt   Hensyn  til   Sokrates;  1841).
  Now,  in  1843,  he  published  no  fewer than  six books,  of which
  the first is the longest he ever wrote. It is significantly entitled
<i>Either/Or</i> (Enten-Eller);  and it  leads us  straight into  the world
  of  Kierkegaard's  thought.  An  "either/or"  confronts  us  with  a
  choice,  and it  is Kierkegaard's  meaning to  force the  reader into
  making  a  decision. He  must decide  how he  wants to  live out
  his life, instead  of simply  drifting passively  down the  river of
  life.  So  in  <i>Either/Or</i>  Kierkegaard  sets  out  two ways  of life,
  which he calls the  "aesthetic" and  the "ethical".  To "aesthetic",
  however,  he  gives  a  different  meaning  from  the  one  that  we
  usually give  to it;  he means  the immediate  and sensory  that is
  every man's starting point in life. In the first  part of  his work
  he  shows  us  a  variety of  aesthetic lives  and types,  from the
  lowest,  which  is  sensory  and  nothing  but  sensory,  as  exemplified
 in the  figure of  Don Juan,  to the  man who  has realized
  the  emptiness  of a  purely aesthetic  life, yet  who nevertheless
  clings desperately to it,  well knowing  that it  can lead  only to
  despair. <P>                                                          
    But  why  does  a  life  on  the  aesthetic  plane  lead  only to
  despair?  Because,  in  Kierkegaard's   opinion,  man   has  within
  him  something  else,  which  will  not be  satisfied by  a sensory
  life. This something else is the eternal. Man, he believes, is made
  up  of  diverse and  opposing parts.  He is,  he says,  a synthesis
  of body  and spirit,  of temporal  and eternal,  of finite  and infinite,
  of  necessity  and  freedom. It  is characteristic  of the
  aesthetic, however,  that it  overemphasizes one  side of  the synthesis:
 the corporeal, the temporal, the finite, and the necessary.
  Yet  the  other side  is none  the less  there; and  it continually
  makes  itself  felt  by  an anxiety,  "a sympathetic  antipathy and
  an  antipathetic  sympathy",  which  alarms  and  attracts  at  the
  same time. The term which best  describes this  call of  the spirit
  in  the  sensory  world,  Kierkegaard  finds,  is  "dread" (angst).
  Thus  dread  is  an  indication  that  man  has the  eternal within
  him.  Without  the eternal  there would  be no  dread. But  the man
  who has felt  the dread  within, and  who yet  obstinately persists
  in  an  existence in  the sensory  sphere will  end in  despair. On
  these  twin  concepts,  of  dread  and  despair,  Kierkegaard wrote
  two   of   his   most   inspired  books:   <I>The  Concept   of  Dread</i>
  (Begrebet   Angest;   1844)   and   <i>The   Sickness    unto   Death</i>
  (Sygdommen    til    D&oslash;den;    1849).    These   two    books   are
  psychological  essays,  but  in  Either/Or  the  same   themes  are
  treated  in  situations  of  imaginative  literature, from  the introductory
  Diapsalmata  (aphorisms),  in  which   the  alternating
  moods  of  the  aesthetic  man  find  expression,  through examples
  taken   from   literature,   such  as   Don  Juan,   Antigone,  and
  characters from the plays of Scribe, to invented figures  like "the
  unhappiest"   and   John   the  Seducer.   Together  they   form  a
  gallery  of  characters  ranging  from  the   immediately  sensory,
  who  in  a  sense  is  innocent  just  because  of  his  immediacy,
  because, in  other words,  he does  not reflect  very much  on what
  he  does,  to the  reflecting seducer,  who has  thought everything
  out and really acts in defiance and despair.<P>

    But the man  who through  the call  of despair  has felt  the inadequacy
  of  a life  in the  aesthetic sphere,  and who  does not,
  in  defiance  and  despair,  remain  in  it,  is  mature  enough to
  choose  something  else  and  enter into  the ethical  sphere. This
  is indicated by the fact that the eternal has asserted  its claims
  on the man, who not only accepts it but  believes in  the possibility
 of realizing the ethical claims in the temporal, in  the sensory world.
 Such a  man is  the ethicist  who writes  long letters
  to  a  friend  who  is  an  aestheticist,  in  the second  part of
<I>  Either/Or</I>. The ethicist is a  fighter and  an optimist,  who feels
  that he is fighting  for a  good cause  and has  no doubt  that he
  will  have  the  strength to  convince his  friends and  the whole
  world what is the good.  He will  not deny  life in  the aesthetic
  sphere, but feels sure that it is possible to unite the two points
  of view in a kind  of synthesis.  Not without  reason, one  of the
  chapters  in  the second  part of  <I>Either/Or</I> is  confidently headed:
  "On  the  balance between  the aesthetic  and the  ethical in
  the development of personality". <P>                                 
    That, no doubt, is what Kierkegaard himself  felt at  that time.
  Having been strongly attracted to the aesthetic in its more refined
 forms, he doubtless still hoped  that it  would be  possible to
  find some kind of  synthesis between  the two  worlds. It  is true
  that  he  himself  had  abdicated,  having  renounced  Regine  and
  thus  the possibility  of his  ever marrying.  But he  had neither
  abandoned  his  connection  with  the  world  altogether,  nor the
  hope that all in one way or another would be for the best.<P>        
    He  was  unexpectedly  confirmed  in  this  hope  one  Sunday in
  the   spring   of  1843,   when,  leaving   Vor  Frue   Church  in
  Copenhagen,  he  chanced  to  meet  Regine,  who  also   came  out
  from  church. She  nodded to  him. That  was all;  but he  was intensely
 moved. So she was  not ill  disposed to  him; and  she did
  not consider him a  cheat! All  manner of  ideas began  to revolve
  in  Kierkegaard's  brain,  suggesting  that  perhaps   they  could
  come  together  in  some  form  of  spiritual  marriage, unsullied
  by the lusts of the flesh.<P>                                        

  But  at  first  he  avoided any  contact and  went off  again to
  Berlin in order  to work  undisturbed. There  he wrote  two books,
 <i> Fear   and  Trembling</i>   (Frygt  og   B&aelig;ven)  and  <i>The  Repetition</i>
 (Gentagelsen). Both  are in  the form,  so characteristic  of him,
 which   lies   mid-way   between   imaginative    literature   and
 philosophy,  and  in  which  the  ideas he  is grappling  with are
 presented in clear essence. The idea he is chiefly  concerned with
 in both is faith, though in very different ways.
