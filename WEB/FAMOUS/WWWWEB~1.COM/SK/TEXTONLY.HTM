S&Oslash;REN  KIERKEGAARD  was  born  in  Copenhagen  on  the   5th  of
 May 1813.  Both on  his father's  and his  mother's side  he was
 of  Jutlandish  descent.  His  father  came  from  a  poor moorland
 farm in a  small village  in West  Jutland, about  10 miles
 from  Ringk&oslash;bing.  As  a  boy  he  was made  to watch  the sheep
 on the  heath and  suffered cold  and hardship.  But at  the age
 of  12  years  he was  sent to  Copenhagen to  live with  a maternal
  uncle  who  was  a  prosperous  tradesman.  Here  he  received
 an education and  established himself  in his  24th year.
 He  made  his  way  with  astonishing rapidity  and was  able to
 retire from business  at the  age of  40 and  spend the  rest of
 his life as a wealthy man of leisure.  He did  not die  until he
 had  reached  his  82nd  year,  in  1838. At  that time  his son
 S&oslash;ren was 25 years old.<P>                                        
   His  mother,  too,  came  from  a  Jutland   moorland  region,
 where her father  was a  smallholder. She  was the  senior Kierkegaard's
  second  wife and  mother of  all his  seven children.
 She first came to the house as a servant  girl, but  married her
 husband  not  much  more  than  a  year after  the death  of his
 first  wife.  While  S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard,  time  and  time again,
 makes  mention  of  his  father,  who  was the  overwhelming influence
 in his life, he speaks of his mother hardly at  all. She
 has  been described  by other  people as  a kind,  cheerful, motherly
  woman.  It  would seem  that the  lighter side  of S&oslash;ren
 Kierkegaard's  nature  was  inherited  from  her.  She  died  in
 1934, when S&oslash;ren was 21.<P> 
                                     
   S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard  was  the  youngest  of  the family  of seven.
  When he  was born  his father  was 56  and his  mother 45,
 and he often called  himself a  child of  old age.  The patriarchal,
 self-willed  father dominated  the home.  He was  a highly
 gifted  man,  self-taught,  but  well-read,  and  much  occupied
 with  spiritual  matters.  His  religious  denomination  was the
 pietistic  Herrnhuter  'fraternity'.  He  had  a sombre  view of
 life and brought up his children to a strict form  of Christianity,
  which  particularly emphasized  the sufferings  of Christ.
 He  suffered  from  periodic  attacks  of  depression, awareness
 of  sin and  scrupulosity. He  especially doubted  the salvation
 of his soul.   <P>                                                

   There  is  no doubt  that it  was from  his father  that S&oslash;ren
 Kierkegaard  inherited  the deepest  layers of  his personality,
 the  periodic  depressions  that  weighed him  down, as  well as
 the  outstanding powers  of thought,  both the  penetrating dialectic
  intelligence  and  the  passionate imagination.  In 'The
 Viewpoint  of  My  Authorship'  Kierkegaard  writes  in  a purely
 biographical vein: <P>                                         
   "As  a  child  I  was  strictly  and  earnestly brought  up to
 Christianity,  humanly  speaking,  insanely  brought   up:  even
 in  my  earliest childhood  I had  been overstrained  by impressions
  which  were  laid  upon  me  by  the  melancholy  old man
 who  was  himself  oppressed  by  them   --  a   child,  insanely
 travestied as a melancholy old man."<P>                           
   Elsewhere  is  written: "I  owe everything  to my  father from
 the very  start. When  he, melancholy  as he  was, saw  me looking
 sad, he would say, 'See that you duly love Jesus Christ.'"<P>
   It  was  particularly  the  suffering  Christ that  the father
 presented  to  the  child. His  son says  that from  boyhood upwards
  he  was  brought  up  to  the  view  that the  truth must
 suffer  and  be  derided and  scorned. He  mentions as  well the
 indignation  he  had  felt from  childhood because,  long before
 he had experienced  it himself,  he had  learned that  the world
 was  ruled by  lies, meanness  and injustice.  "Even as  a small
 child I was told, as  solemnly as  possible: that  everyone spat
 at  Christ  (who,  indeed,  was the  truth), that  the multitude
 (those who  passed by)  spat at  him and  said: 'Shame  on you.'
 I have kept this deep in my heart. This thought is my life."
   So it was. The picture  of Christ  which his  father impressed
 on  the  boy's  mind remained  with him  throughout his  life as
 the  dominating  experience.   In  several   places  Kierkegaard
 wrote  that  the  overwhelming  impression  of  Christ  made  in
 his  childhood  'humanly  speaking'  made  him  intensely miserable.
  "It  was  all  connected  with  the relationship  with my
 father,  the  person  I  have loved  most --  and what  does that
 mean?  It  means  thzt  he  is  just  the  person who  makes one
 miserable -- but out of love. His fault lay not in lack  of love,
 but  in confusing  an old  man with  a child."  But 'religiously
 speaking' in the long run  he was  grateful to  his father."From
 him I learnt  what paternal  affection means,  and thus  I was
 given the concept of divine paternal love,  the only  thing in
 life  which  is  firm  and  unshakable,  the  true Archimedean
 point."   <P>                                                    
                                                              
 In 1830 at the  age of  17, S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard passed  his matriculation
  examination  with  flying  colours  and  began at
 once to read theology. Very  little is  known about  his first
 years as a. student, but from  about 1834  begin the  first of
 his youthful notes that  have been  preserved. They  show that
 he was reading very widely  in the  spheres of  theology, philosophy
  and  aesthetics.  He  was particularly  interested in
 German  theology,  in  German  idealistic  philosophy  and romantic
 aesthetic literature.

 In 1840 he  became engaged  to a  eighteen-year-old girl
 of  the  Copenhagen  upper  classes,  named  Regine   Olsen,  whom
 he  had known  and felt  drawn to  for a  year or  more. Scarcely,
 however,  had  the  engagement  taken  place  when  he   began  to
 have  scruples. To  quote the  journals: "On  the second  day (after  
the  engagement)  I  saw I  had been  wrong. Penitent  that I
 was -- my vita ante acta, my melancholy -- that was enough!" <P> 

    
   Kierkegaard  realized,  in  short,  that  he could  not overcome
 his melancholy, and he  felt unable  to confide  in the  girl what
 he believed to be its causes. The figure of his father  barred the
 way; and the tragedy of the family  curse was  a thing  that could
 not be revealed. He  was thrown  back upon  himself and  his solitude,
 and was  incapable of  "realizing the  universal" --  that is
 to  say,  incapable of  human relationships,  of opening  his mind
 to others, or even of taking Church  office, as  he had  often intended
 but never did. <P>                                           
   Two  months  later  he  had  made  up  his  mind  that  he would
 not be justified in attaching this light-hearted girl  to himself,
 and  perhaps  making  her unhappy  by his  melancholy. Yet  a broken
  engagement  was  in  those  days  a  serious   matter,  which
 could reflect  unfavourably on  the woman  in particular.  To save
 Regine, Kierkegaard  therefore decided  to take  all the  blame on
 himself, and in  such a  way that  it would  be clear  to everyone
 that  it  was she  who had  broken off  the engagement,  and could
 hardly  do otherwise.  So for  several months  he played  the part
 of  an irresponsible  philanderer, noisily  showing off  in public
 and   seeking  by   every  means   to  turn   appearances  against
 himself.  <P> 

                                                      
   In this  he succeeded,  except in  the eyes  of Regine,  who saw
 through  him and  refused to  accept the  breach. The  affair thus
 became  doubly  distressing  for  both  of  them.  When  the break
 was  a fact,  Kierkegaard wrote  in his  journals: "When  the bond
 broke, my feeling was:  Either you  plunge into  wild dissipation,
 or absolute religiosity -- of  a sort  different from  the parson's
 melange." <P>                                                       
   He chose the latter.  But at  the same  time he  chose something
 else:  he  chose  authorship.  It  was  in  November 1841  that he
 broke definitively with Regine.  Two weeks  later he  travelled to
 Berlin (the only place abroad that he ever saw, and that  he visited
 three times), so as  to escape  from the  scene of  these agonizing
  experiences.  And  there  he  began to  write. It  came over
  him  like  a  torrent, driving  him ceaselessly  on during  the next
  ten  years  --  the  most  concentrated  period  of output  ever displayed
  by  a  Danish  author, and  surely one  of the  most compact
  in world literature.<P>

    Fear   and  Trembling</i>   (Frygt  og   B&aelig;ven)  and  <i>The  Repetition</i>
 (Gentagelsen). Both  are in  the form,  so characteristic  of him,
 which   lies   mid-way   between   imaginative    literature   and
 philosophy,  and  in  which  the  ideas he  is grappling  with are
 presented in clear essence. The idea he is chiefly  concerned with
 in b                   
    The year of  his real  debut was  1843. Before  that he  had written
  only  a  few  occasional pamphlets  and his  University thesis,
 <i>On  the  Concept  of  Irony,  with  Constant  Reference  to Socrates</i>
  (Om  Begrebet  Ironi  med  stadigt   Hensyn  til   Sokrates;  1841).
  Now,  in  1843,  he  published  no  fewer than  six books,  of which
  the first is the longest he ever wrote. It is significantly entitled
<i>Either/Or</i> (Enten-Eller);  and it  leads us  straight into  the world
  of  Kierkegaard's  thought.  An  "either/or"  confronts  us  with  a
  choice,  and it  is Kierkegaard's  meaning to  force the  reader into
  making  a  decision. He  must decide  how he  wants to  live out
  his life, instead  of simply  drifting passively  down the  river of
  life.  So  in  <i>Either/Or</i>  Kierkegaard  sets  out  two ways  of life,
  which he calls the  "aesthetic" and  the "ethical".  To "aesthetic",
  however,  he  gives  a  different  meaning  from  the  one  that  we
  usually give  to it;  he means  the immediate  and sensory  that is
  every man's starting point in life. In the first  part of  his work
  he  shows  us  a  variety of  aesthetic lives  and types,  from the
  lowest,  which  is  sensory  and  nothing  but  sensory,  as  exemplified
 in the  figure of  Don Juan,  to the  man who  has realized
  the  emptiness  of a  purely aesthetic  life, yet  who nevertheless
  clings desperately to it,  well knowing  that it  can lead  only to
  despair. <P>                                                          
    But  why  does  a  life  on  the  aesthetic  plane  lead  only to
  despair?  Because,  in  Kierkegaard's   opinion,  man   has  within
  him  something  else,  which  will  not be  satisfied by  a sensory
  life. This something else is the eternal. Man, he believes, is made
  up  of  diverse and  opposing parts.  He is,  he says,  a synthesis
  of body  and spirit,  of temporal  and eternal,  of finite  and infinite,
  of  necessity  and  freedom. It  is characteristic  of the
  aesthetic, however,  that it  overemphasizes one  side of  the synthesis:
 the corporeal, the temporal, the finite, and the necessary.
  Yet  the  other side  is none  the less  there; and  it continually
  makes  itself  felt  by  an anxiety,  "a sympathetic  antipathy and
  an  antipathetic  sympathy",  which  alarms  and  attracts  at  the
  same time. The term which best  describes this  call of  the spirit
  in  the  sensory  world,  Kierkegaard  finds,  is  "dread" (angst).
  Thus  dread  is  an  indication  that  man  has the  eternal within
  him.  Without  the eternal  there would  be no  dread. But  the man
  who has felt  the dread  within, and  who yet  obstinately persists
  in  an  existence in  the sensory  sphere will  end in  despair. On
  these  twin  concepts,  of  dread  and  despair,  Kierkegaard wrote
  two   of   his   most   inspired  books:   <I>The  Concept   of  Dread</i>
  (Begrebet   Angest;   1844)   and   <i>The   Sickness    unto   Death</i>
  (Sygdommen    til    D&oslash;den;    1849).    These   two    books   are
  psychological  essays,  but  in  Either/Or  the  same   themes  are
  treated  in  situations  of  imaginative  literature, from  the introductory
  Diapsalmata  (aphorisms),  in  which   the  alternating
  moods  of  the  aesthetic  man  find  expression,  through examples
  taken   from   literature,   such  as   Don  Juan,   Antigone,  and
  characters from the plays of Scribe, to invented figures  like "the
  unhappiest"   and   John   the  Seducer.   Together  they   form  a
  gallery  of  characters  ranging  from  the   immediately  sensory,
  who  in  a  sense  is  innocent  just  because  of  his  immediacy,
  because, in  other words,  he does  not reflect  very much  on what
  he  does,  to the  reflecting seducer,  who has  thought everything
  out and really acts in defiance and despair.<P>                       


    But the man  who through  the call  of despair  has felt  the inadequacy
  of  a life  in the  aesthetic sphere,  and who  does not,
  in  defiance  and  despair,  remain  in  it,  is  mature  enough to
  choose  something  else  and  enter into  the ethical  sphere. This
  is indicated by the fact that the eternal has asserted  its claims
  on the man, who not only accepts it but  believes in  the possibility
 of realizing the ethical claims in the temporal, in  the sensory world.
 Such a  man is  the ethicist  who writes  long letters
  to  a  friend  who  is  an  aestheticist,  in  the second  part of
<I>  Either/Or</I>. The ethicist is a  fighter and  an optimist,  who feels
  that he is fighting  for a  good cause  and has  no doubt  that he
  will  have  the  strength to  convince his  friends and  the whole
  world what is the good.  He will  not deny  life in  the aesthetic
  sphere, but feels sure that it is possible to unite the two points
  of view in a kind  of synthesis.  Not without  reason, one  of the
  chapters  in  the second  part of  <I>Either/Or</I> is  confidently headed:
  "On  the  balance between  the aesthetic  and the  ethical in
  the development of personality". <P>                                 
    That, no doubt, is what Kierkegaard himself  felt at  that time.
  Having been strongly attracted to the aesthetic in its more refined
 forms, he doubtless still hoped  that it  would be  possible to
  find some kind of  synthesis between  the two  worlds. It  is true
  that  he  himself  had  abdicated,  having  renounced  Regine  and
  thus  the possibility  of his  ever marrying.  But he  had neither
  abandoned  his  connection  with  the  world  altogether,  nor the
  hope that all in one way or another would be for the best.<P>        
    He  was  unexpectedly  confirmed  in  this  hope  one  Sunday in
  the   spring   of  1843,   when,  leaving   Vor  Frue   Church  in
  Copenhagen,  he  chanced  to  meet  Regine,  who  also   came  out
  from  church. She  nodded to  him. That  was all;  but he  was intensely
 moved. So she was  not ill  disposed to  him; and  she did
  not consider him a  cheat! All  manner of  ideas began  to revolve
  in  Kierkegaard's  brain,  suggesting  that  perhaps   they  could
  come  together  in  some  form  of  spiritual  marriage, unsullied
  by the lusts of the flesh.<P>                                        

But  at  first  he  avoided any  contact and  went off  again to
  Berlin in order  to work  undisturbed. There  he wrote  two books,
 <i> Fear   and  Trembling</i>   (Frygt  og   B&aelig;ven)  and  <i>The  Repetition</i>
 (Gentagelsen). Both  are in  the form,  so characteristic  of him,
 which   lies   mid-way   between   imaginative    literature   and
 philosophy,  and  in  which  the  ideas he  is grappling  with are
 presented in clear essence. The idea he is chiefly  concerned with
 in both is faith, though in very different ways.                 


          
   In  <i>Fear  and  Trembling</i>  he  again  considers  the relationship
 with  Regine:  a  relationship  which obsesses  him because  of an
 understandable  sense  of  guilt.  The  chief protagonist  in this
 short  book  is  Abraham,  who  was  ready  to  sacrifice  his own
 child  at  God's  command.  Kierkegaard's  father  had  sacrificed
 his child -- or at any rate  its happiness  -- for  God in  the same
 way; and  he had  been ready  to sacrifice  Regine for  the same
 reason. In his own  case, it  had meant  that he  had sacrificed
 what was most precious to him in this world; he had renounced.<P>
   But  Abraham  had  been  restrained  at  the last  moment, and
 after  he had  shown absolute  obedience to  God had  been given
 back his child.  And applying  this experience  to his  own personal
  case,  Kierkegaard  realized  the connection:  if Abraham
 had his son returned to him, while he had to renounce  his relations
 with  Regine, it  was because  Abraham had  understood the
  deepest  meaning  of  absolute  obedience  to  the  absolute.  That
  is what we call faith; and in  faith lies  the conviction  that for
  God  all  things  are  possible. It  follows that  the man  who has
  faith  does   not  need   to  renounce.   The  man   who  renounces
  proves in doing so  that he  lacks faith;  or, as  Kierkegaard says
  in the entry in the journals  dated May  1843, that  is to  say, at
  the  time  he  was working  on <I>Fear  and Trembling</i>:  "If I  had had
  faith  I  should  have  kept  to  Regine."  And  he  adds:  "Faith,
  therefore, has hope of this life as well, but only by virtue of the
  absurd,  not  because  of  human  reason;  otherwise  it  would  be
  mere  worldly  wisdom, not  faith." In  fact, he  now sees  that at
  the  time  when he  believed a  marriage to  be impossible  and renounced
  it  he  should  have had  faith, when  he would  have been
  filled with the conviction that  for God  all things  are possible,
  even, against all reason, the  ability to  make an  impossible marriage
 possible; and  in that  belief he  should have  remained true
  to  Regine.  This  idea  he  sets down  philosophically in  what he
  terms "the double movement  of infinity",  which consists  in first
  breaking   with   finiteness  but   being  then   enabled,  through
  religion, to recover it. Thus it is possible to  make life  in this
  world  compatible  with  life  in   God  after   all.  Renunciation
  brings  man  into  a  negative  relationship  with  the  world, but
  faith brings him back into a positive relationship with it.<P>        

    This  whole  chain of  reasoning can  be said  to have  been suggested
  by  the  nod  which  Regine allowed  herself when  she happened
  to  meet  her  former  fiance  one  Sunday  morning  as they
  were  both  leaving  church.  The  consequence, as  he saw  it, was
  the  renewed possibility  of achieving  a marriage,  in one  way or
  another,  and  in  one  form  or  another;  a  consequence,  be  it
  noted,  of  the  absurd, by  which he  means by  virtue of  a logic
  outside  the  reach  of  human  comprehension  and   therefore,  to
  human eyes, absurd or paradoxical. <P> 
 
    The  paradoxical  aspect  of  religion   may  also   entail  that
  religion, in certain situations, can conflict with  ethical demands
 and  so  appear  immoral.  God's  commandment  to  Abraham  to
 sacrifice Isaac was requiring him to act like a  murderer; and
 when Kierkegaard  was obliged  to break  with Regine  this was
  contrary  to the  ordinary view  of ethics.  These are  the problems
  Kierkegaard  discusses  in  Fear  and  Trembling,  in   the  chapter
  which   carries   the   rather   involved   heading:  "Is   there  a
  teleological suspension of the ethical;  that is  to say,  are there
  situations  in  which  a  man  can  be  forced to  disregard ethical
  demands   for   a  higher   authority?"  Kierkegaard   answers  this
  question  in  the  affirmative;  and  it  is in  just this  that the
  paradoxical character of religion is made plain,  since it  can lead
  to  demands  which,  from  the  point  of  view of  ordinary ethics,
  are unethical. <P>                                                     

    We  should  remember,  however,  that  it  is  a  question   of  a
  suspension,  not  an  abolition  of the  ethical, and  suspension is
  temporary.  So  he  says:  "What is  suspended is  not lost,  but is
  preserved in the higher function  that is  its telos,  its purpose."
  The ethical thus asserts itself as the basis of human  life, lifting
  it out of the  aesthetic sphere  and bringing  it into  harmony with
  the  claims  of the  universal, which  in turn  are a  reflection of
  the religious claims.<P>                                               
    But  then  comes  the  question  of  why  some  people  are placed
  in such a situation by  God that  they have  to act  in a  way which
  must  bring  them  --  if  only  temporarily  --  into  conflict  with
  ethics.  And  who  are  they?  They  are  the  people  who,  whether
  by  a judgment  of God  or by  guilt, have  got outside  the universal,
 the ethical. That guilt puts a man outside the ethical is selfevident,
  guilt  being  by  definition a  breach with  the universal
  or  ethical.  The  judgment  of  God  is  another  matter,   for  it
  signifies  that  there are  men whom  God has  chosen for  a special
  mission,  and  who  cannot,  therefore,  be  measured  by  the  same
  yardstick as others. <P>                                               


    The  man  who  puts  himself  by  guilt  outside  the  universal --
  as indeed all  men do  -- can  bring himself  back within  the claims
  of  ethics only  by virtue  of the  absurd; in  other words,  by the
  faith that for God all things  are possible.  But he  cannot achieve
  this without first  learning to  renounce. For,  rightly considered,
 guilt consists in clinging to this world and setting it  above the
 kingdom  of  God;  that  is  to  say,  by  committing  oneself absolutely
 to the relative and relatively to the absolute.  Hence it
 is an essential  requirement that  one should  first learn  to renounce
 and  be willing  to abjure  the things  of this  world; and
  then, since  for God  nothing is  impossible, it  is possible  that by
  virtue   of  faith   in  God's   omnipotence,  which   can  accomplish
  what  to  the  human   mind  is   impossible  and   therefore  absurd,
  one  will  recover  a positive  relationship to  this world.  Faith in
  the  absurd,  in  other  words,  is  the same  as the  double movement
  of infinity. <p>
                                                         


  <I>The  Repetition</i>  is  in  every  sense  an  extension  of  <I> Fear  and
  Trembling.</I>  The  concept  of  repetition is,  of course,  nothing else
  but  the  double  movement  of  infinity,  by  virtue  of   which  one
  repeats,  or  recovers,  the  world, after  first making  the negative
  movement  of  renunciation.  Yet  the  two  books  are not  alike. <I>The
  Repetition</i> treats faith psychologically. It is, as its sub-title says,
  "an   essay   in   experimental   psychology".   As   so    often   in
  Kierkegaard,  we  see  things  through  the eyes  of an  observer, and
  this  observer  is  a  man  interested  in the  problems but  not personally
  involved:  a  cool,  rather  ironic,   occasionally  somewhat
  cynical  philosopher  o f  life  who is  uncommitted to  religion, let
  alone Christianity.  <p>                                                 

    Such   a   man   is   the   pseudonymous    character,   Constantine
  Constantius,   who   tells   the   story.  The   young  man   who  experiences
  a  love  affair  resembles  Kierkegaard  to  a   hair.  And
  the love affair resembles, to a hair, the one that he suffered.       
    The  book's  present  form  is  not,  however,  the   original  one,
  and  we  do  not  know  for  certain  how  the  first  version  ended.
  From  a  few  hints in  the journals  we may  conjecture that  it ended
  with  the  suicide  of  the  young man  in love,  probably because
  he  felt  unable  to  honour  the claims  of a  relationship initiated
  by  himself.  Thus  where  Kierkegaard  broke   off  and   went  away,
  his  alter  ego  committed  suicide.  These  are  two  different  ways
  of  solving  the  conflict:  the  conflict  which consists  in neither
  person   being   capable   of   making   the   double    movement   of
  infinity.<p>                                                             
    In  its  present  form,  however,  the book  has quite  another end-
  ing,   and  for   a  good   reason,  one   which  is   connected  with
  Kierkegaard's  own  experience.  We  must  remember  that  the  new
  phase in his production had been set  in motion  by the  little en-
  counter  outside  the  church,  when  Regine  had  nodded  to  him,
  filling  his  mind  with  ideas  which  both  alarmed him  and made
  him deepen  his concept  of faith  and visualize  it in  the double
  movement of infinity,  while maintaining  its intangibility  in the
  form  of  paradox.  When  can  a  smile  and  a  nod  have  had  so
  many consequences? <p>                                                
    But   returning   to   Copenhagen    from   Berlin,    with   two
  manuscripts  ready  for  the  press,  Kierkegaard was  staggered to
  learn  that  Regine  had  become  engaged. She  was engaged  to the
  young  man,  Fritz  Schlegel, who  had been  paying her  his attentions
  before  Kierkegaard  had  come  into  her  life,   and  with
  whom  she  had  become  reconciled.   To  Kierkegaard   this  meant
  that all he had envisaged after  that fateful  nod, all  the dreams
  he  had  dreamt  of  some  spiritual  marriage  between   them,  or
  at  least  mutual  loyalty,  married  or  unmarried, and  the whole
  system  of  thought  which  had  crystallized like  a pearl  in the
  mussel-shell of the  smile had  proved vain  and futile.  His world
  seemed  to crumble  and turn  to dust  at his  feet. He  would make
  a  laughing-stock  of himself  if he  were now  to publish  his new
  book,  in  which  the  hero   commits  suicide   from  disappointed
  love  --  because  his  own   loved  one   had  become   engaged  to
  another,  as  the  ending  of  <I>The  Repetition</i>  would of  course be
  maliciously  misinterpreted.  He  promptly tore  up the  last seven
  or eight pages  of his  manuscript (it  may even  have been  set up
  in  type) and  at top  speed wrote  a new  conclusion, in  which we
  learn that the girl  has married  another, and  in which  the hero,
  instead of  taking his  life, triumphantly  exclaims:<p> "I  am myself
  again; here I have the repetition; I understand all, and life seems
  finer  to  me now  than ever...  I am  myself again;  the machinery
  has  been  started  up.  Cut  are  the  meshes  I was  ensnared in;
  broken is the  spell that  had bewitched  me, so  that I  could not
  return to myself... It is over; my skiff is afloat. The next minute
 I  shall  be back  to where  my soul  hankered, where  ideas surge
 with elemental fury...  where a  man ventures  his life  every mo-
 ment, every moment loses it and regains it. I belong to  the idea.
 When it beckons  me, I  follow it  and when  it makes  an appointment
 I wait days and nights; there none calls me to  dinner, there
 none waits with supper. When  the idea  calls I  leave everything;
 or rather, I have nothing to leave; I betray no-one, I  grieve noone
 by being true; my spirit is  not grieved  by having  to grieve
 another.  When  I  return  home,  no-one  reads  in  my  look; noone
   questions  my   appearance;  no-one   demands  of   my  manner
  an  explanation,  which  I  cannot   even  give   anyone,  of
 whether I am blissfully happy or  deep in  misery, whether  I have
  gained life or lost  it. The  cup of  intoxication is  handed back
  to me again. Already I breathe in its  fragrance; already  I sense
  its effervescent music.  But first  a libation  for her  who saved
  my  soul,  which  lay  in the  solitude of  despair: praise  be to
  womanly  magnanimity!  Long  live  the  flight  of  thought;  long
  live danger in the service of the idea; long live the  hardship of
  combat; long live the jubilation of victory; longe live  the dance
  in the whirl of the infinite; long live the wave that hides  me in
  the abyss; long live the wave that hurls me up above the stars."<p>
 

   This  ecstatic  outburst which  Kierkegaard substitutes  for the
  tragic ending was meant  as his  reply to  criticism. He  would be
  no ludicrous, piti ful fool. On  the other  hand, the  world might
  gain the impression, if  it liked,  that Regine's  engagement came
  as a relief to him. The reality, his true  reactions to  the news,
  can be gleaned from his journals, where,  after first  hearing the
  news,  he fumes  with rage  and scorn  for the  girl who  had once
  cried "It will be my death," and who yet,  two years  later, lived
  happily on, in the arms of another man.<p>                           
    Nevertheless  in  the  young  man's  ecstatic outburst  there is
  more  truth,  more  of  Kierkegaard's  own  inmost being,  than he
  was aware of  when he  set down  these words.  For what  the young
  man says, that he can  now feel  free of  all human  interests and
  can therefore devote himself  unreservedly to  the idea,  i.e., to
  his philosophical and artistic  work: that  was precisely  the impulse
  which,  deepest  down,  forced  the  break with  Regine, as
  he  was later  to realize.  The break  and its  final consummation
  in  Regine's  engagement,  shattering  every  dream of  a marriage
  of the spirit, had floated his skiff; except that it was no skiff,
  but a mighty liner,  which now  headed, under  full sail,  for the
  ocean of philosophy and literature. <p>                              
    The next few  years, indeed,  were to  witness his  most intense
  period  of  production  and  the most  brilliant successes  of his
  creative art.

 <I>Fear  and  Trembling</i>  and  <I>The  Repetition</i>  appeared  together in
 October  1843.  In the  same way,  in June  1844, with  only four
 days   between   them,  Kierkegaard   published  the   two  books
 <I>Philosophical  Scraps;  or  a  Scrap  of  Philosophy</i> (Filosofiske
 Smuler eller en  Smule Filosofi),  "by Johannes  Climacus, edited
 by  S.  Kierkegaard",  and  <I>The  Concept  of  Dread</i>,  "a  simple
 psychological-demonstrative  reflection  regarding  the  dogmatic
 problem of original sin, by Vigilius Haufniensis". <p>
             
   The  many  pseudonyms  can  seem  like  an affectation  but indicate
 a deliberate strategy, by which Kierkegaard aims  to avoid
 teaching  or  preaching; nor  can the  opinions expressed  in his
 books  always be  definitely ascribed  to him.  When a  work like
 Philosophical Scraps is described as "edited by  S. Kierkegaard",
 we may be sure that it is to  a special  degree an  expression of
 his own  thoughts; but  only in  those cases  where he  is shown,
 not as editor, but as  author of  the work  in question,  can the
 opinions in it be ascribed to him  with certainty.  This applies,
 on  the  whole,  only to  the many  collections of  sermons which
 he published between the literary and philosophical works.<P>      
  <I> Philosophical Scraps</i> is an  attempt to  elucidate Christianity.
 It is, in other words, a work of dogmatics,  though, to  be sure,
 a  work  of  an  altogether  undogmatic  character.   Perhaps  it
 would be more correct to  say that  it is  an attempt  to present
 Christianity as it should be if it is to  have any  meaning. Here
 Kierkegaard's  ideas  on the  paradox as  adumbrated in <I> Fear and
 Trembling</I> come to  full flower,  because Christ's  incarnation is
 itself a paradox; partly because it means  the appearance  of the
 infinite in time,  which no  human mind  can compass,  and partly
  because  God,  as  guiltless,  must  be  absolutely  different  from
  man, whose destiny lies in falsehood, since he lives in sin.<P>        
    <I>The  Concept  of  Dread</I>  is  concerned  with  sexuality,  taken as
  the constituent element  in the  concept of  original sin.  This extraordinarily
  penetrating work,  perhaps the  first work  of depth-psychology  in  existence,
  is  based  on  the  previously mentioned
  concept  of  man  as  a  synthesis  of soul  and body,  temporal and
  eternal,  freedom  and  necessity;  and dread  is the  feeling which
  grips  and  dominates  the  man  whose  synthesis  is  threatened by
  the fact that one  aspect of  it --  the body,  the temporal  and the
  necessary  --  is  gaining control.  Dread is  thus a  warning voice,
  though  it  can  be,  as  well,  a  temptation to  new sin;  for, as
  Kierkegaard  says,  in words  which anticipate  Freud's view  in Das
  Ich  und  das  Es,  and  in  Uber  das  Schuldgefiihl,  "Man  is not
  conscious of  guilt because  he sins,  but sins  because he  is conscious of guilt."  <P>                                                 
  

  The  man  who,  through  the  voice  of  dread,  has  realized the
  inadequacy  of  the  aesthetic,  sensory  sphere  has   reached  the
  maturity  to  choose something  else and  enter the  ethical sphere.
  This is marked by the assertion of  its claims  by the  eternal. But
  as was the case in the aesthetic sphere, so in the ethical: we rnust
  distinguish  between  different  stages.  At  its  lowest  stage man
  still believes that he can,  alone, meet  the requirements  of eternity
 in the world of  time. At  its highest  stage, the  ethical man
  has  discovered how  little he  can achieve  by his  own endeavours.
  The  man  who  has  realized  this  has  become  mature   enough  to
  cross  from  the  ethical to  the religious  sphere, which  is based
  on   this   very   recognition   of   the   inadequacy    of   human
  endeavour. <P>                                                         
    This  idea,  which  had   been  implicit   in  all   the  previous
  publications  from   <I>Either/Or</I>  onward,   dominates  the   next  major  work,
<I>  Stages  on Life's  Way </I>(Stadier  paa Livets  Vej; 1845),
  a  voluminous  book  that  is  perhaps  Kierkegaard's  maturest  artistic
 achievement. In a way  it reiterates  the idea  of<I> Either/Or</I>,
  just as the title is a  variation on  that of  the debut  book; but
  with the vital difference that in the new work the religious stage,
  as  a  logical  consequence  of  the ideas  embodied in  the former
  works  exposing  the  impotence  of  human  ethics,   is  separated
  into a special stage.  <P>                                            


<I>   Stages on Life's Way</I>,  a work  of art,  and perhaps  the maturist
  expression  of  Kierkegaard's  ideas,  is  a  major work  in Danish
  literature.  Before  seeing it  through the  press, however,  he was
  already  at  work  on  yet  another  great  book,  this time  a work
  of  philosophy,  and  nothing  less  than   a  reckoning   with  the
  predominant       contemporary      school       of      philosophy,
  Hegelianism,  which  he  feared  and  opposed  with all  his energy,
  because  it  represented  a  backward  step  towards   paganism  and
  saw  the  whole  development  of  the  world  as a  manifestation of
  a necessary logical -- or as they said  then, dialectical  -- process,
  with  Christianity  an  inferior  part.  Had  Hegel's   system  been
  anti-Christian  it  would  not  have  given  such  great  offence to
  Kierkegaard;  but  just  because  it  accepted Christianity  and incorporated
  it  in the  system it  was dangerous,  and in  the great
  work  with  the  singular  title <I>oncluding  Unscientific Postscript
  to  the  Philosophical  Scraps</I>  (Afsluttende  uvidenskabeligt Efterskrift
 til de filosofiske Smuler), of 1846, he settles accounts with
  Hegel's   doctrine   or   system.  It   is  probably   the  wittiest
  philosophical  work ever  written.<p>

 In  the first  place, Kierkegaard
  attacks  Hegel's  tendency  to systematize  the whole  of existence,
  declaring that  a system  of existence  cannot be  constructed since
  existence  is  incomplete   and  constantly   developing.  Likewise,
  he  attacks  Hegel's  confusion  of  two  things which  are entirely
  unconnected:    namely,    logic    and    existence.    Hegel   had
  endeavoured   to   introduce   mobility   into   logic;  Kierkegaard
  demonstrates  the  mistake  of  trying  to  mix the  categories into
  a  single  hotch-potch.  Hegel  thought  he  had created  the objective
  theory  of  knowledge;  Kierkegaard,  sharply  opposing  this,
  put forward the thesis  that subjectivity  is truth,  or --  to quote
  his  own definition  of what  is truth  -- "the  objective uncertainty,
 maintained  possession of  the most  passionate fervour,  is the
  truth,  the  highest  truth, for  one existing".  To which  he adds:
  "But  the  given  definition  of  truth is  a paraphrase  of faith".
  Kierkegaard  deduces   one  further   consequence  of   his  definition
 of  truth: "When  subjectivity, intense  fervour (inderlighed),
  is the truth, then truth objectively fixed is paradox." <P>            
   The  threads  are  thus  brought  together  in this,  the most
 systematic work of the  great system-hater.  It is  certainly no
 system; but those who have the jaws to bite  on this  vast work,
 and  the  teeth  to  crush  its  tough  nuts,  will  there  find
 Kierkegaard's ideas in their most consistent and  coherent form.

  The   pseudonymous   authorship   caused   a    great   sensation
 among  the  literati  of  the  time  in  Copenhagen.  In literary
 circles  it  was   well-known  who   the  author   was,  although
 Kierkegaard  guarded  his  pseudonymity  jealously   until  1846.
 In  the  autumn  of  1845,  a few  months before  the publication
 of the<I> Unscientific Postscript</I>, the talented critic P.  L. M&oslash;ller
 wrote  a  review  of  the   existing  pseudonymous   works.  This
 gave rise to a  quarrel, the  so-called 'Corsair  dispute', which
 in  many  ways  left  a  deep  mark  on  the  last  ten  years of
 Kierkegaard's short life. <p>                                      
   P.  L.  M&oslash;ller's  review  contained  much  praise  and  admiration,
  particularly  for  Kierkegaard's  description of  the aesthctic stage.
 But  the reviewer  took a  sceptical view  of Kierkegaard  as  an
  ethical  and  religious personality  and allowed
 himself   some   remarks  of   a  somewhat   impertinent,  almost
 personal  nature.  P.L.  M&oslash;ller  devoted  his  attentions  mainly
 to  Guilty?  --  Not  Guilty?  He   undoubtedly  knew   that  this
 book was a poetical-realistic treatment of  the story  of Kierkegaard's
   own   engagement.   He   writes   of  the   chief  male
 character, Quidam,  that he  has lost  all that  constitutes personality:
 sentiment, intelligence, will, decision,  action, nervous  and  muscular
  strength.  Everything  has   been  sacrificed
 to  sterile  dialectics.  And  this  Quidam  has  put  the female
 character  to such  experimental torture  that it  is astonishing
 that she has not gone mad or drowned herself. Thus it says: <p>    
 


   "If  healthy  human  reason  may  be allowed  to step  in here,
 it  might  perhaps  say  in  rude impulsiveness:  If you  wish to
 regard life as a dissecting-room and yourself  as a  corpse, very
 well, tear yourself apart as  much as  you like;  so long  as you
 do  no  harm  to  others  the  police will  not come  and disturb
 your  activities.  But  to  weave   another  person   into  one's
 spider's web, dissect her alive, or torture the  soul out  of her
 little  by  little in  the name  of experiment,  that is  not yet
 permissible,  except in  the case  of insects,  and is  there not
 horror  even  in  the  thought  of  that,  which is  repulsive to
 healthy human nature?"  <p>                                        
 

 In  fact  P. L.  M&oslash;ller takes  up a  moral stand  against Kierkegaard
  which  must  have  been  all  the  more   irritating  as
 P.L. M&oslash;ller  had  a  bad  reputation  for  being  a  loose-living
 "aesthete"  just  in  Kierkegaard's  understanding  of  the word,
 and  as  a  Don  Juan.  Kierkegaard  immediately  wrote  a scornful
  article,  full  of  remarks  calculated to  arouse suspicion
 about  P.  L. M&oslash;ller,  in  the  distinguished  daily  paper  "The
 Fatherland".  At the  end of  it he  expresses the  following de-
 sire:  "If  only  I  might soon  appear in  "The Corsair"!  It is
 really  hard for  a poor  author to  be pointed  out as  the only
 figure in Danish literature who has not been abused in it."     
   "The  Corsair"  was  a  small, but  very widely  circulated and
 disreputable  weekly  which  was  wont  to  satirize,   often  in
 a  coarse  manner,  the  prominent  personalities  of  the  time.
 It carried on  "a regime  of terror",  as was  said at  the time,
 and  people  feared  "to  be  in the  Corsair". The  magazine had
 been  started  in  1840 by  a quite  young, promising  poet, Meir
 Goldschmidt,  who  still  edited  it.  P.L. M&oslash;ller  was  an occasional
  contributor.  Young  Goldschmidt  was  full   of  admiration  for
  Kierkegaard  and  had  on  various  occasions  "immortalized" 
 Victor  Eremita  in  his  paper.  Kierkegaard  must undoubtedly
  have  thought  that by  his officially  expressed wish
 to  be abused  in The  Corsair he  had placed  Goldschmidt and
 P. L. M&oslash;ller in an insoluble dilemma. What were they to do?<P>

   But  Goldschmidt  complied  with  the  wish.   From  January
 1846  "The Corsair"  embarked on  a stultification  of Kierkegaard
  as an  author and  as a  private individual.  The short
 articles  were  often  accompanied  by  malicious caricatures,
 and the persecution continued  for a  long period.  The effect
 on  Kierkegaard  was  overwhelming,  as can  be seen  from his
 numerous  statements  in  the  Journals about  Goldschmidt and
 his "vulgarity", which he also called  "literary contemptibility".
 Since he  was very  young, Kierkegaard  has been  in the
 habit of spending much time strolling in  the streets,  and he
 was  very fond  of holding  conversations with  ordinary folk.
 He  was  generous  to  beggars.  Now  according  to   his  own
 statement his relationship with  "the man  in the  street" was
 altered.  He  became  known  about the  city as  "a half-crazy
 eccentric". Street boys yelled Either -- Or after him  and prostitutes
 accosted the  author of  The Diary  of a  Seducer. It
 was an easy matter  for "The  Corsair"'s illustrator  to caricature 
 Kierkegaard's  outward  appearance.  He  was  not only
 round-shouldered   but   sway-backed   and   crook-backed   as
 well. His  legs  were  remarkably thin  and his  gait strangely
 irregular.  Now  it  became  a  torture  for  him to  walk along
 the  street.  He  gradually  began  to feel  like "a  martyr who
 was  being  ridiculed  to  death."  No  one came  to his  aid to
 fight  against  "The  Corsair".  "The  more  distinguished envy"
 held back.<p>                                                     

  Kierkegaard  began  to  feel  more  and  more   isolated,  and
 during the  following years  his relationship  with Christianity
 grew  more intensified.  The severe  form of  Christianity which
 he  had  learnt  as  a  child  began  to  become  more  and more
 dominant.  He  had  experienced  the  evil  of  the  world  per-
 sonally  through  "The  Corsair"  's  persecution. He  begins to
 feel more  and more  of a  martyr. His  leitmotif becomes  to an
 increasing  degree  to  "understand  himself in  suffering". The
 Christian ideal is a dying  to the  world, to  temporality. Even
 great  national  events  such  as   the  Danish-German   war  of
 1848 -- 50 are indifferent to him. "I know only one  danger, that
 of religiosity." The liberal  constitution of  1849 is  also indifferent
  to  him.  He was  distinctively conservative  in politics, full
 of irony  towards the  democratic principle  of coming to the
  right choice  by means  of a  majority of  votes, of
 the  ballot  system.

 The  event  which  set  things in  train was  the death  of Bishop
 Mynster.  Mynster  had  been  Bishop   of  Sj&aelig;lland   and  Primate
 of  the  Church  of  Denmark  for  twenty  years.  He  had  been a
 great  influence on  old Michael  Pedersen Kierkegaard,  and part-
 ly in deference to  his father  the son  had continued  to respect
 the  great  prelate.  Mynster was,  first and  foremost, a  man of
 wide  culture  and  a  man  of the  world. There  is no  reason to
 doubt his personal piety, but it was inseparable from  his general
 culture, which drew  its strength  as much  from the  Classics and
 Goethe  as from  the Gospels.  In S&oslash;ren  Kierkegaard as  the years
 pass  we  find  a growing  criticism of  the ageing  bishop, whose
 form  of  Christianity  seemed  to  him  an  adulteration. "Bishop
 Mynster's service  to Christianity,  really, is  that by  his considerable
  personality,  his  culture,  his prominent  position in
 fashionable  circles,  he  developed the  fashion, or  solemn convention,
  that  Christianity  was something  no person  of culture
 could  do  without.  To  an eternal  and Christian  view, however,
 this is  a rather  ambiguous service.  For surely  Christianity is
 much  too great  to be  patronized. And  in his  earnestness there
 is  something of  a  melange  --  so touched,  so deeply  moved, he
 is at the thought of its past glories, and yet,  when it  comes to
 the point,  so sensitive  about being  ever so  slightly belittled
 himself...  And  yet  I  love  Bishop  Mynster, and  it is  my one
 desire to do all that I can to enhance his reputation; for  I have
 admired  him,  and,  as  a  man,  admire  him still.  And whenever
 I  can  do  something  to  his  advantage, I  think of  my father,
 whom I think it pleases." <P>                                       

   That  was  what  Kierkegaard  wrote in  his journals  in 1848.
 Later  the  tone grew  sharper: "In  the splendid  Palace Chapel
 an  imposing  Court  preacher,  the  chosen  of  the  cultivated
 public, steps forward before a chosen circle of  the fashionable
 and cultivated public and  preaches emotionally  on the  text of
  the  Apostle:  'God  chose  the  mean and  despised' --  and nobody
  laughs!"  <P> 
                                                     
    Mynster, for his  part, did  not care  for Kierkegaard  and kept
  him  at arm's  length, rightly  seeing him  as a  dangerous rebel.
  But in spite of the latent conflict  between the  two, Kierkegaard
  continued  to  show  deep  respect  for  Mynster while  the bishop
  lived. He thought that he owed this to his father's memory. <P>      
    But  in  1854  Mynster  died  and  was  succeeded  by Martensen,
  a  man  of  some  standing:  his  Christian  Dogmatics  enjoyed  a
  European  reputation,  and  he  had  made  studies   of  Christian
  mysticism,  exemplified  especially  in   Jacob  B&ouml;hme,   who  had
  opened  up  new  vistas. But  he, too,  was an  orthodox Hegelian,
  having  the  self-assumed  task of  confuting the  subjectivity of
  Romantic  morals  through  a  "theoretical  knowledge   of  objectivity,
 of the absolute form of the State and religion, of science
  and   art."   Thus   his   theological  writing   became  markedly
  speculative in its character, culminating  in the  dogmatics which
  systematized  the  Christian  world  of  ideas  down to  the order
  of precedence among the angels. <P>                                  
    For  this man  Kierkegaard could  have no  sympathy at  all; and
  when,  in  his  memorial  sermon  on  Bishop  Mynster, he  went so
  far as to call  him "a  witness to  the truth",  thereby promoting
  the admired and idolized Mynster, in a  way, to  the ranks  of the
  martyrs,  Kierkegaard  could  contain  himself  no   longer.  This
  struck  him  as  blasphemy, and  as a  distortion of  every Christian value.
 There had to be a protest now! <P>                       
    It was the starting point of the final phase of  his authorship,
  in  which  Kierkegaard  abandoned  his   pseudonymity  and   in  a
  series of pamphlets addressed the general public direct,  in order
  to open its eyes to the falsification of Christianity that was being
 carried out by the clergy in Christianity's name.  The attacks
  culminated  in  the  publication  of  the  little  journal  called
 <i>&Oslash;jeblikket</i>  (The  Instant),  which  appeared  in nine  issues. The
  tenth was ready for publication  when he  collapsed in  the street
 and had to be  taken to  hospital, where  he died  shortly afterwards, 
shattered by the great internal strain imposed by  his recent activities.
 <P>                                               
   
  The last years of his life thus marked  an intense  outburst of
 production,  in  which  his  work  to some  extent acquired  a new
 content, and to a great extent a new form. In  his desire  to find
 an  audience  he  abandoned  his former  exclusive form  to become
 broad,  popular,  even  demagogic,  his  style coming  to resemble
 the journalism he had despised.  <P>                                

 As  regards content,  the last  publications added  nothing new,
 but  they  were  new  in  that  it  was  Kierkegaard  himself  who
 spoke, and not his pseudonyms. <P>                                  
   This  is bound  up with  the aim  he had  set himself.  He spoke
 in  his  own  name,  not  in order  to rebuke  the Church  and the
 clergy for not fulfilling the strict demands of  Christianity (for
 he was well aware that  neither they  nor he  could do  that), but
 because,  while  they  failed,  they  refused  to admit  that they
 neither  could  nor  would  conform  to  the  demands,  preferring
 to live in domestic comfort and prosperity and  worldly culture,
 while trying to make themselves and the world believe  that this
 was the meaning of Christianity. <P>
