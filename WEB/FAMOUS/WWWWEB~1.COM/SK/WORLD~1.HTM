To my contemporaries my significance depends on my trousers; it may be that to a later era my significance will also depend a little on my writings.

The first of many cartoons of Kierkegaard made by cartoonist Kl&aelig;strup appeared in The Corsair January 9, 1846. It depicted Kierkegaard as a man with extremely thin legs and with one trouser-leg invariably shorter than the other.

  The   pseudonymous   authorship   caused   a    great   sensation
 among  the  literati  of  the  time  in  Copenhagen.  In literary
 circles  it  was   well-known  who   the  author   was,  although
 Kierkegaard  guarded  his  pseudonymity  jealously   until  1846.
 In  the  autumn  of  1845,  a few  months before  the publication
 of the<I> Unscientific Postscript</I>, the talented critic P.  L. M&oslash;ller
 wrote  a  review  of  the   existing  pseudonymous   works.  This
 gave rise to a  quarrel, the  so-called 'Corsair  dispute', which
 in  many  ways  left  a  deep  mark  on  the  last  ten  years of
 Kierkegaard's short life. <p>                                      
   P.  L.  M&oslash;ller's  review  contained  much  praise  and  admiration,
  particularly  for  Kierkegaard's  description of  the aesthctic stage.
 But  the reviewer  took a  sceptical view  of Kierkegaard  as  an
  ethical  and  religious personality  and allowed
 himself   some   remarks  of   a  somewhat   impertinent,  almost
 personal  nature.  P.L.  M&oslash;ller  devoted  his  attentions  mainly
 to  Guilty?  --  Not  Guilty?  He   undoubtedly  knew   that  this
 book was a poetical-realistic treatment of  the story  of Kierkegaard's
   own   engagement.   He   writes   of  the   chief  male
 character, Quidam,  that he  has lost  all that  constitutes personality:
 sentiment, intelligence, will, decision,  action, nervous  and  muscular
  strength.  Everything  has   been  sacrificed
 to  sterile  dialectics.  And  this  Quidam  has  put  the female
 character  to such  experimental torture  that it  is astonishing
 that she has not gone mad or drowned herself. Thus it says:

   "If  healthy  human  reason  may  be allowed  to step  in here,
 it  might  perhaps  say  in  rude impulsiveness:  If you  wish to
 regard life as a dissecting-room and yourself  as a  corpse, very
 well, tear yourself apart as  much as  you like;  so long  as you
 do  no  harm  to  others  the  police will  not come  and disturb
 your  activities.  But  to  weave   another  person   into  one's
 spider's web, dissect her alive, or torture the  soul out  of her
 little  by  little in  the name  of experiment,  that is  not yet
 permissible,  except in  the case  of insects,  and is  there not
 horror  even  in  the  thought  of  that,  which is  repulsive to
 healthy human nature?"  <p>                                        
 

 In  fact  P. L.  M&oslash;ller takes  up a  moral stand  against Kierkegaard
  which  must  have  been  all  the  more   irritating  as
 P.L. M&oslash;ller  had  a  bad  reputation  for  being  a  loose-living
 "aesthete"  just  in  Kierkegaard's  understanding  of  the word,
 and  as  a  Don  Juan.  Kierkegaard  immediately  wrote  a scornful
  article,  full  of  remarks  calculated to  arouse suspicion
 about  P.  L. M&oslash;ller,  in  the  distinguished  daily  paper  "The
 Fatherland".  At the  end of  it he  expresses the  following de-
 sire:  "If  only  I  might soon  appear in  "The Corsair"!  It is
 really  hard for  a poor  author to  be pointed  out as  the only
 figure in Danish literature who has not been abused in it."     
   "The  Corsair"  was  a  small, but  very widely  circulated and
 disreputable  weekly  which  was  wont  to  satirize,   often  in
 a  coarse  manner,  the  prominent  personalities  of  the  time.
 It carried on  "a regime  of terror",  as was  said at  the time,
 and  people  feared  "to  be  in the  Corsair". The  magazine had
 been  started  in  1840 by  a quite  young, promising  poet, Meir
 Goldschmidt,  who  still  edited  it.  P.L. M&oslash;ller  was  an occasional
  contributor.  Young  Goldschmidt  was  full   of  admiration  for
  Kierkegaard  and  had  on  various  occasions  "immortalized" 
 Victor  Eremita  in  his  paper.  Kierkegaard  must undoubtedly
  have  thought  that by  his officially  expressed wish
 to  be abused  in The  Corsair he  had placed  Goldschmidt and
 P. L. M&oslash;ller in an insoluble dilemma. What were they to do?<P>

   But  Goldschmidt  complied  with  the  wish.   From  January
 1846  "The Corsair"  embarked on  a stultification  of Kierkegaard
  as an  author and  as a  private individual.  The short
 articles  were  often  accompanied  by  malicious caricatures,
 and the persecution continued  for a  long period.  The effect
 on  Kierkegaard  was  overwhelming,  as can  be seen  from his
 numerous  statements  in  the  Journals about  Goldschmidt and
 his "vulgarity", which he also called  "literary contemptibility".
 Since he  was very  young, Kierkegaard  has been  in the
 habit of spending much time strolling in  the streets,  and he
 was  very fond  of holding  conversations with  ordinary folk.
 He  was  generous  to  beggars.  Now  according  to   his  own
 statement his relationship with  "the man  in the  street" was
 altered.  He  became  known  about the  city as  "a half-crazy
 eccentric". Street boys yelled Either -- Or after him  and prostitutes
 accosted the  author of  The Diary  of a  Seducer. It
 was an easy matter  for "The  Corsair"'s illustrator  to caricature 
 Kierkegaard's  outward  appearance.  He  was  not only
 round-shouldered   but   sway-backed   and   crook-backed   as
 well. His  legs  were  remarkably thin  and his  gait strangely
 irregular.  Now  it  became  a  torture  for  him to  walk along
 the  street.  He  gradually  began  to feel  like "a  martyr who
 was  being  ridiculed  to  death."  No  one came  to his  aid to
 fight  against  "The  Corsair".  "The  more  distinguished envy"
 held back.<p>

  Kierkegaard  began  to  feel  more  and  more   isolated,  and
 during the  following years  his relationship  with Christianity
 grew  more intensified.  The severe  form of  Christianity which
 he  had  learnt  as  a  child  began  to  become  more  and more
 dominant.  He  had  experienced  the  evil  of  the  world  per-
 sonally  through  "The  Corsair"  's  persecution. He  begins to
 feel more  and more  of a  martyr. His  leitmotif becomes  to an
 increasing  degree  to  "understand  himself in  suffering". The
 Christian ideal is a dying  to the  world, to  temporality. Even
 great  national  events  such  as   the  Danish-German   war  of
 1848 -- 50 are indifferent to him. "I know only one  danger, that
 of religiosity." The liberal  constitution of  1849 is  also indifferent
  to  him.  He was  distinctively conservative  in politics, full
 of irony  towards the  democratic principle  of coming to the
  right choice  by means  of a  majority of  votes, of
 the  ballot  system.
