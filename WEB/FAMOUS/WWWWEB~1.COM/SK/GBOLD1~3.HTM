<b>Comments: </b>Without being too proud, I bet I was among the youngest that was so much inspired by Kierkegaard. And infact I am a seventeen year old Japanese student that goes to a boarding school in Britain [it's a Japanese school though] There was a time when I could not find the meaning of life,  You see I fell in love with a girl and I was quite happy but then I realised that I only loved bodily. Well we broked up but I think that was good. so there were common things in me and Kierkegaard's love toward Regine, That was how I got in to Kierkegaard. <hr>

<b>Comments: </b>I was trying to find anything about gurdjeff or is it gurjeff?
on the web. I couldn't find anything so I used this as a second
 choice and I am the richer for having done so. Thanks to you all
for keeping the dialogue going.  If any of you have any info on a specific 
web site let me know. I'm trying to track down an old aquaintance
who loved gurdjeff.   <hr>

<b>Comments: </b>Heelo again! I see that theres is a great interest in Kierkegaard.
In my theses i am dealing now with thw indirect communication.
And I think that thee pesudonyms really exists, they are the books.
Then I think first of all to do an study in Kierkegaard we have to analyze the personality
the existential position of each pseudonymous. Does somebody have research something about it?<hr>
