Soren's work, and being American I have a difficult time spelling his 
last name, hence SK for wanna be german-speakers like myself is a 
great help. But SK would not be the kind of guy who'd be concerned
about an American not being able to spell his last name right every
time.
"Fear and Trembling" and I became friends after a nasty divorce. SK's
philosophy of not allowing myself to be miserable all of the time 
allowed me to see that pain does have a purpose but I can't let it
rule all the time. SK wished that human relations could be pain-free
and perfect all the time as we all would like everything to be, but 
he was a realist as well and accepted that we are not perfect.
Documenting his feelings in such a perfect way as he did is a gift 
to all of us. As thinking, sensitive sometimes angry and/or
disgusted folks we are all in the same boat.
Thanx to the authors of this sight!

<Pre></b>
The Swedish publisher of existential philosophy NIMROD has taken on the
long neglected task of translating and publishing Sören Kierkegaards works
into Swedish. During 1995 was published "Fruktan och bävan" (Fear and
trembling), translated by Richard Hejll (published in 1920), modernized by
Stefan Borg. Also "Upprepningen" (Repetition) was published during 1995,
for the first time ever complete in Swedish. Translator: Stefan Borg.
During the spring 1996 will follow "Begreppet ångest" (The Concept of
Anxiety), translated by Stefan Borg, with introduction and commentaries by
Villy Sörensen. This will be the first complete edition of this work ever
in Swedish. Later this year NIMROD plans to publish a double edition
consisting of "Filosofiska smulor" (Philosophical fragments), translator
Thomas Andersson, and "Sjukdomen till döds" (Sickness unto death),
translator Stefan Borg. Of these two works only the latter has been
published earlier in Sweden (in 1881). For 1997 the publication of
"Avslutande ovetenskaplig efterskrift" (Concluding unscientific Postscript)
is planned. The aim is to provide the reading public of Sweden (or what's
left of it) with all of Kierkegaards substantial works, as time will allow
it.

In 1995 NIMROD also published "Kierkegaard och den existentiella filosofin"
(K. and the existential philosophy) by the russian philosopher Lev Sjestov
(1866-1938, in english transcr. Lev Shestov). Translator Stefan Borg.
Postscript and commentaries by Anatolij Achutin. Czeslaw Milosz's essay
"Sjestov eller Förtvivlans renhet" (Shestov or Purity of Despair,
translated by Olov Jonason) forms the introduction. By the same author
NIMROD also has published "Sola fide" (1995), translated and commented by
Stefan Borg, a book, which deals with the conflict between "Athens and
Jerusalem" in the history of philosophy and theology. For this highly
original russian thinker, with his roots in russian literature (esp.
Dostoevsky) and in the jewish tradition, the meeting with Kierkegaard,
which took place in his latter years, constituted a major impuls to his
thinking. In Sola fide, which was written before his acquaintance with
Kierkegaard, it is Martin Luther and his teaching of mans justification
through faith only (sola fides) that draws the attention of this excellent
philosopher and author, who unfortunately hasn't achieved the attention he
deserves in the west.

In May 1996 NIMROD will also publish "Den tredje möjligheten" (The third
possibility) by the Swedish existentialist Gunnar Odhner (born in 1942), a
book which deals with the conflict between the subjective and objective
concepts of truth, especially in modern Swedish literature. The English
reader will find more information about Odhner's book below, for the
Swedish reader a visit to <A Href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS1.HTM#107" tppabs="http://www.xpress.se/~guod0222/"> Odhner's own homepage</A> is highly recommended:

<b><A HREF=mailto:Gunnar.Odhner@xpress.se>Gunnar Odhner</A> wrote 05/05/96 -- 08:32:54:</b>
<pre></b>
Sören Kierkegaard was the one who opened my eyes to the difference
between 'knowing' and 'knowing', that is between knowledge that is not
fully integrated, a sort of outward knowledge, and the integrated
knowledge, in which, in a sense, there´s no difference between body
and soul, theory and practice.
This discrepancy became all too obvious to me in the seventies when I
read the books of Rolf Edberg, the ecologist, who was among those
persons who tried to explain the whole human existence from the
perspective of the evolution.  In the margin of the volumes of
Afsluttende uvidenskablig efterskrift (Concluding unscientific
postscript) the name of Edberg abounds.
What especially made me critical of the natural science point of view
was the lack of reference to the subject, the co-inventor of the whole
view of the world.  It was as if it didn´t exist, as if cosmos itself
had spoken directly to Edberg, as 'the viewpoint of the stars' became
his. There was a lack of responsibility in this attitude that annoyed
me and also scared me:  maybe the root of many of the ills of the
world lay hidden in that self-forgotten stand?
Through Kierkegaard I got hold of the end of this rope and started to
pull.  And the whole world came tumbling down.  At least it did as far
as my own standpoints were concerned.  The modern view of the world
started to appear to me as the loot of a conqueror, a self-made image
that was full of inconsistencies and flaws.
In many ways it contradicted itself as in the very essence of the
concept of ecology, which will be nothing but a sham to itself as long
as it is incapable of housing man. Edberg says for example:  'Ecology
is the science describing how all living creatures interact with their
surroundings . . . it´s a way of describing the totality of existence
. . . a cosmic biologic total view that includes everything from atoms
to galaxes'.  But it doesn´t include man and it never will, because
man cannot be put into a scheme or made part of objective knowledge in
that way.
This is one of the main points Kierkegaard makes as I see it:  The
more objective knowledge becomes the less room it has for man.  The
fully objective knowledge excludes man from life itself, makes of the
subject a mere nothingness that confuses himself with cosmos and the
totality, with the pictures of his own making.  Man stabs himself in
the heart with his own speculations. But that is well-known to all who
have studied the philosophy of Kierkegaard.
What maybe is at least partly new in my book is the merging of
Kierkegaard with Marx, the subjective with the objective.  Kierkegaard
says that 'subjectivity is truth', but as I see it it´s not the whole
truth. You come closer, in my opinion, if you say that truth is the
objective standpoint that is subjectively aware of itself or
subjective truth that is aware of the objects giving it sustenance.
To pinpoint what I mean by truth, I elaborate on a statement by
Francis Bacon, in which he claims that science shows us a 'true model
of the world'.  The only true model that can exist ‹ that´s my theory
‹ is the word, as all other models are different from what they model.
And the word can only be a true model if you are the word, that is if
there is no difference between your body and the word:  you have to be
your knowledge to have knowledge.
In my book I also write about how difficult that is in a world of
inequality, where the exploitation of man by man is a distortion of
the word, a denial in practice of truth.  From my point of view power
is always blind and only the man who has knowledge through being his
knowledge is permitted to shake off all power.  I claim that authority
(power), not less than the lack of authority, always is wrong.
As I see it the human race has oscillated between these two positions
in history:  authority saying that there is a truth but it has to be
interpreted, and the lack of authority which says that there is no
truth, only interpreters.  The first standpoint is that of the
medieval society and all other societies where you need the approval
of an authority in order to establish truth.  The second one describes
our modern secular world, where everybody finds his own 'truth'.
In opposition to both these historical attempts to establish truth I
propose a third possibility, rarely used in history, but clearly
aligned with the thoughts of Kierkegaard:  There is a truth but no
interpreters.  Nobody will ever be able to say:  this is the truth.
But truth nevertheless exists.
'Den tredje möjligheten' is available (in Swedish) at Nimrods förlag,
Reboda 2762, S-711 78 Guldsmedshyttan, Sverige. It´s a hard cover book
of about 145 pages. It costs 150 skr when ordered from Stefan Borg,

IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF SOEREN KIERKEGAARD

The world famous Danish poet and
philosopher Soeren Kierkegaard stayed
in the North Zealand fishing town
of Gilleleje in 1835. The town is
around 20 miles north of the city of
Elsinore of Shakespeare Hamlet fame.
During his stay Kierkegaard made a
number of excursions in the surroundings
and then put his thoughts and impressions
on paper.

Graested-Gilleleje County and the Soeren
Kierkegaard Foundation and Society have
planned a number of events in connection
with Copenhagen being Europe´s Cultural
City 1996.

On 27 April 1996 a number of Kierkegaard
walking tours along his paths in the
surroundings were introduced. All tours
are described in seperate brochures with
maps and Kierkegaard quotes (unfortunately
only in Danish).

On July 1, 1996, an exhibition, *Excerpts
from Soeren Kierkegaard´s Life and Works*,
will be opened in the Old Town Hall on
Vesterbrogade in Gilleleje. The same day
a Soeren Kierkegaard Refugium will be
inaugurated. It is planned to offer six
Kierkegaard scholars a place to stay in
Denmark and be a future center for
Kierkegaard activities in the area.

Anybody interested in Kierkegaard and
his works should take the opportunity
to visit Gilleleje and surroundings if
on a tour to Denmark.

The brochures (free) on the walking tours
and a book, _I Soeren Kirkegaards Fodspor_,
is available from Gilleleje Tourist Office,
Gilleleje Hovedgade 6F, Dk-3250 GILLELEJE,
Denmark or from the Soeren Kierkegaard
Foundation, contact Lis Moeller-Joergensen,
Bygaden 40 A, Soeborg, Dk-3250 GILLELEJE, Denmark.
