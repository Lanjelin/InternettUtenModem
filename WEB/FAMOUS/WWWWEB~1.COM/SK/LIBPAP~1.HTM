An Althusserian Critique of Fear and Trembling</CENTER></B><P><Font size=2>
Authors introduction:</B><BR></B><font size=2>I just completed a paper for my structual analysis course on Louis
Althusser and Fear and Trembling. I was always amazed at the discourse of
Kierkegaard in this book, and once I read Althusser's theory of ideology
and ideological apparatuses I came to look at Fear and Trembling as an
appartus of Faith. Upon re-reading the Preface and Epilogue, it became
apparent at what Kierkegaard was attempting to do on both a philosophical
and religious point. In the way the narrator interacts with the reader,
we become at the same time Abraham and the ultimate questioner. The
reader is left with no answers, only questions by the completion of the
text, but these questions are so valuable that the price of faith is
raised in such a way that not only does the reader want to purchase that
faith, but in addition he realizes that he can.<P>
I hope people give feedback. I am discovering what I once had hoped, that Kierkegaard was not only the
father of existentialism. It has always appeared to me that he did not
want his audience to just accept information but to question it any way
they deem possible. That effort should be placed on his works and in so
doing a vast world of possibilities arise.<P>
