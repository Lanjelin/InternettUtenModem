<CENTER><H3>Rating the sites</H3></CENTER><FONT SIZE=3>
Sites are awarded from 0 to 5 stars (<IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif">) depending on the number of points given by you and  other people, who visit and evaluate the sites.<BR>
If you think a site deserves to be rated higher than the number of stars, it already have, you click <IMG SRC="HAPPY.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/happy.gif"> (+1 point). If you think it is rated too high, you click <IMG SRC="SAD.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/sad.gif"> (- 1 points). The page is updated and stars are added or removed, according to the total score for each site:<P>
<IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"> = 1 points, <IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"> = 3 points, 
<IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"> = 5 points, 
<IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"> = 10 points, 
<IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"><IMG SRC="STAR.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/star.gif"> = 15 points<P>
Since you only have 1 point for each site, the total points for the site is not necessarily changed so much that the number of stars are changed immediately, but you have moved it in your direction .<P>
<B>You have only one point to give or take for each site mentioned on the page</B>. This is controlled by checking the IP-address.<P>

The amount of Kierkegaard-material on the Internet is growing so rapidly, that it before or later becomes inevitable to make some kind of evaluation. Whether this is the right way to do it, I don't know. I appreciate any <A HREF=mailto:lindsoe@po.ia.dk>comments</A> on this project!<P>

(All new sites starts with 0 points, but will be labeled <IMG SRC="NEW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.webcom.com/sk/new.gif"> for a month)<P>
