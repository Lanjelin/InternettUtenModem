<hr><a name="ny"></a>
<p><i>Q. Has Madonna ever appeared on Broadway?</i>
<br>Yes, Madonna's first attempt at stage acting (1986) came in a little known experimental theatre piece entitled "Goose & Tomtom" which played for a short run in New York City.  It cast Madonna and Sean Penn and like their film collaboration was also a complete disaster.
<br>She acted alongside Joe Mantegna and Ron Silver in a more recent David Mamet play, "Speed The Plow" (1988).
<hr><a name="manager"></a>
<p><i>Q. Who is Madonna's personal manager?</i>
<br>Freddy DeMann, who also previously managed such artists as Michael Jackson, Lionel Ritchie and The Smithereens.  If you want to get in touch with anyone who has anything to do with Madonna however, all such enquiries usually go through Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg.
<hr><a name="clothes"></a>
<p><i>Q. Who's clothes (designs) does Madonna like to wear?</i>
<br>Of the many designers that Madonna admires some of her favorites are Dolce & Gabbana, Jean Paul Gaultier and Betsy Johnson.  She has recently been doing appearances in Versace designs, and has been featured in their most recent ad campaign.
<hr><a name="influence"></a>
<p><i>Q. What musicians/singers influenced Madonna?</i>
<br>In Madonna's own words, "a lot of Motown...like Diana Ross and 
Stevie Wonder". Her three favorite records-which she 
owned as 45 RPM singles-were Strawberry Alarm Clock's "Incense & 
Peppermint", Gary Puckett's "Young Girl" and The Box Tops "The 
Letter".  Later, when she started playing in bands she was said to 
have been influence heavily by The Pretenders and The Police. 
<hr><a name="bands"></a>
<p><i>Q. What bands was Madonna in prior to going solo?</i>
<br>Some names of bands Madonna was in were: The Millionaires, Modern Dance, The Breakfast Club, Emmy, and also auditioned to be backup singer for disco singer, Patrick Hernandez who was best know for his single, "Born To Be Alive".
<hr><a name="crap"></a>
<p><i>Q. Who the hell is this guy Otto Von Wernherr who I keep hearing 
about and released albums like, "Madonna, In The Beginning" etc?</i>
<br>In 1981, when Madonna was hard-up for money she took a job singing 
back-up for avant garde German artist Otto Von Wernherr.  She 
lent her vocals to three of his songs, "Wild Dancing", "Cosmic 
Climb", and "We Are The Gods".  Her actual participation on the 
tracks was minimal consisting of repetitive chorus lines behind 
Otto's monotone, spoken, flat and German accented vocals.  When 
Madonna hit the big time, he remixed the songs to bring Madonna's 
voice out to the front of the mixes and released them on the UK 
label, Receiver Records which is now marketed as the package 
"Madonna (& Otto Von Wernherr) In The Beginning" and features 
extended dance mixes of the songs.  The tracks and Madonna's voice 
are all horrific and his countless re-releases and picture discs
are soley a rip-off.  If you're a completist collector, you'll
probably want to have at least one version of it, but other than 
that, it's a complete waste of time and money.   
<hr><a name="sex"></a>
<i>Q. How can I get a copy of Madonna's book, "Sex"?</i>
<br>The book is now out of print and most stores have completely sold 
out of all of their copies.  Some bookstores who have copies left 
are selling them for as high as $200.  Japanese and French versions have popped up in the US every now and again.
<hr><a name="fans"></a>
<i>Q. Are there any Madonna Fanzines or Fan Clubs  which I can 
subscribe to or become a member of?</i>
