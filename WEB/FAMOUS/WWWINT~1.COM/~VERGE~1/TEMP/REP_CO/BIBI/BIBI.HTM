Bibi Andersson's professional relationship with Ingmar Bergman began with an appearance in one of his <I>Bris</I> soap commercials in 1951. (She played a princess.) Her image of unblemished, youthful innocence persisted for many years after. In the late 1950s she appeared in several of Bergman's classics—including <A HREF="../../FILMS/SEVENTH/SEVENTH.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/seventh/seventh.htm"><I>The Seventh Seal</I></A> and <A HREF="../../FILMS/WILD/WILD.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/wild/wild.htm"><I>Wild Strawberries</I></A> (both 1957)—invariably symbolizing purity and hope. (It was during this same period that she and Bergman shared a close personal relationship.) This image of innocence was shattered, however, with Andersson's intense portrayal of the tortured nurse Alma in <A HREF="../../FILMS/PERSONA/PERSONA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/persona/persona.htm"><I>Persona</I></A> (1966)—one of the great performances in cinema. Since then, she has had a distinguished career with the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm (including several of Bergman's productions), in addition to fitful international film appearances—among them John Huston's <I>The Kremlin Letter</I> (1970), Robert Altman's <I>Quintet</I> (1979), and a cameo in Gabriel Axel's <I>Babette's Feast</I> (1987). In recent years she has pursued humanitarian causes, most notably in the former Yugoslavia.<BR>

<H4>Bibi Andersson</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"It was the knowledge of a person that inspired him [Bergman] to write in a certain direction. Even if it was unconscious, I'm sure it was playing a big part. If he was at work on something and knew that one of his actress friends had a similar problem or attitude, he would use her. When I was reading a script, I tried to figure out what side of me he was trying to use now, or what he had seen, or what it was that he did not want. You can sometimes be very frustrated if you feel the part does not do you justice. When I read <A HREF="../../FILMS/PERSONA/PERSONA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/persona/persona.htm"><I>Persona</I></A> I wasn't flattered. I didn't understand why I had to play this sort of insecure, weak personality when I was struggling so hard to be sure of myself and to cover up my insecurities. I realized that he was totally aware of my personality. I was better off just trying to deliver that. It's a good way to know oneself. Sometimes I think artists instinctively are very good psychiatrists. I also think all parts have to be based on oneself, otherwise they will never come across."—<B>Bibi Andersson, "Dialogue on Film," <I>American Film</I> (1977)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I don't feel anything for my work in those films [<A HREF="../../FILMS/SEVENTH/SEVENTH.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/seventh/seventh.htm"><I>The Seventh Seal</I></A>, <A HREF="../../FILMS/WILD/WILD.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/wild/wild.htm"><I>Wild Strawberries</I></A>]. I love the films, still. They are very vivid in my memory even if they're twenty years old. But I have no connection with what I was doing then. I saw <I>Wild Strawberries</I> recently, and I thought I was terrible, terrible. But we were all rather corny in those days. There was a certain kind of acting that seemed different, or perhaps it had to do with the sound that came out different. I don't know. The voices sounded different then; I hear them as being artificial. Maybe that is why I feel a certain distance when I see those films. But it doesn't matter. I'm proud of the films, but not with regard to myself. <A HREF="../../FILMS/PERSONA/PERSONA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/persona/persona.htm"><I>Persona</I></A>, on the other hand, I'm still proud of. Each time I see it, I know I accomplished what I set out to do as an actress, that I created a person."—<B>Bibi Andersson, "Dialogue on Film," <I>American Film</I> (1977)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Critics</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"One of the most harrowing roles the screen has presented [is] Nurse Alma in <A HREF="../../FILMS/PERSONA/PERSONA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/persona/persona.htm"><I>Persona</I></A>. That this masterpiece owed so much to Bibi Andersson was acknowledgement of her greater emotional experience. She was thirty now, and in that astonishing scene where Liv Ullmann and she look into the camera as if it were a mirror, and Ullmann arranges Andersson's hair, it is as if Bergman were saying: 'Look what time has done. Look what a creature this is.' Alma talks throughout <I>Persona</I> but is never answered, so that her own insecurity and instability grow. Technically the part calls for domination of timing, speech, and movement that exposes the chasms in the soul. And it was in showing that breakdown, in reliving Alma's experience of the orgy on the beach years before, in deliberately leaving glass on the gravel, and in realizing with awe and panic that she is only another character for the supposedly sick actress, that Andersson herself seemed one of the most tormented women in cinema."—<B>David Thomson, <I>A Biographical Dictionary of Film</I> (1994)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"<I>The Touch</I> shows that she is the warmest, most free-spirited of Bergman's women, more broadly compassionate than Thulin or Ullmann. Being more robust, her distress is more moving, and her doggedness more encouraging."—<B>David Thomson, <I>A Biographical Dictionary of Film</I> (1994)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
