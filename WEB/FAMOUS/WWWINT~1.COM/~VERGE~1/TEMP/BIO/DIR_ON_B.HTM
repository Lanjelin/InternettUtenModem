<H3>Jean-Luc Godard</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The cinema is not a craft. It is an art. It does not mean team-work. One is always alone; on the set as before the blank page. And for Bergman, to be alone means to ask questions. And to make films means to answer them. Nothing could be more classically romantic."—<B>Jean-Luc Godard, "Bergmanorama," <I>Cahiers du cinéma</I> (July 1958)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>François Truffaut</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Bergman is a stubborn, shy man. He devotes his whole life to the theatre and movies, and one has the sense that he is only happy when he’s working surrounded by actresses, and that in the near future one won’t see a Bergman film without women. I think he’s more involved in the feminine principle than in feminism. Women are not seen through a masculine prism in his films, but are observed in a spirit of total complicity. His female characters are infinitely subtle, while his male characters are conventions."—<B>François Truffaut (1973)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Consider the cleanness of his images. Some filmmakers allow pure chance to enter into their images—the sun, passersby, a bicycle (filmmakers like Rossellini, Lelouch, and Huston) and others want to control every square inch of the screen (Eisenstein, Lang, and Hitchcock). Bergman started out like the first group and then changed camps. In his latest films you never see a chance pedestrian; your attention will never be distracted by an extra object in the setting, even a bird in the garden. There is nothing on the canvas except what Bergman (who’s anti-pictorial, like all true filmmakers) wants there."—<B>François Truffaut (1973)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The human face. No one draws so close to it as Bergman does. In his recent films there is nothing more than mouths talking, ears listening, eyes expressing curiosity, hunger, panic."—<B>François Truffaut (1973)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
