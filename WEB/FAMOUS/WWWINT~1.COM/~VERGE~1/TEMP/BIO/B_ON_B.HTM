<H3>On Ideology</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"My basic view of things is—not to have any basic view of things.  From having been exceedingly dogmatic, my views on life have gradually dissolved.  They don't exist any longer."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>On Dreams</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"No other art-medium—neither painting nor poetry—can communicate the specific quality of the dream as well as the film can.  When the lights go down in the cinema and this white shining point opens up for us, our gaze stops flitting hither and thither, settles and becomes quite steady.  We just sit there, letting the images flow out over us.  Our will ceases to function.  We lose our ability to sort things out and fix them in their proper places.  We're drawn into a course of events—we're participants in a dream.  And manufacturing dreams, that's a juicy business."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Sometimes while I'm dreaming I think: 'I'll remember this, I'll make a film of it'—it's a sort of occupational disease."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>On Strindberg</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Strindberg has followed me all my life.  Sometimes I've felt deeply attracted to him, sometimes repelled....he expressed things which I'd experienced and which I couldn't find words for.  I was stuffed with inhibitions—that's something we mustn't forget in this connection."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>On Scriptwriting</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"For a long time I go about with one or two ideas in my head, gathering material, making notes, and so on. Since I've always been busy with so many things, I've had to be methodical about the way I divide up my working time. I know a time will come when I shall be able to say: 'Now I've got six or eight weeks, when I can write my script.' So it's all planned well in advance. Then all I have to do is to sit down and make a start. After which the writing of the script goes on in a very, very methodical, very disciplined, very pedantic fashion."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>On Actors</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"An actor exposes himself. He exposes his voice. He exposes his body. He exposes his soul to the public, from a stage, before a camera, or a microphone. In the moment of self-exposure he feels a strong need to have an eye or an ear on him all the time, correcting and controlling; just as a dancer has his mirror, or the musician a tape recorder. It's a perfectly legitimate need, which me must understand and gratify."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>On Film Rushes</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Looking at our own rushes we have to act as if we were our own critics—but completely objective and unneurotic critics, without any crises of conscience. The material goes rushing by, and all that matters is to decide what's good and what's bad. Only on these terms can one go ahead. And the same applies in the cutting room, and when the film is first run. I think it was Faulkner who coined the expression 'kill your darlings'. These two rules, for me, are basic."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>On Television</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I'm no bookworm. Never have been, never will be. But of everything to do with pictures and images I'm omnivorous. All that affects me intensely, closely.  Whatever is visible or audible—image and sound—that's what affects me most."—<B>Ingmar Bergman, <I>Bergman on Bergman</I> (1968)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
