<P>"It's scary that <I>Jägarna</I> has been nominated for the Guldbaggar [Sweden's "Oscars"]. The film is superficial and naive." This from Ingmar Bergman about last year's biggest film success. At the same time he cuts down all of today's young directors.</P>

<P>"The young Swedish directors are very skilled but they really have nothing to say," Ingmar says in an interview that aired yesterday. "If you can't make someone cry or laugh there's no meaning." The film <I>Jägarna</I> is not to his liking. "There is not one personal touch besides the Swedish landscape. The film is well done, but it's almost bordering on comedy, a xerox of an American action film," he says.</P>

<P>Ingmar praises the technique and skill of the young directors, but he feels that they lack depth and don't reach into the soul. "The problem is that there are no producers in Sweden today. I feel sorry for the young ones in the business today."</P>

<P>After having put down both young directors and producers, he attacks the film and theatre critics. "All forms of criticism are being trivialized. All the amusing men are gone now. These days the critics have a rule to be short and to simplify things."</P>

<P>But not everything is bad. Ingmar praises Jan Troell and his film <I>Hamsun</I>, which was rejected by audiences but praised to the skies by critics. "It's a film that shines like a beacon above the rest. Troell is a truly brilliant genius. He doesn't care if the films are public successes or not. <I>Hamsun</I> is an absolutely exceptional film."</P>

<P>In the TV-interview Bergman also recounts that he spends his summers at Fårö watching Swedish films. "I watch all Swedish films that are made, and it's often a very mixed experience. A film that was remarkably well done was <I>Älskar, Älskar Inte</I> ["Love, Love Not"]. It was incredibly well told but the director failed to get to the core."</P>

<P>The best comments from Bergman are received by Richard Hobert for <I>Glädjekällan</I> ["Spring of Joy"]. "It's one of the best Swedish films I've seen in years. He tells the story in an enchanting way."</P>

<P>Ingmar also reveals that he often watches French TV at home on Fårö. "It's awesome! I get fascinated by this extraordinary event every time. There I am on Fårö watching a show from the Paris opera. It's unbelievable!"</P>

<P>Music has brought much joy to him throughout the years. "It has been a great joy in life's various stages. It's exceptional with CDs nowadays. To be able to listen to music in a new way..."</P>
