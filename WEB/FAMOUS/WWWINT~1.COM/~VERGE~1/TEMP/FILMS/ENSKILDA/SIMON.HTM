<P>It took watching <I>Enskilda Samtal</I> for twenty minutes before I found myself getting involved in the story. It's like reading a good book: the beginning is often boring, but when you've reached the end you're glad you gave it a try!</P>

<P><I>Enskilda Samtal</I> is divided into six different conversations between Anna (Pernilla August) and her relatives and friends. The story jumps to different times as each new coversation begins. Three of them are set in 1925, one in 1927, one in 1934 and the last one in 1907. Comparing this film with <I>The Best Intentions</I> (1992), which is set in 1916-1918, you might say that <I>Enskilda Samtal</I> is a plain sequel made to gain profit because people liked <I>The Best Intentions</I>. This is not the case. <I>Enskilda Samtal</I> is an entirely different movie and can't be compared to its prequel, although both of them are about Bergman's parents.</P>

<P>While <I>The Best Intentions</I> is more of a "Hollywood-movie", most comparable to <A HREF="../FANNY/FANNY.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/films/fanny/fanny.htm"><I>Fanny and Alexander</I></A> among Bergman's films, <I>Enskilda Samtal</I> is more like a stage-play comparable to <I>Scenes from a Marriage</I> (which was produced for TV and, later, the stage) in its realistic conversations between husbands, wives and relatives; and to <I>After the Rehearsal</I> (1984, made for TV) in its focus on the actors' performances and their characters' emotions.</P>

<P>The film begins in a church-yard in Uppsala. Anna crosses it on her way home as she meets her old confirmation-priest Jacob (Max von Sydow) resting on a bench. Troubled by her problems, she starts to cry when Jacob asks how everything is. She confesses that she is having an affair with a man who is eleven years younger than she. The conversation moves on to Anna's home, where she tells Jacob more about her lover and the relationship with her husband. Jacob advises her to tell her husband the truth and to leave her lover. Most of all Anna would like to leave everything and live with her lover, but she realizes that her children will be taken away from her if she does, and that a real relationship probably won't be such a good idea because
of the age-difference.</P>

<P>To enjoy <I>Enskilda Samtal</I> as much as possible you have to be fully concentrated and focused on the plot. You must listen carefully all the time to the speech, because that's where the plot is taking place. It can be quite boring to watch talking heads for three hours, and so it is in the beginning. It's a slowstarter you could say. Max von Sydow's role as Jacob is tough to make vivid. For the umpteenth time he plays an elderly priest—this time a really old one with the movements in a small way. Von Sydow, now 67, probably needs something extra to sparkle as in the old days. The director, Liv Ullmann, seems to have been unable to draw out von Sydow's full register, but, along with his role in <I>Hamsun</I> (1996), this is still his best performance since <I>The Best Intentions</I>, and it's a delight to hear him speaking of God as something holy and merely a symbol for man's faith.</P>

<P>Pernilla August is magnificent as Anna, although the camera is focused on her at least half the time of the movie. The camera loves her! Her face is never the same, preventing the viewer from getting bored. August does a tremendous work playing the tormented Anna. It's truly painful to see her anguished face in those moments.</P>

<P>The happiest moment in the film occurs when Anna meets her lover Tomas in secret, in the third conversation which takes place in Molde, Norway. Tomas is beautifully played by Tomas Hanzon, who makes his character naive, shy and sensitive. A love-meeting however is not that simple; it's obvious that they don't really know each other and that they're both ashamed of what they're doing—especially Tomas, who leaves earlier than planned and blames Anna for persuading him to have made the trip to Norway.</P>

<P>Samuel Fr&ouml;ler, who plays Henrik, Anna's husband, appears only in the second conversation, which takes place in a summer-house on an island in the Stockholm Archiplego. Fr&ouml;ler, however, gives a great performance: sweet and tender in the beginning, even when Anna tells him the truth, but then gradually, masterfully furious and picayune.</P>

<P>Anita Bj&ouml;rk, best known for playing the title role in Sj&ouml;berg's <I>Miss Julie</I> (1951), is Anna's mother (her performance is so brilliant, they could sell the whole movie on advertising: Anita Bj&ouml;rk <I>is</I> Ingmar Bergman's grandmother). She meets Anna in private in the fourth conversation, since she and Henrik hate each other. When Anna tells her mother that Henrik must be declared insane, Strindberg-fans can see a reference to Strindberg's play <I>Fadren</I> ["The Father"], and Bergman-fans get a new entry in their collection of Strindberg-references in Bergman's scripts.</P>

<P>The classical music is beautiful and moody (a.a. &quot;Jesu, joy of man's desiring&quot;, one of Beethoven's best chorales), which gets the movie into the right mood, as do the ugly, glaring wallpapers of the twenties.</P>

<P><I>Enskilda Samtal</I> will be released outside Scandinavia in a shorter version, entitled <I>Confessions</I>, in 1997. Don't miss it!</P>
<BR>
<P>On a scale of 0 to 5 wild strawberries, <I>Enskilda Samtal</I> gets 4.</P>
