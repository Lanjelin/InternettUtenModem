<BLOCKQUOTE><P>"Bergman wanted to cut that scene [beach orgy monologue]. His wife had read it or—I don't know—but he was advised not to keep it in. I said, 'Let me shoot it, but just let me alter certain words no woman would say. It's written by a man, and I can feel it's a man. Let me change certain things.' He said, 'You do what you want with it. We'll shoot it, and then we'll go and see it together.'</P>
<P>He was very embarrassed and so was I—I was terribly embarrassed to do the scene. We shot it in one long close-up in one take. Two hours. We started rehearsing at nine, and we were through at eleven. There was both Liv's and my own close-up. Then we saw it, and he said, 'I'll keep it. It's so good. But I want you, all by yourself, to go into the dubbing room, because there's something wrong with the sound.' I didn't think so. I had been talking very high, very girlish. So the whole monologue was dubbed afterward, and I changed my voice. I suddenly put my voice lower, and that I dared to do when I was totally alone and no one could watch me or see me or anything. That might be what gives the scene a certain intimate quality."—<B><A HREF="../../REP_CO/BIBI/BIBI.HTM" tppabs="http://www.interlog.com/~vergerus/temp/rep_co/bibi/bibi.htm">Bibi Andersson</A>, "Dialogue on Film," <I>American Film</I> (1977)</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I think that for a while the two women really mingled, that I as a nurse understood her. I identified with her, and I was even able to say things in her place. I'm sure all this will change the life of the nurse, because before that she had been very square. She had never used her imagination toward other people; she had never analyzed what was happening to herself either. Suddenly, through the silence of the other woman, she was able to put herself in her place, understanding her world and her thinking and to express that."—<B>Bibi Andersson, "Dialogue on Film," <I>American Film</I> (1977)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Mini Reviews</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="kael">"</A>In this film, as in his very early <I>Prison</I> [<I>The Devil's Wanton</I>], the writer-director Ingmar Bergman involves us in the making of a movie. He gives us a movie within a movie, but he seems hardly to have made the enclosing movie, and then he throws away the inner one. (You can feel it go—at the repeated passage, when the director seems to be trying an alternate way of shooting a sequence.) It's a pity, because the inner movie had begun to involve us in marvellous possibilities: an actress (Liv Ullmann) who has abandoned the power of speech is put in the care of a nurse (Bibi Andersson), and the nurse, like an analysand who becomes furious at the silence of the analyst, begins to vent her own emotional disturbances. The two women look very much alike, and Bergman plays with this resemblance photographically by suggestive combinations and superimpositions. Most movies give so little that it seems almost barbarous to object to Bergman's not giving us more in <I>Persona</I>, but it is just because of the expressiveness and fascination of what we are given that the movie is so frustrating. There is, however, great intensity in many of the images, and there's one great passage: the nurse talks about a day and night of sex on a beach, and as she goes on talking, with memories of summer and nakedness and pleasure in her voice and the emptiness of her present life in her face, viewers may begin to hold their breath in fear that the director won't be able to sustain this almost intolerably difficult sequence. But he does, and it builds and builds and is completed. It's one of the rare truly erotic sequences in movie history."—<B>Pauline Kael, <I>5001 Nights at the Movies</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE>
