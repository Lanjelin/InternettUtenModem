<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="kael">"</A>Ingmar Bergman's festive and full-bodied dream play—a vision of family life as a gifted boy might have perfected it, replacing his strict family (Bergman's father was a clergyman) with a generous-hearted theatrical clan. In what Bergman said would be his final movie, his obsessions are turned into stories, and he tells them to us—he makes us a beribboned present of his Freudian-gothic dream world. The movie is scaled big; it runs for 3 hours and 10 minutes, and its lovingly placed warm gingerbreading is enormously enjoyable. But the conventionality of the thinking in the film is rather shocking. It's as if Bergman's neuroses had been tormenting him for so long that he cut them off and went sprinting back to Victorian health and domesticity."—<B>Pauline Kael, <I>5001 Nights at the Movies</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="maltin">"Haunting, engrossing family saga set in turn-of-the-century Sweden; a summing up of Bergman's career (announced as his final film). Scenes of joy, exuberance, pain, torment, exquisitely expressed, and largely seen through the eyes of a young boy. This earned Oscars as Best Foreign Film, and for its costumes, art direction-set decoration, and Sven Nykvist's lovely cinematography. Edited from an even longer television mini-series. Look for Lena Olin as a maid."—<B>Leonard Maltin, <I>Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide</I></B></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
