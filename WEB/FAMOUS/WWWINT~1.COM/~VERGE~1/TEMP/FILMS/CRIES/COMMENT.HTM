<BLOCKQUOTE>"It begins like Chekhov's <I>Three Sisters</I> and ends like <I>The Cherry Orchard</I> and in between it's more like Strindberg."—<B>François Truffaut (1973)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Ingmar Bergman's <I>Cries and Whispers</I> was a worldwide success though it had all the elements of failure, including the sight of the slow torture of a woman dying of cancer—everything the public refuses to look at. But the film's formal perfection, especially the use of red in the decor of the house, constituted the element of exaltation—I would even say the element of pleasure—so that the public immediately sense that it was watching a masterpiece. And it made up its mind to look at it with an artistic complicity and admiration that balanced and compensated for the trauma of Harriet Andersson's cries and her groans of agony."—<B>François Truffaut, "What do critics dream about?" (1975)</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="kael">"</A>Ingmar Bergman's dream play is set in a manor house at the turn of the century where a spinster in her late 30s (Harriet Andersson) is dying. Her two sisters (Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann) have come to attend her, and they watch and wait, along with a peasant servant (Kari Sylwan). The movie is built out of a series of emotionally charged images that express inner stress, and Bergman handles them with the fluidity of a master. Superbly photographed by Sven Nykvist in a style suggesting Edvard Munch, and with blood-red backgrounds, the film is smooth and hypnotic; it has oracular power and the pull of a dream. Yet there's a 19th-century dullness at the heart of it. Each sister represents a different aspect of woman—woman viewed as the Other—and the film mingles didacticism with erotic mystery."—<B>Pauline Kael, <I>5001 Nights at the Movies</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><A NAME="maltin">"Beautifully photographed and acted drama about lives of a dying woman, her sisters and a servant girl was tremendous critical success, but may be too talky for some."—<B>Leonard Maltin, <I>Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide</I></B></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
