<H3><A NAME="tag1">The Kanhave Canal</A></H3>

<P>
From 30 March to 12 April 1995 an
excavation will take place on the western side of the Kanhave
Canal on Sams&oslash;. The investigation will be carried out by
Anne N&oslash;rg&aring;rd J&oslash;rgensen in connection with
the laying of new telephone cables in the area. The work will
be carried out in cooperation with the National Museum's Natural
Science Research Unit, which has previously dated the time of
construction of the canal to 726 AD on the basis of dendrochronological
analyses.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag2">Nydam</A></H3>

<P>
It is planned that Flemming Rieck's excavations
in Nydam will be resumed from 1 May to 23 June 1995. Efforts will
be concentrated particularly in the area where the pine boat was
found in 1863, and there are high expectations of acquiring new
knowledge about the boat. There will undoubtedly also be many
other sacrificed objects from the defeated armies to be found
along the edge of Conrad Engelhardt's old excavation-area.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag3">Investigations of blockages</A></H3>

<P>
In August 1995 Anne N&oslash;rg&aring;rd
J&oslash;rgensen will carry out an investigation of what is thought
to be a blockage at the entrance-channel to the now dammed-up
V&aring;lse Vig in North Falster. In the course of the summer
Ole Gr&oslash;n will carry out surveys with penetration echo-sounders
at several blockage-sites, including Jungshoved, Tude &Aring;
and Sams&oslash;, as well as a number of other sites which are
suitable for this method of study.
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag4">Roskilde Fjord</A></H3>

<P>
After an extensive and hectic excavation-season
in 1994, Jens Ulriksen will carry out a series of smaller-scale
excavations of possible landing-places and their immediate surroundings
in 1995. The sites will include Veddelevg&aring;rd, Gersh&oslash;j
and Snekkeager. The aim will be to establish a basis for the classification
and dating of landing-places from the Iron Age and Middle Ages.<HR>

To be held from 29 August to
1 September, sailing round Falster.  <A HREF="1SEMINAR.HTM" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/natmus/mabrev/9505-4/1seminar.htm">Further details in this Newsletter.</A>

<P>
In November-December
1995 the Centre for Maritime Archaeology in Roskilde will hold
an international research seminar, with invited participants,
with the title: <I>Maritime Aspects of the Cultural Landscape,
200-1500 AD. </I>Discussion will focus on the following subjects:
<I>Analyses and interpretations of the development of settlement
patterns; Trade and exchange; Coastal defence.<HR>

<P>
Christer
Westerdahl's teaching in Maritime Archaeology at the Institute
of Archaeology and Ethnology, Copenhagen University, has until
now taken the form of a 2-year advanced course following studies
in archaeology. From the autumn of 1995 onwards there will in
addition be a short course (option) which will primarily be designed
for students from other disciplines and for archaeology students
with other fields of specialisation. These two courses in Maritime
Archaeology will run in parallel each year. Furthermore, in the
autumn of 1995, in H&ouml;llviken, Scania, there will be a short
introductory course in Maritime Archaeology (Swedish university
standard 5 credits). This course is being arranged in cooperation
with the University of Lund and the Danish Open University.
