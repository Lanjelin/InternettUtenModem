<H2>The Sailing Seminar 1995</H2>
<HR>

<P>
From 29 August to 1 September the National Museum's Centre for
Maritime Archaeology will hold a 'Sailing Seminar' similar to
the one which was organised on Roskilde Fjord in the late summer
of 1994 (see Newsletter no.3). The theme of the seminar this time
will be the Baltic in the Viking Age and Middle Ages, and the
ships will be those used last year, the two Skuldelev replicas
from the Viking Ship Museum, <I>Roar Ege</I> and <I>Helge Ask</I>. <A HREF="1FORLIS.HTM" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/natmus/mabrev/9505-4/1forlis.htm">(OBS: Helge Ask wrecked)</A>

<P>
  The departure-point will be the old <I>Leidang</I> harbour of
Hvidanger near Vordingborg, and the first stop will be at Stubbek&oslash;bing.
From there a visit will be made to the site on the Fribr&oslash;dre
river where the Viking Ship Museum, since the early 1980s, has
been carrying out extensive investigations of a boatyard from
around 1100.

  Then the sailing-route will continue through Gr&oslash;nsund
out into the Baltic and down the east coast of Falster to Gedser.
There, on the south point of Falster, is an area which was of
great significance for the traffic between Denmark and the continent
throughout the Middle Ages. A land-excursion in this area will
include visits to the fortified site of Svinehave and the village
of Gedesby, not far from the place where the Gedesby ship from
the end of the 13th century was excavated in 1991.
<P>
  For the next day's sail up Guldborgsund the little fleet will
be joined by the newly-built replica of the Gedesby ship and we
will moor at Flad&oslash;, where the Medieval Centre will be our
host for the evening and night. On Friday the Viking ships will
take part in the sailing-trials of the Gedesby replica, until
the middle of the afternoon, when the seminar will end at the
Medieval Centre.
<P>
  As was the case for last year's seminar, there will be lectures
<I>en</I> <I>route </I>about the landscape and the archaeological
and historical sites, as well as discussion about the sailing-trials
and their archaeological value. 
<P>
  The Sailing Seminar 1995 is intended for present and future
archaeologists and historians who would like to experience the
area of Lolland-Falster in a maritime context, or who are more
generally interested in learning about some of the fundamental
conditions of communications and transport in the Viking Age and
Middle Ages. The cost will be DKK 2,000 per participant, covering
all expenses from the start of the seminar in Vordingborg on Tuesday
morning to the return of the participants by bus to the same place
on Friday evening.
