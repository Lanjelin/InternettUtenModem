<H2>A new History of Danish Seafaring</H2>
<HR>

Good history books are corner-stones in the construction of our
self-image - they form the basis for our conception of what <I>was</I>,
and the departure-point from which we explain what <I>is</I>.
But it is not unusual for the publication of a history book to
be also a symptom of the fact that something is changing or disappearing
- an attempt to preserve the memory of a past which is still felt
to be relevant but which is on its way to extinction. As such,
a history book is also a tool for holding onto our immediate past
and for explaining to our descendants who we are and what formed
us. The last history of Danish seafaring was produced in 1919,
at a time when sailing-ship traffic was having to give way in
earnest to steam-driven ships, and when wood was rapidly coming
to be replaced by steel in ship-building. Both changes had far-reaching
effects on Danish society. The new ships required much less manpower
and completely different skills both for ship-building and for
sailing. A whole culture related to wooden ships was virtually
lost.
<P>
  Today there is a different technological and social background
to the changes taking place: global division of labour, container
traffic, and the intransigent economic forces that have particularly
affected small-scale seafaring, ferries and coasters. Even though
the quantity of goods transported by sea is growing, the number
of ships and of seamen is falling rapidly, at the global level,
but even more markedly at local level in Denmark. Denmark's identity
as a seafaring nation is a historical phenomenon, no longer a
current one.
<P>
  Against this background the initiative taken in 1992 by the
Danish National Council for Research in the Humanities to support
the writing of a new history of Danish seafaring is extremely
welcome. The new history has the declared purpose of describing
&quot;all aspects of Danish seafaring from the earliest times
until the present, seen in an interdisciplinary perspective combining
e.g. issues from history, ethnology and archaeology&quot;. A total
grant of DKK 5.1 million has been allocated for the preparation
of this work, with the title &quot;Dansk S&oslash;farts Historie&quot;,
and it is intended that it will be published by Gyldendals in
seven volumes in the period 1996-98. The authors consist of selected
archaeologists and historians from many branches of historical
research in Denmark. Two of the authors of the first volume are
from the National Museum in Roskilde.
