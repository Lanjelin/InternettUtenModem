<h2>Editorial</h2>
<hr>
On Friday 24 February the 'Grand Old Man' of Danish maritime archaeology
and director of the National Museum's Centre for Maritime Archaeology,
Ole Crumlin-Pedersen, celebrated his 60th birthday. For those
of us who are his colleagues in the three institutions in Roskilde,
and for the many friends who took part in the festivities of the
day, this provided a welcome opportunity to thank Ole for his
impressive achievements and inspiring presence throughout many
years of work. The extent to which the fruits of his labours have
grown over those years is clearly shown in this edition of the
Newsletter. The article about the exciting and large-scale extension
plans around the Viking Ship Museum makes it evident how far we
have progressed in presenting maritime archaeology to the public
since the first ferry-loads of curious visitors were taken out
to the Skuldelev excavation in 1962. And the Newsletter's existence
in itself, as well as the context of the research centre which
brought it into being, are expressions of the importance maritime
archaeology has acquired in the cultural/historical environment
here in Denmark and abroad. Another expression of the same development
is the colourful selection of articles on maritime archaeology
which friends and colleagues have chosen to present to Ole in
the <I>festschrift</I> in his honour, entitled <I>Shipshape</I>,
which is described in greater detail elsewhere in this Newsletter.
<P>
  In the light of all this, one cannot help asking oneself how
all these goals have been achieved. What qualities does one have
to have, as a person and leader, to make this possible? Research
abilities and the capacity to inspire colleagues and donors are
two evident answers, but there is a third which is probably just
as important: the ability to share both leadership responsibility
and influence on the shape of the research profile. By transferring
the leadership of first the Viking Ship Museum and later the Institute
of Maritime Archaeology to others, Ole has managed to avoid the
fossilisation which often threatens large organisations and to
replace it with renewed vitality. New, capable people could take
their turn at the tiller and contribute significantly to determining
the course and the forms of cooperation. The variety and diversity
which has thus come to be a feature of the work carried out in
Roskilde is one of the most important reasons for this being such
an inspiring place to work. Let us hope it remains so in the decades
to come.
<P>
  In addition to describing the extension of the Viking Ship Museum,
this edition of the Newsletter also includes the second article
in the series on maritime archaeological survey methods. A new
series, with the title &quot;New pictures of old ships&quot;,
is also launched, with two articles, one about a signet from Roskilde,
and the other about a newly-discovered mural painting in Voldby
Church. In addition to being valuable sources for parts of ships
which are seldom preserved for archaeologists to find, the depictions
of ships are also an expression of the symbolic meaning of the
ship in the society of the time - an exciting perspective, which
in each of these cases of new finds has significance for its interpretation.
And a concrete expression of the breadth of the  research-field
which we are trying to cover from the institutions in Roskilde,
and which this Newsletter attempts to describe, by presenting
a glimpse of topical activities to a larger public. Happy reading.
