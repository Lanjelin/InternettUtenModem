<h2>The ship on the signet from Roskilde</h2>
<hr>
Most of the medieval representations of ships on seals and signets
are to be found in the large and varied group of town seals from
the harbour towns around Europe - and this also applies to Danish
seals. But there are other examples as well, as we shall see from
the case of a newly-found signet from medieval Roskilde.
<P>
  In the centre of present-day Roskilde, immediately to the north
of the Cathedral, there is a field which strangely enough has
not been built on in the last 400 years. In the Middle Ages the
area in question was part of the parish of Sankt Hans, which extended
to the north between the Cathedral and the town rampart. Although
Roskilde was a harbour town, it was placed on a hill-top and not
directly on the fjord. The town instead had two harbour-suburbs:
Sankt J&oslash;rgensbjerg and Vindeboder.
<P>
  Today the field is known as Provstev&aelig;nget, and since 1994
it has been a focus of archaeological investigations. It was as
a result of this that Roskilde Museum came into possession of
a remarkable signet which had been found on the surface some years
previously. The signet is made of bronze and has a circular stamp-area
2.6 cm in diameter. On the back of the signet is a grip with a
hole in it so that it could be carried on a chain around the owner's
neck, or on a belt, etc. The owner would have held the signet
by this handle when he used it to stamp his mark in warm sealing-wax.

  In the Middle Ages a signet was an extremely valuable and personal
object which had to be kept as safely as possible. The seal was
actually what made letters and documents legally valid. The seal
was used where a signature is used today. The medieval signets
therefore all had their own personal distinctive features which
served to identify, in one way or another, the owner; often a
combination of text and picture was used. 
<P>
  In the case of this Roskilde signet the connection is a particularly
well-chosen one. The Latin inscription, written in Gothic capitals,
runs as follows: <I>S' Nicholai Tink Sacerdotis</I> (parish priest
Nicolai Tink's seal). The picture represents a scene from the
legend of St Nicholas, in which he saves the crew of a ship in
distress. The parish priest has thus chosen his patron saint as
his motif. The signet is therefore allusive - a phenomenon which
is well-known in heraldry.
<P>
  St. Nicholas was one of the most familiar saints in the Middle
Ages, known as the protector of seafarers and the benefactor of
children. He is known from innumerable depictions, many of them
in churches, in mural paintings and wooden sculptures, etc.
<P>
  Nicolai Tink is known to us only from this signet, however.
There are no letters preserved with his seal. It is probable that
he held the position of priest in Roskilde, perhaps in the parish
of Sankt Hans. The signet was found very close to the disused
cemetery of Sankt Hans Church, and it is thus reasonable to conjecture
that his signet was buried with him, as was the practice, in order
to prevent misuse of a signet after the death of its owner. We
do not know when Nicolai Tink lived, but the seal suggests a dating
to the period around 1400, on the basis of the lettering of the
inscription.
<P>
  The ship on Nicolai Tink's signet is a<I> hulk,</I> a large
clinker-built trading ship. Its boards and rivets can be seen
clearly. At the stern and bow there are castles which are integrated
parts of the construction of the ship; they may even have a structural
function in holding the ship's boards together. On older representations
of this type of ship one can see that the boards were held together
by ropes.
<P>
  The hulk is supposed to be a ship without a visible keel or
stem. This characteristic is the result of the half-moon curve
of the hull, produced by the fact that all the boards are curved
and go right out to the point of the bows and stern. The hulk
has a single mast and a square sail. These can clearly be seen
on Tink's signet, on which the upper part of the broken mast with
the sail disappears off the edge of the picture.
<P>
  The crew of the ship consists, in this depiction, of three men,
all clad in long garments with the head-gear typical of the period
- hoods. Probably the size and number of persons depicted should
not be taken literally, however. The ship should of course be
thought of as relatively much larger than it is on the signet-picture.
It must have been important, however, for the signet-maker to
express the drama in the situation by enlarging the figures and
not least by showing their gestures: the folded hands of the sailors
and the large right hand of the bishop raised in blessing. This
was the core of the message from the pious parish priest, Nicolai
Tink, but as a bonus he has endowed us with another ship-representation
from the Middle Ages in Denmark.<p>
