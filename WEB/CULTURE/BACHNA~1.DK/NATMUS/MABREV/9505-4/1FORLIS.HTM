<H1>Latest news: 'Helge Ask' wrecked</H1>
<HR>

<P>
During the night of 7-8 April a sudden storm wrecked the Skuldelev
5 replica 'Helge Ask' at its mooring on the Roskilde Fjord outside
the Viking Ship Museum. The heavy surf crushed the slender planking
above the waterline and parts of the framesystem were broken.
The ship has now been salvaged and will be repaired over the summer,
but a number of arrangements involving it have had to be cancelled,
including 'The Sailing Seminar' announced in this Newsletter.
Analysis of the damage to the hull will be included in the forthcoming
publication of the replica-project.
