<I>Maritime Archaeological Registration 2: sediment echo-sounding</I>:
<H3>Use of sediment echo-sounding for location of archaeological sites under water </H3>
<HR>

<P>
It falls naturally within the work of the National Museum's Centre
for Maritime Archaeology to further the development of methods
for locating archaeological sites on the sea-bed. Visibility in
Danish waters is generally poor. Often one can only see a couple
of metres, and sometimes nothing at all. It therefore goes without
saying that surveying by diving and swimming through large areas
is time-consuming and disproportionately expensive.When it is
a matter of needing to see what lies hidden in the sea-bed, divers
swimming around are of even less use. Where the seabed is soft
a diver can of course reach down and feel around, but anyone who
has tried this will know that it is a tiring and very lengthy
process.
<P>
  In contrast to light, sound has very good qualities of penetration
through water, regardless of whether the water is clear or cloudy.
Sound is therefore much more usable when we want to 'see' far
underwater into the water-saturated sediment. During the last
20-30 years work has been carried out on developing echo-sounders
which are not only capable of showing the surface of the sea-bed,
but can also 'see' down into the sediment below. These are described
as 'penetration echo-sounders' or 'sediment echo-sounders'. The
developments in transportable computer-technology within recent
years have meant that it has become possible to process the returning
sound-signals so that many sources of noise-interference can be
removed. The results, in the form of printed echograms, have therefore
become more reliable and much more detailed than hitherto.
<P>
  The use of this advanced technology is subject to a number of
fundamental 'rules of the game', which need to be carefully applied
to obtain optimal benefits. The lower the frequency one uses,
the greater the penetration-quality of the sound. But at the same
time its ability to show small structures decreases. This is known
as coarse resolution. The higher the frequency one uses, the smaller
the objects one is able to observe, but then the ability of the
sound to penetrate the sediment is drastically reduced. As a rule,
a frequency of around 30 kHz (30,000 oscillations per second)
can reach a couple of metres down into the sediment and also make
it possible to observe structures of a size of about 5cm (this
is known as a resolution of around 5 cm). This is an acceptable
compromise for archaeological purposes.
<P>
  Equipment of the 'boomer' type, which sends out a 'burst' of
frequencies all at the same time (e.g. 0.7-10 kHz), or the new
CHIRP II, which sends out a 'swirp' of frequencies from 8 to 22
kHz, gives fine resolution combined with good penetration-capacity.
The disadvantage with this is the processing of the returning
sound-signals, which is much more complex than in the case of
conventional sediment echo-sounders.
<P>
  Our knowledge of how different types of relics show up on sediment
echo-sounders is very meagre. In the course of 1994 and 1995,
therefore, trials were made over a number of underwater sites
with historic remains which had already been registered and surveyed.
The objective was to compare different makes of equipment showing
the same structure, to find out which was best suited for archaeological
use.
<P>
  The main trial area selected was the mouth of Haderslev Fjord,
with two blockages from the Iron Age and Middle Ages: <I>Margrethes
Bro</I> and <I>&AElig; Lei.</I> Their siting - typically - was
at a narrow part of the fjord. &AElig; Lei is situated well below
the surface of some very soft sediment, as is found in many sheltered
fjords, while Margrethes Bro, because of its site close to the
mouth of the fjord, lay in significantly sandier deposits which
would constitute a greater problem for sound-penetration.
<P>
  As expected, the blockage further inland, &AElig; Lei, gave
the better result. Margretes Bro could also be discerned, and
the results have to be said to exceed our expectations; the prospects
look good for the detection of so far unknown blockages in coming
years with the help of sediment echo-sounders.
<P>
  The very wet winter of 1994/95, with flooding of large low-lying
field-areas, brought with it the idea of trying out sediment echo-sounders
in areas which were normally 'inland sites'. We found out that
it is not possible to shoot sound through flooded grass. Its high
air-content simply blocks the sound. There was a surprising result,
however, when we tried to run the sediment echo-sounder in a fishpond
which is dug out of Ravning Enge near Vejle, just above the course
of a major Viking-Age bridge. The posts of the bridge could be
seen about 1 m down into the sediment. They were standing where
we expected them to be, but just a few metres to one side there
was an identical stretch of bridge. The posts we could see on
the echo-sounder could also be felt when we probed the sediment.
Mogens Schou J&oslash;rgensen's planned excavation in the fishpond
has thus suddenly taken on a completely different character, and
we are now waiting in suspense for the Agency for Forestry and
Nature's decision as to what should happen to the fishpond in
future.
<P>
  It is important to establish whether it is possible, with the
use of a sediment echo-sounder, to find layers from Stone-Age
settlements which are now under water. In recent years, just off
the small island of Blak, in Roskilde Fjord, the F&aelig;rgeg&aring;rden
Museum has been excavating a settlement from the Kongemose culture
in water a couple of metres deep. At the south boundary of the
excavation it has been shown that the culture-layer is situated
about 1.5 metres under the surface of the sediment. A seismic
profile produced by a Chirp I in fact shows a layer starting at
the edge of the now filled-in excavation-area, about 1.5 m under
the surface of the sediment, and continuing downwards. An attempt
will be made in March 1995, by drilling, to establish whether
what we can see is the known culture-layer, or whether it is something
else. Whatever the result, it is important to note whether it
will prove possible to identify such thin layers.
<P>
  In conclusion it has to be said that the provisional results
of trials with sound-penetration seem promising. Either we have
just been extremely lucky so far, or else the method is capable
in future providing a considerable increase in the quantity of
known underwater remains. The testing out of the different types
of equipment described in this article was made possible as a
result of help and support from the following firms: EIVA in Hasselager,
Denmark; NAUTIKARIS in Saandport, Holland; JON B. JOLLY Inc.,
Seattle, USA; KNUDSEN ENGINEERING Ltd., Ontario, Canada; and FURUNO
DANMARK, Denmark.
