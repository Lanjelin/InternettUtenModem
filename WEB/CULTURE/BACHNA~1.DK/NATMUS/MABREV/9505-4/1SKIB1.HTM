<H2>The ship on the church-wall in Voldby Church</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ship-representations from the past form a source-group of particular
significance in maritime archaeology. Medieval churches are among
the most important places where such pictures are to be found.
In Norway there is a rich material consisting of ship-graffiti
in the wooden churches1, and a book was recently published about
incised ship-representations in the Gotland churches2.
<P>
  In the National Museum's Institute of Maritime Archaeology we
keep a running collection of information on ship-representations.
Often new finds are the result of restoration-work in churches,
when covered mural paintings are exposed, or when plaster is removed
from walls and reveals motifs incised or scratched in the building-stone.

<P>
  An example of this is the ship from Voldby Church in Djursland
which came to light in June 1994 when Robert Smalley, the conservator,
uncovered the old plaster-layer in the tower-room (fig. 1). This
revealed a three-masted ship, painted with simple sketch-like
lines and with the same colouring as the formal mural decoration,
which is from about 1520.

<P>
The ship has a stern-rudder and low
castles fore and aft. All three masts have topmasts, and there
are also shrouds and stays. On the shroud of the foremost mast
the ratlines are marked. The bow of the ship is deep and strongly
curved, and the stern is overhanging. The ship-type is similar
to the early caravel of that time.
<P>
  This new picture in Voldby Church is particularly interesting
because it is not the only ship-picture at this site. In the formal
mural decoration of the church there is also a ship which has
been known for a long time, since it came to light in an earlier
restoration (fig.2). It is an impressive three-masted ship with
many details, basically of the same type as the more modest version
in the tower, but with a conspicuously commanding appearance.
King Hans (1481-1513) was the first North European monarch to
build ships purely for use in war, and this ship could perhaps
be one of them? One could well imagine that the newly-found ship
served as a sketch for the formal picture on the church vault.
In any case the sketchy one is by far the more realistic.
<P>
  Ship representations are often used today as vignettes or 'authentic'
illustrations of history texts; but they are also often of value
as important archaeological source-materials with regard to construction-details,
especially for rigging and sails, which of course are not usually
preserved with the other archaeological evidence. The role of
the ship in societies of the past is a subject covered in the
National Museum's new publication &quot;The Ship as Symbol in
Prehistoric and Medieval Scandinavia&quot;3.
