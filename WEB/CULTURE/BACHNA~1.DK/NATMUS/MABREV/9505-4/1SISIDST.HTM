<P>
> On 2 December
1994, as part of the project on <I>Coastal Defence</I> for which
Anne N&oslash;rg&aring;rd J&oslash;rgensen is responsible, the
Centre held a one-day seminar at the Institute of Archaeology
and Ethnology, Copenhagen University. Medieval sources describe
the conscription of manpower for the building of national defences.
The earliest source to mention conscription for work of this type
in Denmark is <I>Annales Regni Francorum, </I>in which it is said
that in 808 King Godfred conscripted men (the army) to work on
Danevirke, the major defence work. From both the Viking Age and
earlier times there are a number of more or less well-known defence
works in the old Danish area. Investigation of these is in process
and the purpose of the one-day seminar was to gather the latest
news from recently completed or still continuing investigations.
The programme included: Steen Andersen: <I>Folkevoldene i S&oslash;nderjylland</I>;
Svend &Aring;ge Knudsen and Per Ole Rindel: <I>Nye unders&oslash;gelser
i Tr&aelig;ldiget</I>; Wilhelm Kramer: <I>Tolkning af s&oslash;forsvarsv&aelig;rket
i Slien</I>; Ole Gr&oslash;n: <I>Nye efters&oslash;gningsmetoder
anvendt p&aring; vandbygningsarbejder</I>; Hellmuth Andersen:
<I>Det &aelig;ldste Danevirke</I>; Mogens Schou J&oslash;rgensen:
<I>Nyt om Ravning Enge broen</I>; Anne N&oslash;rg&aring;rd J&oslash;rgensen:
<I>S&oslash;forsvaret i gl. Danmark</I>; Johan Engstr&ouml;m:
<I>Bygning af forsvarsv&aelig;rker</I>. There is an internal report
giving short summaries of the lectures which can be borrowed from
the library of the Centre for Maritime Archaeology.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag2">Evaluation of the National Museum's research activities
in Maritime Archaeology</A></H3>

<P>
In January 1995 an international
evaluation of the National Museum's research was carried out.
The activities in Maritime Archaeology were judged by Professor
H.T. Waterbolk, the Netherlands, and Valerie Fenwick, M.A., England.
The result of the evaluation has been published in the report
&quot;The National Museum of Denmark. International Evaluation
of Research Activities, 1995&quot;, which is available from the
Centre.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag3">Study-visit from R&uuml;gen</A></H3>

<P>
 During two periods in January
1995 the Centre for Maritime Archaeology received visits from
colleagues from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in connection with work
on the Ralswiek 2 ship, which was found on a Viking-Age trading
site on the island of R&uuml;gen in 1967; the ship was re-excavated
and taken up in 1993 with the aim of conserving and exhibiting
it. On 10 January the ship-find and the East German trading places
were presented in a lecture by Peter Herfert and Friedrich L&uuml;th,
and during the period 23-27 January staff at the Centre, in cooperation
with Peter Herfert and his assistants in the reconstruction work,
Guste Detloff and Gerd Schilde, engineers, produced a preliminary
cardboard model of the ship for further analysis.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag4">Study-visit to INA, Texas</A></H3>

<P>
Ole Crumlin-Pedersen and
Jan Bill went on a study-visit to the Institute of Nautical Archaeology
(INA) at Texas A&amp;M University, from 30 January to 5 February
1995. INA is the leading institute in the USA in maritime and
ship-archaeological research, with particular focus on finds from
classical antiquity and the eastern Mediterranean as well as from
North America's colonial period and later. There is also an evident
desire to engage in research into the rich North European ship-find
material from the Middle Ages and earlier. Cooperation with the
Netherlands has been initiated and negotiations are now in progress
concerning future relations with Roskilde.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag5">Visiting professor from INA, Texas</A></H3>

<P>
Fred Hocker, President
of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Texas A&amp;M University,
spent four weeks as visiting professor at the Centre in Roskilde
in March 1995. On 14 March he gave a lecture on &quot;Bottom-based
Ship Construction in Iron-Age and Medieval Northern Europe&quot;;
otherwise his time was occupied with study of the various ship-finds
and replicas which may throw light on the flexibility of the Viking
ships. In connection with this a research seminar on the subject
was held at the Centre on 29 March, with participants from Norway,
Sweden and Denmark.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag6">Research meeting about archaeological surveying</A>
</H3>

<P>
On
20 March 1995, on the Centre's initiative, an international meeting
was held in Roskilde to bring together those involved in a newly-established
network of researchers who use electronic surveying methods in
archaeology. The meeting brought together 42 participants from
7 countries and clearly showed the need for reciprocal information
about on-going experiments with the adaptation of search-techniques
developed for use in other contexts to the location of archaeological
finds underground and underwater. A short report from the meeting
will be issued by the Centre.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="tag7"> New staff members</A></H3>

<P>
 From New Year 1995 the following
people joined the staff of the Centre:  <I>Birthe L. Clausen</I>,
cand. scient., who replaces Birgitte Thye as editor of the Centre's
publications; and <I>Claus Petersen,</I> technical assistant in
the drawing office.
