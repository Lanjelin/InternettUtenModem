<i>* The Nydam excavation 1995</i>: in May and June investigations in Nydam Mose were resumed.
The re-excavation of the sites where Conrad Engelhardt found the oak and pine boats was
continued, and important additional material relating to these two Iron-Age vessels was found,
both in the old excavation trenches and in the adjacent areas. A further three rowlocks have now
been added to those from the pine boat which were found in 1994.  From the port side of the boat
large sections of the gunwale have now been excavated, and 5-6 of the elegant rowlocks. The find-place of the big oak boat which is now exhibited in Schleswig has now been precisely identified.
At the bottom of Engelhardt's excavation trench some heads from the iron rivets which held the
boards together were found, and in the undisturbed peat nearby there was a particularly well-preserved rowlock from the boat.<p>

Quantities of <i>equipment,</i> originally from the pine boat, were excavated this year.  Among the
wooden objects were bows, arrows, spear- and lance-poles, axe- and knife-shafts, and
innumerable shields, many with faint traces of paint. Among the most important weapon-finds of
the year there was a sword-sheath with an exceptionally well-shaped metal mounting. The chape
of the sheath has an inlaid green stone; there are runes on the strap mounting and the upper
mounting is of silver with inlaid stones.<p>

A precise evaluation of the <i>preservation conditions </i>in the bog is badly needed. The wooden
objects have all been interpenetrated by paddock-pipe roots, and many objects have been
irretrievably damaged. But it seems to be the iron objects which were in the peat layers of the bog
which have suffered worst. The layers containing the finds can roughly be described as lying at the
lowest level of the peat or the highest of the mud below. The majority of the iron artefacts are in
the upper levels and they are in many cases badly corroded. Many are so damaged that they have a
consistency like that of sugar;  it is very difficult to remove them from the peat and almost
impossible to conserve them. Provisional investigations show that the Nydam iron artefacts are
subject to accelerating decomposition and that the majority will have corroded away in the course
of the next decade. The problem is a major one, worthy of serious discussion in this coming year,
so that a decision can be taken as to whether the present research-excavations should be followed
up with rescue excavations to save whatever can be saved.<p>

<i>* Vordingborg:</i> Nordhavnen in Vordingborg is situated in a well-sheltered position between the
ruin of the castle and the headland of Oringe. This site was probably an assembly point for the
Danish<i> Leidang</i> fleet in the 11th and 12 centuries. It has been known for a long time that there
were some stumps of poles in the harbour entrance, known as <i>Dronning Margrethes Stiger</i>, and
in 1978 an investigation by the National Museum revealed a double barrage of poles, constructed
in two phases in the 11th century and around 1160. At one end of the later section was a massive
group of posts with stones between, which was interpreted as the foundation of a watch-tower at
the harbour-mouth.<p>

<p>

In September 1995 this theory was tested out by means of a small-scale investigation aiming to
show whether there were traces of an actual construction on this site. The investigation showed
that at one corner of the group of poles there was a vertical corner-post with inset horizontal and
diagonal beams. Alongside this a round, pointed post was found which did not belong to the
timber frame. The thick mud-layer at the site made it impossible to find out, during this brief
investigation, how the construction was finished at a lower level. There is probably a horizontal
frame which kept the corner posts anchored in foundations of about 5 x 6 m, supported by extra
poles rammed down around the timber construction.  Samples have been taken from the posts, and
it should be possible to tell from these whether the history of the structure covered one or more
phases.<p>

<i>* Gersh&oslash;j:</i> The major investigation in the Roskilde Fjord project in 1995 was at Gersh&oslash;j Church
in Hornsherred. The area has not previously been known for finds from the Iron Age or Viking
Age, and in fact until a few years ago there were no finds at all from those periods. The north end
of the village had been a focus of attention for some years as a possible landing-place, however,
because the Romanesque church is situated just above a slight slope down to the fjord, and there is
a holy well, St Lars's Well, on the shore near the church. In 1989 various objects were found by
metal-detector on a nearby field: a Viking-Age dress-ornament, an early Germanic Iron-Age
mount and a number of medieval coins. Since then numerous metal objects and coins have come
to light, almost all of them from the early and high Middle Ages.<p>

In 1994 trial ditches were dug over a large area, and they showed that under the topsoil there were
many traces of construction. They were chiefly from the Middle Ages, but there were also
indications that the area had been used for a long period during the Viking Age.<p>

In June 1995 a major excavation was embarked on with the departure-point in the areas where the
detector-searches and trial ditches had shown the greatest concentration of finds. Just to the north
of the church the remains of several buildings from the early Middle Ages were uncovered,
probably all belonging to one farm. East of this, slightly closer to the fjord, two pit houses and at
least three long houses from the Viking Age came to light. The pit houses were badly damaged by
ploughing, and one of them contained only a few loose finds, including a small blue glass bead and
a sherd of Baltic pottery. The other pit house contained large quantities of animal bones, and also a
quantity of Baltic pottery from the 10th and 11th centuries, half of an iron spur, an iron arrow of
triangular section, a clay holster for a pair of bellows, fragments of casting-moulds, a bone comb,
bronze tweezers, burnt clay and a couple of bronze mounts. In the ploughed-up soil which covered
the pit house a silver coin and a bronze key from the 11th century were found. Three of the long
houses were of a well-known type, first identified at the ring-fortress of Trelleborg near Slagelse,
and later found at many sites over the whole country. This house-type belongs to a period from the
second half of the 10th century until some time in the 11th century. The Trelleborg-type houses
here probably represent the two or three earliest phases in the village which has existed ever since.<p>

Construction-traces were found on the field as far as 100-150 m to the north of the church, but
not all the traces came from the Viking Age and Middle Ages. In addition to the house-constructions mentioned, a number of pits from the late Stone Age and early Roman Iron Age
were investigated.<p>

<i>* Stavnsfjorden:</i> During seismic surveying in Stavnsfjorden on Sams&oslash; in the spring of 1995 two
structures were located. One of them had been a natural channel, now silted up.  The other was
interpreted as a possible barrage related to the Kanhave Canal, and the considerations which arose
from this interpretation were presented in a nationally-broadcast TV programme. In August an
excavation trench was dug through this 'seismic anomaly' and it then proved to be the case that this
was a very particular natural phenomenon and therefore not a man-made structure.<p>

<i>* Two more wrecks off Falster:</i> In August the Institute of Maritime Archaeology inspected two
wrecks off Falster. One of them, found by an amateur archaeologist with a metal detector, is
situated in shallow water near B&oslash;t&oslash;, while the other, found by amateur divers, is lying in
Gr&oslash;nsund. The inspection near<i> B&oslash;t&oslash;</i> took place in relatively bad weather with a strong onshore
wind. Provisional registration of planks and ribs seems to indicate that these are the remains of a
carvel-built ship some 15-20 m in length. Probably only the ship-bottom or parts of it are
preserved, but from it have come finds of silver coins, a bronze vessel, ropes, a glazed potsherd,
animal bones, bricks and ballast-stones. On the basis of the coins, which are German silver <i>Thaler</i>
from the mid 16th century, the wreck can provisionally be dated to 1550-1650. Even though the
wreck is lying in the breaker-zone and is seriously at risk, there is clearly a possibility of further
finds. There is no doubt that further information with regard to ship-development  can be obtained
from this wreck, in terms of ship-type, size, etc., and it may be possible to establish where and
when the ship was built and what its cargo consisted of.<p>

The second wreck is lying in <i>Gr&oslash;nsund </i>at a depth of 3.5-4 m, close to the slope out to deeper
water in the sailing channel. This is a ship 16-18 m long, and about 5 m broad, clinker-built with a
slightly rounded bow, a straight stern and ribs preserved up to the bilge. The wreck is lying with a
slight list to starboard and has presumably only recently been exposed. All the ribs on the port side
and the sternmost on the starboard side are exposed up to 1 m above the sea-bed. The ribs were
generally broad and low. Bow and stern are flared and are preserved up to a higher level than the
ribs and boards. At the stern end the stern knee seems to be intact and also rises about 1 m up
above the level of the sea-bed. Judging by the rib-dimensions the wreck can probably be dated to
the 15th-16th century. There is every indication that it is in the process of being exposed by the
current and is therefore at risk of being broken up.<p>

These wrecks add another two to the series of interesting medieval wrecks which have been
investigated in the Lolland-Falster region in recent years. Both wrecks are endangered, each in a
different way, and the Institute of Maritime Archaeology therefore intends to undertake further
investigations as soon as possible.<p>

* <i>Dannebroge, ship of the line</i>: In 1710, during the Great Nordic War, the <i>Dannebroge</i> exploded
in the bay known as K&oslash;ge Bugt, during a sea-battle with the Swedes, and its captain, Ivar Huitfeldt
and crew of about 600 men perished. The location of the wreck has been known for some years,
and a diving ban has been imposed in the area to prevent looting. In May and June this year the
Institute of Maritime Archaeology, together with the Naval Museum and the Agency for Forestry
and Nature, undertook a 3-week investigation of the site of the wreck.  The purpose was to take up
or make safe on the spot finds which might be particularly tempting for unauthorized salvaging. In
addition it was intended to document the various main components of the hull, <i>inter alia</i> by means
of side-scan recordings with a hitherto unknown degree of detail and precision of measurement.<p>

The investigation resulted in the discovery of a number of silver coins from the time of Christian
IV and Frederik III, along with weapons, ammunition, domestic implements, blocks and tackle.
The cable video-film, together with the side-scan results, should provide a basis for technical
investigation of the construction-principles of the hull. These are so far known only in broad
outline from a preserved drawing of the ship's main frames.<p>

* <i>Fulton cruise</i>. In 1995 the maritime archaeology educational cruise with the museum-ship<i> Fulton</i>
was arranged by the Archaeological Committee of the Danish Amateur Divers' Association and the
National Museum's Institute of Maritime Archaeology. In the period 5-12 August the ship
circumnavigated Fyn with 21 amateur divers with a particular interest in archaeology on board.
During the voyage diving was carried out at underwater sites (M&oslash;llegabet, Haderslev Fjord,
Tybrind Vig, Mejl&oslash;, Korshavn and Roms&oslash;) representative of Stone-Age settlements, barrages and
wrecks. In addition there were lectures - given partly by the professional organisers and partly by
guest lecturers who joined the ship for some of the voyage - about topical subjects and sites, and
training was given in measuring up, site-identification, legal provisions, etc.<p>

<p>

*<i> Guest researchers and study-visits: </i>In continuation of the cooperation with the Institute for
Nautical Archaeology at Texas A &amp; M University  (INA), the Centre for Maritime Archaeology
sent <i>Jan Bill</i> as a guest researcher to Texas in September 1995. He will work there for nine
months on his research projects for the Centre, but will also have the opportunity to study at close
quarters the work-forms and education principles practised at INA.<p>

In October the Centre for Maritime Archaeology was host to underwater archaeologist Iwona
Pomian from the Centralne Muzeum Morski in Gdansk, Poland, who came here on a 4-week visit
after Ole Crumlin-Pedersen and Anne N&oslash;rg&aring;rd J&oslash;rgensen had been on a study-visit to Gdansk and
the Puck excavation in August. In the same month the Centre also received welcome study-visits
from <i>Ulrike Teigelake,</i> underwater archaeologist from Kiel, and<i> Susan M&ouml;ller-Wiering</i>, textile
researcher from Schleswig.<p>

* <i>New Senior Consultant:</i> Professor Olaf Olsen has agreed to become Senior Consultant at the
Centre for Maritime Archaeology from 1 August 1995. Olaf Olsen will, amongst other things,
cover the historical context of the Skuldelev ships in the publication on this subject which the
Centre plans to produce in 1997.<p>

<i><p>

* New books</i>:  In May 1995 Museet F&aelig;rgeg&aring;rden, in Frederiksund, opened an exhibition about the
excavations at Sels&oslash;, and at the same time the book <i>Sels&oslash;-Vestby. Vikingernes anl&oslash;bsplads ved
Sels&oslash;</i>, written by S&oslash;ren A S&oslash;rensen and Jens Ulriksen, came out; it is published by the Centre for
Maritime Archaeology and F&aelig;rgeg&aring;rden jointly. The book recounts the results of the 1994
excavation at the Sels&oslash; site, with finds from the Viking Age and early Middle Ages, along with the
other landing places on Roskilde Fjord from the same period. 40 pages, illustrated, 50 DKK,
available on fax +45 42 31 29 67.<p>

The book <i>The Ship as Symbol in Prehistoric and Medieval Scandinavia</i>, edited by Ole Crumlin-
Pedersen and Birgitte Thye, was published in October 1995 as the first volume in the National
Museum's new series of publications <i>PNM Studies in Archaeology &amp; History.</i> The book contains
21 contributions by an international group of archaeologists and historians of religion, who met in
Copenhagen in May 1994 to discuss the symbolic role of the ship in the societies of the past. 196
pages, illustrated, 295 DKK, available on fax +45 33 47 33 30.<p>

<p>

* <i>International symposium on military systems:</i>  Military organisation in the ancient past has not
previously been the subject of a major international research conference in Scandinavia in spite of
the fact that the concept, on a level with subjects such as trade and religion, forms a cornerstone of
the actual formation of the <i>State</i>. It is therefore important, for the understanding of prehistoric and
historic societies, to establish discussion of the transition from tribally-based military organisation
to state armies, in the light of written and archaeological sources.<p>

In Scandinavia there is extensive archaeological source-material available to provide information
on military development in the first millennium AD. With the written source-material which begins
in external sources around 800 AD and in domestic sources around 1100 AD, this military
development is set in the context of history. It is therefore of considerable importance to examine
this problem-complex in a broad European perspective and in an international cross-disciplinary
dialogue.<p>

The Centre for Maritime Archaeology, in cooperation with the Arm&eacute;museet in Stockholm, the
Historical Institute of Copenhagen University and the Danish State Antiquary's Archaeological
Secretariat, therefore plans to host an international symposium on <i>Military Aspects of
Scandinavian Society, AD 1-1300, in a European perspective. </i>The symposium will be held at the
National Museum in Copenhagen on 2-4 May 1996, and the above-mentioned issues will be
covered by contributions from 25 historians and archaeologists from Northern Europe and the
USA.<p>

The symposium arises from the Coastal Defence project in the Centre for Maritime Archaeology,
and is being organised by Anne N&oslash;rg&aring;rd J&oslash;rgensen at the Centre, from whom further details can
be obtained.<p>

<p>

* <i>News from the Viking Ship Museum</i>: Work on the extension of the Viking Ship Museum (see
Newsletter no. 4) should have begun in the summer of 1995 with preparatory work on the
construction of a museum harbour to the west of the museum. The work has been delayed,
however, in part because of new tendering regulations, but the wharf-island is expected to be
constructed in the course of 1996, as the first element in the overall extension plan. <p>
