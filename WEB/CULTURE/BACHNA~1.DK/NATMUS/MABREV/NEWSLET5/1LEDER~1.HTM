<h3>Achievements in the first two years</h3>
<p>

<hr>
<p>

By 1 September 1995 the Centre for Maritime Archaeology had been in existence for two years,
and this can therefore be considered a suitable time to have a look at what has been achieved in
those first two years and what shape the future will take.<p>

The Centre was one of the first of the 23 centres under the Danish National Research Foundation
to set to work after being notified in the spring of 1993 that they had been awarded resources for a
five-year research programme. We had a good basis to build on, in the form of the cooperation
between the National Museum and the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde. The foundations had
been formed there for a broad range of research projects, and others had arisen out of the National
Museum's cooperation with other museums both in Denmark and abroad. Now it was possible to
develop those projects over a broad front.<p>

The main goal was established. We would aim, in the course of these five years, to show that
within three fields we had an important contribution to make to research in Maritime Archaeology,
not just in Denmark, but internationally. These were the fields 'Maritime Aspects of Archaeology',
'The Archaeology of Watercraft' and 'Development of Tools and Methods'. The main emphasis
would be on the Iron Age, Viking Age and Middle Ages.<p>

As can be seen from the evidence of this newsletter and earlier ones in the series, much has
already happened in these fields. The Nydam project is a good example. By means of new
excavations in Nydam bog, analyses of the material from earlier excavations, and natural-science
contributions in the form of describing the accelerating disintegration of the unexcavated material,
progress has been made in all three fields. Ordinary cultural-historical studies are being combined
in this way with special analyses in ship-archaeology and conservation processes, and an additional
benefit is being reaped in the form of development of a tool for artefact-registration which can be
used in many other contexts - c.f. further discussion in this newsletter.<p>

Within the project-group 'Maritime Aspects of Archaeology' the subject 'The ship as symbol' was
taken as the theme for a major research-seminar in May 1994, and the lectures delivered there
have now been published in book form.The Bronze-Age ship-depictions on razors will soon also
be available in book form with an interpretation of this phenomenon. Among the projects on
seafaring and settlement, the interdisciplinary project 'Fyn's coast in the Iron Age, Viking Age and
Middle Ages' has been completed and will shortly be in print, and the projects on 'Lundeborg' and
'Roskilde Fjord' are entering their final phases. 'Coastal defence' still requires more extensive new
fieldwork;  the potential for new discoveries in this area can be seen e.g. from the report on the
Kanhave Canal in this newsletter, but it is also planned to hold a major research seminar in  May
1996 on the European background for Danish coastal defences.<p>

<i>The Centre for Maritime Archaeology is involved in a variety of projects abroad, several of them
in Germany. Here, in May 1995, Ole Crumlin-Pedersen presented the Viking Ship Museum's
exhibition to German Maritime Archaeologists associated with the German </i>Kommission f&uuml;r
Unterwasserarch&auml;ologie<i>.  Photo Ulrike Teigelake.</i><p>

Where ship-archaeology is concerned, work is continuing in parallel on the preparation for
publication of a number of major finds. This applies to Nydam, Hedeby, Skuldelev, Fribr&oslash;dre and
Gedesby, which will each be the subject of a monograph which will set the find in context in
relation to important aspects of our seafaring history. The first of these volumes, the publication on
the ship-finds from Hedeby, is expected to be ready in 1996, in cooperation with the
Arch&auml;ologisches Landesmuseum in Schleswig. <p>

In the technical project-category, progress has been made on development of methods in
conservation and surveying, in close cooperation with Danish and foreign researchers. The results
may be of significant value in relation to field archaeologists' prospects of locating and preserving
the many archaeological finds underwater or in wetland areas. The projects on documentation and
analysis of the ship-finds have benefitted from exemplary cooperation with several institutes in the
Danish Technical University. For the sake of completeness, it should also be mentioned that we
are studying the history of ropework and sail-making, as well as the historical value of evidence
from wood-samples and fish-bones.<p>

Amidst all this activity the Centre has become a meeting-place for researchers from Denmark and
elsewhere, attending colloquies and seminars or invited as guest researchers. Formal cooperation
has been set up with the Institute for Nautical Archaeology at A&amp;M University in Texas, where
one of the Centre's staff-members currently has the post of guest-researcher for 9 months.<p>

As is apparent from this, the Centre's staff have had a flying start, and the first dividends are
beginning to materialize. We shall have plenty to do in the next three years, and we also believe
that the Centre will have demonstrated, in this trial period, the justice of its claim to be an
important and topical focus of Danish and international archaeological research.  <p>

At the time of writing, conditions for research in Denmark are subject to radical change, and no-one knows what will happen in the coming months in this field, except that the Minister for
Research, Frank Jensen, wishes to see a strengthening of the field. With the very positive
experience we have had of the way the Danish National Research Foundation has supported its
centres, we feel that this model not only deserves to be continued, but also shows one of the best
routes for Danish research to take in the future.<p>
