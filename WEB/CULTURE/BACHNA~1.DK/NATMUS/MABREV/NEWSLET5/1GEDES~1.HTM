Ship-finds are good sources of information about societies of the past, because they tell us, more
clearly than most finds on land, about the nature, scale and significance of communication and
transport. But our knowledge of the properties of the ships of the past is patchy, and this makes it
difficult to make full use of this source-material. <p>

How much cargo they could carry, in what waters and at what times of year they could operate,
and how large a crew they needed: these are central questions which cannot be resolved by
traditional archaeological methods. For this purpose calculations, and better still experiments with
carefully-reconstructed replicas in full scale, are a useful and even indispensable tool. Experiments
of this type have been carried out by the Viking Ship Museum and the National Museum in
Roskilde since 1982, and they have had considerable effect on e.g. our views on the
sailing-abilities of the Viking ships.<p>

The excavation of a small medieval wreck at Gedesby in south Falster in 1991 provided a basis for
subjecting a medieval craft to critical analysis. The Gedesby ship is from the end of the 13th
century and has been discussed, along with other similar ship-finds from Lolland-Falster, in earlier
editions of this Newsletter (nos. 1, 2 and 3).<p>

<p>

<i>The reconstruction process</i><p>

Shortly after the excavation, the Medieval Centre at Nyk&oslash;bing Falster proposed that the National
Museum and the Medieval Centre should jointly make a replica in full size of this well-preserved
ship-find. And just such a project, of joint analysis and reconstruction, in fact came about, in the
years 1992-95, after all parts of the wreck had been documented in the Wood Preservation Unit of
the Conservation Department in Brede in 1991-92.<p>

The first stage was the building of a half-model of the hull in cardboard, 1:5, cut out in accordance
with the shape of the planks; then a whole model on the same scale was built out of lime-wood.
The few pieces of the ship which were missing from the hull were added on the wooden model,
and this model also formed the basis for the reconstruction of the internal arrangement with
half-decks fore and aft, the rigging and the rest of the ship's equipment. The model was a
creditable representative of medieval ships in an exhibition held in 1993-94 which reviewed the
achievements of Danish archaeology over the last 25 years, and since then it has come to occupy a
permanent position in a local-history exhibition at B&oslash;t&oslash; Nors pumping station, near the
finding-place of the original ship.<p>

The building of a replica in full scale was begun in the Medieval Centre in 1993, and because of
the extensive work already done on the models most of the problems had already been settled, so
the work progressed steadily, using the original wood-working techniques. On 1 June 1995 the
ship was named<i> Agnete</i> - after an old Danish folksong about Agnete and the Merman - and it was
launched ready for rigging and trials.<p>

<i>Sailing-trials</i><p>

The sailing-trials took place from 28 August to 2 September 1995 in the sea near Gedser, on the
landward side of the notorious R&oslash;dsand sandbank. There was a strong wind which created waves
up to 1.5 m high, so the ship's seaworthiness was well and truly tested. Another good reason for
this choice of location was that the original ship must certainly have sailed in this area, about 700
years ago; as was the case with the trials of the Viking ship replicas, we tested the Gedesby ship in
its home environment.<p>

The test equipment consisted of a Danish-made colour-track-plotter, linked to a GPS navigator, an
anemometer on an escort-boat, and a VHF radio, a secretary with a pencil, and a log book for the
trials. During the sailing the track-plotter drew a coloured stripe on its screen to mark the ship's
true course over the sea-bed, taking into account deviation and set of the current where applicable.
The secretary had to be alert and nimble to work the plotter, set 'event-markers' on the course-line,
e.g. to mark a turn or a change in the wind, to note down the wind-reports coming from the radio
from the anchored escort-boat, and to record the speed of travelling and the exact time and
number of the event-markers. The whole process was saved on disk so that individual elements of
the trials and events could later be screened for analysis.<p>

The Gedesby ship is 12.5 m long and has a 5.0 m beam. Its draught is just over a metre, depending
on the load. In all we sailed with a displacement of about 13.2 tons during the sailing-trials. The
weight of the hull, rigging, equipment and crew came to a total of 6,565 kg. The weight of the
stone ballast was initially 5,820 kg, but we added a further 835 kg to give better directional stability
in the strong winds towards the end of the period of the trials. For the purposes of comparison, the
20 oxen weighing about 200 kg each which the Gedesby ship would probably have had room for
would only have weighed 4 tons, so a certain amount of ballast would no doubt have been added
as well. All this was propelled by a square sail, 60 m2, of linen cloth. The stability, as could be
expected of a loaded cargo vessel, was reasonably good. The first reef, which reduced the sail area
by at least 10 square metres, did not have to be made until the wind-force reached 11 m/s ('strong
wind'), and the next at 'moderate gale' force, 14-15 m/s.<p>

With the wind coming in across the stern the highest speed achieved under the trials was measured
at 8.1 knots (almost 16 km per hour) in a wind-force of 13 m/s and with one reef in the sail.
Obviously, the speed is lower in more normal wind-conditions, e.g. around 4-6 m/s, which would
give about 4 knots. In general the fact is that when sailing with the wind one sails faster with a
stronger wind. This holds true until a certain point, when because of the water-resistance the speed
cannot be increased further, but we did not reach that point during these trials. According to
common theories, in the case of the Gedesby ship this point should lie around 8.5 knots.<p>

Against the wind the picture is not so simple. To start with, the speed is lower, and secondly one
has to proceed by tacking in zigzags. At the same time, the wind-pressure causes a deviation which
can be significant in the case of a ship with such a relatively slight draught as the Gedesby ship has.
In order to judge how well a ship has tacked in given wind- and sea- conditions, one calculates the
VMG (Velocity Made Good), which is a numerical value for a ship's effective progress directly
into the wind. The VMG is valid; i.e. one can completely ignore deviation etc. and make
comparisons with the VMG of other ships in the same wind- and sea- conditions.<p>

The <i>Agnete</i>'s VMG ratings lie between 0.3 knots at the worst and 1.5 knots at the best. When it
comes to tacking, it is the case that the upper limit of how fast one can sail against the wind is
reached relatively fast, because the wind-resistance and deviation increase sharply with an
increasing wind-force, and at the same time the tractive force of the sail is considerably reduced
when it is reefed. In the case of the <i>Agnete</i> it also looks as if the VMG is at its best, between 1.2
and 1.5 knots, with a wind-force of 9-10 m/s, but begins to fall to under 1 knot in wind over 11
m/s, i.e. just at the point when the sail should be reefed. If two reefs are made, the rate falls even
further as a result. We have two results in 14 m/s with a double-reefed sail. The worst rate, of 0.3
knots VMG was obtained the first time we had double-reefed, and is probably the result of lack of
concentration in an unfamiliar situation. The following day, when there was also a moderate
gale-force wind, we were better prepared and the results were more than twice as good: 0.7 knots
VMG.<p>

These measurements show that across the board the VMG results for the medieval replica <i>Agnete</i>
are lower than those for the Viking trading-ship replica, the <i>Saga Siglar,</i> with 26 tons
displacement (Skuldelev 1) and <i>Roar Ege</i>, with 7 tons (Skuldelev 3). This is because the<i> Agnete</i>'s
sail cannot be aligned as closely fore-and-aft during tacking as is possible on the Viking ships,
because of the<i> Agnete</i>'s low breadth/length ratio - 1:2.5, compared with 1:3.2 for <i>Saga Siglar</i> and
1:4 for <i>Roar</i> - which results in the shrouds getting in the way to a greater degree. This means that
the ship cannot sail closer to the wind than 65-70 degrees, while the other two ships can reach
about 60 degrees.<p>

Rowing the Gedesby replica turned out, not unexpectedly, to be somewhat laborious. But with the
6 very long oars projecting out between the shrouds, as can be seen on several old illustrations, it
proved possible in fact to manoeuvre the Agnete fairly successfully around the harbour in a light
wind. In calm weather it must be possible to reach a speed of a little over 2 knots over a short
course, but against the wind little headway can be made by rowing. The oars are no doubt only for
positioning and harbour manoeuvres in confined and very sheltered waters.<p>

It was a positive surprise to discover that the <i>Agnete</i> could 'turn on a sixpence' in virtually all
conditions. This was true of changing tack against the wind, which is often a problem for
square-sail ships, and of veering. During tacking most ships avoid veering as far as possible,
because it results in loss of 'altitude' and speed.  But for the <i>Agnete</i> the turning area was not larger
than about 30 m, which meant that she could actually come about just as fast as in tacking, and
moreover was still going at speed, whereas during tacking a ship lies still immediately after turning. 
Both types of turning took only about 50 seconds at best; this was the fastest we have to date
recorded for a square-sail ship. The reason for this must be the ship's waterlines, which are very
rounded compared with the longer, slighter curves seen in many of the Viking ships. The fact that
the <i>Agnete </i>has a stern rudder in contrast to the side-rudder of the Viking ships has no effect,
according to our experience, on the turning properties. The Gedesby ship replica would probably
turn just as fast with a good side-rudder. In spite of the rounded water-lines, which might perhaps
have resulted in imbalance or a 'hard rudder' under sail, the balance was very good. The <i>Agnete</i>
was neither weather-helm nor lee-helm, but could be steered by a single finger on the tiller.<p>

Sea-worthiness is no doubt the most prominent of the Gedesby ship's virtues. If a ship can make
0.7 knots against the wind and current with a double-reefed sail in a moderate gale, there would
have to be exceptionally bad weather conditions, possibly combined with physical damage before it
could be wrecked or swamped.  During our trials the waves were up to 1.5 m high, and under
those conditions it was a pleasure to see how the <i>Agnete</i>'s very flaring sides simply threw the sea
back and down during tacking, so that not even spray fell on board. At the same time one could
clearly see that the ship's flexible construction distributed the pressure from the waves over larger
areas of the ship than those directly hit by the first impact, and this significantly reduced the strain
on the forepart.<p>

Even the rigging seems well-reconstructed and sturdily-made. It was well and truly put to the test
in the gale-force winds. As already mentioned, the full-sail carrying capacity could be rated high,
since the sail did not require reefing until 11 m/s. The Viking cargo-ship <i>Roar Ege</i>, which is only
half as large, in relation to its displacement, has to be reefed at 8-9 m/s, while the<i> Saga Siglar</i>,
double the size of the <i>Agnete</i>, can wait until 14-15 m/s. One is often compelled to reef slightly
earlier, however, to ease the labouring of the ship in high seas.<p>

In conclusion, we already know that in comparison with the two Viking trading-ships the<i> Agnete</i>
can be said to be entirely able to compete in relation to speed in the water, but in tacking there are
differences. The <i>Agnete</i>'s course made good in relation to the wind, as it is recorded on screen
taking account of deviation, lies within the area 71-82 degrees from the direction of the wind. The
same calculation has given between 64 and 72 degrees for <i>Roar</i> and between 65 and 68 degrees
for <i>Saga Siglar</i>, in all cases with the worst figures being obtained with reefed or double-reefed
sail. All three square-sail ships achieve their best VMG at 9-10 m/s, but the <i>Agnete</i>'s is not quite as
good as those of the others. Finally, it looks as if the<i> Agnete</i> is by far the most sluggish in slack
weather. Perhaps the ship should have had slightly more sail, but it should be stressed that we have
too few test results in light wind to be able to judge this. In order to obtain more statistically
reliable results the <i>Agnete</i> should be subjected to at least a further week of controlled sailing-trials -
preferably in more normal Danish summer weather with relatively light wind-conditions and
perhaps with e.g. the <i>Roar Ege</i> participating as a sparring partner.<p>

<i>Publication</i><p>

The sailing-trials, along with the reconstruction-work and the quantities of experience gained
during the building of the <i>Agnete</i> will be described in a report to be published in Danish by the
National Museum's Centre for Maritime Archaeology in 1996. This report will primarily be an
account of the reconstruction and of the aims of the experimental-archaeology project, its methods
and results. An English publication will be produced in the series Ships &amp; Boats of the North, in
1998. This will to a greater extent be a presentation of the Gedesby find itself, of its context and of
parallels to it, but it will also include the results of the sailing experiments with the replica.<p>

In parallel with this a corresponding process has been initiated to prepare an account of the
Skuldelev find and to publish it along with the experiments which have been carried out with the
replicas of those ships. In this way the Centre for Maritime Archaeology will be able, in the
coming years, to make important contributions both to the discussion of methodology with regard
to the viability of experiments in archaeology and to the debate concerning the historical
development of ships and seafaring.<p>
