<h3>PhotoDraw</h3>
<h4>A new method for producing drawings of archaeological artefacts, etc.</h4>
<p>

Illustrations of archaeological finds often turn out to be a significant obstacle in the completion of
publication projects. Work involving manual drawing is particularly prone to cause delays and
expense. In an age when it is possible to put men on the moon it may seem rather strange to see
graphic artists setting to work with slide-gauges, pens, crayons and drawing paper when a drawing
of an object is required. First the object has to be carefully measured up, then a pencil sketch is
made, and then comes the most time-consuming, boring phase, during which the drawing is built
up of thousands of dots laboriously positioned with pen and Indian ink. This is the time-honoured
method, at any rate where the objects concerned are of materials such as metal, pottery,
bone/antler or rock. A spear- or lance-head may thus very easily take half a day, and a pottery
vessel with complicated decoration one or two days.<p>

Why not use photos instead, then, one might well ask. Because the clarity of photographs is
diminished in the reproduction phase, in particular during the process of screening the picture; this
drastically reduces the resolution and drowns out the finer details.  In this respect technology has to
be said to be trailing behind.<p>

But help is on the way. In the spring of 1995, at the National Museum's Centre for Maritime
Archaeology and the Institute of Maritime Archaeology the foundations were laid for a new
illustration-method which could well revolutionize the production of drawings of artefacts and in
the long run spare considerable sums for museums and other research institutes.<p>

In February 1995 I was given the task of drawing hundreds of finds from the Nydam excavation
with a view to a major publication which was being planned. I reached out as usual for the
customary tools, but faced with a task of this immense scale my thoughts turned instead to
alternative strategies which all had the common factor that it must be possible to find a shortcut by
using photos. Suddenly it came to me that as early as in the 1970s I had had some interesting
results by copying from black-and-white negatives over onto hard lith-film. This resulted in
artefact-pictures with a grained or dotted structure - very like what is normally painstakingly
achieved by dotting with pen-and-ink. After turning my gaze on my computer, I came to realize
that the solution was a combination of photo-technology and electronic picture-editing: the digital
dark-room; i.e., a hybrid, which accounts for the working title, PhotoDraw.<p>

The method, which has been developed in close and inspiring cooperation with Flemming Rieck
and Erik J&oslash;rgensen, consists of transferring a photo of an artefact, black-and-white or colour, on
paper or on slide - or a picture obtained with a digital camera or camera-scanner - to the computer
and transforming it there into photo graphics in an advanced graphics-editing programme.
Extremely fine black dots can then be applied, and the relative density of their distribution
represents grey tones and other forms of shade and structure to create the image-element. The
result is a 'drawing' which in principle is not differentiable from the drawings produced by
conventional methods.  It is estimated that with the new method - when it has been fully developed
- it will be possible to produce illustrations of archaeological finds and museum objects 4-5 times
faster than by the old method. In addition the drawings will be more faithful to the original and
thus more objective than manual drawings, which always reflect a more or less subjective
interpretation of the artefact. And anyone with a little talent for graphic and computer techniques
and insight into them will relatively quickly be able to acquire the technique. It is also a distinct
advantage that the drawings will then be available in electronic form, which will make it easier to
highlight details, e.g. decoration which might not stand out sufficiently clearly on the original
photo, and to integrate the drawings in a desktop-publishing project.<p>

It is evident that the method can also be of use within other subject-areas where drawings of
objects are necessary, e.g. geology/mineralogy, palaeontology (fossils) and biology.<p>
