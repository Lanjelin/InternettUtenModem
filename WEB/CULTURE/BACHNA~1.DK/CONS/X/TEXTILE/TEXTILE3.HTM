<h3>EXHIBITING TEXTILES IS DIFFICULT!</h3>

often hear this remark - and it is true that textiles should ideally be
displayed flat and in a dim light, to slow further breakdown. Because of
this it is difficult to appreciate the fine details that are hidden in
the &quot;brown rags&quot;. Ideally, the textile mount for exhibition should
also be suitable for storage. This is easy with smaller fragments that
can be mounted in frames of acid free cardboard.

excavation, a Viking Age site near Viborg in Jutland, excavated in 1868.
The fragment is framed with a window so that the sewing technique can be
studied from the back. </i>

<p>Photos or drawings can be used to show details that are hidden, or lost
under low light in the exhibition.
