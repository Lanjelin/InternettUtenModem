<h2>Archaeological Conservation and its Consequences</h2>

<h3>A history of the techniques and ethics of conservation at the National
Museum of Denmark through the last 150 years</h3>

<h3><font SIZE=+0>A www version of the exhibition prepared for the IIC
conference held in Copenhagen, August 1996</font></h3>

<p>Some restoration methods used in the past are now seen to be directly
damaging to the object. Conservators have, in the past, been much bolder
in their reconstructions. On the other hand there are examples of ingenious
adaptation of the chemical knowledge of the time which have saved objects
which would otherwise have crumbled to dust. This exhibition is a respectful
but critical appraisal of the evolution of the conservator's trade. </p>

<p>The exhibition was made by Eva Salomonsen, Kristiane Straetkvern and
Irene Skals, with contributions by many colleagues, in particular Birthe
Gottlieb (X-ray pictures) and John Lee (photographs). This www version
of the exhibition is by Tim Padfield.</p>
