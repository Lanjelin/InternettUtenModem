<h4>CONSERVATION OF WATERLOGGED WOOD - PART 4 
<hr width="100%" ></h4>

<h4>The finished work</h4>

<p>The waterlogged wood workshop of the National Museum conserves on average
2000 objects a year. Not all these objects will be exhibited. Many are
stored but must be available for study. They must therefore be packed in
a way that causes the least stress from handling. This attention to packing
and transport begins at the excavation site. </p>

<br><i>Objects that are found in many small pieces can be sealed in perforated
foil, together with their identification number, so that all the pieces
can be treated together until they are eventually joined.</i>
