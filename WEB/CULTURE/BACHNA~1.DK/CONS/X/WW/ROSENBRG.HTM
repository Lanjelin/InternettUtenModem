Georg Rosenberg (1878-1941) was employed at the National Museum of Denmark
from 1895 to 1940. He conserved both inorganic and organic materials. He
was responsible for several large conservation projects, including the
Hjortspring find. In 1917 he published a method for conservation of iron
and bronze and he worked extensively with galvanic and electrolytic methods
for metal conservation. Rosenberg also developed and improved methods for
textile conservation. Rosenberg kept meticulous records in his notebooks
which have been a great help to his successors.

<p>Rosenberg made several experiments to find a method for strengthening
brittle archaeological textiles. The experiments were made with cotton
wool impregnated with a mixture of Chinese Wood Oil, turpentine and carbon
tetrachloride. He experimented also with glueing the impregnated cotton
wool to silk netting.</p>
