<h4>Freeze drying with tertiary butanol</h4>

<p>We have conserved antiquities in Denmark by freeze drying since 1979,
when equipment was installed in the National Museum to freeze dry from
tertiary butanol, which solidifies at 25 degrees C. </p>

<p>The objects are first impregnated with PEG 4000 dissolved in butanol
(an alcohol like molecule). During this process the original water diffuses
out of the wood, because it is miscible with butanol. The butanol is then
removed by freeze drying. The butanol passes directly from the solid to
the vapour state, avoiding the liquid state, where surface tension would
cause collapse of the wood structure during evaporation. The results have
been good, in spite of the poor penetrating power of PEG 4000. The method
was used in the National Museum for ten years but was abandoned in 1992,
because it is slow and is also a health risk.

<h4>Impregnating and freeze drying with water</h4>

<p>The preferred method, at present, for conserving very decomposed wood,
such as Iron Age wood from bogs, is impregnation with PEG in water solution,
followed by freeze drying. A mixture of PEG's of different molecular sizes
is often used to give a combination of depth of impregnation and strength.
Impregnants such as sucrose (sugar) and glucose are useful for wooden objects
with metal parts which corrode in PEG solution. </p>

<p>Thin pieces and severely decomposed pieces of wood can be impregnated
in half a year. Thicker and better preserved wood needs to lie in the bath
up to ten years before it is thoroughly impregnated. After impregnation,
the object is freeze dried. This takes from 3 to 5 months.</p>

<h4><font SIZE=+1>Dehydration with organic solvents</font></h4>

<p>Occasionally, selected objects are treated by dehydration from solvents:
cellosolve and petrol. The principle of the process is that the cellosolve
is miscible with water and slowly replaces it as the object is heated in
a bath of cellosolve to evaporate the water. The cellosolve is in turn
replaced by petrol. This can them be allowed to evaporate from the wood.
There is no collapse because the water-free wood is stiff even when it
is full of petrol. The method is fast. Objects conserved in this way are
pale and light. The disadvantage of the method is that the organic vapours
are poisonous. It is useful for objects containing both wood and iron,
which corrodes in the PEG bath.</p>
