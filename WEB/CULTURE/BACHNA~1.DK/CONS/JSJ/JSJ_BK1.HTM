<h4>A brief account of the purpose of the meeting:</h4>

<p>The intent was to go behind research results in photographic conservation
and discuss methods used for research, why they are used and how the results
change thinking about preservation. We also discussed what research needs
to be done. The participants left the meeting with a renewed respect for
the possibilities and limitations of a variety of investigation techniques.
All contributions to the meeting are published in English in the proceedings.
