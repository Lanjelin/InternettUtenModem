<h4><b>Abstract</b></h4>

<p>Observations on collections of photographs show that the rate of deterioration
is very variable, depending as much on the quality of the processing as
on the inherent stability of the materials. The current standard storage
climate for negatives is based on the degradation rate of cellulose acetate.
This climate does not prevent the deterioration of badly manufactured or
processed film but demands expensive equipment that is not necessary for
the survival of sheet film that is in good condition. We suggest an approach
to collections management which eases the climate specification for the
bulk of the collection, compensated by regular surveying of the collection
with eye, nose and chemical sensors. Decaying images are found and put
into a cold store to retard deterioration, followed by copying and possible
chemical treatment. </p>

<h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

<p>We describe the types of deterioration commonly observed in collections
of black and white sheet films. This survey suggests that the standard
recommended for the storage climate is both too lax, in that it does not
prevent deterioration of unstable images, and too strict, in that it imposes
the technical and cost burden of full air conditioning, wherever in the
world the archive is situated. We explore an alternative strategy for collection
management which combines an active policy of inspection and treatment
with climate control based on the minimum modification of the local climate
that will give a safe microclimate in the store. </p>

<h4><b>Evidence from the collections</b></h4>

<p>Figure 1 shows a typical result from a condition survey of a collection
of photographs. This collection spans from about 1900 to the mid 1950's.
The negatives are on glass, nitrate and acetate base. The collection has
always been housed in a palace in Copenhagen, never air conditioned, drifting
during the year between 16C at 25% relative humidity (RH) and 28C and 60%
RH. </p>

photographs. Each square represents an individual negative. White squares

<p>A striking feature of the survey is that all the deterioration is in
the image rather than the base. The negatives marked as in bad condition
suffer from discoloured or bleached silver gelatine emulsions. The film
base appears to have no influence on this deterioration and is itself in
good condition. </p>

<p>A common feature of such surveys is the presence of groups of bad pictures.
Figure 2a shows two boxes full of wrapped negatives, each box with a clearly
defined centre of decomposition, evidently caused by reactive vapours,
because the wrappers are disintegrating. </p>

<p><i>Figure 2 a: An example of damage spreading from a point source of
corrosive vapour. The two boxes each contain around 1500 nitrate negatives.
The dark spots are caused by deteriorating film base. </i></p>

<p>Figure 2b shows a series of negatives adjacent to a 'diseased' negative,
showing rapidly diminishing damage with increasing separation. </p>

<p><i>b: Negatives from the discoloured area in the right box. The base
deterioration has apparently started in the negative shown at bottom right,
attacking the negative in close contact (bottom left), while deterioration
in the negative at top left has only just started.</i> </p>

<p>In figure 3 we show in schematic form how one would expect the state
of a collection to develop in the next few decades. The condition now is
represented by row A. </p>

<p>If the collection is steadily and uniformly deteriorating one would
expect a pattern like row B, where the oldest images are the worst. </p>

<p><i>Figure 3 A schematic representation of the state of preservation
of negatives in a collection. The present state is represented by row A.
Row B shows the likely result of a survey in 30 years time if negatives
primarily deteriorate with age. C predicts the future condition if the
deterioration is due to bad processing. D shows the effect of negatives
attacking neighbours through emission of acid vapours. Finally, if a bad
environment is the main cause of deterioration the result will look like
row E.</i> </p>

<p>If bad processing has caused some photographs to decay one would not
expect a different pattern of deterioration over the next decades, because
the bad photos have already selected themselves out. A prediction for the
future state of such a collection is illustrated in row C. </p>

<p>If one decomposing picture is attacking its neighbours through emission
of acid vapours, the prediction for the future state can be seen in row
D. </p>

<p>If the storage environment is the main cause of deterioration, all images
can be expected to show signs of deterioration in the future, as illustrated
in row E. </p>

<p>It seems that the collection described in figure 1 has not suffered
from a bad environment and that the observed deterioration can be attributed
to inherent vice in a few of the negatives. </p>

<p>

<h4><b>The four components of good collections management</b></h4>

<p>From this analysis we define the care of a collection of photographs
as a combination of four activities: </p>

<p>1. Regular inspections to identify deteriorating images. </p>

<p>2. Identification of the reason for this decay. </p>

<p>3. Removal of these negatives for copying, preservative chemical treatment
(1) or stabilisation through cold storage (2). </p>

<p>4. Maintenance of a moderate climate around the stable bulk of the collection.
</p>

<p>This last component of our scheme: ensuring a moderate climate for the
pictures that are in good condition, is the main subject of this article.
