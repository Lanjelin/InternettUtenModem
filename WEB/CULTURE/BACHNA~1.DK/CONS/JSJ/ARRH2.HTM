<h4><b>The climate required for black and white photographs</b></h4>

<p>The first duty of an archivist is to prevent catastrophic, rapid damage
to the collection. Figure 4 shows roughly where the limits lie. </p>

<p><i>Figure 4 The factors that influence the durability of photographs.
Above the glass transition of gelatin the film is likely to stick to its
enclosure. Below the delamination line the differential shrinkage of gelatin
and film base threatens to break their adhesion. The diagonal lines mark
the time for acetate film base to reach an acidity that causes autocatalytic
hydrolysis. The limit for physical damage through ice crystal formation
in the gelatin is shown at the top left corner. We can find no quantitative
data for limiting conditions for fungal damage. We have not observed biological
attack in the humid Copenhagen climate and therefore use the glass transition
as the limiting factor at high RH. </i></p>

<p>The high humidity limit is set by the glass transition of gelatin to
a soft consistency which renders it liable to stick to its surroundings.
We have taken, and simplified, the data of McCormick-Goodhart (3). The
lower RH limit is set by the danger of delamination through differential
shrinkage of the base and emulsion. We have taken the recommendations from
the ANSI standard for glass plate negatives (4). The high temperature limit
for catastrophe is the softening point of gelatin but we have conservatively
used the 10 years to significant acetate film base acidity from Reilly
et al (5). We use this as a general indicator of the rate of degradation
reactions, rather than as a definite lifetime prediction. Ice crystallization
in frozen film only occurs at very high RH. We include this to warn against
unprotected storage in refrigerators. The region for biological attack
on the gelatin is difficult to define. Silver is an effective biocide,
acetic acid and phenol outgassing from acetate negatives are also poisonous
to many organisms. We have never found biological decay in collections
in temperate climates that could not have been caused by liquid water.
We regard the softening of the film at high RH as setting the climate limit.
Figure 5 is a simplified version of figure 4 which is used as the basis
for building up the discussion. </p>

<p><i>Figure 5 Suggested climate limits for the storage of black and white
film, with contours showing the increasing chemical stability conferred
by low temperature and, to a lesser degree, by low RH.</i> </p>

<p>The exact position of the lines is not important because the aim must
be to hold the climate well within the boundaries and over towards the
left side of the diagram. The relaxed attitude to high temperature does
not mean that we accept as safe a permanent climate in this region of the
diagram. The diagram marks the limits of acute, immediate danger. </p>

<p>Figure 6 superimposes on this window of non-catastrophic temperature
and relative humidity the climate at various places, representing different
climate types (6). We have used the monthly average values for temperature
and relative humidity, assuming a certain inertia in the storage room that
will even out shorter variations. </p>

<p><i>Figure 6 The monthly average temperature and relative humidity in
various places, compared with the region of safe climate for storage of
black and white photographs.</i> </p>

<p>Notice that the hot humid climate of Lagos is immediately destructive
to photographs and the winter dampness of Copenhagen lifts the gelatin
above its glass transition. Luxor presents the opposite risk of delamination.
Anchorage seems, climatically, to be an excellent place to store photos.

<h4><b>The ANSI/ISO standard</b></h4>

<p>At this point we refer to the ANSI standard (7) for storage climate,
for guidance on how radically we need to adjust the natural climate. </p>

<p><img src="ARRH7.GIF" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/cons/jsj/arrh7.gif" alt="Fig" align=bottom></p>

<p><i>Figure 7 The natural climate in various places, compared with the
ANSI standard storage climate for black and white film and the limits for
safe storage suggested in this article. </i></p>

<p>Figure 7 includes the ANSI standard for the climate around black and
white negatives. The standard teasingly nudges the edge of the area occupied
by the world's natural climates. Standards have an authority that encourages
acquiescence without deeper consideration, particularly by administrators
who have little knowledge of the experimental or experiential basis for
the standard. The climate standard for storage of black and white film
is based on the predicted rate of hydrolytic decomposition of cellulose
acetate film base, as extrapolated from accelerated ageing tests over a
range of temperatures, using the Arrhenius method. A lifetime of better
than 100 years seems to have been the guiding principle (8). </p>

<p>As we have already explained, it is quite often the image that deteriorates
faster than the base. The standard is therefore optimistic in its implicit
assumption that film is always processed to such a high standard that the
durability of the base is the limiting factor in image storage. On the
other hand the lifetime figures for the film base shown on the graph are
pessimistic, as Reilly et al acknowledge, because they are based on the
decomposition rate of film that was encapsulated in airtight bags so that
the acid could not escape. This tight wrapping is only approached in reality
with rolled film. Flat film stored in envelopes has been shown to lose
much of the acetic acid vapour to the air (5). The standard also fails
to take into account that glass plate, acetate and nitrate negatives, and
maybe prints and slides, are often stored together. A single standard for
archives, based on choosing a climate that lies within a matrix of limits
for each of the various stored materials, would be more practical. </p>

<p>The standard is therefore somewhat arbitrary. The general trend is parallel
to the line of constant deterioration rate according to Reilly et al. but
the precise positioning from left to right is a compromise between the
ideal storage temperature, 0K, and the most extreme terrestrial climate
at about 310K (37C). </p>

<p>The position of the standard in T-RH space has one important consequence
that is not immediately obvious: it requires unusual air conditioning technology.
The zigzag standard limit follows the -3C frostpoint, as shown in figure
8. </p>

<p><img src="ARRH8.GIF" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/cons/jsj/arrh8.gif" alt="Fig" align=bottom></p>

<p><i>Figure 8 The ANSI standard superimposed on lines showing the RH and
temperature corresponding to a -3C frost point and a 4C dew point temperature.</i>
</p>

<p>The frost, or dew, point is significant, because this is the temperature
to which the air conditioning equipment must cool the air to dehumidify
it, by condensation of water or ice. The air is subsequently heated up
again so that its RH falls to its set value as the temperature rises to
its set value. A dew point below freezing needs a cooling surface cooled
by an antifreeze solution, or by direct expansion of refrigerant, and it
also requires a defrosting cycle. Air conditioning for human comfort operates
with air at a dew point above 4C, which is usually achieved by condensation
onto a surface cooled by recirculating cold water. The climate attained
with air at this dewpoint cannot be drier than 32% RH at 21C, or 47% at
15. The standard therefore requires more expensive, though well developed,
techniques. The low temperature option in the standard also requires airtight
construction to avoid condensation on the outer wall of the cooled room.
</p>

<p>Whether one is rich or poor, there is no profound, logical reason to
stick exactly to the ANSI (ISO) standard (9). It is expensive for the poor
and not particularly good at preserving the pictures of the rich. It requires,
everywhere, the installation of mechanical systems, which can fail with
far more catastrophic results than an unclimatised building can ever achieve.
</p>

<p>The lifetime of an air conditioning installation is about twenty years.
The lifetime of the photographic standards has proved to be even shorter
(10). Less than ideal climate control that still ensures a slow rate of
deterioration will hold the collection in readiness for the possibilities
of a future with infinitely durable digital preservation (if one remembers
the code) on gold discs. The question is how far one can move out beyond
the standard limit into the warm, damp area of the diagram without risking
being judged an irresponsible curator of irreplaceable records. </p>

<p>

<h4><b>The Copenhagen model</b></h4>

<p>We use Copenhagen as a model for a marine temperate climate. The simplest
way to reduce the relative humidity to bring the climate within the safe
range for a photographic store is to warm the air. Figure 9 shows the natural
climate, at the top of the diagram. </p>

<p><img src="ARRH9.GIF" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/cons/jsj/arrh9.gif" alt="Fig" align=bottom></p>

<p><i>Figure 9 Climate change caused by heating and by dehumidification.
The monthly average climate of Copenhagen is shown in the top ring of stars.
The middle, flattened ring shows the effect of heating the air to reduce
the RH to 50%. The lowest ring shows the result of dehumidifying to come
close to the ANSI standard. </i></p>

<p>The flattened ring in the centre represents the consequences of warming
to maintain 50% relative humidity throughout the year. This is not a particularly
attractive option because the temperature moves towards the rapid reaction
side of the diagram. This system operates in the State Archive of Schleswig-Holstein,
Germany, and is described by Christoffersen (11). It has the advantage
that in a sufficiently insulated building the necessary heating, about
five degrees above ambient, is provided by very modest human activity and
low level, intermittent lighting. The radiator heating system installed
at Schleswig has never been needed. </p>

<p>An alternative strategy is to dehumidify the air. Dehumidification to
bring the climate as close as possible to the standard is shown as the
lowest ring of stars in the diagram. Notice that the climate is still displaced
to a slightly higher temperature. This is an automatic consequence of dehumidification
without cooling. The points on figure 9 represent the result of passing
air in any quantity through a perfectly insulated room. In practice the
air change will be held to the minimum needed to ensure adequate ventilation
and the room will lose heat to the outside, bringing the summer temperature
closer to the standard specification. Note that an extremely massive and
well insulated building is not necessarily the correct structure. Careful
design is necessary to get the optimum result from simple strategies. </p>

<p>This dehumidification system is used in the museum stores of the Danish
National Museum. It is described by Padfield and Jensen (12). </p>

<p>Underground storage provides great temperature stability. The photographic
archive in Mo i Rana in north Norway is built in a cavern which has a natural
climate of 8C and 100% RH. This is dehumidified to 35% RH (13). The alternative
strategy of warming, to 15C for example, would only reduce the RH to 60%.
In general, dehumidification is preferable in store rooms, because the
air change can be kept small. In rooms used by people the necessary air
exchange, and the need for reasonable warmth, often makes heating a more
attractive route to a low RH in a cool climate. </p>

<h4><b>Summary</b></h4>

<p>Observations on collections of photographs show that the rate of deterioration
is very variable, depending as much on the quality of the processing as
on the inherent stability of the materials. The current standard for storage
climate is a compromise that will still allow the deterioration of badly
manufactured or processed film but demands expensive equipment that is
not necessary for the survival of film and prints that are in good condition.
The standard emphasises the importance of the room climate but observation
suggests that pollution of the microenvironment by relatively few decomposing
negatives is a frequent cause of damage to sound material nearby. </p>

<p>We suggest an approach to collections management which eases the climate
specification for the bulk of the collection, allowing relatively simple
and cheap manipulation of the local climate. This relaxed approach to climate
control is compensated by regular surveying of the collection with eye,
nose and chemical sensors. Decaying images are found and put into a cold
store to retard deterioration and to allow later preservation of the image
by copying and possibly by chemical treatment. </p>
