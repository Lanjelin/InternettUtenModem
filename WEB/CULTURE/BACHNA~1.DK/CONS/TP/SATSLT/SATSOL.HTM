<h4>Saturated salt solutions for controlling relative humidity</h4>

<p>The water vapour concentration, and therefore the relative humidity
over a salt solution is less than that over pure water. This is because
water is present in both the gas and the liquid phase, whereas the scarcely
volatile salt molecules are only present in the liquid. They dilute the
water and hinder escape of water molecules into the air. The rate of return
of water molecules to the liquid surface is proportional to their concentration
in the gas, where there are no salt ions to interfere. The system therefore
adjusts to an equilibrium where there are fewer water molecules in the
air than there would be over a pure water surface. The RH is therefore
lower than 100%. </p>

<p>This argument applies to all salt solutions, saturated or not. The reason
for using saturated solutions, in contact with a heap of the solid crystals,
is that the concentration theoretically remains constant even if water
enters or leaves the solution from the air. </p>

<p>In practice there are some problems with saturated salt solutions. They
are difficult to wash out of art objects after accidents. The salt tends
to crystallise at the edges of the container. The crystals form a labyrinth
that allows solution to rise by capillarity and crystallise further up
the wall. Eventually the salt gets everywhere. </p>

<p>A less well known problem is that the salt solution is bad at dehumidifying.
During this process the saturated solution begins to absorb water from
the air. This dilutes the solution at the surface. The less dense surface
solution is gravitationally stable and does not mix with the bulk of saturated
solution, so the RH drifts upwards from the theoretical value for the saturated
solution towards 100%. If the room temperature is unstable the salt solution
behaves quite unpredictably, causing considerable errors when such solutions
are used in experimental work to measure absorption isotherms or to calibrate
instruments. </p>

<p>The situation can be improved by heaping up the solid salt in a cone,
with just enough water to damp it. Extra solution formed by water absorption
from the air will dribble down the outside of the cone, exposing a fresh
crystal surface to grab more water from the air. Convective mixing can
also be achieved by enclosing the saturated solution in a polymer sachet
that is permeable to water molecules but not to charged ions. Thin silicone
sheet is good for this purpose but now the job is so complicated that it
is better to use another RH control method altogether. </p>

<p>Mechanical mixing is possible but messy and brings the extra uncertainty
that the mixer adds heat to the solution, resulting in a higher than theoretical
RH at the surface of the object being conditioned. </p>

<p>If, in spite of these difficulties, you wish to use saturated salts,
the definitive list was published by Lewis Greenspan, 'Humidity fixed points
of binary saturated aqueous solutions', J. of Research, National Bureau
of Standards, 81A (1977) pp 89-96</p>

<p>I have extracted from these data a set that can be used for <a href="SATSALT.HTM" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/cons/tp/satslt/satsalt.htm">calibrating
