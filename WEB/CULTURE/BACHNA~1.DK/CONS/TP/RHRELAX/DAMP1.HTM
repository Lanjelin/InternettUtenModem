<h4>A humidification chamber for relaxing paper or textiles</h4>

<p>Here is a method of humidification that was developed by Tim Padfield
and Poul Larsen as part of an experiment in desalting bricks. It is, however,
of general usefulness. </p>

<p><img src="DAMP1.GIF" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/cons/tp/rhrelax/damp1.gif" alt="Diagram" border=0 of apparatus height=199 width=492 align=bottom></p>

<p>A compressor, air flask or aquarium pump sends air through a dehumidifier
(optional, see later). The air then bubbles through a water filled flask
that is thermally insulated. Spray is trapped by a washing up scourer of
twisted plastic ribbon. The emerging air is saturated but at a lower temperature
than the room air, because the latent heat of evaporation is drawn from
the air, as in a psychrometer. This air stream is then passed through a
long (about 1 metre, depending on air flow) coil of copper pipe to bring
it back to room temperature. During this process the relative humidity
falls. The air then passes into the reaction vessel containing the object
to be humidified. </p>

<p>The principle is very simple. We need to add methods for measuring and
regulating RH and we should add some safety features. </p>

<p>

<h4>RH control</h4>

<p>Two thermometers are required.The RH is defined by the ratio of the
saturation vapour pressures of water at the temperature of the water in
the flask and at the temperature of the air in the humidification chamber.
There is therefore no need for a direct RH measurement, except once, to
check that saturation is actually achieved at the desired air flow (there
will be more about RH measurement in a later article). </p>

<p>The air flow is first adjusted to the required value. The water temperature
is then adjusted by changing the efficiency of the insulation. The apparatus
illustrated can achieve any RH between 95% and 40%. It is, however, surprisingly
difficult to achieve a high RH. If only a high RH is required and the room
RH is stable, the drier can be omitted. A second saturator can be added,
or a fan used to blow room air past the saturator. </p>

<h4>Safety features</h4>

<p>The usual error is forgetting to top up the water, but we do not recommend
automatic water level control. The central tube in the saturator functions
as a pressure release valve. When the water level falls below the bottom
of the tube the air will go up the tube instead of into the humidity chamber.
The convolutions of the copper heat exchanger will ensure that the air
will more easily escape through the straight tube in the saturator. To
be quite sure, you can put a slight resistance to air flow at the entrance
to the humidification chamber; a rubber flap with a very thin brass spring
will do. </p>

<p>Guarding against exhaustion of the drier is more difficult. If silica
gel is used it will fail gradually, so one must be really careless to cause
a high RH this way. Molecular sieve is a more efficient drier but fails
suddenly, like rechargeable cycle lamp batteries.
<hr>The next question is: when is the humidification process complete?
More about that next month... </p>
