Museum of Denmark.</h3>

<dd>The <i>Department of the National Museum of Denmark</i> is a traditional
conservation department with all conservation disciplines being represented:</dd>

<dd>* Metals section</dd>

<dd>* Paintings section</dd>

<dd>* Organic materials section </dd>

<dd>* Furniture section</dd>

<dd>* Paper and textiles section</dd>

<dd>* Wallpaper section</dd>

<dd>* Laboratory</dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd>The Department acts by law as a consultant in connection with the restoration
of the 2000 medieval</dd>

<dd>churches in Denmark.</dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd><b>Organization and size:</b></dd>

<dd>The Department is a traditionel conservation department at a museum
and it is a business, too. </dd>

<dd>The two functions are integrated into the same organization.</dd>

<dd>The department is organized into 6 conservation sub-departments and
a laboratory,</dd>

<dd>which also deals with museum climate issues, and a secretariat.</dd>

<dd>The Conservation Department, consisting of almost 100 employees, is
on of the largest of its kind in the world.</dd>

<dd>Two thirds of the staff is paid to deal with the National Museum's
own collections. The last third conserves </dd>

<dd>wallpaintings, decorations and furniture in Danish churches, castles,
manor houses and protected buildings. </dd>

<dd>The payment here is according to market price.</dd>

<dd>Also private people are customers in this business part of the Department.</dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd><b>History:</b></dd>

<dd>The history of conservation in the Natioal Museum is of course as old
as the museum itself. </dd>

<dd>Royal collections have existed since the 17th century. </dd>

<dd>The collections expanded over the years and at the beginning of the
19th century the National Museum was established as an institution,</dd>

<dd>based mainly on archaeology. From the middle of the 19th century conservation
was established as a professional discipline.</dd>

<dd>A great number of the archaeological objects excavated at that time
are on display today, many of which are in fine condition.</dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd>The Department, as it is organized today, has devoloped since 1985,
when the museum's three separate conservation departments </dd>

<dd>were amalgamated to form a single enity. </dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd><b>Situation, the buildings and storage:</b></dd>

<dd>The Department is situated in two different locations:</dd>

<dd>The major part of the Depatment is in <i>Brede</i>, 15 km north of
Copenhagen, and is housed in 4 buildings with a total area of 9000m2.</dd>

<dd>The archaeological metal and the ceramic conservation is situated in
<i>Ny Vestergade</i> (across the street from the National Museum's </dd>

<dd>exhibitions in Prinsens Palais (The Prince's Palace), which is the
main address of the museum in the centre of Copenhagen).</dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd>The Department in Brede is housed in an old factory by the river <i>Mølleåen
</i>which developed around a watermill.</dd>

<dd>Such watermills have existed in Brede since early medieval times. </dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd>The National Museum's storage facilities here are housed mostly in
old buildings converted specifically for the purpose.</dd>

<dd>The next mill along the river is at <i>Ørholm</i>, a property also
owned by the National Museum, where extensive storage facilities, recently
converted, </dd>

<dd>have also been established.</dd>

<dd>Together with the capacity at the main residence in Prinsens Palais
in Copenhagen, the National Museum has a total storage area</dd>

<dd>of 25.000 m2, most of which is of a higly satisfactory standard.</dd>

<dd></dd>

<dd>The buildings in Brede and in Ny Vestergade are listed, and as always
this means that it is difficult and expensive</dd>

<dd>to convert them into conservation laboratories and workshops. </dd>

<dd>However substantial funds have been available for this purpose throughout
the years and it is confidently expected </dd>

<dd>that before the end ot the century they will be up to professioanl
standards.</dd>
