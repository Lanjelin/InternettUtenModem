ICOM-CC provides a framework within which conservation specialists can meet and work on an interdisciplinary level. <A HREF="GROUPS/WOGRGEN.HTM" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/cons/icom_cc/groups/wogrgen.htm"><B>Twenty-four Working Groups</B></A> are the backbone of the Committee<B>. </B>They may deal with:

ICOM-CC organizes Triennial Meetings to bring together professionals from all over the world who are interested in conservation. The Meeting represents the apex of the triennial activity of the Committee and of its Working Groups. Recent Triennial Meetings have been held in Copenhagen in 1984, Sydney in 1987, Dresden in 1990 and Washington in 1993.<B> <A HREF="CONF96/EDIN96.HTM" tppabs="http://bach.natmus.min.dk/cons/icom_cc/conf96/edin96.htm">The 1996 Triennial Meeting</A></B> was held in Edinburgh.
