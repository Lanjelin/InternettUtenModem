<p><b>In 1997 we can celebrate the fact that it was 600 years ago that the three Nordic kingdoms of Denmark, Norway (including Iceland and Greenland) and Sweden (including Finland) were united in a political union under Queen Margrete I. This came about in the summer of 1397 at Kalmar
Castle, when the young Erik of Pomerania, Margrete's adopted son, was crowned king of all three realms. The Kalmar Union lasted, apart from a few brief intervals, until 1521, and Denmark and
Norway remained united until 1814.</p>

<p> On the occasion of the 600th anniversary of the union the Nordic Council of Ministers will support a major exhibition which will be shown in four Nordic countries in turn. The exhibition is organized by the National Museum of Denmark where it will be shown from December 26th 1996. The patrons of the exhibition are Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, King Harald V of Norway, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and the Presidents of Finland and Iceland.</p> 

<p> Based on Margrete I the exhibition portrays the period's cultural history and depicts one of the most significant women of the Middle Ages. Even though it was Erik of Pomerania who was crowned monarch of the three Nordic kingdoms, the union was Margrete's creation, and she was
its actual ruler until her death in 1412.</p>  

<p> The departure-point of the exhibition is a political event: the meeting in Kalmar in 1397. The power-structures involved in the kingdoms within the Nordic union will be sketched out and the original Union documents will be exhibited.<br><br>

The contrasts of the period are sharp and eloquent. Magnificent but terrifying crucifixes from the mid 14th century, when the plague rampaged through the area and eliminated almost half the population, stand out in contrast to manuscripts offering charming and cheerful reports. Tools and everyday goods are displayed as well as refined and sumptous gold ornaments.<br><br>

A section will focus on everyday garment as well as fine textiles including the magnificent dress which was once placed beside Margrete's grave in Roskilde, until it was taken away by Swedish mercenaries in 1659.

Furthermore the treasures of the church, and the art of the time, are illustrated in a selection of expressive and well-preserved works from the Nordic region and Northern Germany. Church silver, reliquaries and pilgrim badges all speak of the sacrifice people were prepared to make for the salvation of their souls.<br><br>
