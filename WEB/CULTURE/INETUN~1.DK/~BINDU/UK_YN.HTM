</TD><TD>Two deep relaxations, based on Swami Satyananda's classic Yoga Nidra,
created and guided by Swami Janakananda, who has also composed the background
of nature sounds. Music by Roop Verma. As a background and introduction there
is a 18 page booklet inserted
in the tape box.
<P><I>"This tape is a hit, if you can talk about hits within
relaxation."</I> (A. Thomson, therapist and New Age bookseller
in UK)
<P>
<I>"The tape is one of the most inspiring I have heard for
a long time. It is a multidimensional work of art of a nature
that is rarely seen."</I> (M. Lammg&aring;rd, musician and
therapist, V&auml;xthuset Kaprifol, Sweden)
<P>
<I>"After a number of years of having a stressed life with
a job that almost ruined my ability to live in the present, I'm
now again happy to face each new day, not to unnecessarily worry
myself about tomorrow. I have learnt to laugh again. I think it's
fantastic."</I> (E. Berg, Ludvika, Sweden)
<P>
"<I>Yoga Nidra sounds like nothing I've heard before. It is accompanied by
nature sounds, and the Indian musician Roop Verma. Sound symbols for the
various chakras are also played, from that music tradition called Nada Yoga.
Naturally, this practice is an individual experience . Personally, I find
it utterly fascinating. I feel refreshed and revitalised after the practice,
and I know I will continue with it</I>." (Nils-Olof Jacobsen in the magazine
S&ouml;karen)
<P><I>"Yoga Nidra is much more than a deep relaxation; it is
a total experience that touches and awakens all parts of your
being."</I> (Swami Janakananda)
