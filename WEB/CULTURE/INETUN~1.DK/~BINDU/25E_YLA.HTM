<P>The Yoga teacher education is both a creative process, a dynamic training,
a period of learning, and above all a way of living. This is a process
which is outwardly directed towards society with which we constantly communicate
and profound in the meditations and the methods we use, as well as in the
way we live in the different Schools and communities (<I>ashrams</I>).
</P>

<P>Our Yoga teacher education is not just about meeting occasionally during
the week and on certain weekends. It is a full-time education. It concerns
people who are serious about yoga, who sincerely seek a meaningful way
of living and working and who will help others too. </P>

<P>The living conditions which have been created around the education make
it possible to realise priorities normally unattainable in society - to
incorporate and increase the joy of <I>being</I>, and struggling less towards
<I>becoming</I>. </P>

<P>The aim of the education and the training is personal growth and spiritual
insight, based on a solid knowledge of yoga and meditation. It is a training
which stands in contrast to the media society, where people's minds are
filled with <I>information</I>, while the lack of personal <I>experience</I>
is disastrous. This results in fear, numbness and passivity. Unfortunately
many forms of education suffer from this shortcoming. Even some yoga teacher
training courses are only about cramming theoretical and mythological knowledge,
with very little personal or individual practice, which limits the experience
of the <I>effects</I> of yoga and meditation. </P>

<P>It takes a minimum of four years to become an independent yoga teacher
at our School, and at least two more years if one also wishes to teach
meditation. </P>

<P>The education is an exciting and rich chapter in one's life, not something
to be undertaken just to receive a diploma. Those who have fulfilled the
teacher training can receive a diploma according to the length and nature
of the education: 1) yoga; 2) yoga and meditation, and finally; 3) yogacharya
(a spiritual preceptor and master of yoga). The diploma contains both general
and personal information as well as listing what the teacher is qualified
to teach. </P>

<H3><B>The 3-month retreat - A strong and stable foundation</B> </H3>

<P>The Yoga Teacher Education begins with <I>the residential three month
sadhana course</I> at H&aring;&aring; Course Center. Like most courses
at this Center, it is international and taught in English. There are no
other entrance requirements for this retreat, but the desire to participate
and learn what the course offers. (Get a free course brochure with details
from the School.) </P>

<P>This retreat alone is more comprehensive and profound than many yoga
teacher training courses conducted around the world. Nevertheless, the
objective of the three month sadhana course is not to educate teachers,
nor does it give one the qualification to teach. It is foremost a process
for your own development and insight. Regardless of what you will be doing
after the three month course, it is a learning period which provides a
unique basis for your <I>sadhana</I> (your personal practice of yoga and
meditation) for years to come. Most people who partake in this retreat
do not set out to join the Yoga teacher education. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="25_YLA2.JPG" tppabs="http://inet.uni-c.dk/~bindu/25_yla2.jpg" HEIGHT=238 WIDTH=352></P>

<P><I>Apart from the classes in the yoga room, a yoga teacher seminar at
H&aring;&aring; also involves the teachers solving practical tasks together,
as here where a drain ring is manoeuvred into place. The children look
on in the background.</I> </P>

<H3><B>The formal beginning</B> </H3>

<P>At the end of the 3-month sadhana course a talk takes place between
the teacher and the student who has decided to join the education. If this
interview is to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, then the student
commits him/herself to be part of the education, and the teacher commits
himself to accept and teach the student according to the conditions outlined
in this paper. </P>

<P>The education will then take place in one of the city Schools and/or
at H&aring;&aring; Course Center. </P>

<H3><B>Four aspects form a whole</B> </H3>

<P>The Yoga Teacher Education is based on four aspects of the tradition.
It is a practical and theoretical education with training in a group as
well as individu-ally. Naturally it all starts with one's own use of yoga
and meditation, </P>

<P>followed up by advice and guidance from the teacher. In addition, there
is a less tangible training of wisdom according to the secret, oral or
whispered tradition - a tradition that will not and cannot be written down.
It can only be passed directly from teacher to pupil, and only to one who
is responsive. </P>

<P>The four aspects are: </P>

<P><B>1. Communication </B></P>

<P>The ability to be present in every situation, to meet life with initiative
and receptivity, contrary to when one hides behind expectations and mythologies
about other worlds, behind astrology or religious fanaticism. To be able
to devote oneself to the present moment, without demanding that the conditions
or the people first have to be different, ideal or formally correct and
without creating a distance through an overbearing attitude. </P>

<P>This ability to be open, whether confronting a situation, a person,
or a group of people - is not reached through many of the modern therapies.
Often the personality is only hardened or hypnotised, making it able to
&quot;cope&quot;, but less capable of accepting and joining life as such.
</P>

<P>The education is based on the reality in <B>daily life</B>, where in
the long run it is impossible to agree upon rules of the game. In daily
life, after all, one has to count on oneself, with heart and brain. The
education takes place when we teach or are being taught but, first of all,
it happens in the work and the communal life (<I>ashram</I>), in the Yoga
Schools and at the Course Center. </P>

<P><B>2. Experience and Knowledge</B> </P>

<P>You develop knowledge of body, mind and energy<B> </B>through using
the yoga exercises and the meditations. This experience is followed up
by the relevant aspects of physiology, anatomy and the scientific investigations
into yoga and meditation - and, naturally, by a study of the original source
material of yoga. </P>

<P><B>3. Karma Yoga</B> </P>

<P>The ability to engage whole-heartedly and with energy in the daily chores,
however big or small. One learns to take responsibility and to be consistent
in the carrying out of a task (see more on Karma Yoga below). </P>

<P><B>4. Self-knowledge </B></P>

<P>To awaken and train consciousness - to stay aware - is among the most
important and essential requirements in the tradition. The ability to experience
is the foundation for health and insight. </P>

<P>Tantra teaches us to let go, to join in, to act and to experience ourselves
in the whole. Through meditation we realise our real identity. It gives
meaning and perspective to life. </P>

<P><I>Can the pose be improved a little more? Correcting the Shoulderstand
during a 14 days course at H&aring;&aring;. </I></P>

<H3><B>An outline of the education</B> </H3>

<P>The year is divided into three teaching seasons, all of which consist
of roughly four months each. </P>

<P>In the summer, the Schools in the cities are open most of the time,
but the teachers and aspirants also spend time travelling, teaching at
holiday resorts and at H&aring;&aring; Course Center, as well as solving
individual tasks. At H&aring;&aring;, they either take part in a retreat
or help in running the retreats. </P>

<P>The rest of the year (September - December and January - April), the
Yoga teacher classes provide theoretical as well as practical insights
into yoga. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="25_YLA4.JPG" tppabs="http://inet.uni-c.dk/~bindu/25_yla4.jpg" HEIGHT=113 WIDTH=169></P>

<P><I>It is not enough to be a good yoga teacher. One also has to know
something about how a brochure is put together, such as here at the light
table in the school's layout room in H&aring;&aring;.</I> </P>

<H3><B>Modules</B> </H3>

<P>The subjects of some of the classes are grouped in the form of <B>modules</B>.
One major module and other minor ones are dealt with between September
and April. All modules are covered in 4 years. </P>

<P><B>The four major modules</B> <B>are:</B> </P>

<P><B>1.</B> <I>Hatha Yoga</I> cleansing processes<I>,</I> including<I>
tratak</I> (a concentration technique). <I>Asanas,</I> the physical yoga
poses and their effect on body mind and psyche. <I>Yoga therapy, </I>which
involves both the traditional knowledge of the yogis as well as current
medical research on yoga; how yoga can be used as a healing method. </P>

<P><B>2.</B><I> </I>The cleansing of energy flows, the awakening and use
of psychic energy, involving<I> Pranayama</I> (breathing exercises); <I>Mudras</I>
and <I>Bandhas</I> (attitudes and locks); <I>Prana Vidya</I> (&quot;knowledge
of energy&quot; - a healing method)<I>.</I> The physical and psychosomatic
benefits of <I>Pranayama</I>. The balancing of the communication of the
two brain halves and more. </P>

<P><B>3.</B> Yogic relaxation in theory and practice, mainly based on the
different structures and variations of <I>Yoga Nidra</I> (yogic deep relaxation),
and<I> </I>on <I>Savasana</I> (lying dead still) as well as on the methods
of overcoming influences (<I>Pratyahara</I>). The latter happens through
awareness, acceptance and confrontation, as well as through relaxation
and meditation techniques. </P>

<P><B>4.</B> Concentration, <I>Dharana</I>; <I>Tratak</I> (inner and outer)
and<I> </I>visualisations (see part two: A Module). </P>

<P><B>Other subjects</B> that are covered in the same four years in connection
with the main subjects are: </P>

<P>a) <I>Fundamental Concepts of yoga</I>; <BR>
b) <I>Tantra, attitude and practices</I>; <BR>
c) <I>Original or classical texts</I>; <BR>
d) <I>Songs and dances from different parts of the world, with emphasis
on Kirtan</I> (singing of <I>Mantra</I>); <BR>
e) <I>Scientific research on yoga and meditation</I> (research done in
the School as well as studies of reports from elsewhere); <BR>
f) basic <I>anatomy</I> and <I>physiology</I>; <BR>
g) <I>Yoga for pregnant women</I>; </P>

<P>and more... </P>

<P><I>Meditation: </I>most teachings on meditation take place in the Yoga
Teacher Seminars and the retreats at H&aring;&aring; Course Center (see
below), in Satsang with Swami Janakananda, in Antar Mauna courses at the
larger Schools, as well as in individual guidance and practice. </P>

<H3><B>Classes</B> </H3>

<P>The aspirant takes part in three yoga teacher classes every week. Each
class is of about two hours duration. The subjects are: </P>

<P><B>1.</B> <I>The pedagogic and practice of yoga. </I>Here the teacher-aspirant
teaches the other yoga teachers and receives constructive feedback. He
or she is taught the structure of the different yoga programmes, and learns
how to teach different levels of students, the content of each class, as
well as learning how to progress from week to week, and from season to
season. </P>

<P><B>2.</B> <I>The past week...</I> Through questions and reports from
the teaching of the ordinary classes in the School, the aspirant continuously
receives the nec-essary guidance as the education progresses (see also
below, the first year). </P>

<P><B>3.</B> Each of the above-mentioned four<I> modules </I>is presented
through: </P>

<P><B>a.</B> Source material in the form of texts. </P>

<P><B>b.</B> Scientific reports. </P>

<P><B>c.</B> Practical classes in the methods pertaining to the subjects
of the current module. </P>

<P><B>d.</B> Individual practice and experience of the methods listed in
relation to the module. </P>

<P>Every week one also attends the group meditations and participates as
a student or an assistant teacher in the yoga and/or meditation clas-ses
for the general public taught by the more experienced teachers of the School.
</P>

<P>Every season Swami Janakananda gives Satsang in the different ashrams
- and teaches Antar Mauna courses (see also the previous issue of Bindu),
in which the aspirant participates. </P>

<H3><B>Karma Yoga </B></H3>

<P>An indispensable part of the education and training is Karma Yoga. It
involves working together and communicating with the other yoga teachers
in running a Yoga School, including all tasks that it involves, such as
writing, learning to use and work with computers, making lay-outs, printing
and distributing brochures, creating our magazine <I>Bindu</I>, keeping
the gift shop and communicating with pupils, administration, planning courses,
food preparation, cleaning, book-keeping, caring for and training our horses,
farming and gardening, forestry work, construction work, looking after
the children of our students during classes on the residential courses,
counselling and, of course, teaching. </P>

<P><I>&quot;Karma Yoga trains your aware-ness and boosts your energy. It
is easy to intellectu-ally know what to do and how to handle a situation
or a task, but what happens in practice? Are you able to break with old
habits and limiting influences? You will know this through committing yourself
to Karma Yoga. </I></P>

<P><I>The attitude of Karma Yoga is essential for a yoga teacher. You do
what is necessary and you learn not to be self-concerned. There should
be no ulterior motives for teaching yoga. I expect the pupils to say good-bye
when they leave, but I do not expect them to thank me. This does not mean
that there is a lack of communication... </I></P>

<P><I>The ashram forms a good foundation for imparting Karma Yoga in practice.&quot;
</I>(Mira, leader of the School in Stockholm) </P>

<P><I>&quot;In the Yoga teacher education we work practically with abilities
essential for good leadership: </I><B>Overview </B><I>by handling various
kinds of tasks, </I><B>intuition</B><I> through personal practice, training
in </I><B>communication</B><I> and a conscious relationship to </I><B>responsibility</B><I>.
The training is not laid down in advance, but evolves as a personal course
according to capacities and skills - in the same way as the dynamics of
a sound organisation. </I></P>

<P><I>Actually, I experience that the education touches upon an essence
behind it all, which goes deeper than theory of leadership and communication
analysis. It is the spontaneous ability </I><B>to be present and act</B><I>
in a given situation without having a motive. Para-doxically this attitude
does not connect with a society built on competition - a leader for no
reason at all...&quot;</I> (Uri, a yoga teacher under education) </P>

<P><IMG SRC="25_YLA5.JPG" tppabs="http://inet.uni-c.dk/~bindu/25_yla5.jpg" HEIGHT=187 WIDTH=257></P>

<P><I>The school continuously collaborates with doctors and researchers
on scientific research on yoga and meditation. Here a teacher is being
measured at the University Clinic in Cologne. EEG, breath, blood pressure,
and other data, are gathered in a computer for later evaluation.</I> </P>

<H3><B>Yoga Teacher Seminars</B> </H3>

<P><I>A fundamental part of the education is four yearly Yoga Teacher Seminars
at H&aring;&aring; Course Center:</I> two weeks in May, two weeks in August/September,
a weekend in October and two and a half weeks in December. </P>

<P>These seminars are guided by Swami Janakananda together with experienced
yoga teachers from the different branches of the School. </P>

<P>Since we have students in the group not only from the Scandinavian countries
but from other countries as well, the common language is English. </P>

<P>Apart from the general practices of yoga, meditation and Satsangs, each
seminar has a main topic or theme, around which classes and discussions
take place. </P>

<P>The seminars are quite intensive and serve to strengthen the meditation
and insights of the individual teachers - they also function as a &quot;cleansing
process&quot; at the end of each season. They allow the teachers to more
thoroughly let go of the<I> </I>influences and tensions collected during
the busy work of teaching in the various Schools - to again and again recharge,
center oneself and reaffirm the perspectives of the work we are doing.
Therefore only a few hours each day are dedicated to strictly &quot;theoretical&quot;
classes. </P>

<P>During these seminars, the individual's practice of yoga and meditation
is valued. Each day starts with <I>Kriya Yoga</I> practice in the meditation
hall (which is also the case for daily life in the Schools), and followed
up by one or two yoga classes during the day. In the evening apart from
talks and discussions, there are group meditations, and sometimes kirtan
(music and dance). </P>

<P>The teachers and teacher aspirants from all the ashrams meet and exchange
experiences. Furthermore, the education is co-ordinated here for each season
between the School's different branches. We also work together with various
practical tasks, e.g. the production of our magazine <I>Bindu,</I> as well
as keeping the Course Center in shape<I>.</I> </P>

<P>People come and go, and some of the independent teachers who have finished
their formal education keep returning to the Yoga Teacher Seminars in H&aring;&aring;.
But the size of the proper yoga teacher group has remained stable for the
last 15 years, around 35 to 40 people. With this size the intensity is
kept and everyone knows each other. Swami Janakananda, as the teacher,
is able to communicate with and give every aspirant a personal, thorough
and deep-going training. </P>

<H3><B>Guest teachers</B> </H3>

<P>From time to time medical doctors and other researchers from the fields
of psychology have been invited as guest teachers on the Yoga teacher education,
mostly at our <I>Yoga Teacher Seminars</I>. Courses have been conducted
with Roop Verma in the type of Nada Yoga taught to and practised by Indian
musicians. Other courses held include one in the Tantric Yantra given by
the Indian Tantric painter Sohan Qadri; Sufi dancing (see picture); African
drumming and dancing. Recently we had an intensive course in time management,
conflict resolution, and communication with Robyn Taylor, a highly qualified
teacher from Australia. </P>

<P>Scheduled for this season is a speech pedagogue and a neuro-psychologist;
and in the spring a medical doctor from Australia with yoga therapy as
his speciality. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="25_YLA6.JPG" tppabs="http://inet.uni-c.dk/~bindu/25_yla6.jpg" HEIGHT=136 WIDTH=92><IMG SRC="25_YLA7.JPG" tppabs="http://inet.uni-c.dk/~bindu/25_yla7.jpg" HEIGHT=135 WIDTH=176></P>

<P><I>Ajit Mookerjee, who has written many books on Tantric art, and Jabrane
Sebnat, a Moroccan Sufi master, are just two of the guest teachers the
yoga teacher group has met at H&aring;&aring; over the years.</I> </P>

<H3><B>Four years: </B></H3>

<P><B>The first year</B> is preceded by participation in the 3-month course
in H&aring;&aring;, from January to April. After the course, the aspirant
remains living in H&aring;&aring; providing back-up for the summer courses.
When the summer is over he or she moves to one of the other ashrams in
the cities: Stockholm, Copenhagen, &Aring;rhus, Hannover etc. or continues
to live at H&aring;&aring; Course Center. (Often part of the training is
to move to another ashram after living a year or two in one place - and
perhaps later, to a third one.) There the aspirants take part in the daily
work and attend the yoga teacher classes. </P>

<P><I>Sadhana:</I> One's own independent yoga and meditation practice is
part of the daily routine of every year, for the duration of the education.
</P>

<P><I>Teaching practice:</I> One starts to teach one or two beginner classes
during this year under the guidance of an experienced teacher. </P>

<P>In <B>the second year</B> the individual practice of the aspirants is
continued, deepened and stabilised further. The yoga teacher classes are
continued. The aspirants begin to teach more classes and assume responsibilities
in the various Karma Yoga tasks. During the summer, they help at H&aring;&aring;
and take part in one of the 14-day courses there. </P>

<P>During <B>the third year</B> the activities remain the same. Now the
aspirant has gained experience and assumes more responsibility in the running
of the School, in administration and planning, with the education and in
teaching and guiding others. </P>

<P><B>The fourth year</B> is like the third year. The aspirants now start
to prepare to teach meditation. After the fourth year, they have more and
more opportunities to teach meditation. </P>

<P>Naturally the education varies according to individual needs and wishes,
motivation and abilities. A yoga teacher education alone, however, is no
guarantee, it is up to the individual - or said with the words of Swami
Satyananda <I>&quot;yoga does not liberate you, that you do yourself&quot;</I>.

while the picture on the right is from a teaching situation at the same
place.</I> </P>

<H3><B>International Events</B> </H3>

<P>From time to time, starting with the International Convention in Monghyr
in 1973, groups of teachers travel and participate in international yoga
conventions under the auspices of <I>The International Yoga Fellowship
Movement</I>. In 1977, the School itself arranged such a convention: <I>Yoga,
Meditation &acute;77</I> under the patronage of Swami Satyananda. A group
of teachers visited Swami Satyananda in Deoghar in 1994 and another group
participated in a convention held in Bogota in 1995, to name a few. </P>

<P>Groups of teachers and aspirants have also participated in several festivals
such as <I>Body, Mind and Spirit</I> in London, New York, Copenhagen, Oslo,
Stockholm and other cities. </P>

<H3><B>Ashram - a way of living</B> </H3>

<P>We, the majority of the yoga teachers, do not call ourselves sannyasins
(initiates) and only a few of us have received a swami initiation over
the years. At present 12 out of 38 participants have received new names.
This is based on a personal resolution and is not required in order to
be part of the ashram or education. The life we lead, however, is as intense
as and is consistent with that of a sannyasin, in a joyful balance between
the inner life supported by meditation, and the life in society as active
and creative teachers. Titles and outer rituals do not seem to matter much
to the Nordic people; what counts is a meaningful lifestyle and the way
we explore our potentials (<I>sadhana</I>). </P>

<P>Many of us have had valuable training and communication with Swami Janakananda
for more than 12 years. We are now seen as teachers and preceptors rather
than students, running the various Schools in co-operation with each other.
Others have, after many years in the School, created independent schools
or are teaching on their own. </P>

<P>Single individuals, as well as families with children, live in the Schools.
</P>

<P>There are also people living and participating in the ashram who do
not want to become yoga teachers but who wish to devote a period of their
lives to sadhana, where they can work with yoga and meditation in the best
possible environment. </P>

<P>Many of the teachers' initial motive for joining the School was, in
fact, to live in a place where sadhana was part of daily life. Little by
little, however, they began to see the usefulness and sense in teaching
yoga to others. </P>

<H3><B>Economy</B> </H3>

<P>Concerning the expenses for the education: The fee for the 3-month course
and an ordinary two weeks course in 1996 is 17.500 Swedish crowns (aprox
in &pound;1700 and in US$2650), and 4.500 Sw. Cr. (&pound;440, US$685)
respectively, while the two weeks Yoga Teacher Seminar in H&aring;&aring;
costs at present (May 1996) 1.800 Sw.Cr. (&pound;175, US$273). The yoga
teacher classes cost approx. 1.800 Sw.Cr. per year, and added to that is
the cost of living, accommodation and food, which is now approx. 2.000
Sw.Cr. (&pound;195, US$300) per month. These are the standard fees but
they may vary somewhat from person to person and between the different
branches of the School. </P>

<P>The reason for the fees being so low is that one lives an integrated
life in the ashram. With higher costs, one would probably have obligations
elsewhere, without time to spare, and it would be impossible to receive
a comprehensive training and education. </P>

<P>Personal growth cannot be measured in terms of money or time. Time and
motivation, however, make it possible to obtain substantial and consistent
guidance according to a tradition that is alive and timeless. </P>

<H3><B>Perspective</B> </H3>

<P>The education actually has three objectives: </P>

<P>That the teachers, once they have finished their education, can work
independently and use the knowledge and experience of the rich Tantric
yoga and meditation tradition in their own lives as well as passing it
on to others. </P>

<P>That they have been rooted so firmly that they can carry out their work
without being overcome by the fear, doubt and faintheartedness which one
often encounters in society and which we see limiting the way many yoga
teachers teach around the world. </P>

<P>And last but not least, that the teachers through the education, the
training and their sadhana have received both tools and a perspective on
life, which make it possible for the spiritual and the mundane, the inner
and the outer, to merge in a natural and harmonious unity </P>

<P>- a good basis for a life full of inspiration and meaning. </P>
