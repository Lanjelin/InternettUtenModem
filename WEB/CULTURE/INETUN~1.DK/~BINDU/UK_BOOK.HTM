</TD><TD VALIGN="Top"><H4>Swami Janakananda's book in a revised and extended
edition
(Rider Books, UK and Weiser, USA)
</H4><P>

This book offers
an alternative to the way many books deal with
yoga, when they maintain the misunderstanding that one must take
on a new life style to use yoga and meditation.
<P>
Swami Janakananda does not only stress the practical side of yoga
and meditation in this book, but shares the Tantric wisdom and
view, that gives you the freedom to practise yoga and meditation
entirely on your own terms.
<P>
Many attempts have been made to explain yoga from a scholarly
or religious viewpoint. This book instead describes yoga from
within, based on the author's own understanding - from a yogi's
point of view. Yoga has, through many thousands of years, developed
into a system that deals with human development and health. We
find traces of yoga from the past on earth's various continents.
Today yoga and meditation are both one of the most used alternative
therapy forms in many countries, and a basis for an active and
creative life for many people.
<P>
As you follow the exercises in this book, you will realise that
yoga is based on a profound knowledge of human nature: A knowledge
not limited to any age, life-style or nationality. It is the fruit
of a living tradition, where knowledge is passed directly from
teacher to student, from generation to generation. Step by step
you are guided through the subject, and in a practical manner
you can benefit from the different poses, breathing exercises,
meditations and the Tantric sexual yoga.
<H3>A readers recommendation
</H3><P>
"I am writing this letter to tell you how pleased I am with
the book 'Yoga, Tantra and Meditation in Daily Life'. I have also
recently bought the tape 'Yoga Nidra'. I am very pleased of what
I saw and heard. I have read many yoga books and tried to follow
them, but they were not filled with much information. Your book
tends to go into more detail about each asana, breathing exercise
and meditation. Many of my friends didn't understand yoga until
I showed them your book and they found it very fascinating. Personally,
I have tried different kinds of exercises such as weight lifting
which afterwards made me feel very tired and sore. I also tried
Tai Chi, which is similar to yoga and meditation, but I found
out that yoga gives a better overall relaxing effect than Tai
Chi. I have only been doing yoga for about eight months, but I
am inspired by yoga more and more each day. I have been doing
the classical poses in the 'Yoga, Tantra and Meditation' book
now for a few months. In closing, I would like to thank you for
the wonderful material and some day I would like to travel to
Sweden and go to your school.
<P>
<I>Sincerely, </I>
