<HR WIDTH="100%">Part two - <B>A Module</B> </H1>

<P>The following is only an example of a module, a sketch. The modules
exist in writing in the diaries of the aspirants and teachers. We are at
the moment organising the material, based on the first 26 years of teaching
of the Scandinavian Yoga and Meditation School. </P>

<P>We have chosen a module that we call <I>Concentration/Dharana. Dharana</I>
can be defined as a capacity to hold a concept or picture in the mind for
a certain length of time. A few years ago, we worked with this module from
September to April. During that period we also worked with three other
modules: <I>Yoga-therapy</I>, <I>Yoga Nidra</I> and <I>Fundamental concepts
of yoga</I>. </P>

<P>Every day for 6 months out of this period everyone practised Tratak
individually, a concentration technique where heart of the practice involves
gazing at the flame of a candle. This we did for 20 minutes, followed by
10 minutes of lying on the back in Dead Still (<I>Savasana</I>). On the
Yoga Teacher Seminars in H&aring;&aring;, we also did Inner Tratak, guided
by Swami Janakananda. The experience we derived from these practices was
used as a basis in our theoretical classes and discussions. This period
of intense practice of Tratak, among other things, gave us a knowledge,
which was confirmed when we afterwards turned to the yoga literature to
study this in theory. </P>

<P>We examined Concentration/Dharana from different angles, from: </P>

<P>1. Own experience. <BR>
2. Our tradition, the lineage of teachers <BR>
3. Original yogic and Tantric texts <BR>
4. Scientific reports, articles and modern literature </P>

<P>We have chosen to describe this with a number of questions: </P>

<P>What is the purpose of doing Outer Tratak? </P>

<P>How does it influence the state of the brain? </P>

<P>What do we know from our own experience of the influence of Tratak on
our capacities? </P>

<P>What does the yoga literature tell us about this? </P>

<P>What is the relationship between relaxation and concentration? </P>

<P>Is one possible without the other? </P>

<P>Which yoga exercises support and enhance concentration? </P>

<P>Which breathing exercise, done right before Tratak, strengthens its
effect? </P>

<P>How can Tratak increase the awareness in, and the benefit of, Yoga Nidra?
</P>

<P>What do we understand by the word concentration in daily language? </P>

<P>How does it influence our state in everyday life when we practice Tratak
daily? </P>

<P>What experiences did the yoga teachers have individually? </P>

<P>How did it help different students (case histories)? </P>

<P>What is Inner Tratak, which practices or symbols does it contain, how
is it composed, and to what purpose? </P>

<P>How can Inner Tratak be made easy, so the student can learn to visualize?
</P>

<P>What is Dharana - is it just concentration? </P>

<P>Is Dharana the capacity to hold a vision in the mind for some time?
And in that case, what is the purpose? </P>

<P>What Dharana methods do you know? </P>

<P>Are concentration and awareness two different things? </P>

<P>What is the purpose of different concentration practices:<BR>
Gazing at the eyebrow center. <BR>
Gazing at the nose-tip. <BR>
Physical concentration on the chakras.<BR>
Mental concentration on the chakras.<BR>
Visualisation on the yantras of the chakras. </P>

<P>Where is consciousness located, when you concentrate on a chakra? </P>

<P>From where do you experience it? </P>

<P>Are there several possibilities? </P>

<P>What scientific research has been done on the effects of the various
concentration practices: </P>

<P>In medicine? </P>

<P>In psychology? </P>

<P>(For example, at present we are co-operating in a research with medical
doctors in Sweden, which may show how tratak - together with other yoga
practices - may influence the production of the hormone <I>melatonin</I>,
and thus our biorhythms and biological clock. </P>

<P>What do the different cultures tell us about concentration and visualisation:
the Celts; the Amazon Indians and their superior way of teaching; the Maya
literature; the ancient Egyptian Culture? Initiation rites and concentration
in different cultures. </P>

<P>What is the relationship between the Tratak practice and a personal
Psychic Symbol? </P>

<P>The use of concentration and visualisation in the meditations from the
tantric tradition, as taught by Swami Satyananda, the teacher of Swami
Janakananda. </P>

<P>What literature can we use in this context - from India, Japan, China
and Tibet - and relevant books of psychology and physiology? </P>

<P><I>Look at a candle... </I></P>

<P><I>then close your eyes. </I></P>

<P><I>Forget the darkness around you and look at the red glow on your eyelids.
</I></P>

<P><I>Look intensely on the violet colour. </I></P>

<P><I>Meditate upon it and imagine that it becomes larger and larger. </I></P>

<P><I>See a soft shining ocean of violet light around you. </I></P>

<P><I>You are a wave of light, a ripple of peace on the surface of the
ocean. </I></P>

<P><I>Now pay attention to what is happening. </I></P>

<P><I>You are a tiny ripple, whirling around on the surface of an ocean
of light. </I></P>

<P><I>Your tiny life is a part of that Life, which pervades everything.
</I></P>

<P><I>As your meditation deepens, you, the tiny ripple of peace, become
the vast ocean of peace itself. </I></P>

<P><I>Meditate on the thought: &quot; I am a wave of peace.&quot; Feel
the enormous sea just below your consciousness. The wave must feel the
nourishing life of the vast ocean under itself.</I> </P>

<P>(Meditation from Swami Yogananda's Metaphysical Meditations). </P>
