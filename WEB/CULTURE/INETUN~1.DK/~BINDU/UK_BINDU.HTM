Bindu - periodical on Yoga - Tantra - Meditation</H3>

<P>Bindu is published by Scandinavian Yoga and Meditation School. We started
releasing Bindu again in 1993 with the ambition of publishing four issues
per year. But as we also need time to teach, and at the same time do not
want to reduce the quality of Bindu, it is more manageable for us with
two issues per year. Bindu is available in english, german, swedish and
danish.</P>

<P>Bindu is based on voluntary work at all levels, from writing and photography
to printing.</P>

<P>Every second month (next time 1. April) we change the number of Bindu
that you may <A HREF="#ReadNow">read here</A>. If you <A HREF="mailto:haa.course.center@pp.microbus.se">send
us your full name, adress and country</A>, we will send you a free copy
of the latest issue of Bindu.</P>
