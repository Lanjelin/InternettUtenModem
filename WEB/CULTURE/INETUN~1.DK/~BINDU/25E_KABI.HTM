- four poems</H1>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT></B> Brother! when I was forgetful, my true
Guru showed me the Way. <BR>
Then I left off all rites and ceremonies, I bathed no more in the holy
water: <BR>
Then I learned that it was alone I who was mad, and the whole world beside
me was sane; and I had disturbed these wise people. <BR>
From that time forth I knew no more how to roll in the dust in obeisance:
<BR>
I do not ring the temple bell: <BR>
I do not set the idol on its throne: <BR>
I do not worship the image with flowers. <BR>
It is not the austerities that mortify the flesh which are pleasing to
the Lord, <BR>
When you leave off your clothes and kill your senses, you do not please
the Lord: <BR>
The man who is kind and who practises righteousness, who remains passive
amidst the affairs of the world, who considers all creatures on earth as
his own self, <BR>
He attains Immortal Being, the true God is ever with him. <BR>
Kabir says: “He attains the true Name who’s words are pure, and who is
free from pride and conceit.”</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>O</FONT></B> Man, if thou dost not know thine own Lord,
whereof art thou so proud? <BR>
Put the cleverness away: mere words shall never unite thee to Him. <BR>
Do not deceive thyself with the witness of the Scriptures: <BR>
Love is something other than this, and he <BR>
who has sought it truly has found it. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>B</FONT></B>etween the poles of the conscious and the
unconscious, there has the mind made a swing: <BR>
Thereon hang all beings and all worlds, and that swing never ceases its
sway. <BR>
Millions of beings are there: the sun and the moon in there courses are
there: <BR>
Millions of ages pass, and the swing goes on. <BR>
All swing! the sky and the earth and the air and the water; and the Lord
Himself taking form: <BR>
And the sight of this has made Kabir a servant.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Y</FONT></B>our Lord is within you, <BR>
Like fragrance in the flowers. <BR>
Why, like a musk deer <BR>
Are you searching for musk <BR>
in the grass <BR>
again and again?</P>

<P>Kabir was born 1440, according to himself “at once the child of Allah
and Ram” (Islam and Hinduisme). </P>
