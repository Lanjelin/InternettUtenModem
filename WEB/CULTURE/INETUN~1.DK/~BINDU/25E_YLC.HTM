<P>What makes a yoga (and meditation) teacher? What is the goal of a yoga
teacher? What is a good yoga teacher? What should comprise an education
or training for a yoga teacher? </P>

<P>Can a yoga teacher be afraid of standing on his/her head? Can s/he be
scared of pranayama (yogic breathing exercises) or meditation? No of course
not if the persons in question use these things themselves - and also have
their experiences confirmed by scientific research. </P>

<P>Unfortunately we cannot do anything about superficiality, fear and ignorance,
but it is damaging to the reputation, name and quality of yoga that certain
educations are short and sometimes even blended with all sorts of other
things that diffuse intensity and concentration. To mix other things in
a yoga teacher education takes up space and time and blurs the view of
the inherent possibilities of the yoga tradition, which after all is based
on thousands of years of testing and experience. </P>

<P>Without a firm basis, insufficiently educated teachers have the tendency
to dilute yoga so that it is unrecognisable and without the desired effects;
they themselves often stop teaching after only a few years. </P>

<H3><B>Some sad examples out of many</B> </H3>

<P><I>&quot;What you don't know, or what you know through theory alone,
that you fear.&quot;</I> (Swami Janakananda) </P>

<P>We have had some students from Germany, who have told us that their
first yoga teachers would not teach them the headstand, and told horror
stories about pranayama. </P>

<P>There are a few yoga teachers in Denmark who talk about &quot;Safe Yoga&quot;;
they pride themselves on not teaching &quot;dangerous&quot; (their word)
yoga practices. Some, for instance, have mentioned nose cleansing, <I>Neti</I>,
which today is recommended by many private doctors and is used against
allergy in several major hospitals in Sweden. In an extensive study on
soldiers from the German army at the Medical College, Hannover, <I>Neti</I>
was found to be &quot;an excellent preventive remedy against colds&quot;.
</P>

<P>We have received letters from many people in the USA who are desperate
because they can not find a yoga teacher with quality in the area where
they live. They ask us if we know of a yoga teacher there, who teaches
on similar lines to Swami Satyananda and Swami Janakananda. All they find
is some kind of yoga gymnastics/aerobics or yoga that you cannot do, unless
you have different kinds of cushions, furniture and tools (also see the
editorial). </P>

<P>In one of the largest Swedish cities, some of our students have complained
of the incompetent teaching they were exposed to by teachers who apparently
had only a superficial education and no real personal practice or training.
Because of such teachers, the students were disappointed with yoga and
lost interest. Some of them gave it a second try, however, came to one
of our courses and felt the difference. </P>

<P>As Swami Janakananda puts it: <I>&quot;What kind of teaching would you
want to get if you were reborn, let's say, 200 years from now? Wouldn't
you want to be able to find a teacher who has trodden the path him(her)self.
Wouldn't you want to be able to recognise the essence in yoga through his
or her teaching?&quot;</I> </P>

<P>Franz, one of the senior yoga teachers:<I> &quot;A yoga teacher education
of 1-4 months seems unrealistic. What kind of background do those who follow
this kind of education have? If they have never done yoga before or only
done a little, it is totally inadequate. And even though they may have
a great deal of experience of yoga, there is the question of whether they
can be prepared to teach others in such a short time. Does the &quot;teacher&quot;
following this kind of &quot;diploma education&quot; have the possibility
of a lineage of teachers to fall back upon and get advice from in their
work with other human beings? How are they tested under adverse teaching
circumstances? Do they, as compensation to real guidance, form &quot;coffee
or tea&quot; clubs, where limiting fear and superstition grow?&quot;</I>
</P>

<P>The late Swami Vishnudevananda, in an open letter to yoga teachers:
<I>&quot;This is the tradition of yoga, a great spiritual tradition in
danger of being polluted by the commercial concerns of those individuals
wishing to market yoga by forming professional yoga associations... The
&quot;3 year course&quot;</I> [formed by a national association in a European
country] <I>involves two days of five hours every two weeks, equalling
a total teacher/student involvement of 360 hours in three years - if the
student and teacher come for all the classes. ... The &quot;3 year course&quot;
title fools the public by making a false comparison. Actually the classes
are held only every second weekend. This dispersed instruction does not
demand the regulated and disciplined life of yoga, nor does it offer the
implied professional training of three years in university, where one must
work hard every day in order to gain professional certification. ... The
attitude of such yoga associations can only be understood in terms of commercial
self-interest. They are not founded on the wisdom of the guru-disciple
lineage, the ancient yoga tradition in which the disciple's spiritual wealth
is inherited from the teacher.</I>&quot; </P>

<P>It is our responsibility as yoga teachers to keep the standard of the
Yoga teacher education high. </P>

<P>It is not a question of producing as many yoga teachers as possible.
That might even strangle the tradition. We can only hope that those who
teach on such a small basis, out of fear of the unknown or jealousy of
those who went ahead, one day do not prevent the real yogis carrying on
the undiluted tradition. </P>

<P>It is a question of quality and genuineness, of what each yoga teacher
is able to give his or her students. It needs not only facts, theory and
philosophy, but time, dedication and patience. </P>

<P><I>&quot;This is not about proving one's capability <BR>
but of remaining in contact with one self <BR>
and from one self <BR>
being together with others.&quot;</I> <BR>
(Swami Janakananda) </P>

<P>A good yoga teacher is not good because he (or she) is ambitious or
clever. S/He knows the methods of yoga by experience, and has experienced
a personal training and growth, that is true, but it is the realisation
of <I>the attitude</I> of yoga that gives it depth. </P>

<P>S/He is self-reliant, but seeks the guidance of the teacher or guru
to cope with the illusions of life - s/he follows an unbroken tradition.
S/He is on the way to wisdom. </P>

<P>This person has dropped many masks and much role playing. He (or she)
stands &quot;naked&quot; in front of the students, has acquired the psychic
and spiritual dimensions needed to teach the methods of yoga and meditation,
and has become a good medium with enough sensitivity to pick up the needs
of others and inspire them to self-realisation, rather than being a preacher
and indoctrinating people in <I>any mythology what so ever</I>. </P>

<P>Such a teacher can tease or trick his students out of self-involvement,
depressions or preconceptions - s/he can help them on their way by pricking
holes in their balloons of pride, in their bubbles of idealism and enthusiasm.
</P>

<P>No one is perfect - or maybe we all are in our diversity - and we do
not see perfectionism as an aim in itself, but the further you have gone
yourself the further you can lead your students. </P>

<P>In discussing the yoga teacher education, we are faced with a dilemma.
On the one hand, we want to share the wonderful tools of yoga with as many
as possible. On the other hand, we must ask how fast, short, superficial
or &quot;safe&quot; can a yoga teacher education be before it becomes irresponsible
and turns its back on thousands of years of tradition and the experience
of countless generations? In that case it should be given another label.
