<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Don't expect to arrive at a hotel and be waited
upon...&quot; With these thoughts I departed for my first yoga course in
H&aring;&aring; many years ago. I had read a few books and was expecting
to sleep on primitive straw mats in a cold dormitory, and sit on a wooden
floor with a simple bowl of rice for lunch. To my surprise, H&aring;&aring;
Course Center did not live up to these ascethic/romantic expectations -
our rooms were comfortably furnished, there was a sauna and a dining room
with inviting round tables. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Inner knowledge and mystical experiences are not associated
with any outer form - I realised that quite quickly. </FONT></P>

<H3><B>Interplay</B> </H3>

<P>At H&aring;&aring;, the visitor finds an interplay of many things that
make a transformation possible. Firstly, what happens in the yoga room:
yoga and breathing exercises and the Tantric meditations Ajapa Japa and
Antar Mauna. This is the core around which everything else develops. But
not everything happens in the yoga room... </P>

<P>&quot;<I>Something or other feels different here</I>,&quot; was the
initial comment of a student from Berlin, when he got off the bus at H&aring;&aring;
after a long journey, and looked at the surroundings. The silence at the
course center could almost be felt physically. </P>

<P>Just being in an ashram has an effect. It allows you to take a pause
from the daily influences and habitual patterns of thoughts and attitudes.
Modern psychology would describe it as <BR>
de-automatisation. Clearing out the head and mind to be able to open new
doors. </P>

<P>The purpose of a course, or retreat, is to give you the time and possibility
to go deep within yourself and, with the aid of yoga and meditation methods,
to ex-plore your own resources. The clarity, energy and creativity discovered
during this period can be taken home to daily life. The sequence of a day
at the course center is intense and diverse - yoga and breathing exercises
in the morning - karma yoga in the kitchen, in the garden or with the horses
- relaxation (Yoga Nidra) and meditation (Ajapa Japa) - varied vegetarian
food, mostly from the Center's own ecological farm - freetime - yoga and
meditation (Antar Mauna) in the late afternoon - lecture, kirtan/music/dance
or meditation in the evening. </P>

<P>Freetime in the afternoons in the Swedish nature is an essential part
of a residential course at H&aring;&aring;. Indoors there is a sauna and
a specially constructed relaxation tank (The Pyramid), in which you - free
from all sense impressions - float &quot;weightlessly&quot; in water. The
surrounding forests invite long strolls, and there is horseriding in the
fields and the forests (for both beginners and experienced riders). The
Center has canoes for use on the nearby lake, where it is possible to go
swimming in the summer and ice skating in the winter. </P>

<P>The teachers leading the courses each have a minimum of 14 years teaching
experience; many have more. As a participant, you can be certain of having
a teacher with a genuine personal knowledge of the meditations he/she teaches.
(Read also the article on the yoga teacher education.) Those assisting
on the course, whether it be in the kitchen, the fields or the stables,
are people who live in the ashram and who work with yoga and meditation
themselves. They are familiar with what happens in the yoga room, and most
of them are also yoga teachers under training. </P>

<P>The courses, which are held all year round, are international. Participants
come from Australia, Poland, Germany, USA, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, England,
from the whole of Scandinavia, etc., and therefore the teaching is conducted
mostly in English. (If necessary, translation of some languages can be
provided.) Due to the large number of participants from Germany, there
is a 14 days course every year with German as the main language. </P>

<P>There is a wide range of courses: from weekend courses and 10 and 14
days courses, to the 4 weeks Kriya Yoga course and the annual 3 months
course, led by Swami Janakananda. The 3 months course is a retreat for
people wanting to go further. On this course you are initiated into the
original Tantric Kriya Yoga during one month of silence. </P>
