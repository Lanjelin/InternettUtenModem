The Official Keeper of the Web Page is <a href="mailto:NetServices@sfi.org"><i>Allyson M.W. Dyar</I></a> (NetServices@sfi.org). 
If you have any problems with any of the pages, please send her e-mail so she can check it out.
<p>

<p>The STARFLEET Logo on this page and other pages on this site was adapted by Jeff Williams who graciously took our black and white logo and did it up spiffy. Thanx, Jeff! If you like his work, let Allyson know and she'll pass your note to him. As Jeff gave Allyson "ownership" of the logo, permission is hereby granted to any STARFLEET member of good standing to use on his or her ship, region or personal web page. If you have any question about the logo's useage, please ask Allyson.

<p>The other junk'n'stuff (and a few other things including adapting Jeff's logo) were supplied by 
<a href="mailto:gren@teleport.com"><i>Kurt Roithinger</i></a>
(gren@teleport.com).</p>


In 1995, imagine the web keeper's surprise when she received numerous phone calls and e-mail 
messages telling her about her &quot;fame&quot; in the NetGuide book &quot;Net Trek.&quot; Well, gee, <b>She's</b> 
not famous but this page is -- check out page 109! In the meantime, link to the 
publisher's page 
<a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs15.htm#1528" tppabs="http://www.ypn.com/">ypn</a> 
or e-mail 'em at: 
<a href="mailto:editors@ypn.com">Net Guides</a> (editors@ypn.com) 
<p>

If that isn't enough, in 1996, this page was reviewed in the May 1996 issue of NetGuide 
and was given three stars out of four! 
</p>

And in December of 1996, <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs30.htm#3095" tppabs="http://www.cnet.com/">C/Net</a> on-line  had the following to say about the 'fleet home page:
<i>The Starfleet International Web Page is big, bad, and darn serious.
Starfleet is a 21-year-old
international fan association with more than 7,000 members "united he world
over in their appreciation of Star Trek: The Greatest Human Adventure." So
if you want to stage a virtual Star Trek convention with other fans, this
is the place to visit. You'll find contact information here for hundreds of
chapters around the globe, from Connecticut to Croatia. And there are more
affiliated clubs than you can imagine, including the Armed Services
Program, the Corps of Engineers (Starfleet's engineering fan club),
Starfleet Executive Officers (newsletter and contact list provided),
Starfleet Marines, and Starfleet Medical Corps. If you want to attend a
real, live Star Trek convention, the Starfleet site includes notices of
those, too. Starfleet doesn't offer fun trivia or graphics, but if you want
to make contact, this is the place to go.</i>
<p>


On 20 January, 1997, the old STARFLEET Logo (brown/yellow) was featured on a story on MSNBC touting the new CD-ROM based game, "Starfleet Academy."
<p>

The intro on the  
<a href="STARFL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.sfi.org/html/starfleet.html">Starfleet Home Page/Main Menu</a> 
is courtesy of the 
<a href="mailto:MerryMom4@aol.com">USS Palo Duro</a> (who, in turn, borrowed it from the USS Tejas).

<p>The STARFLEET Logo on this page was adapted by Jeff Williams and then readapated along with doing some other junk'n'stuff (and a few other things) by
