FYI...

For the next few days, Commodore Sal Lizard will be off-line busy with the
technical aspects of CompOps.  Until he returns, I am his designated proxy
and will be the officer-in-charge of CompOps (scary, eh?).
 
If you have any further questions, please email me or the compops staff at
compops@sfi.org.

Onward,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I’m pleased to pass along some *good* news (for a change) regarding the
finances and records from the former Administration.

Last Wednesday, I faxed a letter to the Branch Manager of the UMB Bank,
Swansea Branch, requesting that the accounts be closed and bank checks be
issued to STARFLEET HQ.  On Friday, the Branch Manager went to Mr.
McGinnis’ office and made him sign the paperwork to close the accounts
down.  She then forwarded the checks to me.  I will be depositing them
tomorrow in our bank.

The General Account held $1,185.50.  This money will be used by Computer
Operations to get out the back membership packets that are owed to the
membership.  Hopefully this money will clear out all the back membership
packets, and even if it does not, it will go a long way towards that mark.

The Scholarship Account held $314.88.  This money will be used to open the
Scholarship Account at our bank.

The STARFLEET Challenge of the Heart Fund held $1,078.65.  This money will
be forwarded to Deb Maestu and the Challenge of the Heart organization, as
these funds were raised for specific charity purposes.

It has also been reported to me that the Scholarship CDs were being managed
by an independent entity (a friend of McGinnis’) and that Mr. McGinnis is
taking steps to ensure that new checks are issued and sent on to STARFLEET HQ.

Mr. McGinnis has told Chuck Freas that he will be regenerating all his past
reports and financial data to be sent to us.  Mr. McGinnis also offered to
do our IRS Form 990s for the tax year; I will be sending him a fax letter
thanking him for his offer but politely declining.

One part of the nightmare is over, two parts to yet get through, before the
door is finally closed on the past Administration.




Regards,
Mike

send out a request for input.

Put simply, the IC '97 Programming Committee would like to know what you,

Conference. What kind of programs and activities would you like available?

Please forward all ideas and comments to Marla at: zeonia@ix.netcom.com

Remember, the more input we get from you, the better we can make the 
Conference.

Greetings everyone.

I'm pleased to announce that we have a presence in England now.

Professor Steve Molyneux of the University of Wolverhampton, in England, is
STARFLEET's official point of contact in Region 20.

Steve brings along about 50 personnel interested in joining STARFLEET, as
well as a planned Region 20 Web Site and offering to be the European Mirror
site for our organization.  As we start to launch STARFLEET shuttles and
get them rolling, Professor Molyneux will be appointed Acting Regional
Coordinator.

I am currently in discussion with him regarding getting all the paperwork
necessary to get the groups going in Region 20, and STARFLEET Flagship USS
Thagard has agreed to be the host chapter for his group and the successive
chapters.

Professor Molyneux's email address is stephen.molyneux@cableinet.co.uk.

To Allyson Dyar:  please make the appropriate change to the STARFLEET Web
Page to designate Professor Molyneux as our POC.

To Britt Sloan:  please place the appropriate notation in the CQ for us.

Thanks, and please take a few minutes to send a welcome email to the
Professor.  I look forward to helping the Professor build up and maintain
STARFLEET Region 20.

Regards,
Mike
