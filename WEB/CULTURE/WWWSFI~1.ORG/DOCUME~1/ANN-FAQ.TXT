STARFLEET ANNOUNCEMENTS LIST FAQ
<last update:  9703.03>

*****

@Name of List: STARFLEET Announcements List 

@Address of List: <sfi-announce@sfi.org>

@Purpose of List: This list is an announcements only (no discussion, just "press releases") 
list where only the moderator or his/her designates are the only ones that will be allowed to 
post to the list. The purpose of making this list moderator only as far as postings is to keep 
it on track as being announcements only -- no discussion of any kind will be allowed here 
(for discussions, use the Starfleet list at netrail.net). The goal of the list is to get as many 'fleet 
members who are on-line subbed to this list as possible and is especially intended for members 
that can't keep up with the regular mailing list, but want to keep up-to-date on 'Fleet 
issues and news.

If I don't see the same announcements posted on the STARFLEET list at Netrail, I'll post the 
announcement there myself.
