FCapt Jack Hopkins, STARFLEET Inspector General regretfully informed me
that he wishes to step down from his role as IG.

Jack cited burn out from the position, wanting the time to spend with his
family and his church, and the time to devote to the soon-to-be USS
Phantom, of which he is the Commanding Officer.

Therefore, STARFLEET will be looking for a new IG.

Will any interested party please submit a STARFLEET and real life resume to:
 
Commodore Michael Malotte
Director of STARFLEET Personnel
1717 South 5th Street  
Leavenworth, Kansas  66048
personnel@sfi.org

You need not be a lawyer or other such legal type to apply for the position.  
The ideal candidate would be in STARFLEET for at least three years, have
taken and passed OTS and OCC, have held the positions of CO or XO of a
chapter, or held a medium level regional position, such as RDC or Chief of
Staff.

The candidate must have the time and resources to do the job effectively,
from the investigations handed to him/her by the AB or called from a
member, to the ability to keep track of Regional Coordinator Votes of
Confidence.

The cutoff date for receiving applications will be April 15th, and the new
IG will be appointed by no later than April 30th.

This advertisement will also appear in the Communique.

Thanks for your time.

This has been a bit *too* long in coming, but...

The IC97 Flyer has been revised.

Upon election as Fleet Admiral, Michael D. Smith resigned as IC97 Chair, and
was succeeded by IC97 Co-Chairs Tony Rowley and Bob Vosseller.

Registration for the 1997 STARFLEET International Conference should now be
sent to Tony Rowley. His address is on the flyer, which can be downloaded
from the IC97 Web Site (http://www.webwarren.com/ic97/) Follow the links to

In addition to the new address, the flyer now notes contact info for the

Please be certain that you distribute *only* the current version of the flyer.

Stay tuned for more information about IC97.

I originally sent the original message during a time when apparently the
List Server was down.  I never saw a copy come back through, so I am going
to send it again, only I am going to include the Name Change that I sent
afterward (which DID make it through the List Server).

****THE GREAT COUPON WAR OF 1997****

For the past few days, I have been watching the thread "Northern Lightly"
with interest (and amusement :)).  This thread got me to thinking (dangerous
thing, I know) and this is result.....

For awhile, now, I had been looking for a possible way to get more chapters
involved in the Overseas Coupon Project (OCP) and still have fun doing it.
Then the other night as I was reading the "Northern Lightly" thread, it hit
me.  "THE GREAT COUPON WAR OF 1997" North against South, East against West,
but instead of cannon balls and gunpowder, this war will be fought with
COUPONS.  This war will not be limited to only STARFLEET Chapters, but also
to chapters of any other organization (Star Trek realted or not) who wish to
join the war.  

The object (of course) is for one side to collect more coupons and have a
higher average per chapter than the other side.  This makes the outcome more
uncertain, for although some regions have more chapters, other regions can
still be victorious by gaining a higher average per chapter (this is
determined by _participating_ chapters, not total chapters in the region).
The more chapters that participate in this war, the better the chances of
winning this war is for either side.  

The only restriction in this war is (and this comes from experience) the
coupons must be of the magazine or newspaper variety, and not from coupon
books that are given out from time to time by supermarkets (this would
create an unfair advantage in certain areas of the country).  These coupons
can still be used for the OCP project, just not for the war.

It is requrested that warring chapters please let me know of your totals for
this project so that I may keep tabs on the outcome of the war.  I am trying
to set up an "OCP Coupon War" home page to keep everyone informed of the
totals and situations.  There can also be "battles" fought between
individual chapters from various regions (usually over a one month period)
with the highest chapter winning (the times of these battles can be worked
out between battling chapters).

With the ground rules laid,.............

After speaking with the CO of the USS Charleston, in Charleston, SC, it has
been decided that a COUPON WAR is now declared on all other chapters of
STARFLEET and non-STARFLEET organizations.  The first volley of this war
will be shot from the shores of Charleston, SC.  

<Sound of cannons going off>

The USS Charleston begins with a shot of $500.00 worth of coupons.

WHO DARES TO OUTDO US?
