Hello all.

Just some more info to pass along to your crews, as quickly as possible.
Please cross-post this and forward to any Fleet chapter or member that you
know of that may not be online, or subscribed to any of our mailing lists.

Former CS Dan McGinnis has failed to cooperate with our requests for the
return of the money and financial records for STARFLEET.  I have authorized
Chuck Freas to pursue alternative avenues to force Mr. McGinnis to
cooperate with us.

I have also been in contact with former JAG Gary Scott Decker, who advised
me that I could contact Frank Fernandez, the CPA hired by Rob Lerman.  Gary
offered, and I accepted his assistance in contacting Mr. Fernandez.  Mr.
Fernandez has agreed to make copies of all relevant data he has regarding
STARFLEET and is forwarding that information to Internal Auditor Howard
Cronson.

I have been in contact with Sue Hampton regarding the Scholarship issue,
and she is contacting all Scholarship winners over the past two years to
check on status of payment.

Chuck has been in contact with the State of North Carolina regarding our
status there, and is also in contact with the IRS regarding our situation.
I'll let Chuck brief you more fully on that during the course of the next
few days.

Tom Monaghan and his staff are hard at work.  Tom just recently sent me a
thorough report to date regarding Ops.  I'm pleased to note that the
Existing Fan Club Program is hard at work, and I've been informed that
there are several pending returns in the works at this time.

The online reporting form is working after hitting a minor snag, and the
new MSRs and membership flyers are out.  I'm awaiting master copies of them
from Ops Vice Chief Les Rickard and then will be mailing them out to the
RCs.  I'm also working with Ron Fell, Director of Recruiting Services in
order to get that office, neglected by the previous administration up to
speed.

Greg Trotter is starting the process to secure our bulkrate permit for
mailing the first CQ.  This is being done since we need a bulkrate permit
before we can apply for a 2nd class (or Periodicals) postal permit.  Please
don't forget that the deadline for CQ submissions is February 15th, 1997,
so please be prompt.  Greg and his staff are looking forward to producing
the first CQ to be mailed to the membership in many months, and I for one
am looking forward to seeing their work.

Wendy Fillmore has been hard at work putting together the Fanzine staff and
home page, and is looking forward to seeing submissions and artwork for
that publication.

Robbie Lewis has gotten the CSR out, and I know several RCs and myself at
the very least have received their copies.  Chapter COs, make sure that
those copies are distributed to you and your crews.  Unfortunately, this
first CSR was forced to be mailed to the RCs only, as we just don't have
the working capital to get them to all the COs.  This will hopefully be
rectified by the prompt payment of the CCF fee to Marlene Miller for the
year 1997.  I see that many chapters have already forwarded that fee to
her, and hope that more of you will in the coming weeks.

Rob Lerman reports sending the money requested by Paul Dyl to him via
certified mail in order to transition the Academy paperwork.  As you all
know, Mr. Dyl has seen fit to withhold the data of several schools and/or
logos associated with STARFLEET Academy.  A letter is being dispatched to
him regarding this situation.  In the meantime, Rob is currently working to
create new logos and tests so that we may reopen those schools ASAP.

ShOC chief Dennis Gray reports receiving the data and material from Linda
Reynolds, and is in the process of sorting that data as we speak.  ShOC has
already handled the launch of a few chapters, and is looking forward to
launching a few more in the coming weeks.

Computer Ops reports that memberships are flowing in to the Membership
Services department daily.  We have already received 17 family memberships
and 30 single memberships to date, and FCapt Mandi Herrmann advises the
next set of membership checks totals over $2000.  Please keep those
memberships coming in, folks.  In our first CQ, I will outline the return
of the STARFLEET Membership Drive, so keep a lookout for that article.

Sal Lizard also reports the transfer of STARFLEET's Internet Services to a
dedicated machine, transforming the "virtual" aspect of our online presence
to a full and dedicated platform.  Allyson Dyar is in the process of moving
the STARFLEET Web Page to that server, and her home site at halcyon.com
will act as a mirror site.  This also means mailing list administrators
will be able to work directly to add and remove people from the sfi.org
listservers, instead of having to go through Sal.

Scott Akers and the Marine Corps Senior Staff is hard at work bringing the
Corps back up to speed.  I have also heard recently from Randy Slater, the
head of the STARFLEET Rangers, and I hope to see that program reactivated
in the coming months.

IC97 staff are hard at work to bring you this year's International
Conference.  I'm looking forward to attending this year's IC, which is not
only in my home Region, but my home state as well.  I hope many of you will
choose to attend this year.

I'd like to take a moment to thank all of STARFLEET's staff to date.  They
have been working tirelessly in order to do their part to remove STARFLEET
from the morass it was sunk into.

I'd also like to thank those of you online who have pledged your support
and willingness to work alongside us to achieve our goals. 

Together we *can* make a difference.

Thanks again, and see you next update!

Mike

Carolyn Donner asked me to post this to the 'fleet listserver:

*****

    OCC is and has been on hold since November of 1996.  The reason for
this is that Dan McGinnis never reimbursed me for receipts sent to him
in October of 1996.  I sent them in with plenty of time to spare for him
to reimburse me before I ran out of supplies (manuals and tests), but he
did not reimburse me and when I ran out of course materials, I had no
choice but to put things on hold here.  I tried to work this out with
Paul Dyl and Jim Herring, but was told that Jim did not want to handle
money since he was only going to be running things for a short time (and
besides he didn't have the money to handle).  Fortunately, Rob Lerman is
working with Mike Smith who now have copies of the receipts and I
should be getting a check soon, so hopefully OCC will be back in
business soon.
     In the meantime, OCC ONLINE is still open for business.  If you
have a computer and modem, just call the Intergalactic Information BBS
at 937-379-2832 and leave a message for the sysop (Gary Donner) and tell
him you want to take OCC online and leave your SCC#.  There's a bulletin
on the BBS that tells you all about taking OCC online.
    Also, if you already have your OCC course materials, tests are still
being graded by Jim Cushing and diplomas issued.  Jim's address was on
the letter you received with your test.  If you've lost it, send me a
note at OCC@sfi.org.  Jim will continue to grade tests and send out
diplomas as long as the postage and blank diplomas hold out.  So be sure
to enclose a stamp with your completed test.  It will help a lot.
Thanks.
   Please be patient. I'm sure the new administration will have OCC back
up and running real soon.  In the meantime, if you mailed in your OCC
application, it is still here and I will see that those already here
will be the first to receive their course materials as soon as things
are back to normal.  Thanks for your patience.

Subject: Update on Chapter Reporting Guidelines
Sender: owner-starfleet@netrail.net
Reply-To: starfleet@netrail.net

Hello All,

        Well here we are into the first month of a new STARFLEET
Administration and things seem to be coming together. I can't say that for
sure as I have been locked in the Vice Chief of Operations Office treading
through a large number of MSR's. Which is what brought on this short post.
        First of all, add me to the Oops Club as in my Chapter Guidelines
Post some time back I said that the MSR Deadline would not change. I made a
mistake and should have said that it would change. The Deadline for Chapters
to report to Operations is the 5th of the month following the Reporting
Period. Now, as I said before, we're not gonna start "pullin nails" nor are
we gonna send out the OPS "Goon Squad" with the Portable Comfy Chair if they
are couple of days late. All MSR's should be sent to the following address:

Les Rickard
Starfleet Operations
P.O.Box 22
Lexington, NC 27293-0022
Email: VOps@SFI.ORG

        Second, I would like to ask that any MSR's sent electronically be
done by the use of the Email form (Which I am going to post after this short
email to the same lists) or the Operations Web Site MSR (Or similar MSR Site
if they are out there). Now, I know we have had some problems the last few
days with the MSR, but bugs are to be expected in a new system. If ya can't
get through on the OPS Site then use the Email form. Please don't send
Attached Files that are MSR's (Such as doc or txt files) I can not view them
on most occasions and do not have some of the programs these MSR's are
written in. 
        On the new MSR Forms. I am preparing a Mailer to all RC's which will
contain the new MSR, VRR and Starfleet Application (With updated Address).
Hopefully they will filter down within the next few months and we start
seeing the new MSR's coming in here.
        Finally, I want to say - Keep the MSR's comming. The reporting
percentages are not phenomonal, but they are pretty good considering how
difficult it was jumping right into it with no transistion time to let
everyone know where reports were supposed to go.
        Well, thats about it. The Email MSR Form will be sent out after this
post, please forward to anyone that doesn't have it and wants it or to lists
that I have not included.
        Take Care and Go Boldly!

In Service to Starfleet and its Members,

Subject: The CSR
Sender: owner-starfleet@netrail.net
Reply-To: starfleet@netrail.net

I am currently discussing the CSR situation with my staff, as I wasn't
certain whether to proceed with the CSR to those who had paid the CCF fee
or wait until the next issue, meaning that they would get 5 CSRs this year,
and one the following year.  I had already announced the first CSR would go
only to the RCs.

In any event, as I had originally planned, the next CSR *will* be going out
to those chapters who have paid the CCF fee; other chapters will need to
contact their RC and compensate them as necessary for a copy.

The CCF is supposed to pay for 6 issues of the CSR, the CCF certificate to
the chapter, and to help defray the costs of the annual audit of
STARFLEET's books.

I am currently reviewing the CCF payment process, and shall be engaging in
discussion with my staff as to the feasibility of having the Regional
Coordinators take in the money from their Regions beginning in 1998, and
having the RCs be responsible for copying/mailing the CSRs and the Chapter
Charter.  The RCs could then forward the balance to STARFLEET for the audit.

In a message dated 97-02-02, it is written:

<< The following is an excerpt from a letter written by an international
 member in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Presented here for discussion.
 
 ...I'm off to the hotel right now to try and come up with two $1 bills.
 Please tell SFA Command that if this truly is the International fan club,
 they should first ask the opinion of us Internationals! The voucher system
 was so easy, as we could send a $20 bill and get 20 vouchers. Have you any
 idea just how difficult it is to obtain single dollar bills overseas? 20's,
 50's, and even 10's are no problem, but ones are next to impossible! Please
 pass that along to command, in addition to the fact that we risk theft a
 lot more by sending cash thru the mail. And don't let them give you the
 excuse of checks. If I were to make a $2 check here, it would cost me $20!
 Vouchers were perfect for the international fan club. ...

Folks, you are preaching to the choir here.

Just in case anyone missed it, here is the official final word as I know it
(and Rob "007" Lerman, please correct me if I'm wrong):

The official policy as announced was that vouchers are no longer required for
tuition at all STARFLEET Academy courses.  We didn't say that vouchers were
no longer any good.  We never said that if you had some of them that you must
throw them away because they wouldn't be accepted.

If you have them, use them.  Use them till they're all gone.

This means that any and all Overseas Members can still use their Fleet
vouchers for SFA courses.  Likewise, North American members can still use
Fleet vouchers for SFA courses.

In fact, any and all members can still use Fleet vouchers for SFA courses.

And, if anyone --  regardless of where they live -- wants to reorder SFA
vouchers, e-mail HQ and request same.  Your request will be honored  -- as
best we can.

Do we have any vouchers?  Yes, those that were turned over to Mike D. Smith
by Jim Herring.  How many?  I don't know.   Where are they?  Last I heard at
Fleet HQ in NJ.  Would we mail them out if requested?  Well, as far as I know
-- yes.  Has anyone requested that we do so?  As far a I know -- no.

Are vouchers a problem?  Yes.  Why?

Because we *don't* have the financial records or the documentation we need to
make final decisions regarding SFA vouchers -- like, how many total vouchers
are still out there;  which ones and how many are good and which ones and how
many, if any, have been cancelled/used/voided/are no longer good to reuse but
are still lurking out there; who has the good vouchers and the bad ones, if
any;  who has them that shouldn't have them; who doesn't have them that needs
them and really should have them, etc.  

We need to know these things to ascertain and finally determine our potential
debts and our gross income.  Such information is crucial to our mandatory IRS
reporting.  If we don't obtain it very soon, like yesterday, we will have
major problems.

Would we like to retain some form of voucher program?  Yes.  In fact, we have
talked about taking it one step further -- to a Fleetwide "Gift Certificate"
that could be used everywhere by everyone for any Fleet-related
purpose/function -- Quartermaster, SFA, CCF, DTS VRR and VAR forms, etc.

When can we do this?   We don't know.  Are we going to do this for sure?  We
don't know.

If people want to express their displeasure about our lack of knowledge and
our resultant inability to do what they want us to do regarding vouchers (and
frankly, we are very willing to do the gift certificate plan if we can get
some hard data on it), then let them call someone in Belleville who has the
ready ability to clear all of this up.  

'Nuff said.

This first IRC meeting we'll keep as posted.

Polling will last from now until the end of the month.

Hello, all.

OCC will be reopened shortly, as I have just cut Carolyn Donner a check for
the amount owe her.

OCC is a critical school for STARFLEET and needs the direct attention.

Rob Lerman is working with the other school directors and we will be
bringing them current as finances permit.

Regards,
Mike
