Greeting to all...

I am asking everyone who represents a ship, region or whatever to pass
along the following info.  I have not been able to get this published in
the CQ for obvious reasons with publications problems, so PLEASE pass this
info along to all concerned.

Starfleet 1999 IC Bid Deadline

The SICC will be accepting Bids for the awarding of the 1999 International
Conference.  The Deadline for submitting a complete proposal will be
January 15, 1997.

All bids must be submited in Folder/Binder Form and include the names,
addresses, phone and or email of all committee personnel.  Once the
original Bid is received and certified, the Bid Chairperson will be
contacted and supplied with the additional addresses of the
committee members to whom copies of the bid will need to be mailed.

If anyone needs the current guidelines, please contact:

If anyone would like to receive the Bound 120 page comprehensive 1995 IC
Report, then please send along $5 to cover the printing and postage of
such.

Also, if anyone was wondering about the 1998 Bid Process, we are presently
awaiting the completion of three Bids and then that selections process
shall begin.
