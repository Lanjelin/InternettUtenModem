@Name of List: STARFLEET Announcements List 

@Address of List: <sfi-announce@sfi.org>

@Purpose of List: This list is an announcements only (no discussion, just
"press releases") list where only the moderator or his/her designates are
the only ones that will be allowed to post to the list. The purpose of
making this list moderator only as far as postings is to keep it on track
as being announcements only -- no discussion of any kind will be allowed here 
(for discussions, use the Starfleet list at netrail.net). The goal of the
list is to get as many 'fleet members who are on-line subbed to this list
as possible and is especially intended for members that can't keep up with
the regular mailing list, but want to keep up-to-date on 'Fleet issues and
news.

If I don't see the same announcements posted on the STARFLEET list at
Netrail, I'll post the announcement there myself. 

@Administrator Name/Address: Commodore Allyson M.W. Dyar <NetServices@sfi.org>

@Posting Information: send a message to <sfi-announce@sfi.org> or

Subject: A quick CQ update...
Sender: owner-starfleet@netrail.net
Reply-To: starfleet@netrail.net

Hello, everyone....

I know that many of you are using as a yardstick indicator of the
Smith/Freas administration the production and mailing of the first
Smith/Freas CQ.

Well, I'm happy to tell you that the CQ is at the printers as we speak, and
we are looking for a Friday mailing date of the first CQ.  Members who are
attending the Region 2 Summit will be able to see copies of the CQ on
during the Saturday schedule, as we are planning to ship copies of the CQ
overnight to Atlanta for the Summit.

I want to put a small word of caution and reminder regarding the mailing of
the CQ.  Because the former administration never actually (contrary to the
spoken word) secured the Periodicals postal permit, we have to ship the
first CQ via bulk-rate mail.  On Friday, Cdr Greg Trotter will begin the
process of securing the Periodicals permit which we hope to attain in time
for the next CQ.  So keep that in mind when we let you know that the CQs
have *definitely* been mailed.

As CS, I'm in the lucky position to have seen a sneak preview master, and
folks let me tell you that Greg, News Editor Britt Sloan, Features Editor
Kris Harah and Design Editor Tonea Morrow did a fantastic job on the CQ.  I
think that you all will be pleasantly surprised at the new look of the CQ
(not to mention actually *getting* a CQ in your mailboxes).

I'd like to take a moment to thank the CQ staff for their work and effort.
As this was the first time that the staff worked together in producing the
CQ, there were obviously some rough spots on the road, but Greg and Co.
worked them out smoothly.

I hope that you all will take a few moments to contact the CQ staff and
thank them for their work after you have received and read through the CQ.
I know I liked it, and I'm sure you will too.

Regards,
Mike
