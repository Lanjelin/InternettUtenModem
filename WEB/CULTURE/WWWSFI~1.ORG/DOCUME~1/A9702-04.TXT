I thank Sashi German for forwarding the opinions that she has heard to the
list.

I can only say that these people can't be farther from the truth.

To date, the Smith/Freas team has already put out a Command Status Report
filled with information to the RCs (and as seen here, many people
volunteered to mail those to chapters in their individual states).

Our first CQ is due to hit the streets next Wednesday, which contains all
the pertinent information that has been released to date, including two
applications for positions within the Administration, namely the Inspector
General and the Director of the Advanced Starship Design Bureau.

So, anyone who claims they are being left behind is totally incorrect.
Anyone who claims they haven't gotten any information should either contact
their CO for a copy of the Command Status Report, or have their CO contact
their RC to get a copy.

I'm sorry that information is not flowing to people as quickly as they'd
like, but the information *is* getting out.

Regards,
Mike
