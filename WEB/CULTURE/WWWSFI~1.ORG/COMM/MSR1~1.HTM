RE:        Communications Division January Activity Report
_________________________________________________________________

The Communications Division has been highly productive during the
month of January.  In addition to the numerous STARFLEET web pages
created by the NetServices staff, a Communications Division web
page is now available at http://www.lily.org/~ggold/sfcomm.html,
which is linked into the main STARFLEET pages and serves as a
central link to other Communications-related pages, including
the Fanzine page, the soon-to-be-published Communiqu&eacute; page, 
a "STARFLEET In The News" page, and others.

The Fanzine, Communiqu&eacute;, and NetServices staffs have been growing,
are extremely active, and their phenomenal accomplishments are 
delineated below.  I commend them to you.

In addition, plans for three new Offices are underway, and the 
leadership positions for these offices will be advertised in the
upcoming edition of the Communiqu&eacute;.


FANZINE

 Fanzine staff update:

  Capt. Wendy Fillmore - Managing Editor
  Capt. Bob Fillmore - Technical Consultant

  Typing Team:
    Capt. Nat Saenz - R5 - nat@televar.com
    Inge Fong - R5 - nat@televar.com
    LTjg David Breland - coda@sierra.com

  Proofreading Team (Team 1):
    Ens. June Heidemann - R7 - JuneH@qtx.com
    Ens. Jeff Engel - R7 - j_engel@earthlink.com
    Ens. Jean Engel - R7 - ghatten@earthlink.com

  Copy Editing Team (Team 2):
    Adm. Alex Rosenzweig - R7 - alexr@castle.net
    Comm. Sashi German - R7 - sashi@feith1.FEITH.com
    LCdr. Liz Woolf - R7 - lizwoolf@garden.net

 Fanzine accomplishments:

  1) Web page:  http://www.castle.net/~olgie/fanzine

  2) submission guidelines;

  3) editing guidelines;

  4) production schedule;

  5) article submitted for Communiqu&eacute;.

 The Fanzine staff has already received two e-mail submissions, and a 
 packet full of stuff from Kris Harrah that had been submitted for the 
 last fanzine.  Included were three disks, so a significant portion of 
 it is already typed up.  They have held three on-line meetings, and 
 expect to pick up again on Wednesday, February 19, 7:30 p.m. for their
 next meeting.  They've also come up with a price structure, and are 
 examining other fanzines for format ideas.


NETSERVICES

 NetServices provides the first contact for 'fleet members or perspective
 who wish information on what is available to 'fleet members in cyberspace
 aka -All Things Cyberspace. These include maintaining the 'fleet web pages,
 announcements-only listserver (under construction) and answering e-mail
 that comes to the Department.

 NetServices staff update:

  Michael Dugas has been added to the NetServices staff as a Staff Assistant.

 NetServices accomplishments:

  1) &lt;starfleet.html&gt; aka the "main page" -- received approximately 6000
     hits with an average of around 200 per day.

  2) Feedback Page -- 62 feedbacks were received from the 'fleet web pages,
     via the feedback form. These were acknowledged and forwarded to the
     appropriate individuals/Divisions/EC members for response and action.

 Web Page Maintenance takes up a majority of Allyson's time, though this 
 is expected to diminish as daily maintenance becomes more routine.  The
 announcements page is working out better than expected, and will be used
 in conjunction with the Announcements-only listserver, which is under
 development.  Between the 'fleet main list, the announcements list and the
 announcements page (with files that can be viewed on-line and saved 
 off-line), there will be no excuse for the on-line 'fleet member to be 
 uninformed.

 Future plans include moving the main site from halcyon directly onto
 sfi.org. This should be accomplished by mid-February. Halcyon will be
 kept up to date as a backup.  Allyson is lso working on a general
 information and address FAQ to assure that all important names and
 addresses be accessible from one file.


COMMUNIQU&Eacute;

 The Communiqu&eacute; is well under development, and on track for printing in
 late February. 

 Communiqu&eacute; accomplishments:

  1) Verifying printing costs -- We are still looking at a cost of around 20
     cents per CQ to print, even taking into account a lower press run.

  2) Acquiring permits -- Starfleet now hold bulk rate permit #5 in Tecumseh,
     Oklahoma and has $299.15 in postage credit at the Tecumseh PO. Greg will
     apply for the second class permit the day before we mail the CQ; that way,
     we will be able to include the current CQ as an example publication, and
     we'll be credited the diference in postage between second and third class
     mailings.

  3) Design -- Design editor Tonea Morrow has been hard at work getting us an
     attractive and appropriate flag for the new Communiqu&eacute;.

  4) Web site -- Mike Wilkerson has volunteered to design a CQ web site. He has a
     preliminary site up, and the new site will be announced to the EC and the
     general membership very soon.

 The transfer of Communiqu&eacute; materials from Kris Harah to Greg Trotter should be 
 completed by 2/7/97.


SUPPORT SERVICES
 
 Three offices are being created as part of the Communications Division's 
 Support Services Department.  Openings for all three offices are currently
 being announced on the Communications Division web page, and will be
 announced in my column in the upcoming issue of the Communiqu&eacute;:

  1) Office of Subspace Communications

   The Office of Subspace Communications will be responsible for promoting open
   communications between STARFLEET chapters within their regions and world-wide.
   This includes not only an on-line pen-pal program, but a "SubSpace Relays" 
   program for those chapters without e-mail. In addition, this office will be
   responsible for coordinating STARFLEET's participation in OPERATION:EAGLE,
   a pen-pal project which promotes communication between STARFLEET members and
   real-life members of the armed services overseas.  Applications for the position 
   of Director are now being accepted.  FCapt Bill Herrmann has expressed an 
   interest in this position, and is considered the leading candidate for
   appointment.

  2) STARFLEET Diplomatic Corps

   The Diplomatic Corps will be responsible for opening and maintaining 
   communications between STARFLEET and other fan organizations, initiating
   inter-fandom activities and newsletter exchanges.  Applications are now being 
   accepted for for the position of Director, in addition to various Liaison
   positions.

  3) STARFLEET Language Bank

   The Language Bank will consist of volunteers who may be called upon 
   to provide translation services (spoken/written Terrestrial languages, 
   sign languages, Vulcan, Klingon, Romulan, Dwarvish, Elven, et cetera) in
   their Regions or over the Internet, as needed. Applications are now being 
   accepted for the position of Coordinator, who shall be responsible for 
   recruiting and organizing the volunteer translators.
