Greetings from Communications Central, and welcome to the new age of 
STARFLEET Communications.  I'm Commodore Gordon Lloyd Goldberg, new 
Chief of Communications for STARFLEET.  My staff and I are very excited 
about the future and the job ahead of us.  As you can hopefully tell just 
from the fact that you are holding this copy of the Communiqu&eacute;, we are
dedicated to keeping you informed on a timely basis.  Yet you will find
that the Communiqu&eacute; is only part of our new approach to 'fleet communications.
As you will see for yourselves in the coming months, our Communications 
team will be making good use of both postal and internet services in our
efforts to make sure that STARFLEET Headquarters and the membership
stay in close touch.<p>

Before I get to the business of introducing the rest of the team,
I'd like to let you know a little about myself.  In addition to
serving as STARFLEET's Chief of Communications, I'm currently based
on board the USS Northstar in New York City.  Prior to joining the 
Northstar, I was a Communications Specialist on the New Jersey-based
USS Avenger, to which I had transferred after the decommissioning of
the USS Tai Shan, where I had served variously as Chief of Communications
and Operations, as well as Executive Officer.  I was also the founder
of the STARFLEET Internet Mailing List, which I continue to assist in
administering.  In real life, I'm a former special-education teacher
with degrees in computer science, business administration, and psychology,
now serving as Labor Relations Director for the New York City Department 
of Transportation. I'm also an active community volunteer and political 
activist, fantasy and science-fiction fan (duh!) and computer enthusiast.
Somewhere in and among all that, I manage to find time to spend with
my boyfriend, Sven, who has finally gotten hooked on Star Trek.<p>

I can be reached on the Internet at Comm@sfi.org, or by postal mail at
the following address:<p>

          Gordon L. Goldberg<br>
          Chief of Communications<br>
          330 Haven Avenue, 3C<br>
          New York, NY  10033-5333  USA<p>

Remember those addresses -- later in this column, I'll be discussing
some openings that are available in the Communications Division, and 
I'll be accepting applications via e-mail or postal mail.  In fact, any 
communication with this Division can be sent using either medium.  For
the most urgent, time-sensitive issues, I can also be reached by phone
at 212-781-5745.<p>

Now to the real business.<p>

The Communications Division is now divided into four departments: 
Communiqu&eacute;, Fanzine, NetServices, and Support Services.  The first
three report to their respective Vice Chiefs (who report to me, of 
course), while the directors of the Support Service Offices (who have
yet to be appointed) will report directly to me.<p>

The Communiqu&eacute; you are holding is the first of many that will be
brought to you through the efforts of Commander Greg Trotter, who heads up
the Communiqu&eacute; team along with Tonea Morrow, Brittany Sloan, Kris Harah, 
and their staffs.  In addition to getting new Communiqu&eacute;s out to you
every other month, Greg and company hope to be able to deliver the back-issues none of us received during the previous administration, so that the
hard work our predecessors put into producing those issues will not have been
wasted.  I ask you to join me in applauding their efforts thus far.  <p>

Communiqu&eacute; submissions can be sent to CQ@sfi.org or:<p>

Captain Wendy Fillmore and her Fanzine team will be calling upon STARFLEET's
writers and artists to provide material for our yet-to-be-named
literary/art publication, which will be printed twice a year.  Look for
Wendy's article elsewhere in this Communiqu&eacute; for submission guidelines and
how to subscribe to the 'zine.  The Fanzine staff can be reached reached
by e-mail at Fanzine@sfi.org, or:<p>

Rounding out the existing staff is Commodore Allyson M.W. Dyar, whose 
NetServices staff has done a phenomenal job in setting up the STARFLEET 
web site at http://www.sfi.org, and responding to the e-mail which the 
site has brought in.  In the near future, NetServices will be setting up 
various informational e-mail auto-responders, as well as an announcements-only mailing list server for those of you on the net who want all the facts
without any of the chatter found on the general mailing list.  NetServices
will also be moderating the Commander, STARFLEET's monthly "fireside chats"
on the Internet Relay Chat server at irc.lips.net.  Questions, comments,
and suggestions may be sent to NetServices@sfi.org or:<p>

          Comm. Allyson M.W. Dyar<br>
          PO Box 941<br>
          Kirkland, WA  98083-0941  USA<p>

And now for the "Help Wanted" section. <p>

Three offices are being created as part of the Communications Division's 
Support Services Department: the Office of Subspace Communications; the
STARFLEET Diplomatic Corps; and the STARFLEET Language Bank. Applications
for the leadership positions for all three offices are currently being 
accepted, and may be sent to my e-mail or postal addresses.<p>

The Office of Subspace Communications will be responsible for promoting open
communications between STARFLEET chapters within their regions and world-wide.
This includes not only an on-line pen-pal program, but a "SubSpace Relays" 
program for those chapters without e-mail.  These chapters will have the 
opportunity to be partnered with a neighboring e-mail-enabled chapter or
other liaison in order to keep them informed on up-to-the-minute fleet news.
In addition, this office will be responsible for coordinating STARFLEET's 
participation in OPERATION:EAGLE, a pen-pal project which promotes 
communication between STARFLEET members and real-life members of the armed 
services overseas.  Fleet Captain Bill Herrmann will be serving as acting 
Director of Subspace Communications.  Anyone who is willing to be a 
volunteer "Subspace Relay" liaison should contact Bill at Subspace@sfi.org.
Ships who need a liaison can write to Bill at:<p>

          FCPT Bill Herrmann<br>
          9908 Berrywood Drive<br>
          Ladson, SC  29456  USA<p>

The Diplomatic Corps will be responsible for opening and maintaining 
communications between STARFLEET and other fan organizations, initiating
inter-fandom activities and newsletter exchanges.  The Director of the
Diplomatic Corps will also serve ex officio as STARFLEET's ambassador to
the International Fan Council.<p>

The Language Bank will consist of volunteers who may be called upon 
to provide translation services (spoken/written Terrestrial languages, 
sign languages, Vulcan, Klingon, Romulan, Dwarvish, Elven, et cetera) in
their Regions or over the Internet, as needed.  The Language Bank 
Coordinator will be responsible for recruiting and organizing the 
volunteer translators.<p>

Anyone who is interested in any of these positions, please get in touch with
me as quickly as you can.  I would like to fill these positions as rapidly 
as possible in order to get these programs underway.  I plan to announce
the appointments in my next column.<p>

In closing, I'd like to ask your assistance in a communications project 
I've just started up -- STARFLEET In The News.  We'll be putting
together an online "scrapbook" of STARFLEET-related news stories, 
starting with the January 22nd article in the New York Post, at
http://www.sfi.org/comm/inthenews.html.  If you see any articles
about STARFLEET, its chapters, or members in the news, please, let me 
know!  Until then, I'll be keeping all channels open...<p>

                                  In service to the fleet,<p>

                                  Gordon L. Goldberg, Commodore<br>
                                  Chief of Communications, STARFLEET<p>
