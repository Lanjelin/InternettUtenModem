<font size="+2">How can you use The Why Files? </font><br>
<font size="+1"><dt><b>Teachers</b>

<dd>What good are The Why Files in the classroom? We'll never know -- until you use them. Since our theme is "science behind the news," we think they'd be an excellent supplement to curriculum, particularly if you use current events as a springboard for classroom activities. If, for example, you were teaching a unit on electrochemistry, you could explore the role batteries are playing in the development of <a href = "../../tppmsgs/msgs15.htm#1569" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/005electcar/index.html">electric cars</a>.  <br>
In any case, we'd like to hear <a href = "../../tppmsgs/msgs16.htm#1634" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/netforum/test/a/3-3">your ideas</a> about how The Why Files can be most useful to you and your fellow science teachers. Suggest a story; expand on a pet theme; surprise us!
<dt> 
<b>Students </b>
<dd> The Why Files are free for your exploration.  You can start from the <a href = "../INDEX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/index.html">top</a> and get the latest on science behind the news. Or you can check out <a href = "../OLDSTO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/oldstorylist.html">musty, dusty, but trusty files</a> for stories that interest you.  And we've even set up a place where you can give us a <a href = "../../tppmsgs/msgs16.htm#1635" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/netforum/test/a/3-4">piece of your mind</a>.
<dt> 
<b>Everyone Else</b>
<dd>Remember that TV clip about a promising new AIDS drug? Did you catch the headline about ancient insects entombed in amber (just think of it -- the first mosquito bite in history).  Or perhaps you heard the last half of a radio story about a new way to predict earthquakes.  Then you lost that fascinating story to info-fog -- half remembered, half forgotten, generally worthless. Maybe it's in our <a href="../OLDSTO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/oldstorylist.html">old files</a>.  <br>
<Dt><b>Funding</b>
<dd> The Why Files is a project of the National Institute for Science Education, which is funded by the National Science Foundation.
