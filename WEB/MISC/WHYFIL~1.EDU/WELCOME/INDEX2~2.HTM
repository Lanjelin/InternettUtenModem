The Why Files, a project of the <a href = "../../tppmsgs/msgs15.htm#1570" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/welcome/nisensf.html">National Institute for Science Education</a>, is an electronic exploration of the science behind the news. Twice a month, we'll bring you a new feature on the science (and math, engineering, and technology) of everyday life.  Our boundaries are broad -- from outer space to cellular biology, from dinosaurs and dragon lizards to the statistics of political polling.  <P> 
It's our job to ask (and answer) questions like these:<ul> 

<li>Why were hurricanes so common last year?
<Li>Is there a relationship between eyesight and diet?
<li>Can electric cars help us breathe easier?
</ul>
The way we see it, science and technology are not the province of the elite, but issues that affect every person in this high-tech society.  Our goal is to broaden the conversation between science, engineering, math and technology, and the rest of society.  We'll look at science as a process, not a product.  <P> 
Along the way, we'll show you what it looks like. We'll scan web sites related to our stories and link you to the most exciting scientific spots in cyberspace.  We'll talk to skeptics, question the accepted wisdom and stir things up so <b>you</b> can draw your own conclusions.  <p> 
What we won't be is <b>boring </b> or <Img align="absmiddle" src="UPSIDE~1.GIF" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/welcome/upsidedown.gif"></a><p>
