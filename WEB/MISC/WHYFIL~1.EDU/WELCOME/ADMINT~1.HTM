<font size="+3">Your Role in The Why Files...  <br> 
<font size="+1">
In the hope that you'll contribute to The Why Files, we've made it easy for you to shape what we do:
<Ul>
<li>Please add your question or comment to the <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs16.htm#1637" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/netforum/test/a/1">forum</a>. Use the topics already there, or add your own topic.<p> 
<Li>If you like something, tell us via <a href="mailto:staff@whyfiles.news.wisc.edu">email</a>. If you don't like something, tell us -- maybe we'll change it.<p> 
<li>If you wish to receive email announcements for future articles, please sign the <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs16.htm#1638" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/announce">The Why Files Announcement List</a>.
<p> 
If you wish to be removed from the list, simply reply to the last announcement and indicate that you no longer want to receive updates.
<p>
<li>Is there a mailing list that I can join? Yes! Send an email message to: <a href="mailto:majordomo@whyfiles.news.wisc.edu">majordomo@whyfiles.news.wisc.edu</a>.<p> In the <i><b>body</b></i> of the message type: <code>subscribe sbtn <i>"your@email.address"</i></code>
<p><b>OR</b> come to the <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs16.htm#1639" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/lwgate/lwgate/SBTN/">SBTN mailing list gateway</a>!  It makes subscribing and unsubscribing much easier.
<p>
<li><b>Cool Science Images</b>.  We periodically post images from the cutting edge -- along with a good caption, as stand-alone stories.  If you have something to donate, or want to direct us to a place with great graphics, contact: <a href="mailto:csi@whyfiles.news.wisc.edu">csi@whyfiles.news.wisc.edu</a>.
<p> <li>We are also looking for quizzes and quiz ideas for <a href="../SPORTS/INDEX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/sports/index.html">Sportsfiles</a>.  If you've got ideas or questions (short and pithy, please), please contact us at: <a href="mailto:sports@whyfiles.news.wisc.edu">sports@whyfiles.news.wisc.edu</a>.
