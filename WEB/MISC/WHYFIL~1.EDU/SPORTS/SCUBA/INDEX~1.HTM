<font size="+1">Yes, according to a new study that suggests episodes of panic or
near-panic may explain many recreational diving accidents and deaths.
In a national survey, more than half of divers reported
experiencing at least one panic or near-panic behavior, says

<font size="+1">The panic attack was often spurred by something that a non-diver
would deem serious -- entanglement, an equipment malfunction or the
sight of a shark. But the attacks don't make things
better, Morgan says -- they can lead to irrational and dangerous behavior.
If divers and instructors knew more about the phenomenon, Morgan
adds, they could screen out people who might be susceptible to
life-threatening panic attacks.<p>
