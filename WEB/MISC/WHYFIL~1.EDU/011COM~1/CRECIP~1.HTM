A dramatic and effective way to begin a unit on comets is to make your
own comet right in front of the class. The ingredients for a comet are
not difficult to find and watching a comet being "constructed"  is
something the students will remember for a long time.

<DT>The "ingredients"  for a six-inch comet are:
       <DD>2 cups of water 
       <DD>2 cups dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) 
       <DD>2 spoonfuls of sand or dirt 
       <DD>a dash of ammonia 
       <DD>a dash of organic material (dark corn syrup works well)
<P>
<DT>Other materials you should have on hand include:
       <DD>an ice chest 
       <DD>a large mixing bowl (plastic if possible) 
       <DD>4 medium-sized plastic garbage bags 
       <DD>work gloves 
       <DD>a hammer, meat pounder, or rubber mallet 
       <DD>a large mixing spoon 
       <DD>paper towels
</DL>
<P>
Dry ice is available from ice companies in most cities (look under
"ice"  in the Yellow Pages for a local source). Day-old dry ice works best, so you might want to buy it the afternoon before the day you do
the activity. Keep the dry ice in an ice chest when transporting it
and in your refrigerator's freezer compartment overnight. Most ice
companies have a minimum on the amount of ice they will sell (usually 5
pounds). But having extra dry ice on hand will be useful because some
will evaporate and also because it is advisable to practice this
activity at least once before doing it with the class.
<P>
To create the nucleus of Comet Halley from the 
following recipe, all ingredients must be increased by a factor of 300 
trillion, +/- 20%. <P>

Here are the steps for making a 6-inch comet (students make good
baker's assistants for this exercise!):
<OL>
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Cut open one garbage bag and use it to line your mixing bowl. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Have all ingredients and utensils arranged in front of you. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Place water in mixing bowl. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Add sand or dirt, stirring well. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Add dash of ammonia 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Add dash of organic material (e.g. corn syrup), stirring until well 
       mixed. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Place dry ice in 3 garbage bags that have been placed inside 
       each other. Be sure to <font color="#cc0000"><b>wear gloves</b></font> while handling dry ice to keep from being burned.
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Crush dry ice by pounding it with hammer. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Add the dry ice to the rest of the ingredients in the mixing bowl 
       while stirring vigorously. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Continue stirring until mixture is almost totally frozen. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Lift the comet out of the bowl using the plastic liner and shape it 
       as you would a snowball. 
       <font color="#cc0000"><li></font>Unwrap the comet as soon as it is frozen sufficiently to hold its 
       shape.
</OL>
Now you can place the comet on display for the students to watch during
the day as it begins to melt and sublimate (turn directly from a solid
to a gas - which is what carbon dioxide does at room temperature and
comets do under the conditions of interplanetary space when they are
heated by the Sun).
<p>
The comet is reasonably safe to touch without getting burned by the dry
ice, but it is still best to have a spoon or a stick for the students
to use while examining it. As the comet begins to melt, the class may
notice small jets of gas coming from it. These are locations where the
gaseous carbon dioxide is escaping through small holes in the still
frozen water. This type of activity is also detected on real comets,
where the jets can sometimes expel sufficient quantities of gas to make
small changes in the orbit of the comet.
<p>
After several hours, the comet will become a crater-filled ice ball as
the more volatile carbon dioxide sublimates before the water ice
melts. Real comets are also depleted by sublimation each time they
come near the Sun. Ultimately, old comets may break into several
pieces or even completely disintegrate. In some cases, the comet may
have a solid, rocky core that is then left to travel around the comet's
orbit as a dark barren asteroid.</font>
