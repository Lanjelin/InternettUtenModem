<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>ur beautiful retreat center Rodby which has already passed its 25th anniversary is situated in the south of the sunny island Lolland, halfway between Hamburg and
Copenhagen. It was visited by <STRONG>H.H. the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa</STRONG> several times and recommended as a place of Milarepa where 1,000 people will reach enlightenment.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he place has been strongly blessed by H.H. himself, also by huge events like the <STRONG>Kagyu NagDz&ouml;</STRONG> with H.E. Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche as well as several Phowa courses with Lama Ole Nydahl and many other courses with highly realized lamas. Countless practitioners have already made short- and long-term retreats here, also benefiting from the very powerful stupa built by Tenga Rinpoche and Lama Ole Nydahl.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>e have 11 meditation rooms, 2 dormitories and other facilities, also for children. We can accommodate and welcome single practitioners as well as bigger courses. You can also choose to go into closed retreat, open retreat, or a retreat where you help us with our daily work for a reduced accommodation fee or for free.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he very nice meditation hall attracts even non-Buddhists to visit our place. We are very easy to reach by car and by train with a bus stop just in front of the center. Our charges for a normal retreat are $ 18, DM 27 or DKr 110 per day, including everything.
