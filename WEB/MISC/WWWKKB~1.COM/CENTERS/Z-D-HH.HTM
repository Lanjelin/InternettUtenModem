The 'Karma Drub Gjy Ling' - meaning: place of the transmission-lineage of practice; the name was given by the sixteenth <A HREF="../TEACHERS/KARMAPA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/teachers/karmapa.htm">Karmapa</A> Rangjung Rigpe Dorje - is one of the largest Karma-Kagyu center in the Western world under the spiritual guidance of <STRONG>His Holiness the seventeenth Karmapa Thaye Dorje</STRONG>. Its roots go back to the beginning of the 1970's when <A HREF="../TEACHERS/OLE.HTM" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/teachers/ole.htm">Lama Ole Nydahl</A> from Denmark held his first Dharma lectures in a small pub in Hamburg-Altona. The Center is now situated on the fourth flour of an old, but completely and nicely renovated  warehouse in Hamburg-Altona. The people who maintain  the activities of the center are all volunteers who are, beside their centerwork, engaged in varying professions and studies such as law, medicine, play-acting, psychology, education and so forth. Being in a lively Tibetan Buddhist transmission the aim of the people responsible for the activity of the center is to practice the authentic Buddhist teachings as lay-people within a normal daily life setting.
<P>
The center offers various kinds of activities: Meditation practices such as the daily <A HREF="../TERMS/3LIGHTS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/terms/3lights.htm"><STRONG>Guru Yoga</STRONG></A> on the Sixteenth Karmapa (Three Light Meditation) guided in German; <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs48.htm#4896" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/terms/chenrez.htm"><STRONG>Chenrezig</STRONG></A> (Loving Eyes) Meditation guided in German, traditional Pujas like <STRONG>Chenrezig</STRONG> and <STRONG>Tara</STRONG> once a week; <STRONG>Milarepa-Tsok Puja</STRONG> and <STRONG>Medicine-Buddha Puja</STRONG> once a month; and occasionally <STRONG>Phowa Puja</STRONG> for those who have already completed a Phowa course lead by a qualified Lama. The center offers guided <A HREF="../TERMS/NGONDRO.HTM" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/terms/ngondro.htm"><STRONG>Ngondro</STRONG></A> practice days as well as basic introduction lectures held by experienced lay practitioners. Furthermore, profound Diamond Way Buddhist teachings are given by fully qualified Buddhist teachers like Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche, Lopon Tsechoo Rinpoche, Gyaltrul Rinpoche, and other Rinpoches, Khenpos and Lamas from Tibetan or European origin. 
<P>
All meditations are free and both teachings and meditations are open to the public. The center has a Dharma Shop selling Meditation booklets, Puja texts, books and more and is proud of having a large selection of tape records starting in the 1970’s and encompassing various topics taught by different Buddhist teachers. 
<P>
