Today, there is an old factory hall on the ground which will house the large, flexible meditation hall after construction. A front house planned for restauration offers space for the Café and the 20 members of the the Buddhist living community running the center, paying average rents.
<P>
The price for the grounds is DM 1.8 million - appropriate for the location. The construction of the meditation hall will cost DM 200,000, the renovation of the front house DM 540,000 DM. Including tax and agent fees, the total price is DM 2.6 million. All prices have been checked by experts.
<P>
The North German non-profit-organisation will be able to spend DM 60,000 on the project. Additional DM 200,000 have been donated by supporters since 1993. However, much more is needed: to receive a loan which we can then pay back, an additional DM 300,000 are still missing.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="BLUE"><STRONG>If you want to help</STRONG></FONT><P>
DM 300,000 necessary to finance the project are still missing. If you can support this project by donations or loans, please turn to the address below or e-mail us. We are glad to give you further information.
<P>
For people in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark, we are also able to offer memberships in regional or local support groups. These include the possibility to take a loan of DM 500 to 5,000 for the project, payable back in monthly rates of DM 15 to 150 over three years, almost without interest. If you live in another country, please ask for additional information if you are interested in this way of supporting us.
<P>
All supporters will be regularly informed about the progress of the project. In Germany, all donations are tax deductable. Please ask for information about other countries. If, against our expectations, the project should fail, we will pay your money back. For this purpose, please make sure we receive your full address and banking account no. together with your donation.
<P>
Please make donations payable to: Buddhistische Zentren Nord e.V., account 506 875 700 at Dresdner Bank Hamburg, BLZ (standard bank number) 200 800 00.
