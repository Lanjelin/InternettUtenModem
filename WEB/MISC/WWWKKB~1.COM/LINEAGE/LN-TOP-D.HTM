<FONT SIZE="+2">K</FONT>arma Kagyu Lineage is the Yogic transmission among the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It encompasses both the old (Nyingma) and the new (Sarma) teachings which reached Tibet. Being heavily practice oriented, the Kagyu is called the "oral" or the "perfection" school. The origin of the Kagyu Lineage dates back to the ninth century at the time of the full flowering of Tantric Buddhism in India. The first teacher in this tradition was <STRONG>Tilopa</STRONG>, the renowned yogi and Mahasiddha (perfected one). Tilopa received the transmission directly from Dorje Chang (<EM>skt.</EM>: Vajradhara), the celestial Buddha who symbolizes the Dharmakaya, the ultimate mind. Tilopa in turn gave the whispered teachings to <STRONG>Naropa</STRONG> who had previously been chancellor of Nalanda University in India. Naropa's twelve years of service to Tilopa are regarded as a great example of devotion to one's teacher.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he first Tibetan to receive the teaching was <STRONG>Marpa</STRONG>, the Translator, so named because of his heroic efforts to reach India on foot, searching for his teacher Naropa, and patiently practicing and translating the Mahamudra teachings into Tibetan. Marpa was a householder and landowner and he gathered around him a number of students; the main one was <STRONG>Milarepa</STRONG>. Because of the bad karma acquired through his early deeds as a sorcerer, Milarepa was submitted to years of arduous purifying labor before Marpa would grant him the teachings. Milarepa spent many years meditating in caves, gained profound illumination and was famed as a poet and saint. He died at the age of 80, at which time the lineage passed onto <STRONG>Gampopa</STRONG> who had previously been a doctor. Gampopa was the first monk of the Kagyu School and he organized the Kagyu monastic system. He also formulated the teaching in practical texts such as the "Jewel Ornament of Liberation" which outlines the gradual path to liberation.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>our major and eight minor schools originated from Gampopa's three main disciples. The major schools have all fused into the Karma Kagyu with the <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs48.htm#4897" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/lineage/teachers/karmapa.htm"><STRONG>Karmapa</STRONG></A> as the head. The first Karmapa, Dusum Chenpa, was Gampopa's most gifted disciple. He manifested great spiritual power and purity early in his life and in his sixteenth year he received a supernatural <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs48.htm#4894" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/terms/blkcrwn.htm">Black Crown</A> from dakinis and other divinities which bestowed knowledge of the past, present and future. This hat has been passed on to all the subsequent Karmapas who are reincarnations or "tulkus" of Dusum Chenpa. All the Karmapas have worked unceasingly to spread the Buddha's teaching, and are recognized as emanations of the bodhisattva <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs48.htm#4896" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/terms/chenrez.htm">Chenrezig</A> (<EM>skt.</EM>: Avalokitesvara).
