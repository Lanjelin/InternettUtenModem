<H2>The Buddha Dharma Center</H2>
<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>opon Tsechu Rinpoche wants to further the activities of H.H Karmapa through a Buddha Dharma Center. This Buddha Dharma Center is located directly next to Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche's living quarter in Kathmandu - on a quiet and beautiful site that is overlooked by the Swayambunath-Stupa.  The construction of the center started already in February 1993.  

<IMG SRC="PICT/BDC-CAD.GIF" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/pict/bdc-cad.gif" ALT="CAD drawing of the Buddha Dharma Center" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE="15" HSPACE="10" HEIGHT="292" WIDTH="409">
<H3>Reasons for the Center</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>hrough his teaching activities, Rinpoche has gained many western students. Many of these students visit Rinpoche from time to time in his house in Kathmandu - where, of course, accommodation is relatively limited, and therefore doesn't allow for extensive encounters.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>nother important reason for establishing a Dharma Center is the current situation of Buddhism in Nepal itself:  Rinpoche finds that while there are many monasteries in the Kathmandu-Valley, they don't provide "real teaching offers" for the local Buddhist lay-person.  Therefore, locals have received only scarce Dharma-teaching and seldom practice meditation.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT>inpoche wants to change these circumstances through the creation of the Dharma Center.  The Dharma Center should become a location where students from the East and West can get in contact with Mahayana-Buddhism. It will not have the function of a monastery, but will be an "open location" for the study and practice for ordained and lay-persons alike.  

<H3>Main Activities of the Buddha Dharma Center</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Teachings by Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche and other qualified teachers
<LI>Practice of mediation and meditation ritual (among them Phowa), as well
as courses to further the understanding and practicing of different inner
and outer aspects of these practices:  Visualization, Tormas, Music
(ritual), and the like.  
<LI>Establishing a Buddhist library and teaching of Tibetan and Nepalese.
<lI>Teaching (of the theory) and practice of traditional Tibetan medicine
and astrology.  
</OL>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he building is being constructed in the traditional style of a Tibetan-Buddhist temple and has 3 floors.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>n the ground floor, you will find a large temple room (Lhakang) for teachings and pujas.  On the sides there rooms are reserved for different organizational tasks (i.e. offices, kitchen, etc.). On the upper floor, directly above the Lhakang, a large library with a study-room will be created.  On the sides living quarters for Karmapa and Rinpoches, as well as for Rinpoche's visitors are planned. In the attic, you will find a small meditation room.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he building without statues, books and other inventory will cost approximately US $ 215,000.

<H3>Update on the project</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he basic structure has already been built and the Lhakang has already been put in.  Elaborate decoration and completion of the other rooms is the task for the remainder of this year (1996).
<P>
<H3>Activities after Completion:  </H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>irst of all, it will be a small "medicine-house" for medical treatment as well as for the production and storage of medicine.  Secondly, the building will host monks and nuns, as well as Rinpoche's students, who want to participate in the activities of the center.     
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>opon Tsechu Rinpoche emphasized, that it is important to him, that Dharma students from Western and Eastern Europe be near him, and don't have to stay in anonymous guest houses in the area.  Furthermore, Dharma students who have limited funds, should be able to get temporary accommodation.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he "medicine-house" and the guest-house, unlike the temple building itself, will not be constructed directly next to Rinpoche's living quarters, but close nearby.  That way some free space for the main building will remain and the garden can be utilized better.
