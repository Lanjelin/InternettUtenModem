<H3>Rainbow-Light Meditation</H3>
<PRE>
   We sit relaxed and straight, our right hand resting in our left
palm and our thumbs lightly touching. If not seated in a chair our
right calf rests on or in front of the left one, and we draw our chin
slightly in. 

   First, we calm the mind. We feel the formless stream of air,
coming and going at the tips of our noses and let thoughts and noises
pass without evaluation. 

   Then we want to meditate, to experience mind´s richness and gain
distance from any disturbing emotions. Not until then can one really
help others. 

   At the heart-level in the center of our chest, now appears a tiny
rainbow light. Gradually it expands through our body, totally filling
it and dissolving all diseases and obstacles on its way. When we can
stay with this awareness, our body shines like a lamp and light
streams in all directions, filling space. It dissolves the suffering
of beings everywhere and the world now shines with great meaning and
joy. All are in a pure land, full of limitless possibilities.
Everything is self-liberating. 
We emanate this light as long as it feels natural. 

   When we end this meditation, the light returns and absorbs the
outer world into open space. It shines into our bodies, which also
dissolve and there is now only awareness, with no form, center or
end.

   Then, like a fish jumping from the water, again a world appears.
Everything vibrates with meaning, all beings are perfect in essence
and our body and speech are tools for benefiting others. Finally, we
wish that all the conscious good which happened may become limitless
and stream out to everybody. That it will remove their suffering and
bring them the only lasting joy, the recognition of the nature of
mind.
