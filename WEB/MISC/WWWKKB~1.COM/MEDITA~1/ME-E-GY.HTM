<H2>Guru Yoga Meditation of the 16th Karmapa </H2>
<H3>Basic Meditation of the Karma Kagyu Lineage</H3>
<EM>The version of the Three Light Meditation  presented here is from the Summer of 1995. Already in the late sixties, the 16th Karmapa, Ranjung Rigpe Dorje, made Hannah and me holders of this practical and comprehensive tool for enlightenment, repeating his wish over later years that we always keep it fresh and on the cutting edge of western mind. For this reason, the focus of the meditation has shifted several times. Here it is on actively continuing the pure view obtained in meditation, into one’s daily life.
<P>
After having taken Refuge in the morning, one may informally and at any time during  the day let the Lama appear in front and receive his blessing. I know of no more effective meditation. Therefore, practice and enjoy.</EM><BR>
<P>
Yours,<BR>

<H3>Guru Yoga Meditation of the 16th Karmapa </H3>
<PRE>
   We feel the formless stream of air at the tips of our 
noses and let thoughts and feelings pass without evaluation. 
Then we focus on the four basic thoughts which turn mind towards 
liberation and enlightenment:

   We recognize our precious opportunity in this life, that we
can benefit countless beings through the methods of a Buddha. Few
ever meet beyond-dualistic teachings and even fewer are able to
use them.

   We remember the impermanence of everything composite. Only 
the unlimited clear space of mind is lasting and nobody knows how 
long conditions will remain for recognizing that.

   We understand causality. That it is up to us what will come. 
Former thoughts, words and actions became our present state and 
right now we are sowing the seeds for our future.

   Finally we see the reasons for working with mind: Enlightenment 
is timeless highest bliss and we cannot benefit others while 
confused and suffering ourselves. Not experiencing the world as we 
would wish to, we now open up to those who have that power. For 
the good of all beings we take Refuge in our goal, Buddha, the 
full development of mind; in the teachings which bring us there; 
in our friends and helpers on the way; and especially in the Lama, 
our teacher. In the Karma Kagyu Lineage he always represents the 
Karmapa, now Thaye Dorje. Uniting blessing, methods and protection, 
he is needed for our fast development.

   Now out of space in front of us, condenses the golden, 
transparent form of the 16th Karmapa - a radiant field of energy 
and light. He wears the Black Crown, the shape of which can awaken 
mind’s deepest awareness and his face is golden and mild. His eyes 
see us clearly, he knows us and wishes us everything good. 
Expressing the state of compassion and wisdom inseparable, of 
bliss and space, his crossed hands hold a dorje and bell at his 
heart. Seated in the Dorje-position, he is surrounded by masses of 
light.

   We understand that he is not a limited being but an expression 
of space as truth and the essence of all Buddhas. His presence is 
there whether we can see his form clearly or not, and we strongly 
desire to accomplish his qualities for the benefit of all.

   Knowing our wish, Karmapa comes ever closer, now remaining at 
a pleasant distance in front of us. We think or say, "Dearest 
Lama, essence of all Buddhas, of you we ask, give us your power 
which removes the ignorance and obscurations of all beings and 
ourselves. Let mind’s timeless light awaken inside us.";

   Responding to our strong wish, Karmapa smiles. Now a powerful 
clear light radiates from his forehead and enters the same place 
between our eyebrows. It fills our head with powerful crystalline 
light and dissolves all disturbing impressions in brain, nerves and 
senses. The causes of harmful habits and diseases thus disappear 
and our body becomes a conscious tool for bringing protection, 
love and material things to others. While retaining the clear 
light for as long as desired, we hear the inner vibration of the 
syllable <STRONG><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="WHITE">OM</FONT></STRONG>.

  Now, emanating from Karmapa’s throat, a radiant beam of red 
light enters our mouth and throat. Transparent and powerful, it 
dissolves all difficulties in our speech. The impressions of 
negative confused words disappear and our speech becomes 
compassion and wisdom, a conscious tool for benefiting others. 
Together with the red light, we hear the deep inner vibrations
of the syllable <STRONG><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="RED">AH</FONT></STRONG>.

   Now from the heart-center in the middle of Karmapa’s chest, 
an intense blue light shines out. It streams into the middle of 
our chest and fills it up. Thus mental difficulties disappear. 
Disturbing feelings and stiff ideas dissolve and our mind becomes 
spontaneous joy - space and bliss inseparable. Inseperable from 
the deep blue light vibrates the syllable <STRONG><FONT SIZE="+3" COLOR="BLUE">HUNG</FONT></STRONG>.

   Then, the three lights enter us at the same time. Clear light 
fills our head, red light our throat and blue light our heart. 
Thus we obtain the essential state, encompassing all. While 
receiving the lights, we can use a mantra to further unite inner 
and outer truth, here in its expression as power. Each repetition 
of <STRONG>Karmapa Chenno</STRONG> - power of all the Buddhas, work through 
us, become one with us - puts us in the stream of enlightened 
activity. We repeat it loudly or inwardly for as long as we 
like while absorbing the lights.

     <B><A HREF="../TERMS/MANTRA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/terms/mantra.htm">KARMAPA CHENNO, KARMAPA CHENNO, KARMAPA CHENNO, ........</A></B>
            (repeat mantra as long as you wish)

   Then, the golden form of Karmapa and his Black Crown dissolve 
into rainbowlight. It flows through us and all form disappears. 
Now there is only awareness with no middle or end, timeless and 
everywhere. Though thoughts or sensory impressions may appear: 
they are nothing but the free play of that space.

   When this state can no longer be held, again a world manifests, 
perfect and pure. Every atom vibrates with joy and is kept 
together by love. All is fresh and meaningful, radiant with 
unlimited potential. Beings near and far appear as female or 
male Buddhas, whether they know it or not. Sounds are Mantras 
and thoughts wisdom, for the sole reason that they can happen.

   Also our own body now condenses out of space, appearing as our 
preferred Buddha, our Lama or as our habitual form. But there is 
one major difference from before the meditation. Then, we were 
our body and thus vulnerable to old age, sickness and death. Now 
instead we have our body. Body and speech are our tools for 
benefiting others. What we really are - and we know that now - 
is that clear light which was conscious even when there was no 
form.

   We decide to keep this pure view in all situations of life 
and strengthen it whenever possible. Finally we wish that the 
good which just appeared may become limitless, stream out to all 
beings everywhere, remove all their suffering and bring them 
the only lasting joy, that of knowing their mind.
