<H2>Creative Job Search: The Job Search</H2>
<H3>AUTHOR: Kevin McDowel</H3>
<H4>Extracted from the original version</H4>
<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>ooking for work is a full-time job and is the hardest work
a person may ever do! A serious job search requires as much time
looking for work as will be spent on the job. A forty hour per
week job equals a forty hour per week job search.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>very job seeker has requirements for employment
and limitations on their current qualifications. Without clear
job search goals the search will become aimless and ineffective.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>egin your job search by gathering and organizing all the information you need to sell your qualifications and satisfy the
needs of a prospective employer. Begin by doing a thorough identification
and analysis of your skills. Employers do not just want to know
where you have been, your job titles or that you need a job, they
want to know what you can do.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT>repare a personal data sheet with all your employment
related information. This will make employment applications easier
to complete. Write resumes that advertise your skills to an employer.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>xperts agree that today the vast majority (80% or more) of
job openings are not advertised. Most employment opportunities
are hidden. (A primary reason is simply that most employers do
not need to advertise; they have enough applicants without it.
Another reason is that employers prefer to hire on a referral
from someone they trust.)
<P>
<H3>Strategies</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>here are a variety of strategies that increase the chances of identifying job openings and to break into the hidden
job market. These techniques include: networking, informational
interviewing, direct employer contact, employment services, electronic
bulletin boards and resume scanning systems.
<P>
<H3>Networking</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">N</FONT>etworking is not new, it is simply the sharing of information and resources with others. Job search networking is a targeted
effort to talk to people about your job search. It should not be limited to casual conversations with people you bump into. It should be a calculated campaign to contact people for ideas, suggestions, and information.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>egin by contacting people you know well: family, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Describe clearly what information you
are seeking. Ask for names of others you can contact to build your network list.
<P>
<H3>Informational Interviewing</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he informational interview is a networking effort targeted toward potential employers and professionals within a specific
industry. This technique is used to gather information regarding skills, training, and experience needed for an occupation. It is also a method to learn about a specific company or about an industry. Never ask for a job during an informational interview.
<P>
<H3>Direct Employer Contact</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT>irect contact, approaching employers when you do not know if they are hiring, is essential for the serious job seeker. Direct
contact takes planning and preparation. It is not enough to just
walk in and ask &quot;Are you hiring?&quot; A successful job search
is a sales campaign and your challenge is to sell your qualifications.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he first step is to develop a list of potential employers. As your job search progresses, you will continuously add to this
list. Publications you want to review include the phone book, Chamber of Commerce listings, employer profiles, industry guides and newspapers.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">O</FONT>nce you have your list then you have to plan a strategy to approach each employer. There are many approaches available and
you will want to vary them depending upon the circumstances and your preferences. You can fill out an application, send a resume, call the employer directly, or arrange for an informational interview.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>ollow-up and persistence are the keys to a successful job search! If you are serious about employment, plan your follow-up.
<P>
<H3>Private Employment Agencies</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>mployment agencies come in all shapes, sizes and prices. Some specialize in very specific occupational areas. Many employers
have exclusive arrangements with employment agencies and they can be a resource for job leads. Determine what they will do for you and how much it will cost.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>emporary agencies and contract houses are another source of employment. Increasingly employers are turning to them to help
manage their human resources. Temporary jobs are a way to build skills, gain experience and minimize the cost of reemployment.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>f you choose to use an agency, check them out very carefully and be sure you understand all the conditions of the contract.
<P>
<H3>Job Search Technologies</H3>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>here is an increase in the use of technology in job search. With the use of computers and modems a person can reach a vast
world of opportunities. Many job seekers use electronic media to identify potential employers and submit their qualifications. Employers and employment agencies use scanners to enter resumes and applications into a computer that reads, summarizes and stores the information for future consideration.
