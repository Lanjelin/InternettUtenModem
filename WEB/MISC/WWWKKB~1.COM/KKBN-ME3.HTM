<H3>Meditation on Light and Breath</H3>
<PRE>
   We sit comfortably, whether on a pillow or on a chair. Our hands
rest in our lap, the right on top of the left, palms up and thumbs
lightly touching. We keep our back straight without tightness, and
our chin pulled in a little.

   First we calm our mind. We feel the formless stream of air,
coming and going at the tips of our noses, letting thoughts and
sounds go by without holding on to them.

   Now we will meditate in order to experience mind and to gain a
distance from our disturbing emotions. Only then can we really be
useful to others.

   A foot and a half in front of our nose now appears a clear
transparent light. While we breathe in, the light moves in a stream
down through the center of our body. On its way, the clear light 
turns ever more red. Stopping briefly four fingers below the
navel, the transparent light has become totally red. When we exhale
naturally, the red light moves upward and becomes gradually more
blue. A foot and a half in front of us, the blue transparent light
again becomes clear and we inhale it once more. 
We hold this awareness without tension, while our breath comes and
goes naturally.

   If it is difficult to see the colors, we simply think: clear
light when we inhale, red light when the light stops below the navel
and blue when we exhale.

   After a while we may also focus on the vibrations of our breath.
While inhaling we hear the syllable <STRONG><FONT SIZE="+2">OM</FONT></STRONG>.

   While holding the light below the navel, we hear a deep <STRONG><FONT SIZE="+2">AH</FONT></STRONG> and 
while exhaling we hear the vibration of <STRONG><FONT SIZE="+2">HUNG</FONT></STRONG>.
We stay with this for as long as we like.
	
   At the end of the meditation, the world appears fresh and new. We
wish that all the good which just happened may become limitless,
radiate out to all beings everywhere, remove their suffering, and
give them the only lasting joy, the realization of the nature of
mind.
