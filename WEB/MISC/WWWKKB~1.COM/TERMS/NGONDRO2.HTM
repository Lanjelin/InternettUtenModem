<H2>Ngondro - Diamond Mind (<EM>tib.</EM> Dorje Sempa)</H2>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he second of the preliminaries, the 100-syllable mantra of Diamond Mind (<EM>tib.</EM> Dorje Sempa, <EM>skr.</EM> Vajrasattva), is also tantric, meaning that it works with our totality. This may be surprising since, in this practice, we are "only" sitting. But concentration on a Buddha form and on the nectar brings about a very deep change in our body, while mantras and the identification with Enlightenment transform our speech and mind.

<FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>hatever happens to us is a product of our karma. Actions in former lives lead us to a particular genetic makeup, to our deepest traits of character, and to birth in a specific place. In order to help us remove the negativity which hasn´t yet ripened, all Buddhas unite their purifying power in the form of Diamond Mind. In this second part of the Ngondro, we are given a method for burning all poisonous seeds so that we shall no longer be hampered by negativity, and the meditation is effective. We can really expect more space in our mind, less obstacles, and a clearer view which enables us to do more for others.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he name of Dorje Sempa means "the Diamond Mind", and this aspect of Enlightenment may emanate out of an all-good space in families of five or a hundred, white or in the five wisdom-colors. It may appear as a single form, in union, as an expression of great joy as Demchok, or powerfully protective as Dorje Phurba (<EM>skr.</EM> Vajra Kilaya). I don´t know any other aspect that can be realized through so many different meditations, all ultimately  changing everything into Ogmin, the Pure Land of "No Down." In the Ngondro, however, since the aim is deep purification, we meditate on the single, peaceful aspect and emphasize the developing phase of holding him above us and repeating the mantra. Therefore, the dissolving phase of identifying and becoming one with him is kept short.

<FONT SIZE="+2">F</FONT>inally, a few words about practice. The goal is always the spontaneous, effortless state of awareness, and the quickest way to get there is by identifying  with perfection. Either going the direct way of simply being fearless, spontaneously joyful, and actively compassionate, or the indirect one of meditating on forms which clearly are so, nothing works better. The essential thing in such "visualizations" is that the mind "knows" what it´s opening up to. For example, I may ask you what the house of yours parents looked like and you will know; you will have a feeling of it whether there is a visual image or not. It´s this knowingness which gives the experience. Everyone can dream. No one has a "blind" mind. So, be confident in the richness of space. Understand that Enlightenment is there whenever we even think of it. Devotion to our Lama and Refuge are all that we need, for without confidence and devotion, there is no Diamond Way.
