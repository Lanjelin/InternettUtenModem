Ven. Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT>inpoche was born in Bhutan in 1918. At the age of seven he became a monk in Phunaka Dzong, one of the biggest Bhutanese monasteries. When he was 13 years old he accompanied his teacher Ngawang Palzang Rinpoche, a great Drukpa Yogi, to Nepal. There he received full training and meditated under severe conditions in the holy places of Guru Rinpoche and in Milarepa’s caves.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">L</FONT>ater Rinpoche returned to Bhutan and completed his  studies. Afterwards he travelled to Nepal with his lama and accomplished several retreats to master his meditation. He undertook pilgrimages to monasteries and holy places in Tibet, where he met H.H. the 16th Karmapa for the first time. His Holiness became one of Rinpoche’s most important masters. Rinpoche received most of the teachings and transmissions of the Karma Kagyu Lineage from Him.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n the years to follow, Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche became very important for Dharma practitioners in Nepal, establishing a number of monasteries and nunneries that serve the indigenous Buddhist population of Sherpas, Tamangs and Tsumbas. Rinpoche gives unceasing support for the restoration of old stupas, meditation places and monasteries, and built many "Om Mani Peme Hung" prayer wheels.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>ecause of his vast activity spanning many decades, Rinpoche is regarded as the key figure holding together the diverse Buddhist community in Nepal. The immense power of his compassion is felt by people of every background and has accomplished benefit for all.
