<H2>The 14th Shamar Rinpoche - Mipam Chokyi Lodro</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he first Shamarpa, Khedrup Drakpa Senge, was the pricipal disciple of the 3rd <A HREF="KARMAPA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/teachers/karmapa.htm">Karmapa</A>. The Karmapa presented him with a ruby red crown, an exact replica of his own <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs48.htm#4894" tppabs="http://www.kkbn.com/terms/blkcrwn.htm">black crown</A>. This was to be a symbol of their identicalness -  this disciple was in every respect his equal. With the red crown, the Karmapa bestowd on him the name, "The Shamarpa - The One With The Red Crown." As stated in the Good Kalpa Sutra: "In future, a Mahabodhisattva with a ruby red crown will come to the suffering multitude, leading them out of their cyclic bewilderment and misery".

<FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>n the Shamarpa, the Sakyamuni's prediction was fulfilled. The Shamarpas have reincarnated since the 14th century as either student or teacher to the Karmapas. Shamar Rinpoche is now in his 14th incarnation as Mipam Chokyi Lodro. He was born as the nephew of the 16th Karmapa. After Karmapa's death, Shamar Rinpoche undertook the project of completing a large institute of Buddhist studies in New Delhi. According to Karmapa's wishes, the <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs44.htm#4458" tppabs="http://www2.best.com/~hhtd/kibi.htm">Karmapa International Buddhist Institute</A> (KIBI) is to serve as an establishment of higher learning to further universal wisdom and compassion, based on the correct study and translation of the great treatises of Buddhism.
