He received extensive teachings from the Karmapa, who, during his first visit in the West, left him there as his representative. Since that time, Lama Jigme Rinpoche is guiding Karmapa’s main seat in Europe, Dhagpo Kagyu Ling in France.

Besides his great organizational skills, he is highly respected as a lama. Many have already benefited greatly from his profound knowledge, his understanding of western lifestyle, and his practical wisdom, warmth and humor.
