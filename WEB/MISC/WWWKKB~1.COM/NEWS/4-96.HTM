<H3>THE SITUATION OF KARMA BERCHEN LING IN KORINTHOS/GREECE</H3>
After the burning of Buddhist retreat Berchen Ling in winter this year,
it looked like the Buddhist activity in Greece might be coming to a sad
end.(see our article from April ´96) The hysterical press campaign
launched by the local church was expanding out of control. The local
Buddhists, accused of everything from satanic practices to luring
innocent Greek farmers in order to convert them to their heathen creed,
were on the defensive, fully intimidated by the fury of the attacks.
Their jobs, their homes, their everyday lives were seriously threatened
by the insolent assault. Raging, fanatical priests were levelling ever
more ridiculous demands. To bring their threats closer home, a court in
Tessaloniki sentenced Ms Hara Kalomeri to three months in jail for the
"hideous crime" of running a Buddhist centre. (See the verdict in the
Hara Kalomeri case in March ´96/Tessaloniki.). In its zeal to eradicate
Buddhism from its country, the orthodox church went clearly overboard
Slowly, however, a number of less frantic voices could be heard above the
hateful clamour of the priesthood and their flock of blind supporters. A
few conscious-stricken intellectuals timidly called for some amount of
restraint and a measure of tolerance. At that point, the members of the
Athens Buddhist group led by Lama Ole, decided to take matters into their
own hands. First of all, our friends had to confront the nasty campaign
the church was waging against Buddhism. With the help of good lawyers
they try to establish a legal, solid base for the functioning of the
Dharma in the country. This is a difficult task, since any non-orthodox
religion is totally forbidden by an old decree signed by the dictator
Metaxa in 1938. The medieval rule, in open challenge to the European
Union laws, is still very much in force today and looms ominously over
the heads of those who would jointly dare worship or practise anything
other than the true faith of the Orthodox Christianity. If it hadn’t been
for the ubiquitous Christian terminology, one might have mistaken today’s
Greece with the Iran of the mullhas, which is the only other country
where similar laws exist officially.
<P>
Such was the general climate when in May we left Athens to visit our
destroyed retreat-place. Representing our friends from Germany who last
summer helped to build the now burned down houses and in defiance of the
hostile atmosphere against our work, we arrived at the desolate scene of
what was once a growing, meditation centre. Here, away from the bustle of
the more critical capital, we got an unexpected glimpse into the ways and
dealings of the orthodox  church and its "secret-police" methods.
A tip from the neighbours lead us to a priest in Korinthos. We clearly
surprised him with our visit and taking advantage of the initial
confusion, immediately demanded an end to the defaming rumours and
slandering press campaign waged by the church against us. Overcoming a
first shock, the outspoken cleric rushed with aplomb into a relentless
attack on the foes of the church that he unmistakably saw within the
rather thin and certainly far from bellicose ranks of Greek Buddhists. It
turned out that he was also well informed about the different Buddhist
groups in the country - he even produced a secret list with the names of
people he considered sworn enemies of the orthodox hierarchy. Lama Ole
Nydahl was prominently on the list. Defiant, he boldly declared that the
church had been sending spies to our courses for years and that it was
his personal mission to carry on with a crusade against Buddhism in
Greece. Yet, in the end he tried to avoid a direct confrontation and
„offered" to leave us in peace if we just went on with our work on
Berchen Ling, - "The Black Mountain". How much, and if at all, we can
trust his words, is of course an open question. 
<P>
Although our closest neighbours encouraged us to come back and promised
their support, this is not possible as long as the juristic situation in
Greece is not cleared. Right now we could be easily stopped by legal
means if the Metaxa laws were applied. The first step is to put pressure
on the government, both from within and from outside Greece, to have the
medieval laws, governing the religious freedom in the country, fully
abolished. 
<P>
In the end, despite the obvious obstacles, we decided to keep the
beautiful place in the mountains open. Everybody is invited to go there
to help and meditate. Still, the main activity will be reduced to summer
courses. The original plan of a whole year retreat-centre is, for the
time being, cancelled. But by keeping the place alive, we are fully
determined to fight for some measure of religious freedom in Greece and
bring the country in line with the XXth century laws of the European
Union.
<P>
At this point we are glad to announce that there will be a Ngondro-course
in Berchen Ling with Lama Ole Nydahl in June next year. (13.7-15.7 1997).
<P>
Any kind of help is most welcome!
