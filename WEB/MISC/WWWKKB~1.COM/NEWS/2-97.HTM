<H3>News from Bulgaria</H3>
In december our friends in Bulgaria managed to buy a beautiful piece of
land near Varna, with an incredible view over the Black Sea. It&#180;s meant
to be an important place for buddhism in the balkans.
<P>
It took more than one and a half years to overcome all obstacles,
because, in the former communist, and now again socialist country, the
laws of land ownership are very difficult and complicated.
<P>
At the same time it took the local center in Varna two years to get a
registration as a Karma Kagyu Yoga Union. The uprising orthodox church of
Bulgaria, in alliance with their former surpressors, the socialist party
produced a repressive law against religious minorities, which left very
little space for a legal existence as a buddhist group.
<P>
As everybody probably knows from the newspapers, Bulgaria is at the
moment in deep crisis. The economy has totally broken down, there is a
tremendous hyperinflation, prices and rents are increasing steadily while
at the same time the salleries are reduced and not being paid anyway.
Traveling through the country we met high educated people with jobs, who
however had to sell their furniture to buy food for their families.
<P>
Under these circumstances it is really admirable that there are a few
idealists to spite of all difficulties with enough surplusenergy, to work
for the development of the Dharma. For them it is a great joy, that with
the new land they are now able to arrange the first larger dharma course
with Lama Ole in Bulgaria. Everybody is kindly invited to take part.
Through our joint work and the meditations with Lama Ole the new land
will be blessed and the seeds for future growth will be laid. The main
work necessary is cleaning up the place and erecting a fence.
After work your strained bodies will have the chance to relax in one of
the hot springs nearby or swimming in the Black Sea.
<P>
The course will take place from June 18th till June 22nd. During
that time there are always cheap flights to Varna, ask in your local
travel agency. And very important, please bring tents, sleeping bags and
your own crockery!
<p>
For further information please contact us. Here is our new address
