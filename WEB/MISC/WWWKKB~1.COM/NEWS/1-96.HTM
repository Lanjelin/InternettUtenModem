<H3>REPRESENTATIVE OF TIBET ATTENDS THE INAUGURATION CEREMONY OF PRESIDENT
     OF THE KALMYK REPUBLIC IN RUSSIAN FEDERATION</H3>
     MOSCOW, October 26, 1995; (OT-Moscow) --   The Government and Parliament
of Kalmyk Republic invited Representative of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in
Moscow, Mr. Nawang Rabgyal, to attend the oath-taking and inauguration
ceremony of Kalmyk President, Mr. Kirsan Ilumzhinov, which took place in
Elista, the capital of Kalmyk, on October 21, 1995.
<P>
     Among many guests from republics in Russian Federation, the
Representative of Tibet was  the only foreign guest speaker. While
congratulating the Kalmyk President on behalf of Tibetans, Mr. Rabgyal
outlined the historical relationship between Tibet and Kalmyk, which are
close and united together by their common traditional culture.
<P>
     Mr. K.Ilumzhinov was re-elected to second-term presidency of Kalmyk
Republic, a traditional Buddhist region in European part of Russia.  He will
be visiting Dharamsala on 6 to 11 November 1995 to meet His Holiness the
Dalai Lama.
<P>
     The Kalmyk President will also attend the inauguration of Norbulingka
Institute, at the invitation of the Department of Religious & Cultural
Affairs of Central Tibetan Administration-in-exile.  His entourage includes
Chairman of Kalmyk Parliament, Culture Minister and other 6 officials and TV
reporter.
<P>
     Tibet and Kalmyk has had long historical contacts.  The 5th Great Dalai
Lama unified Tibet with assistance of Gurshri Khan, who was supported by
chieftans of Qirat and Torgut Mongols, who were ancestors of Kalmyk nation.
Some historians believe that the origin of Kalmyk ancestors was from Kokonor
region. For seven decades there were no direct contacts between Tibet and
Kalmyk, due to external circumstances.
<P>
     Since the first visit of the Dalai Lama to Kalmyk Republic in 1991,
there has been growing cultural contacts and cooperation between Dharamsala
and Elista.  The Friends of Tibet Society was formed in Kalmyk in 1992 and it
has been very supportive of Tibetan cause.
