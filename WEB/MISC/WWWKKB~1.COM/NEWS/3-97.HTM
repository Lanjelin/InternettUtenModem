<H3>Letter from Shamar Rinpoche to the Dalai Lama</H3>
From:<BR>
<B>Office His Holiness The Dalai Lama</B>
<P>
To:<BR>
<B>Shamar Rinpoche, Holder of the Karma Kagyu Lineage.</B>
<P>
I hereby send you our response to the points you raised at your 
meeting on the 3rd of January 1997 with H.H. the Dalai Lama.
(List of the points you mentioned during the meeting:)
<P>
You expressed the desire that H.H. the Dalai Lama meets with and 
gives the novice-vows of monastic ordination to the young reincarnate 
of H. H. the XVIth Karmapa (who you have recognised) and that the 
young reincarnate's parents also meet with H. H. the Dalai Lama.
<P>
You said that Chobgye Tri Rinpoche also recognises the same reincarnate.
<P>
You also requested the Dalai Lama's permission that Ogyen Thinley 
be the Throne-Holder of the Karmapa's seat in Tibet Tsurphu Monastery 
and that the reincarnate that you have recognised be the Holder of 
the Karmapa's seat in India, Rumtek Monastery.
<P>
Our response:
<P>
In the past you've repeatedly informed H. H. the Dalai Lama that the 
late Karmapa left instructions regarding the circumstances of his future 
reincarnation with a bhikshu who has adhered to the moral ethics of 
monastic tradition in a very pure manner and that when the time is 
right you would inform H. H. the Dalai Lama of the contents of these 
instructions. H. H. the Dalai Lama responded that if there is an 
authentic source regarding these instructions, a second 
Karmapa-reincarnation is a possibility. However, at His Holiness's 
recent meeting with you, when analysing the implications of what you 
said, it seems to us that the older bhikshu you have spoken of is 
Chobgye Tri Rinpoche.
<P>
We, on the 18th of January 1997, through our representative in 
New Delhi, gave you a copy of a letter from Chobgye Tri Rinpoche 
addressed to H. H. the Dalai Lama. In 1996 our representative 
in Nepal approached Chobgye Tri Rinpoche to ask how he had recognised 
the reincarnate that you have put forth. Chobgye Tri Rinpoche, 
in response, wrote to H. H. the Dalai Lama that he hadn't made 
the recognition. This letter made it clear that you don't have an 
authentic source for your claim. Thus, there is no possibility 
of a second Karmapa-reincarnation.
<P>
There can be just one head of the Tsurphu and Rumtek Monasteries. 
There is no possibility of two heads. H. H. the Dalai Lama has 
clearly & comprehensively recognised the Karmapa-reincarnation 
residing in Tibet. Regarding this there is no room for change.
Also you, at a previous meeting with our representative of the 
Department of Religious Affairs and representatives of the various 
Tibetan Religious Lineages, said that you have no intention of creating 
disturbance regarding the position associated with the traditional 
seat of the Karmapas.
<P>
Regarding H. H. the Dalai Lama's meeting with and giving monastic 
ordination to the reincarnate, we said that it is very important to 
consult with and clarify all details with the Situ and Gyaltsab 
Rinpoches as well as their associates. Your response was that 
this can be done, that it can be done through the Department of 
Religious Affairs. Thus the Department of Religious Affairs has 
sent the minutes of your meeting with H. H. the Dalai Lama to 
you and the individuals associated with this issue.
<P>
On the 29th of January Gyaltsab Rinpoche, Trangu Rinpoche, a 
representative of Situ Rinpoche, two Kagyu-representatives, the 
treasurer of the Black Hat tradition, the president of the small 
Zung Drel Association, the president of the Sikkim Hla-De Association, 
the vice-president of the Himalaya Association, representatives of 
nineteen centers in eight countries, seventy-nine representatives 
of thirty-two monasteries in India and Nepal called on the 
Ministers of the Tibetan Government in exile on the 29th of January. 
They also called on H. H. the Dalai Lama on the 30th of January. 
In brief they discussed what is outlined below. The people 
meeting with H.H. the Dalai Lama told him that as to the history 
of the Karmapas and associated predictions there has, up till now, 
never been, at the same time, a number of reincarnations, such 
as reincarnations of body, speech and mind. Also, if His Holiness 
gives an audience and monastic vows to the young reincarnate, 
problems and arguments in the Kamtsang Kagyu Lineage will never 
come to an end. Therefore, the individuals present insisted, it 
isn't feasible to recognise the young reincarnate as a body, 
speech or mind incarnation of the Karmapa or to give an audience 
and monastic vows.
<P>
Therefore, for the sake of preventing further problems and for 
the sake of reconciliation, H. H. the Dalai Lama can not give 
an audience or monastic vows to the young reincarnate for 
the time being. Please keep this in mind.

<P>
<B>LETTER OF REPLY FROM SHAMAR RINPOCHE</B>
<P>
<P>
To<BR>
<B>The Private Office of the Dalai Lama.<BR>
Dharamsala</B>
<P>
Feb. 7, 1997
<P>
I have received your letter dated the 3rd of Feb. 1997, where
you informed me of H. H. the Dalai Lama's decision concerning
the topics I discussed with him on the 3rd of Jan. 1997. What
was decided then has, according to your letter, changed. There
are, in your letter of the 3rd of Feb., points you did not
discuss at the meeting. It may be that you forgot to mention
those points while we were talking face to face. It seems that
you after our meeting remembered those points, points that are
far removed from the truth, and that you then wanted to
communicate them. I have stated my response to each of your
points below.
<P>
Chobgye Tri Rinpoche is a Lama that I have respect for and faith
in. Therefore, what he told me in private about the late
Karmapa's reincarnation I regard as the auspicious words of a
holy man. However, I took his indication to be one source among
others and to be investigated. Fundamentally, it is on the basis
of my own efforts that I have arrived at my decision. I have
pursued many avenues, until there were absolutely no doubts in
my mind. I have, in using traditional methods, supplicated
enlightened deities in order to receive their indications. I
have no need for requesting the assistance of Chobgye Tri
Rinpoche or any other individual. H. H. the XVIth Karmapa
Rigpa'i Dorje recognised me to be the Shamar reincarnation. It
is over thirty years ago that he enthroned me and established
this. In the Karma Kamtsang Lineage the Shamarpas are the
authority adjoining that of the Karmapas. Thus there is no
individual to succeed a Shamarpa in taking the decision who is
the authentic reincarnation of a Karmapa. However, I do not
insist upon tradition for the sake of forcing others to comply
with my decision. It is up to the Karma Kamtsang follower
whether or not  he desires to respect tradition or chooses
another approach.
<P>
During our recent meeting we just touched on the subject of
Chobgye Tri Rinpoche and the associated issue. I have, during
the Karma Kagyu Conference in New Delhi 1996, clearly explained
each and every detail of my encounter with him and the
tape-recordings of the Conference are available everywhere. I'm
aware of that Chobgye Tri Rinpoche was approached by your
representative in Nepal and that Chobgye Tri Rinpoche gave his
response in a letter to H. H. the Dalai Lama. He wrote me too
and I have enclosed a copy of his letter. Thus it is clear that
the details I disclosed at the Karma Kagyu Conference ten months
ago accord with the truth. As you mentioned in your letter, at
my recent meeting with H. H. the Dalai Lama I did not go into
these details. This is because I presumed that H. H. the Dalai
Lama has knowledge of them as the resolutions of the same
Conference are common knowledge. However, you pretend that I
implied that Chobgye Tri Rinpoche is the person I have knowledge
of as the individual who is in possession of H. H. the Karmapa
Rigpa'i Dorje's instructions as to his reincarnation. In fact, I
did not utter one word in this direction to H. H. the Dalai
Lama. I also did not say that the person in question is a
bhikshu upholding moral ethics in a very pure manner. What I did
say was that this individual is a disciple of the late Karmapa,
a disciple who has kept his relationship with the Karmapa pure
and who the late Karmapa held in high esteem. In 1994 when I met
with H. H. the Dalai Lama at the Centaur Hotel close to New
Delhi's Airport he said, that the person in question would be a
bhikshu upholding pure moral ethics. At the time I immediately
responded that this is not the case. At our recent meeting H. H.
the Dalai Lama stated the same thing again, but as I thought it
quite unimportant I did not attempt to correct him which I now
apologise for. However, your mention of a bhikshu's moral ethics
also apply to the discipline of a bodhisattva, so in fact it is
not necessary to correct your words.
<P>
It was for the sake of showing respect to H. H. the Dalai Lama
that I requested an audience with His Holiness on behalf of the
young reincarnate of the late Karmapa. It is common knowledge
that during the later part of the late Karmapa's life, H. H. the
Dalai Lama and H. H. the Karmapa were in constant opposition.
For the sake of discontinuing this trend I did my best to
establish an auspicious connection when requesting that H. H.
the Dalai Lama gives monastic vows to the late Karmapa's
reincarnation, who I have recognised. I never requested that His
Holiness acknowledge the young reincarnate as a body, speech or
mind incarnation. I have no need at all for such an
acknowledgement because H. H. the Karmapa is not obliged to
request permission to take rebirth in this world. The claim that
he needs a visa to enter this world is laughable to each and
every individual in the three realms that make up our universe.
China's new political trend has allowed the recognitions of the
Karmapa and the Panchen. In this situation the Private Office of
the Dalai Lama's political response was inadequate. The Office
made public that China's choice of the Karmapa's reincarnation
is authentic but it rejected China's choice of the Panchen's
reincarnation for its own gain.
<P>
I, the Shamar reincarnation, have put an end to the attempts to
drag the Lineage of the Karmapas in the dirt. This, to prevent
politics from entering the ways of religion, is of benefit not
just to the Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism, but to all schools
that are based in a lineage of successive reincarnated masters.
To prevent this is extremely beneficial in terms of remaining
self-governing. The Private Office of the Dalai Lama stated,
among other things, that it would merely consider to allow a
body, speech or mind reincarnation of the late Karmapa on the
basis of a reliable letter of instruction by the late Karmapa.
This amounts to a medieval dictatorial command and I understand
that this is the approach that you desire. But it is completely
unacceptable to me. Our Karmapa Thinley Thaye Dorje is
completely beyond the trap of such deceptive political schemes.
As is known throughout the world he is fully established as one
of the twenty-one Karmapas  in accordance with the prophecy of
the fifth Karmapa Deshin Shegpa. There is no need whatsoever to
request a reconfirmation of this fact in the disguise of a body,
speech or mind reincarnation. Such a reconfirmation has never
before, from the time of the first Karmapa D&uuml;sum Khyenpa, been
required. So why would it be necessary today?
<P>
Similarly, with respect to Rumtek Monastery, the then Dharma
King  of Sikkim offered that property to H. H. the Gyalwa
Karmapa Rigpa'i Dorje who constructed his seat there. As H. H.
the Dalai Lama, from the time of H. H. the Gyalwa Karmapa
Rigpa'i Dorje, has never had any right of influence there, there
is absolutely no need for his permission to allow or not to
allow a Karmapa to take possession of his rightful seat.
However, Situ bribed the previous Chief Minister of Sikkim Mr.
Nar Bhadur Bhandari who, using the local armed forces, took over
the Monastery by force. But Mr. Bhandari lost the election. Now,
Rumtek Monastery is subject to litigation in the Indian courts.
This legal dispute is the only circumstance that hinders the
young reincarnate from going there. His going there does not
depend on a permission from H. H. the Dalai Lama. All of us are
the same in that we are refugees. Why bother to request
permission to enter Sikkim from a fellow refugee? The fact that
H. H. the Dalai Lama does not have the authority to prevent the
supreme Karmapa Thaye Dorje to occupy his throne, to take
possession of his monastery in New Delhi, clearly demonstrates
that he also has no right of influence over Rumtek Monastery.
Rumtek Monastery is situated in India, because of that and for
many other reasons I, out of concern, insisted on requesting H.
H. the Dalai Lama that this kind of immoderate course of action
that can not achieve its aim be given up. I did say that we will
not attempt to obtain influence over the Tsurphu seat of
Karmapa Ugyen Thinley. Similarly, as Rumtek Monastery is
situated in India, neither the Government of China nor Gyalwa
Karmapa Ugyen Thinley have laid claim to Rumtek Monastery. All
Monasteries and Institutions in India that belonged to the late
Gyalwa Karmapa Rigpa'i Dorje, the Rumtek Monastery: the Karmapa
Institute in New Delhi and other branches in India the late
Karmapa, who was the legal possessor, transferred to the Karmapa
Charitable Trust. Therefore, if the Private Office of the Dalai
Lama makes a lot of inadmissible claims as to property that does
not belong to it, the rumours that the Tibetan Government in
Exile is up to placating the Government of China for its own
purposes, that the Tibetan Government in Exile tries to make out
that Sikkim is part of Tibet will be proven to be true. Thus,
both the name of the Dalai Lama and his aims will be negatively
affected. 
<P>
Furthermore, regarding the great Gyalwa Karmapa obtaining an
audience with H. H. the Dalai Lama, you spoke of difficulties,
that you among other things, must request the permission of Situ
Rinpoche. This is clearly stated in your letter. Just so, it is
satisfactory for us if the present decision to not grant an
audience is maintained for as long as the Karmapa is not yet an
adult as our primary concern regards his education. Another
reason for why an audience is not desirable at this point is
that we have lost our country and we have taken refuge in India.
Situ and Gyaltsab can not meet here in India because Situ is
barred from entering the country and Gyaltsab is barred  from
leaving the country as both of them have transgressed the laws
of India. It is simply because of the kindness of the Indian
Government, the fact that this country's policies are
peace-loving, that they at this point have not been imprisoned.
Personally, I have not fallen into the abyss of having to ask
for permission from two of the most discredited individuals
among us refugees.
<P>
Our Karmapa, the supreme Thinley Thaye Dorje, resides in India
where the government shows respect and veneration for him. India
is a country of great consequence for Tibet and the Tibetans. It
is the source of Tibetan Buddhism and it is the country that
gave shelter and protection to the Tibetans who fled Tibet in
1959. India has showed us Tibetans great kindness. Two of the
most powerful nations in Asia are India and China, and as I
mentioned above, the Indian Government holds Karmapa Thaye Dorje
in high esteem. To attempt to gain circumstances better than
those would amount to discarding with a diamond in order to
obtain a semi-precious stone. We are perfectly satisfied with
the present state of affairs, our joy is comparable to the joy
of samadhi (meditative absorption) at the highest level. As you
know, all of us are dependent on the Government of India for our
welfare, there are no other options. With respect to our Lineage
it is up to us, who are part of that lineage, to achieve its
aims. Right now, except for the situation at Rumtek Monastery,
our aims have been accomplished. The Rumtek Monastery property,
its land and its movable assets are protected as a result of my
efforts. Regarding the difficulties of the monk-body, the Sikkim
Police Force is charged with keeping order. These difficulties
are to be resolved by the court, that is how law abiding
individuals go about solving disputes. Therefore, we're simply
waiting for the court's ruling.
<P>
H. H. the Dalai Lama, in terms of his responsibilities, has
until now, again and again, advised the Tibetans in exile to be
prepared to go back to Tibet, that they shouldn't set up their
permanent homes outside Tibet, that they shouldn't even set up
furniture in their homes. To make efforts toward going back to
Tibet is His Holiness's responsibility, but the Rumtek Monastery
is not. Therefore, my final request to the Private Office of the
Dalai Lama is that it does not involve His Holiness's name in
this problematic issue because Rumtek Monastery is a Sikkim
Monastery and as such there is no possibility of bringing it
with one to Tibet. In your letter of the 3rd of Feb. you clearly
stated that if our young reincarnate is granted an audience with
H. H. the Dalai Lama there would be endless problems. If this is
your true view-point why did you then from the very beginning
act as the very people who added fuel to this fire of problems.
The consequence of this course of action is that the people of
Sikkim have come to suffer the most. Would it be of any benefit
if H. H. the Dalai Lama appears as the individual who has
created disturbance in one of the states in India? I request you
to apply a more far-seeing approach. You ought to be cautious in
your undertakings! The blazing fire of political schemes ignited
by Situ and Gyaltsab who used the Karmapa reincarnation as a
pretext was, on the basis of peaceful means, put out by me
before it had consumed everything. Documents relating to the
course of events, from the beginning to the end, prove this. But
is it not the case that  H. H. the Dalai Lama, in that he has
accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, should act on the basis of
methods that bring about peace and happiness, methods that are a
hundred times more peace-loving than my own. Recently, a group
of people associated with Situ and Gyaltsab obtained an audience
in Dharamsala with H. H. the Dalai Lama. They made out that they
represent a large number of monasteries and Buddhist Centres in
many countries. But we know very well who they are. Previously,
Situ and his associates bribed the then Chief Minister of
Sikkim, Mr. Nar Bhadur Bhandari who by then had become
dictatorial. In consequence, they destroyed their root-Guru's
seat, which is an extremely evil deed. At the time Mr. Kunzang
Sherab, who, I was told, is in the present under investigation
by CBI (the Central Bureau of Investigation), and his
associates, among others a group of juvenile delinquents from
Lal Bazaar, Gangtok, gave gifts of food and clothing to a number
of crazed Sikkim subjects. Thus, they were able to bring these
individuals to Rumtek. The resulting gathering they referred to
as 'The International Kagyu Meeting'. At this 'Meeting'
resolutions that are blatant distortions of the truth were made.
The resolutions they then submitted to the Land Revenue Office
of Gangtok. The Office came to know that the 'Meeting' had no
legal authority to take the decisions it had taken, that it in
fact was illegal. Therefore, the Office did not accept the
resolutions. It is these very individuals who had an audience
with H. H. the Dalai Lama. But as we are not children, we are
far from being impressed either by these people or their number.
If, hypothetically, these people were who they pretend to be, as
I mentioned earlier, they are still associated with two of the
most discredited people in our community, that is, they are
followers of lawless individuals. Therefore, we are not at all
impressed. Furthermore, I was told that H. H. the Karmapa's
General Secretary was among this group of people during their
audience with H. H. the Dalai Lama. Regarding this, the late
Karmapa Rigpa'i Dorje appointed two General Secretaries. The
older General Secretary passed away many years ago. The younger
General Secretary, Tragpa Yongdu, nephew of the late Karmapa, is
still alive and well. Therefore we enquired at the Embassy of
China if the Tibetan Karmapa Ugyen Thinley had dispatched a
General Secretary to H. H. the Dalai Lama's residence in
Dharamsala. The answer was that this is not 
the case, that not a single person has been sent to Dharamsala.
So, be aware of that the 'General Secretary' who came to His
Holiness' residence is an impostor.
