<H3>DHARAMSALA CONDEMNS PRETENDER PANCHEN LAMA'S ENTHRONEMENT TODAY</H3>
Expresses concern over the safety of Tibetans' real Panchen Lama
<P>
DHARAMSALA, 8 Dec. - The Tibetan Administration-in-exile condemned China's
enthronement of a pretender Panchen Lama today as "invalid and illegal."
<P>
"The pretender Panchen Lama's enthronement goes against the wishes of the
Tibetan people, and the Tibetan people will never accept this," said Kalon
Sonam Topgyal, the chairman of the Kashag of the Dharamsala-based Tibetan
Administration.
<P>
Gyaltsen Norbu, the rival Panchen Lama selected by the Chinese leadership
over the choice of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, has been formally enthroned
today by the Chinese communist authorities in Tibet at Tashi Lhunpo
Monastery, the traditional spiritual seat of the Panchen Lamas of Tibet,
according to reports coming from Tibet.
<P>
The enthronement ceremonies began at 10:30 AM today, Beijing time, amid
unprecedented security measures. Those selected audience invited to the
enthronement ceremony by the Chinese authorities have been issued with
identity cards, and members of the Public Security Bureau manned the main
entrance to the monastery's sprawling courtyard to check the ID cards of
those entering the monastery. Those without ID cards, even if they are monks
of the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, were refused admission.
<P>
More than 500 soldiers of China's People's Liberation Army were spread
throughout the monastery compound to overcome any potential disturbance.
<P>
Kalon Sonam Topgyal said, "the so-called enthronement of the so-called
Panchen Lama goes against the beliefs, traditions and religious practices of
the Tibetan people."
<P>
Kalon Sonam Topgyal expressed concern about the personal safety of Gedhun
Choekyi Nyima, the boy recognised by His Holiness the Dalai Lama as the
authentic Panchen Lama on 14 May. "We are appealing to human rights
organizations throughout the world to impress upon the Chinese leadership of
the importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of the true Panchen
Lama," the kalon added.<BR><BR>
