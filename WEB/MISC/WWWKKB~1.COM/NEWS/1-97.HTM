<H3>The New Stupa in Auenb&uuml;ttel</H3>
On July 16th 1996 our stupa was finished by ven. Tsechou Rinpoche. He stayed 
two days with us and as erverything was well prepared by Heiner and our 
sangha-members we succeded in getting everything ready on 2 pm, when Rinpoche started the Ramne-Puja and by that activated the power of the stupa. More than 150 women and men participated in the ceremony which included a long-life-initiation. We all are very thankful to Rinpoche for his work. 
<P>
It is dedicated to the 17th Karmapa Taye Dorje.
<P>
At the moment the statue inside the stupa is still 8th Karmapa, a donation 
from the Buddhist Centre Passau.
<p>
Rinpoche decided that it should  n o t  stay inside. As it is dedicated to 
the 17th Karmapa, it should be a statue of Tsepagme. He promised us to order 
one at Katmandu when he would return there.
<P>
People from Danmark, Poland, Austria, Tchechia and Germany helped us since 
serveral months and weeks before. Especially it is a work done by the 
neighbour centres Kiel, L&uuml;beck, Langenhorn, Braderup (Sylt), Holzbunge, 
L&uuml;neburg, Osnabr&uuml;ck and the Lolland Centre from Danmark.
<p>
Thank You all very much !
<P>
The state now is that the chorten itself is ready, but the white colour is 
missing and the stones to walk around. It will start this summer and we 
again need some money for that. Everything else is already paid from the 
lot of money we got from You all. Thank You for all Your donations !
<P>
There is still some money left, but it is not enough for getting the paving.
We hope that it is longing for the colouring and the preparations therefore.
<P>
Many thanks to our architect Woytek Kossowski and his wife Maggie who always 
answered our question and made the building  p o s s i b l e  !
<P>
