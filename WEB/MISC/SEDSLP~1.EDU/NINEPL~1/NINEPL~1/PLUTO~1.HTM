&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n Greek mythology, Pluto (Greek:
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS61.HTM#6107" tppabs="http://www.pantheon.org/mythica/articles/h/hades.html">Hades</a>)
       is the
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS61.HTM#6108" tppabs="http://www.pantheon.org/mythica/articles/r/realm_dead.html">god of the underworld</a>.
       The planet received this name (after many
       <a href="HYPO~1.HTM#plutonames" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/hypo.html#plutonames">other suggestions</a>) perhaps
       because it's so far from the Sun that it is in perpetual darkness
       and perhaps because "PL" are the initials of
       <a href="HELP~1.HTM#lowell" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#lowell">Percival Lowell</a>.
<p cl>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto was discovered in 1930 by a fortunate accident.  Calculations
       which later turned out to be in error had predicted a planet beyond
       <a href="NEPTUN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html">Neptune</a>, based on the motions of
       <a href="URANUS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html">Uranus</a> and Neptune.  Not knowing of the error,
       <a href="HELP~1.HTM#tombaugh" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#tombaugh">Clyde W. Tombaugh</a>
       at <a href="HELP~1.HTM#lowell" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#lowell">Lowell</a> Observatory in
       Arizona did a very careful sky survey which turned up Pluto anyway.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>fter the discovery of Pluto, it was quickly determined that Pluto was too small
       to account for the discrepancies in the orbits of the other planets.
       The search for <a href="HYPO~1.HTM#planetx" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/hypo.html#planetx">Planet X</a> continued but
       nothing was found.  Nor is it likely that it ever will be: the discrepancies
       vanish if the mass of Neptune determined from the 
       <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#Voyager2" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#Voyager2">Voyager 2</a> encounter with Neptune
       is used.  There is no tenth planet.
<p>
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS6.HTM#651" tppabs="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/09.html"><img align=left alt="" border=0 width=101 height=99 src="THUMB/PLUTOHST.GIF" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/thumb/plutohst.gif" hspace=4></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto is the only planet that has not been visited by a spacecraft.
       Even the <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#hst" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#hst">Hubble Space Telescope</a>
       can  resolve only the largest  features on its surface (left and above).
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>F</font>ortunately, Pluto has a satellite, <a href="#charon">Charon</a>.
       By good fortune, Charon was discovered (in 1978)
       just before its orbital plane moved edge-on toward the inner solar system.
       It was therefore possible to observe many
       transits of Pluto over Charon and vice versa.  By carefully calculating
       which portions of which body would be covered at what times, and watching
       brightness curves, astronomers were able to construct a rough map of
       light and dark areas on both bodies.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto's radius is not well known.  Measurements range from 1150 to 1187 km.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>hough the sum of the masses of Pluto and Charon is known pretty well (it can be
       determined from careful measurements of the period and radius of Charon's orbit and
       <a href="HELP~1.HTM#kepler" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#kepler">Kepler's</a> Third Law),
       the individual masses of Pluto and Charon are difficult to determine because
       that requires determining their mutual motions around the center of mass of the
       system which requires much finer measurements -- they're so small and far away
       that even <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#hst" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#hst">HST</a> has difficulty.
       The ratio of their masses is probably somewhere
       between 0.084 and 0.157; more observations are underway but we won't get really
       accurate data until a <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#pffb" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#pffb">spacecraft</a> is sent.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto is the second most
       contrasty body in the Solar System (after <a href="IAPETU~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/iapetus.html">Iapetus</a>).
       Exploring the
       origin of that contrast is one of the high-priority goals for the
       proposed <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#pffb" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#pffb">Pluto Express</a> mission.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>here are some who think Pluto would be better classified as a large
       asteroid or comet rather than as a <a href="SOL~1.HTM#planet" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html#planet">planet</a>.
       Some consider it to be the largest of the
       <a href="KBOC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/kboc.html">Kuiper Belt</a> objects.
       There is considerable merit to the later position, but historically Pluto
      has been classified as a planet and it is likely to remain so.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto's orbit is highly eccentric.  At times it is closer to the Sun than
       Neptune (it has been so since 1979 and will continue until 1999).
       Pluto rotates in the opposite direction from most of the other planets.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto is locked in a 3:2 <a href="HELP~1.HTM#resonance" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#resonance">resonance</a>
       with Neptune; i.e. Pluto's
       orbital period is exactly 1.5 times longer than Neptune's.
      Its orbital inclination is also much higher than the other planets.
      Thus though it
    <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS6.HTM#652" tppabs="http://eggfoo.arc.nasa.gov/HTML/PLUTO/PlutoSym/Dobro/Dobro.html">appears</a>
      that Pluto's orbit crosses Neptune's,
      they will never collide.
<p>
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS6.HTM#653" tppabs="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/raw/pluto/plutonor.gif"><img align=left alt="" border=0 width=88 height=88 src="THUMB/PLUTONOR.GIF" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/thumb/plutonor.gif" hspace=4></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>L</font>ike <a href="URANUS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html">Uranus</a>, the plane of Pluto's equator is at almost
       right angles to the plane of its orbit.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he surface temperature on Pluto is not well known but is probably between
      35 and 45 Kelvins (-228 to -238 C).
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto's composition is unknown, but its density (about 2 gm/cm3) indicates
       that it
       is probably a mixture of 70% rock and 30% water ice much like Triton.
      The bright areas of the surface seem
       to be covered with ices of nitrogen with
      smaller amounts of (solid) methane and carbon monoxide.
      The composition of the darker areas of Pluto's surface is unknown but may be
      due to primordial organic material or
      photochemical reactions driven by cosmic rays.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>L</font>ittle is known about Pluto's atmosphere, but it probably consists primarily of
      nitrogen with some carbon monoxide and methane.  It is extremely tenuous
      the surface pressure being only a few microbars.
       Pluto's atmosphere may exist as a gas only
       when Pluto is near its <a href="HELP~1.HTM#perihelion" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#perihelion">perihelion</a>;
       for the majority of Pluto's long year, the atmospheric gases are frozen into ice.
       Near perihelion, it is likely that some of the atmosphere
       escapes to space perhaps even interacting with Charon.
       The Pluto Express
       mission planners want to arrive at Pluto while the atmosphere is unfrozen.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he unusual nature of the orbits of Pluto and of <a href="TRITON~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/triton.html">Triton</a>
       and the similarity of bulk properties between Pluto and Triton suggest some
       historical connection between them. It was once thought that Pluto may have
       once been a satellite of Neptune's, but this now seems unlikely. 
       A more popular theory is that Triton, like Pluto, once moved in an
       independent orbit around the Sun and was later captured by Neptune.
      Perhaps Triton, Pluto and Charon are the only remaining members of a large
      class of similar objects the rest of which were ejected into the
      <a href="KBOC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/kboc.html">Oort cloud</a>.
       Like the <a href="EARTH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">Earth</a>'s <a href="LUNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html">Moon</a>,
       Charon may be the result of a collision between Pluto and another body.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>luto can be seen with an amateur telescope but it is not easy.
      Mike Harvey's <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#17" tppabs="http://www.calweb.com/~mcharvey/planet_all.html">planet finder charts</a> show the current position of Pluto (and the other planets) in the sky, but much more detailed charts and careful observations over several months will be required to actually find it.
Suitable charts can be created with many
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#18" tppabs="http://www.seds.org/billa/astrosoftware.html">planetarium programs</a>
such as <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#19" tppabs="http://www.seds.org/billa/StarryNight/sn.html">Starry Night</a>.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font>haron was discovered in 1978 by J. Christy.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font>haron is unusual in that it is the largest moon with respect to its

      of Charon</a> as seen from Pluto very interesting.)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font>haron's composition is unknown, but its low density (1.4 gm/cm3) indicates
       that it may be similar to <a href="SATURN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html">Saturn</a>'s
       icy moons (i.e. <a href="RHEA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/rhea.html">Rhea</a>).  Its surface seems to be covered
       with water ice.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>U</font>nlike Pluto, Charon does not have large albedo features, though it may have
      smaller ones that have not been resolved.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>t has been proposed that Charon was formed by a giant impact similar to the one
      that formed Earth's <a href="LUNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html">Moon</a>.
<p>
