<hr>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>lmost all of the information in <font size=+1><i>The Nine Planets</i></font> was gathered by
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs26.htm#2639" tppabs="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>
spacecraft and scientists and paid for by <b>taxes</b>.  Our exploration
of the solar system is necessarily
a public enterprise and it lives or dies by public opinion.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>B</font>ut today the space program in the United States is in trouble.
A series of tragic failures (Challenger, Mars Observer) and
embarrassing setbacks (<a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#galileo" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#galileo">Galileo</a>'s
stuck antenna, <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#hst" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#hst">HST</a>'s flawed optics) have
changed NASA's reputation from one of daring and can-do pragmatism to one of
bumbling in-fighting bureaucracy. 
Popular support has largely evaporated.
Its budget has been repeatedly slashed. Each year NASA struggles to make do
with less and less. Many good proposals have been shelved and once in a
lifetime opportunities missed.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>t doesn't have to be this way. Remember <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#apollo" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#apollo">
Apollo</a>?
If you want to see America's space program restored to its former glory, you
can help. <b>Write your representatives</b> in Washington. Jaw-bone your friends and
colleagues. Join an activist group.
Don't let policy be set by the opinions
of those who think that the space program is only for
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#trekkie" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#trekkie">Trekkies</a> and that
cutting NASA's budget alone can wipe out the deficit.
Let <b>your</b> voice be heard.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>here was recently a letter writing campaign to save
<a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#marssurveyor" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#marssurveyor">Mars Surveyor</a>.
Apparently, one Congressman's office received  a total of
10 (ten) letters of support which was considered "a lot" and was a significant
factor in that Congressman's decision.
So despite the conventional wisdom, at least on relatively limited
issues like this, your voice can indeed be heard.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>S</font>ome feel that the Space Station and the manned program in general is taking
scarce dollars away from space science and argue for cuts in the manned program
in hopes of grabbing some of the residual funds. But, in my opinion, this is a
short-sighted attitude.
An anonymous Usenet poster got it about right when he wrote:
<blockquote>"There are those who have different points of view about what our goals
should be in space.  Some are interested in science or just the beauty
of an alien landscape; they are satisfied looking vicariously through the eyes
of a machine; others feel the need to actually walk those alien landscapes,
or send human proxies.  Still others believe that human destiny is in the
stars and we must expand into the universe to survive.  I guess we need
to work together, and tolerate each other's motivations."</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HELP~1.HTM#ben" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#ben"><font size=+2>B</font>enjamin Franklin</a> put it more succinctly:
"We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>f you're a citizen of another nation, I apologize for the USA bias in all this.
(In fact, I'm considerably embarrassed by the way my country has sometimes
let down its partners in space.)
If your country has its own space program please support it
and programs of international cooperation like
<a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#cassini" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#cassini">Cassini/Huygens</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>n easy way to help is to join a space advocacy
group like the following.
They deserve the support of all who care about mankind's future in space.
