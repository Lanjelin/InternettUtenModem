<h2><a name="vulcan">Vulcan</a>, the intra-Mercurial planet, 1860-1916, 1971</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he French mathematician <a href="HELP~1.HTM#leverrier" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#leverrier">Urbain Le Verrier</a>,
co-predictor with <a href="HELP~1.HTM#adams" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#adams">J.C. Adams</a> of the position
of <a href="NEPTUN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html">Neptune</a> before it was seen, in a lecture at
2 Jan 1860 announced that the problem of observed deviations of the
motion of <a href="MERCUR~1.HTM#orbit" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html#orbit">Mercury</a>
could be solved by assuming an intra-Mercurial
planet, or possibly a second <a href="ASTERO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html">asteroid belt</a>
inside Mercury's orbit.
The only possible way to observe this intra-Mercurial planet or
asteroids was if/when they transited the Sun, or during total solar
eclipses.  Prof. Wolf at the Zurich sunspot data center, found a
number of suspicious "dots" on the <a href="SOL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html">Sun</a>,
and another astronomer found
some more.  A total of two dozen spots seemed to fit the pattern of
two intra-Mercurial orbits, one with a period of 26 days and the
other of 38 days.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1859, Le Verrier received a letter from the amateur astronomer
Lescarbault, who reported having seen a round black spot on the Sun
on March 26 1859, looking like a planet transiting the Sun.  He had
seen the spot one hour and a quarter, when it moved a quarter of the
solar diameter.  Lescarbault estimated the orbital
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#inclination" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#inclination">inclination</a> to
between 5.3 and 7.3 degrees, its longitude of node about 183 deg,
its eccentricity "enormous", and its transit time across the solar
disk 4 hours 30 minutes.  Le Verrier investigated this observation,
and computed an orbit from it: period 19 days 7 hours, mean distance
from Sun 0.1427 a.u., inclination 12# 10', ascending node at 12# 59'
The diameter was considerably smaller than Mercury's and its mass was
estimated at 1/17 of Mercury's mass.  This was too small to account
for the deviations of Mercury's orbit, but perhaps this was the
largest member of that intra-Mercurial asteroid belt?  Le Verrier fell
in love with the planet, and named it <b>Vulcan</b>.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1860 there was a total eclipse of the Sun.  Le Verrier mobilized
all French and some other astronomers to find Vulcan - nobody did.
Wolf's suspicious 'sunspots' now revived Le Verrier's interest, and
just before Le Verrier's death in 1877 some more 'evidence' found its
way into print.  On April 4 1875, a German astronomer, H. Weber, saw
a round spot on the Sun.  Le Verrier's orbit indicated a possible
transit at April 3 that year, and Wolf noticed that his 38-day orbit
also could have performed a transit at about that time.  That 'round
dot' was also photographed at Greenwich and in Madrid.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>here was one more flurry after the total solar eclipse at July 29
1878, where two observers claimed to have seen in the vicinity of the
Sun small illuminated disks which could only be small planets inside
Mercury's orbit: J.C Watson (professor of astronomy at the Univ. of
Michigan) believed he'd found TWO intra-Mercurial planets!  Lewis
Swift (co-discoverer of Comet Swift-Tuttle, which returned 1992),
also saw a 'star' he believed to be Vulcan -- but at a different
position than either of Watson's two 'intra-Mercurials'.  In
addition, neither Watson's nor Swift's Vulcans could be reconciled
with Le Verrier's or Lescarbault's Vulcan.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>fter this, nobody ever saw Vulcan again, in spite of several
searches at different total solar eclipses.  And in 1916,
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#einstein" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#einstein">Albert Einstein</a>
published his General Theory of Relativity, which explained
the deviations in the motions of Mercury without the need to invoke
an unknown intra-Mercurial planet.  In May 1929 Erwin Freundlich,
Potsdam, photographed the total solar eclipse in Sumatra, and later
carefully examined the plates which showed a profusion of star images.
Comparison plates were taken six months later.  No unknown object
brighter than 9th magnitude was found near the Sun.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>B</font>ut what did these people really see?  Lescarbault had no reason to
tell a fairytale, and even Le Verrier believed him.  It is possible
that Lescarbault happened to see a small asteroid passing very close
to the <a href="EARTH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">Earth</a>, just
inside Earth's orbit.  Such asteroids were unknown
at that time, so Lescarbault's only idea was that he saw an
intra-Mercurial planet.  Swift and Watson could, during the hurry to
obtain observations during totality, have misidentified some stars,
believing they had seen Vulcan.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>"V</font>ulcan" was briefly revived around 1970-1971, when a few researchers
thought they had detected several faint objects close to the Sun
during a total solar eclipse.  These objects might have been faint
<a href="COMETS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/comets.html">comets</a>,
and later comets have been observed that later did pass close
enough to the Sun to collide with it.

<h2><a name="mercmoon">Mercury's Moon</a>, 1974</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>wo days before the 29 March 1974
<a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#marin10" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#marin10">Mariner 10</a> flyby past
<a href="MERCUR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">Mercury</a>, one
instument began registering bright emissions in the extreme UV that
had "no right to be there".  The next day it was gone.  Three days
later it reappeared, and the "object" appeared to detach itself from
Mercury.  The astronomers first thought they had seen a star.  But
they had seen it in two quite different directions, and every
astronomer knew that these extreme UV wavelengths couldn't penetrate
very far through the interstellar medium, suggesting that the object
must be close.  Did Mercury have a moon?
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>fter a hectic Friday, when the "object" had been computed to move at
4 km/s, a speed consistent with that of a moon, JPL managers were
called in.  They turned the then-dying spacecraft over full time to
the UV team, and everyone started worrying about a press conference
scheduled for later that Saturday.  Should the suspected moon be
announced?  But the press already knew.  Some papers -- the bigger,
more respectable ones -- played it straight; many others ran excited
stories about Mercury's new moon.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>nd the "moon" itself?  It headed straight on out from Mercury, and
was eventually identified as a hot star, 31 Crateris.  What the
original emissions came from, the ones spotted on the approach to the
planet, remains a mystery.  So ends the story of Mercury's moon but
at the same time a new chapter in astronomy began: extreme UV turned
out not to be so completely absorbed by the interstellar medium as
formerly believed.  Already the Gum nebula has turned out to be a
quite strong emitter in the extreme UV, and spreads across 140
degrees of the night sky at 540 angstroms.  Astronomers had
discovered a new window through which to observe the heavens.

<h2><a name="neith">Neith</a>, the Moon of Venus, 1672-1892</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1672, <a href="HELP~1.HTM#cassini" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#cassini">Giovanni Domenico Cassini</a>,
one of the prominent astronomers
of the time, noticed a small companion close to
<a href="VENUS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/venus.html">Venus</a>.  Did Venus
have a satellite?  Cassini decided not to announce his observation,
but 14 years later, in 1686, he saw the object again, and then
entered it in his journal.  The object was estimated to have about
1/4 the diameter of Venus, and it showed the same phase as Venus.
Later, the object was seen by other astronomers as well: by James
Short in 1740, Andreas Mayer in 1759,
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#lagrange" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#lagrange">J. L. Lagrange</a> in 1761
(Lagrange announced that the orbital plane of the satellite was
perpendicular to the ecliptic).  During 1761 the object was seen a total
of 18 times by five observers.  The observations of Scheuten on June 6
1761 was especially interesting: he saw Venus in transit across the
Sun's disk, accompanied by a smaller dark spot on one side, which
followed Venus in its transit.  However, Samuel Dunn at Chelsea,
England, who also watched that transit, did not see that additional
spot.  In 1764 there were 8 observations by two observers.  Other
observers tried to see the satellite but failed to find it.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>N</font>ow the astronomical world was faced with a controversy: several
observers had reported seeing the satellite while several others had
failed to find it in spite of determined efforts.  In 1766, the
director of the Vienna observatory, Father Hell (!), published a
treatise where he declared that all observations of the satellite
were optical illusions -- the image of Venus is so bright that it is
reflected in the eye, back into the telescope, creating a secondary
image at a smaller scale.  Others published treatises declaring that
the observations were real.  J. H. Lambert of Germany published
orbital elements of the satellite in Berliner Astronomischer Jahrbuch
1777: mean distance 66.5 Venus radii, orbital period 11 days 3 hours,
inclination to ecliptic 64 degrees.  It was hoped that the satellite
could be seen during the transit of Venus in front of the Sun June 1
1777 (it is self evident that Lambert made a mistake in calculating
these orbital elements: at 66.5 Venus radii, the distance from Venus
is about the same as our <a href="LUNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html">Moon</a>'s
distance from the <a href="EARTH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">Earth</a>.  This fits
very badly with the orbital period of 11 days or only somewhat more
than 1/3 of the orbital period of our Moon.  The mass of Venus is a
little smaller than the mass of the Earth).
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1768 there was one more observation of the satellite, by Christian
Horrebow in Copenhagen.  There were also three searches, one made by
one of the greatest astronomers of all time,
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#herschel" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#herschel">William Herschel</a> -- all
three of them failed to find any satellite.  Quite late in the game,
F. Schorr from Germany tried to make a case for the satellite in a
book published in 1875.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1884, M. Hozeau, former director of the Royal Observatory of
Brussels, suggested a different hypothesis.  By analysing available
observations Hozeau concluded that Venus moon appeared close to Venus
approximately every 2.96 years or 1080 days.  Hozeau suggested that
it wasn't a moon of Venus, but a planet of its own, orbiting the sun
once every 283 days and thus being in conjunction with Venus once
every 1080 days.  Hozeau also named it Neith, after the mysterious
goddess of Sais, whose veil no mortal raised.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1887, three years after the "moon of Venus" had been revived by
Hozeau, the Belgian Academy of Sciences published a long paper where
each and every reported observation was investigated in detail.
Several observations of the satellite were really stars seen in the
vicinity of Venus.  Roedkier's observations "checked out" especially
well -- he had been fooled, in succession, by Chi Orionis, M Tauri, 71
Orionis, and Nu Geminorum!  James Short had really seen a star
somewhat fainter than 8th magnitude.  All observations by Le Verrier
and Montaigne could be similarly explained.  Lambert's orbital
calculations were demolished.  The very last observation, by Horrebow
in 1768, could be ascribed to Theta Librae.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>fter this paper was published, only one more observation was
reported, by a man who had earlier made a search for the satellite
of Venus but failed to find it: on Aug 13 1892,
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#barnard" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#barnard">E. E. Barnard</a> recorded
a 7th magnitude object near Venus.  There is no star in the position
recorded by Barnard, and Barnard's eyesight was notoriously
excellent.  We still don't know what he saw.  Was it an asteroid that
hadn't been charted?  Or was it a short-lived nova that nobody else
happened to see?


<hr>
<h2><a name="moon2">The Earth's Second Moon</a>, 1846-present</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1846, Frederic Petit, director of the observatory of Toulouse,
stated that a second moon of the <a href="EARTH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">Earth</a>
had been discovered.  It had
been seen by two observers, Lebon and Dassier, at Toulouse and by a
third, Lariviere, at Artenac, during the early evening of March 21
1846.  Petit found that the orbit was elliptical, with a period of 2
hours 44 minutes 59 seconds, an apogee at 3570 km above the Earth's
surface and perigee at just 11.4 km (!)  above the Earth's surface.
Le Verrier, who was in the audience, grumbled that one needed to take
air resistance into account, something nobody could do at that time.
Petit became obsessed with this idea of a second moon, and 15 years
later announced that he had made calculations about a small moon of
Earth which caused some then-unexplained peculiarities in the motion
of our main <a href="LUNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html">Moon</a>.
Astronomers generally ignored this, and the idea
would have been forgotten if not a young French writer,
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#verne" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#verne">Jules Verne</a>,
had not read an abstract.  In Verne's novel "From the Earth to the
Moon", Verne lets a small object pass close to the traveller's space
capsule, causing it to travel around the Moon instead of smashing
into it:

<blockquote>
  "It is", said Barbicane, "a simple meteorite but an enormous one,
   retained as a satellite by the attraction of the Earth."
<p>

  "Is that possible?", exclaimed Michel Ardan, "the earth has two moons?"
<p>

  "Yes, my friend, it has two moons, although it is usually believed
   to have only one.  But this second moon is so small and its velocity
   is so great that the inhabitants of Earth cannot see it.  It was by
   noticing disturbances that a French astronomer, Monsieur Petit, could
   determine the existence of this second moon and calculated its orbit.
   According to him a complete revolution around the Earth takes three
   hours and twenty minutes. . . . "
<p>

  "Do all astronomers admit the the existence of this satellite?", asked
   Nicholl
<p>

  "No", replied Barbicane, "but if, like us, they had met it they could
   no longer doubt it. . . . But this gives us a means of determining our
   position in space . . . its distance is known and we were, therefore,
   7480 km above the surface of the globe where we met it."
</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>J</font>ules Verne was read by millions of people, but not until 1942 did
anybody notice the discrepancies in Verne's text:
<ol>
  <li>  A satellite 7480 km above the Earth's surface would have a period
    of 4 hours 48 minutes, not 3 hours 20 minutes.
  <li>  Since it was seen from the window from which the Moon was invisible,
    while both were approaching, it must be in retrogade motion, which
    would be worth remarking.  Verne doesn't mention this.
  <li>  In any case the satellite would be in eclipse and thus be invisible.
    The projectile doesn't leave the Earth's shadow until much later.
</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>D</font>r. R.S. Richardson, Mount Wilson Observatory, tried in 1952 to make
the figures fit by assuming an eccentric orbit of this moon: perigee
5010 km and apogee 7480 km above Earth's surface, eccentricity 0.1784.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>N</font>evertheless, Jules Verne made Petit's second moon known all over the
world.  Amateur astronomers jumped to the conclusion that here was
opportunity for fame -- anybody discovering this second moon would
have his name inscribed in the annals of science.  No major
observatory ever checked the problem of the Earth's second moon, or
if they did they kept quiet.  German amateurs were chasing what they
called <b>Kleinchen</b> ("little bit") -- of course they never found
Kleinchen.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HELP~1.HTM#pickering" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#pickering"><font size=+2>W</font>. H. Pickering</a>
devoted his attention to the theory of the subject: if
the satellite orbited 320 km above the surface and if its diameter
was 0.3 meters, with the same reflecting power as the Moon, it should
be visible in a 3-inch telescope.  A 3 meter satellite would be a
naked-eye object of <a href="HELP~1.HTM#magnitude" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#magnitude">magnitude</a> 5.
Though Pickering did not look for
the Petit object, he did carry on a search for a secondary moon -- a
satellite of our Moon ("On a photographic search for a satellite of
the Moon", Popular Astronomy, 1903).  The result was negative and
Pickering concluded that any satellite of our Moon must be smaller
than about 3 meters.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>ickering's article on the possibility of a tiny second moon of
Earth, "A Meteoritic Satellite", appeared in Popular Astronomy in
1922 and caused another short flurry among amateur astronomers, since
it contained a virtual request: "A 3-5-inch telescope with a
low-power eyepiece would be the likeliest mean to find it.  It is an
opportunity for the amateur."  But again, all searches remained
fruitless.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he original idea was that the gravitational field of the second moon
should account for the then inexplicable minor deviations of the
motion of our big Moon.  That meant an object at least several miles
large -- but if such a large second moon really existed, it would have
been seen by the Babylonians.  Even if it was too small to show a
disk, its comparative nearness would have made it move fast and
therefore be conspicuous, as today's watchers of artificial
satellites and even airplanes know.  On the other hand, nobody was
much interested in moonlets too small to be seen.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>here have been other proposals for additional natural satellites of
the Earth.  In 1898 Dr Georg Waltemath from Hamburg claimed to have
discovered not only a second moon but a whole system of midget moons.
Waltemath gave orbital elements for one of these moons: distance from
Earth 1.03 million km, diameter 700 km, orbital period 119 days,
synodic period 177 days.  "Sometimes", says Waltemath, "it shines at
night like the Sun" and he thinks this moon was seen in Greenland on
24 October 1881 by Lieut Greely, ten days after the Sun had set for
the winter.  Public interest was aroused when Waltemath predicted his
second moon would pass in front of the Sun on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th of
February 1898.  On the 4th February, 12 persons at the post office of
Greifswald (Herr Postdirektor Ziegel, members of his family, and
postal employees) observed the Sun with their naked eye, without
protection of the glare.  It is easy to imagine a faintly
preposterous scene: an imposing-looking Prussian civil servant
pointing skyward through his office window, while he reads
Waltemath's prediction aloud to a know of respectful subordinates. On
being interviewed, these witnesses spoke of a dark object having one
fifth the Sun's apparent diameter, and which took from 1:10 to 2:10
Berlin time to traverse the solar disk.  It was soon proven to be a
mistake, because during that very hour the Sun was being scrutinized
by two experienced astronomers, W.  Winkler in Jena and Baron Ivo von
Benko from Pola, Austria.  They both reported that only a few
ordinary sunspots were on the disk.  The failure of this and later
forecasts did not discourage Waltemath, who continued to issue
predicitons and ask for verifications.  Contemporary astronomers were
pretty irritated over and over again having to answer questions from
the public like "Oh, by the way, what about all these new moons?".
But astrologers caught on -- in 1918 the astrologer Sepharial named
this moon <b>Lilith</b>.  He considered it to be black enough to be
invisible most of the time, being visible only close to opposition or
when in transit across the solar disk.  Sepharial constructed an
ephemeris of Lilith, based on several of Waltemath's claimed
observations.  He considered Lilith to have about the same mass as
the Moon, apparently happily unaware that any such satellite would,
even if invisible, show its existence by perturbing the motion of the
Earth.  And even to this day, "the dark moon" Lilith is used by some
astrologers in their horoscopes.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>F</font>rom time to time other "additional moons" were reported from
observers.  The German astronomical magazine "Die Sterne" reported
that a German amateur astronomer named W. Spill had observed a second
moon cross our first moon's disc on May 24, 1926.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>round 1950, when artificial satellites began to be discussed in
earnest, everybody expected them to be just burned-out upper stages
of multistage rockets, carrying no radio transmitters but being
tracked by radar from the Earth.  In such cases a bunch of small
nearby natural satellites would have been most annoying, reflecting
radar beams meant for the artificial satellites.  The method to
search for such natural satellites was developed by
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#tombaugh" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a>:
the motion of a satellite at e.g.  5000 km
height is computed.  Then a camera platform is constructed that scans
the sky at precisely that rate.  Stars, planets etc will then appear
as lines on the photographs taken by this camera, while any satellite
at the correct altitude will appear as a dot.  If the satellite was
at a somewhat different altitude, it would produce a short line.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>O</font>bservations began in 1953 at the Lowell Observatory and actually
invaded virgin territory: with the exception of the Germans searching
for "Kleinchen" nobody had ever paid attention to the space between
the Moon and the Earth!  By the fall of 1954, weekly journals and
daily newspapers of high reputation stated that the search had
brought its first results: one small natural satellite at 700 km
altitude, another one 1000 km out.  One general is said to have
asked: "Is he sure they're natural?".  Nobody seems to know how these
reports originated -- the searches were completely negative.  When the
first artificial satellites were launched in 1957 and 1958, the
cameras tracked those satellites instead.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>B</font>ut strangely enough, this does not mean that the Earth only has one
natural satellite.  The Earth can have a very near satellite for a
short time.  <a href="METEOR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/meteorites.html">Meteoroids</a>
passing the Earth and skimming through the upper
atmosphere can lose enough velocity to go into a satellite orbit
around the Earth.  But since it passes the upper atmosphere at each
perigee, they will not last long, maybe only one or two, possibly a
hundred revolutions (about 150 hours).  There are some indications
that such "ephemeral satellites" have been seen; it is even possible
that Petit's observers did see one.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n addition to ephemeral satellites there are two more possibilities.
One is that the Moon had a satellite of its own -- but despite
several searches none has been found (in addition it's now known that
the gravity field of the Moon is uneven or "lumpy" enough for any
lunar satellite orbit to be unstable -- any lunar satellite will
therefore crash into the Moon after a fairly short time, a few years
or possibly a decade).  The other possibility is that there might be
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#trojan" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#trojan">Trojan satellites</a>,
i.e. secondary satellites in the lunar orbit,
travelling 60 degrees ahead of or behind the Moon.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>S</font>uch "Trojan satellites" were first reported by the Polish astronomer
Kordylewski of Krakow observatory.  He started his search in 1951,
visually with a good telescope.  He was hoping for reasonably large
bodies in the lunar orbit, 60 degrees away from the Moon.  The search
was negative, but in 1956 his compatriot and colleague, Wilkowski,
suggested that there may be many tiny bodies, too small to be seen
individually but many enough to appear as a cloud of dust particles.
In such a case, they would be best visible without a telescope i.e.
with the naked eye!  Using a telescope would "magnify it out of
existence".  Dr Kordylewski was willing to try.  A dark night with
clear skies, and the Moon being below the horizon, was required.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n October 1956, Kordylewski saw, for the first time, a fairly bright
patch in one of the two positions.  It was not small, subtending an
angle of 2 degrees (i.e. about 4 times larger than the Moon itself),
and was very faint, only about half as bright as the notoriously
difficult Gegenschein (counterglow -- a bright patch in the zodiacal
light, directly opposite to the Sun).  In March and April 1961,
Kordylewski succeeded in photographing two clouds near the expected
positions.  They seem to vary in extent, but that may be due to
changing illumination.  J. Roach detected these cloud satellites in
1975 with the OSO (Orbiting Solar Observatory) 6 spacecraft.  In 1990
they were again photographed, this time by the polish astronomer
Winiarski, who found that they were a few degrees in apparent diameter, that
they "wandered" up to ten degrees away from the "trojan" point, and
that they were somewhat redder than the zodiacal light.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>S</font>o the century-long search for a second moon of the Earth seems to
have succeeded, after all, even though this 'second moon' turned out
to be entirely different from anything anybody had ever expected.
They are very hard to detect and to distinguish from the zodiacal
light, in particular the Gegenschein.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>B</font>ut people are still proposing additional natural satellites of the
Earth.  Between 1966 and 1969 John Bargby, an American scientist,
claimed to have observed at least ten small natural satellites of the
Earth, visible only in a telescope.  Bargby found elliptical orbits
for all the objects: eccentricity 0.498, semimajor axis 14065 km,
which yields perigee and apogee heights of 680 and 14700 km.  Bargby
considered them to be fragments of a larger body which broke up in
December 1955.  He based much of his suggested satellites on supposed
perturbations of artificial satellites.  Bargby used artificial
satellite data from Goddard Satellite Situation Report, unaware that
the values in this publication are only approximate and sometimes
grossly in error and can therefore not be used for any precise
scientific analysis.  In addition, from Bargby's own claimed
observations it can be deduced that when at perigee Bargby's
satellites ought to be visible at first magnitude and thus be easily
visible to the naked eye, yet no-one has seen them as such.

<h2><a name="sat">Saturn's Ninth and Tenth Moons</a>, 1861, 1905-1960, 1966-1980</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n April 1861 Hermann Goldschmidt announced the discovery of a 9th
moon of <a href="SATURN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html">Saturn</a>, which orbited the planet
between <a href="TITAN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html">Titan</a> and <a href="HYPERI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/hyperion.html">Hyperion</a>.
He named that moon <b>Chiron</b> (!).  However the discovery was never
confirmed -- nobody else ever saw this satellite "Chiron".  Later,
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#pickering" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#pickering">Pickering</a>
discovered what's now considered Saturn's 9th moon,
<a href="PHOEBE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/phoebe.html">Phoebe</a>,
in 1898.  This was the first time a satellite of another planet was
discovered by photographical observations.  Phoebe is also Saturn's
outermost moon.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1905, Pickering though he had discovered a tenth moon, which he
named <b>Themis</b>.  According to Pickering, it orbited Saturn between the
orbits of Titan and Hyperion in a highly inclined orbit: mean
distance from Saturn 1,460,000 km, orbital period 20.85 days,
eccentricity 0.23, inclination 39 degrees.  Themis was never seen
again, but nevertheless appeared in almanacs and astronomy books well
into the 1950's and 1960's.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1966, A. Dollfus discovered another new moon of Saturn.  It was
named <a href="JANUS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/janus.html">Janus</a>, and
orbited Saturn just outside its rings.  It was so
faint and close to the rings that the only chance to see it was when
the rings of Saturn were seen from the edge, as happened in 1966.
Now Janus was Saturn's tenth moon.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1980, when Saturns rings again were seen edgewise, a flurry of
observations discovered a lot of new satellites close to the rings of
Saturn.  Close to Janus another satellite was discovered, named
<a href="EPIMET~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/epimetheus.html">Epimetheus</a>.
Their orbits are very close to each other, and the most
interesting aspect of this satellite pair is that they regularly
switch orbits with each other!  It turned out that the "Janus"
discovered in 1966 really were observations of both of these
co-orbital satellites.  Thus the 'tenth moon of Saturn' discovered in
1966 really turned out to be two different moons!  The spacecraft
<a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#Voyager1" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#Voyager1">Voyager 1</a> and

travelled past Saturn shortly afterwards, confirmed this.

<h2><a name="planetx">Planet X</a>, 1841-1992</h2>

began investigating the by then quite large
residuals in the motion of <a href="URANUS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html">Uranus</a>.
In 1845, <a href="HELP~1.HTM#Le Verrier" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#Le Verrier">Urbain Le Verrier</a> started
to investigate them, too.  Adams presented two different solutions to
the problem, assuming that the deviations were caused by the
gravitation from an unknown planet.  Adams tried to present his
solutions to the Greenwich observatory, but since he was young and
unknown, he wasn't taken seriously.  Urbain Le Verrier presented his
solution in 1846, but France lacked the necessary resources to locate
the planet.  Le Verrier then instead turned to the Berlin observatory,
where <a href="HELP~1.HTM#galle" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#galle">Galle</a> and his assistant
<a href="HELP~1.HTM#arrest" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#arrest">d'Arrest</a>
found <a href="NEPTUN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html">Neptune</a> on the evening
of Sept 23, 1846.  Nowadays, both Adams and Le Verrier share the
credit of having predicted the existence and position of Neptune.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>(I</font>nspired by this success, Le Verrier attacked the problem of the
deviations of <a href="MERCUR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">Mercury's</a> orbit,
and suggested the existence of an
intra-mercurial planet,  <a href="#vulcan">Vulcan</a>, which
later turned out to be non-existent.)
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>O</font>n 30 Sept 1846, one week after the discovery of Neptune, Le Verrier
declared that there may be still another unknown planet out there.
On October 10, Neptune's large moon <a href="TRITON~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/triton.html">Triton</a>
was discovered, which
yielded an easy way to accurately determine the mass of Neptune,
which turned out to be 2% larger than expected from the perturbations
upon Uranus.  It seemed as if the deviations in Uranus' motion really
was caused by two planets -- in addition the real orbit of Neptune
turned out to be significantly different from the orbits predicted by
both Adams and Le Verrier.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1850 Ferguson was observing the motion of the minor planet Hygeia.
One reader of Ferguson's report was Hind, who checked the reference
stars used by Ferguson.  Hind was unable to find one of Ferguson's
reference stars.  Maury, at the Naval Observatory, was also unable to
find that star.  During a few years it was believed that this was an
observation of yet another planet, but in 1879 another explanation
was offered: Ferguson had made a mistake when recording his
observation -- when that mistake was corrected, another star nicely
fit his 'missing reference star'.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he first serious attempt to find a trans-Neptunian planet was done
in 1877 by David Todd.  He used a "graphical method", and despite the
inconclusivenesses of the residuals of Uranus, he derived elements
for a trans-Neptunian planet: mean distance 52 a.u., period 375
years, <a href="HELP~1.HTM#magnitude" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#magnitude">magnitude</a>
fainter than 13.  Its longitude for 1877.84 was
given 170 degrees with an uncertainty of 10 degrees.  The inclination
was 1.40 degrees and the longitude of the ascending node 103 degrees.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1879, Camille Flammarion added another hint as to the existence of
a planet beyond Neptune: the aphelia of periodic <a href="COMETS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/comets.html">comets</a>
tend to
cluster around the orbits of major planets.  Jupiter has the greatest
share of such comets, and Saturn, Uranus and Neptune also have a few
each.  Flammarion found two comets, 1862 III with a period of 120
years and aphelion at 47.6 a.u., and 1889 II, with a somewhat longer
period and aphelion at 49.8 a.u.  Flammarion suggested that the
hypothetical planet probably moved at 45 a.u.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>O</font>ne year later, in 1880, professor Forbes published a memoir
concering the aphelia of comets and their association with planetary
orbits.  By about 1900 five comets were known with aphelia outside
Neptune's orbit, and then Forbes suggested one trans-Neptunian moved
at a distance of about 100 a.u., and another one at 300 a.u., with
periods of 1000 and 5000 years.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>D</font>uring the next five years, several astronomers/mathematicians
published their own ideas of what might be found in the outer parts
of the solar system.  Gaillot at Paris Observatory assumed two
trans-Neptunian planets at 45 and 60 a.u.  Thomas Jefferson Jackson
See predicted three trans-Neptunian planets: "Oceanus" at 41.25 a.u.
and period 272 years, "trans-Oceanus" at 56 a.u. and period 420
years, and finally another one at 72 a.u. and period 610 years.  Dr
Theodor Grigull of Munster, Germany, assumed in 1902 a Uranus-sized
planet at 50 a.u. and period 360 years, which he called "Hades".
Grigull based his work mainly on the orbits of comets with aphelia
beyond Neptune's orbit, with a cross check whether the gravitational
pull of such a body would produce the observed deviations in Uranus
motion.  In 1921 Grigull revised the orbital period of "Hades" to
310-330 years, to better fit the observed deviations.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1900 Hans-Emil Lau, Copenhagen, published elements of two
trans-Neptunian planets at 46.6 and 70.7 a.u. distance, with masses
of 9 and 47.2 times the Earth, and a magnitude for the nearer planet
around 10-11.  The 1900 longitudes of those hypothetical bodies were
274 and 343 degrees, both with the very large uncertainty of 180
degrees.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1901, Gabriel Dallet deduced a hypothetical planet at 47 a.u. with
a magnitude of 9.5-10.5 and a 1900 longitude of 358 degrees.  The
same year Theodor Grigull derived a longitude of a trans-Neptunian
planet less than 6 degrees away from Dallet's planet, and later
brought the difference down to 2.5 degrees.  This planet was supposed
to be 50.6 a.u. distant.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1904, Thomas Jefferson Jackson See suggested three trans-Neptunian
planets, at 42.25, 56 and 72 a.u.  The inner planet had a period of
272.2 years and a longitude in 1904 of 200 degrees.  A Russian
general named Alexander Garnowsky suggested four hypothetical planets
but failed to supply any details about them.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he two most carefully worked out predictions for the Trans-Neptune
were both of American origin: <a href="HELP~1.HTM#pickering" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#pickering">Pickering's</a>
"A search for a planet
beyond Neptune" (Annals Astron. Obs. Harvard Coll, vol LXI part II
1909), and <a href="HELP~1.HTM#lowell" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#lowell">Percival Lowell's</a>
"Memoir on a trans-Neptunian planet"
(Lynn, Mass 1915).  They were concerned with the same subject but
used different approaches and arrived at different results.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>ickering used a graphical analysis and suggested a "Planet O" at
51.9 a.u.  with a period of 373.5 years, a mass twice the Earth's and
a magnitude of 11.5-14.  Pickering suggested eight other
trans-Neptunian planets during the forthcoming 24 years.  Pickerings
results caused Gaillot to revise the distances of his two
trans-Neptunians to 44 and 66 a.u., and he gave them masses of 5 and
24 Earth masses.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>ll in all, from 1908 to 1932, Pickering proposed seven hypothetical
planets -- O, P, Q, R, S, T and U.  His final elements for O and P
define completely different bodies than the orginal ones, so the
total can be set at nine, certainly the record for planetary
prognostication.  Most of Pickerings predictions are only of passing
interest as curiosities.  In 1911 Pickering suggested that planet Q
had a mass of 20,000 Earths, making it 63 times more massive than
Jupiter or about 1/6 the Sun's mass, close to a star of minimal mass.
Pickering said planet Q had a highly elliptical orbit.  
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n later years only planet P seriously occupied his attention.  In
1928 he reduced the disance of P from 123 to 67.7 a.u., and its
period from 1400 to 556.6 years.  He gave P a mass of 20 Earth masses
and a magnitude of 11.  In 1931, after the discovery of
<a href="PLUTO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html">Pluto</a>, he
issued another elliptical orbit for P: distance 75.5 a.u., period 656
years, mass 50 Earth masses, eccentricity 0.265, inclination 37
degrees, close to the values given for the 1911 orbit.  His Planet S,
proposed in 1928 and given elements in 1931, was put at 48.3 a.u.
distance (close to Lowell's Planet X at 47.5 a.u.), period 336 years,
mass 5 Earths, magnitude 15.  In 1929 Pickering proposed planet U,
distance 5.79 a.u., period 13.93 years, i.e. barely outside Jupiter's
orbit.  Its mass was 0.045 Earth masses, eccentricity 0.26.  The
least of Pickering's planets is planet T, suggested in 1931: distance
32.8 a.u., period 188 years.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>ickering's different elements for planet O were:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>ercival Lowell, most well known as a proponent for canals on
<a href="MARS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Mars</a>,
built a private observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.  Lowell called his
hypothetical planet <b>Planet X</b>, and performed several searches for
it, without success.  Lowell's first search for Planet X came to an
end in 1909, but in 1913 he started a second search, with a new
prediction of Planet X: epoch 1850-01-01, mean long 11.67 deg, perih.
long 186, eccentricity 0.228, mean dist 47.5 a.u.  long arc node
110.99 deg, inclination 7.30 deg, mass 1/21000 solar masses.  Lowell
and others searched in vain for this Planet X in 1913-1915.  In 1915,
Lowell published his theoretical results of Planet X.  It is ironical
that this very same year, 1915, two faint images of Pluto was
recorded at Lowell observatory, although they were never recognized
as such until after the discovery of Pluto (1930).  Lowell's failure
of finding Planet X was his greatest disappointment in life.  He
didn't spend much time looking for Planet X during the last two years
of his life.  Lowell died in 1916.  On the nearly 1000 plates exposed
in this second search were 515 <a href="ASTERO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html">asteroids</a>,
700 variable stars and 2 images of Pluto!
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he third search for Planet X began in April 1927.  No progress was
made in 1927-1928.  In December 1929 a young farmer's boy and amateur
astronomer, <a href="HELP~1.HTM#tombaugh" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a>
from Kansas, was hired to do the search.
Tombaugh started his work in April 1929.  On January 23 and 29,
Tombaugh exposed the pair of plates on which he found Pluto when
examining them on February 18.  By then Tombaugh had examined
hundreds of plate pairs and millions of stars.  The search for Planet
X had come to an end.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>O</font>r had it?  The new planet, later named Pluto, turned out to be
disappointingly small, perhaps only one Earth mass put probably only
about 1/10 Earth masses or smaller (in 1979, when Pluto's satellite
<a href="PLUTO~1.HTM#charon" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html#charon">Charon</a> was discovered,
the mass of the Pluto-Charon pair turned out
to be only about 1/1000 Earth mass!).  Planet X must, if it was
causing those perturbations in the orbit of Uranus, be much larger
than that!  Tombaugh continued his search another 13 years, and
examined the sky from the north celestial pole to 50 deg. south
declination, down to magnitude 16-17, sometimes even 18.  Tombaugh
examined some 90 million images of some 30 million stars over more
than 30,000 square degrees on the sky.  He found one new globular
cluster, 5 new open star clusters, one new supercluster of 1800
galaxies and several new small galaxy clusters, one new comet, about
775 new asteroids -- but no new planet except Pluto.  Tombaugh
concluded that no unknown planet brighter than magnitude 16.5 did
exist -- only a planet in an almost polar orbit and situated near the
south celestial pole could have escaped his detection.  He could have
picked up a Neptune-sized planet at seven times the distance of
Pluto, or a Pluto-sized planet out to 60 a.u.
<p>

<a name="plutonames">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he naming of Pluto</a> is a story by itself.
Early suggestions of the
name of the new planet were: Atlas, Zymal, Artemis, Perseus, Vulcan,
Tantalus, Idana, Cronus.  The New York Times suggested Minerva,
reporters suggested Osiris, Bacchus, Apollo, Erebus.  Lowell's widow
suggested Zeus, but later changed her mind to Constance.  Many
people suggested the planet be named Lowell.  The staff of the
Flagstaff observatory, where Pluto was discovered, suggested Cronus,
Minerva, and Pluto.  A few months later the planet was officially
named Pluto.  The name Pluto was originally suggested by Venetia
Burney, an 11-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he very first orbit computed for Pluto yielded an eccentricity of
0.909 and a period of 3000 years!  This cast some doubt whether it
was a planet or not.  However, a few months later, considerably
better orbital elements for Pluto was obtained.  Below is a
comparison of the orbital elements of Lowell's Planet X, Pickering's
Planet O, and Pluto:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he mass of Pluto was very hard to determine.  Several values were
given at different times -- the matter wasn't settled until James W.
Christy discovered Pluto's moon Charon in June 1978 -- Pluto was then
shown to have only 20% of the mass of our Moon!  That made Pluto
hopelessely inadequate to produce measureable gravitational
perturbations on Uranus and Neptune.  Pluto could not be Lowell's
Planet X -- the planet found was not the planet sought.  What seemed
to be another triumph of celestial mechanics turned out to be an
accident -- or rather a result of the intelligence and thoroughness
of Clyde Tombaugh's search.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>nother short-lived trans-Neptunian suspect was reported on April 22
1930 by R.M. Stewart in Ottawa, Canada -- it was reported from plates
taken in 1924.  Crommelin computed an orbit (dist 39.82 a.u., asc
node 280.49 deg, inclination 49.7 deg!).  Tombaugh searched for the
"Ottawa object" without finding it.  Several other searhes were made,
but nothing was ever found.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>M</font>eanwhile Pickering continued to predict new planets (see above).
Others also predicted new planets on theoretical grounds (Lowell
himself had already suggested a second trans-Neptunian at about 75
a.u.).  In 1946, Francis M. E. Sevin suggested a trans-Plutonian
planet at 78 a.u.  He first derived this from a curious empirical
method where he grouped the planets and the erratic asteroid
Hidalgo, into two groups of inner and outer bodies:

<br><pre>
   Group I:     Mercury   Venus   Earth    Mars   Asteroids  Jupiter
   Group II:      ?       Pluto   Neptune  Uranus  Saturn    Hidalgo
</pre>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>H</font>e then added the logarithms of the periods of each pair of planets,
finding a roughly constant sum of about 7.34.  Assuming this sum to
be valid for Mercury and the trans-Plutonian too, he arrived at a
period of about 677 years for "Transpluto".  Later Sevin worked out a
full set of elements for "Transpluto": dist 77.8 a.u., period 685.8
years, eccentricity 0.3, mass 11.6 Earth masses.  His prediction
stirred little interest among astronomers.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1950, K. Schutte of Munich used data from eight periodic comets to
suggest a trans-Plutonian planet at 77 a.u.  Four years later, H. H.
Kitzinger of Karlsruhe, using the same eight comets, extended and
refined the work, finding the supposed planet to be at 65 a.u., with
a period of 523.5 years, an orbital inclination of 56 degrees, and an
estimated magnitude of 11.  In 1957, Kitzinger reworked the problem
and arrived at new elements: dist 75.1 a.u., period 650 years,
inclination 40 degrees, magnitude around 10.  After unsuccessful
photographic searches, he re-worked the problem once again in 1959,
arriving at a mean dist of 77 a.u., period 675.7 years, inclination
38 degrees, eccentricity 0.07, a planet not unlike Sevin's
"Transpluto" and in some ways similar to Pickering's final Planet P.
No such planet has ever been found, though.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HALLEY~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html"><font size=+2>H</font>alley's Comet</a> has also
been used as a "probe" for trans-plutonian
planets.  In 1942 R. S. Richardson found that an Earth-sized planet at
36.2 a.u., or 1 a.u. beyond Halley's aphelion, would delay Halley's
perihelion passage so that it agreed better with observations.  A
planet at 35.3 a.u. of 0.1 Earth masses would have a similar effect.
In 1972, Brady predicted a planet at 59.9 a.u., period 464 years,
eccentricity 0.07, inclination 120 degrees (i.e. being in a retrograde
orbit), magnitude 13-14, size about Saturn's size.  Such a
trans-Plutonian planet would reduce the residuals of Halley's Comet
significantly back to the 1456 perihelium passage.  This gigantic
trans-Plutonian planet was also searched for, but never found.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>om van Flandern examined the positions of Uranus and Neptune in the
1970s.  The calculated orbit of Neptune fit observations only for
a few years, and then started to drift away.  Uranus orbit fit the
observations during one revolution but not during the previous
revolution.  In 1976 Tom van Flandern became convinced that there was
a tenth planet.  After the discovery of Charon in 1978 showed the
mass of Pluto to be much smaller than expected, van Flandern
convinced his USNO colleague Robert S. Harrington of the existence of
this tenth planet.  They started to collaborate by investigate the
Neptunian satellite system.  Soon their views diverged.  van Flandern
thought the tenth planet had formed beyond Neptune's orbit, while
Harrington believed it had formed between the orbits of Uranus and
Neptune.  van Flandern thought more data was needed, such as an
improved mass for Neptune furnished by
<a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#Voyager2" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#Voyager2">Voyager 2</a>.  Harrington started
to search for the planet by brute force -- he started in 1979, and by
1987 he had still not found any planet.  van Flandern and Harrington
suggested that the tenth planet might be near aphelion in a highly
elliptical orbit.  If the planet is dark, it might be as faint as
magnitude 16-17, suggests van Flandern.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1987, Whitmire and Matese suggested a tenth planet at 80 a.u. with
a period of 700 years and an inclination of perhaps 45 degrees, as an
alternative to their "<a href="#nemesis">Nemesis</a>" hypothesis.  However,
according to Eugene M. Shoemaker, this planet could not have caused
those meteor showers that Whitmire and Matese suggested (see below).
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1987, John Anderson at JPL examined the motions of the spacecraft
<a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#pioneer10" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#pioneer10">Pioneer 10</a>
and <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#pioneer11" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#pioneer11">Pioneer 11</a>,
to see if any deflection due to unknown gravity
forces could be found.  None was found -- from this Anderson concluded
that a tenth planet most likely exists!  JPL had excluded
observations of Uranus prior to 1910 in their ephemerides, while
Anderson had confidence in the earlier observations as well.
Anderson concluded that the tenth planet must have a highly
elliptical orbit, carrying it far away to be undetectable now but
periodically bringing it close enough to leave its disturbing
signature on the paths of the outer planets.  He suggests a mass of
five Earth masses, an orbital period of about 700-1000 years, and a
highly inclined orbit.  Its perturbations on the outer planets won't
be detected again until 2600.  Anderson hoped that the two Voyagers
would help to pin down the location of this planet.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font>onley Powell, from JPL, also analyzed the planetary motions.  He also
found that the observations of Uranus suddenly did fit the
calculations much better after 1910 than before.  Powell suggested a
planet with 2.9 Earth masses at 60.8 a.u. from the Sun, a period of
494 years, inclination 8.3 degrees and only a small eccentricity.
Powell was intrigued that the period was approximately twice Pluto's
and three times Neptune's period, suggesting that the planet he
thought he saw in the data had an orbit stabilized by mutual
resonance with its nearest neighbours despite their vast separation.
The solution called for the planet to be in Gemini, and also being
brighter than Pluto when it was discovered.  A search was performed
in 1987 at Lowell Observatory for Powell's planet -- nothing was
found.  Powell re-examined his solution and revised the elements:
0.87 Earth masses, distance 39.8 a.u., period 251 years, eccentricity
0.26, i.e. an orbit very similar to Pluto's!  Currently, Powell's new
planet should be in Leo, at magnitude 12, however Powell thinks it's
premature to search for it, he needs to examine his data further.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>E</font>ven if no trans-Plutonian planet ever was found, the interest was
focused to the outer parts of the solar system.  The erratic asteroid
Hidalgo, moving in an orbit between Jupiter and Saturn, has already
been mentioned.  In 1977-1984 <a href="HELP~1.HTM#kowal" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#kowal">Charles Kowal</a>
performed a new
systematic search for undiscovered bodies in the solar system, using
Palomar Observatory's 48-inch Schmidt telescope. In October 1987 he
found the asteroid 1977 UB, later named Chiron, moving at mean
distance 13.7 a.u., period 50.7 years, eccentricity 0.3786,
inclination 6.923 deg, diameter about 50 km.  During his search,
Kowal also found 5 comets and 15 asteroids, including Chiron, the
most distant asteroid known when it was discovered.  Kowal also
recovered 4 lost comets and one lost asteroid.  Kowal did not find a
tenth planet, and concluded that there was no unknown planet brighter
than 20th magnitude within 3 degrees of the ecliptic.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font>hiron was first announced as a "tenth planet", but was immediately
designated as an asteroid.  But Kowal suspected it may be very
comet-like, and later it has even developed a short cometary tail!
In 1995 Chiron was also classified as a comet - it is certainly the
largest comet we know about.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n 1992 an even more distant asteroid was found: Pholus.  Later in
1992 an asteroid outside Pluto's orbit was found, followed by five
additional trans-Plutonian asteroids in 1993 and at least a dozen in
1994!
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>M</font>eanwhile, the spacecraft Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2 had
travelled outside the solar system, and could also be used as
"probes" for unknown gravitational forces possibly from unknown
planets -- nothing has been found.  The Voyagers also yielded more
accurate masses for the outer planets -- when these updated masses
were inserted in the numerical integrations of the solar system, the
residuals in the positions of the outer planets finally disappeared.
It seems like the search for "Planet X" finally has come to an end.
There was no "Planet X" (Pluto doesn't really count), but instead an
asteroid belt outside Neptune/Pluto was found!  The asteroids outside
Jupiter's orbit that were known in August 1993 are as follows:

alone but had a companion star.  Suppose that
this companion star moved in an elliptical orbit, its solar distance
varying between 90,000 a.u. (1.4 light years) and 20,000 a.u., with a
period of 30 million years.  Also suppose this star is dark or at
least very faint, and because of that we haven't noticed it yet.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>his would mean that once every 30 million years that hypothetical
companion star of the Sun would pass through the
<a href="KBOC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/kboc.html">Oort cloud</a> (a
hypothetical cloud of proto-comets at a great distance from the Sun).
During such a passage, the proto-comets in the Oort cloud would be
stirred around.  Some tens of thousands of years later, here on
<a href="EARTH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">Earth</a>
we would notice a dramatic increase in the the number of
<a href="COMETS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/comets.html">comets</a>
passing the inner solar system.  If the number of comets increases
dramatically, so does the risk of the Earth colliding with the
nucleus of one of those comets.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>W</font>hen examining the Earth's geological record, it appears that about
once every 30 million years a mass extinction of life on Earth has
occurred.  The most well-known of those mass extinctions is of course
the dinosaur extinction some 75 million years ago.  About 15 million
years from now it's time for the next mass extinction, according to
this hypothesis.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>his hypothetical "death companion" of the Sun was suggested in 1985
by Daniel P. Whitmire and John J. Matese, Univ of Southern Lousiana.
It has even received a name: <b>Nemesis</b>.  One awkward fact of the
Nemesis hypothesis is that there is no evidence whatever of a
companion star of the Sun.  It need not be very bright or very
massive, a star much smaller and dimmer than the Sun would suffice,
even a brown or a black dwarf (a planet-like body insufficiently
massive to start "burning hydrogen" like a star).  It is possible
that this star already exists in one of the catalogues of dim stars
without anyone having noted something peculiar, namely the enormous
apparent motion of that star against the background of more distant
stars (i.e. its parallax).  If it should be found, few will doubt
that it is the primary cause of periodic mass extinctions on Earth.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>B</font>ut this is also a notion of mythical power.  If an anthropologist of
a previous generation had heard such a story from his informants, the
resulting scholary tome would doubtless use words like 'primitive' or
'pre-scientific'.  Consider this story:

<blockquote>
 There is another Sun in the sky, a Demon Sun we cannot see.  Long
 ago, even before great grandmother's time, the Demon Sun attacked our
 Sun.  Comets fell, and a terrible winter overtook the Earth.  Almost
 all life was destroyed.  The Demon Sun has attacked many times
