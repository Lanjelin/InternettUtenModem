Here is a brief outline of the current theory of the events
in the early history of the solar system:
<ol>
<li> A cloud of interstellar gas and/or dust (the "solar nebula")
    is disturbed and collapses under its own gravity. The disturbance
    could be, for example, the shock wave from a nearby supernova.

<p>
<li> As the cloud collapses, it heats up and compresses
    in the center. It heats enough for the dust to
    vaporize. The initial collapse is supposed to take
    less than 100,000 years.

<p>
<li> The center compresses enough to become a protostar
    and the rest of the gas orbits/flows around it. Most
    of that gas flows inward and adds to the mass of the
    forming star, but the gas is rotating. The centrifugal
    force from that prevents some of the gas from reaching
    the forming star. Instead, it forms an "accretion disk"
    around the star. The disk radiates away its energy and
    cools off.

<p>
<li> First brake point. Depending on the details, the
    gas orbiting star/protostar may be unstable and
    start to compress under its own gravity. That
    produces a double star. If it doesn't ...

<p>
<li> The gas cools off enough for the metal, rock and (far
    enough from the forming star) ice to condense out into
    tiny particles. (i.e. some of the gas turns back into dust).
    The metals condense almost as soon as the accretion disk
    forms (4.55-4.56 billion years ago according to isotope
    measurements of certain meteors);
    the rock condenses a bit later (between
    4.0 and 4.5 billion years ago).

<p>
<li> The dust particles collide with each other
    and form into larger particles. This goes on
    until the particles get to the size of boulders
    or small <a href="ASTERO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html">asteroids</a>.

<p>
<li> Run away growth. Once the larger of these
    particles get big enough to have a nontrivial
    gravity, their growth accelerates. Their gravity
    (even if it's very small) gives them an edge over
    smaller particles; it pulls in more, smaller particles,
    and very quickly, the large objects have accumulated
    all of the solid matter close to their own orbit.
    How big they get depends on their distance from
    the star and the density and composition of the
    protoplanetary nebula. In the solar system, the
    theories say that this is large asteroid to <a href="LUNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html">lunar</a>
    size in the inner solar system, and one to fifteen
    times the <a href="EARTH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html">Earth</a>'s size
    in the outer solar system. There
    would have been a big jump in size somewhere
    between the current orbits of
    <a href="MARS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Mars</a> and <a href="JUPITE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>:
    the energy from the <a href="SOL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html">Sun</a> would have kept
    ice a vapor at closer distances, so the solid,
    accretable matter would become much more common
    beyond a critical distance from the Sun. The
    accretion of these "planetesimals" is believed
    to take a few hundred thousand to about twenty
    million years, with the outermost taking to longest
    to form.

<p>
<li> Two things and the second brake point. How
    big were those protoplanets and how quickly
    did they form? At about this time, about 1 million
    years after the system began to form, the star
    would generate a very strong solar wind, which
    would sweep away all of the gas left in the
    protoplanetary nebula. If a protoplanet was
    large enough, soon enough, its gravity would
    pull in the nebular gas, and it would become
    a gas giant. If not, it would remain a rocky or
    icy body.

<p>
<li> At this point, the solar system is composed
    only of solid, protoplanetary bodies and gas
    giants. The "planetesimals" would slowly collide
    with each other and become more massive.

<p>
<li> Eventually, after ten to a hundred million years,
    you end up with ten or so planets, in stable orbits,
    and that's a solar system. These planets and their surfaces
    may be heavily modified by the last, big
    collision they experience (e.g. the largely
    metal composition of <a href="MERCUR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">Mercury</a> or the
    <a href="LUNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/luna.html">Moon</a>).
