&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he Moon was first visited by the Soviet spacecraft
       <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#luna2" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#luna2">Luna 2</a> in 1959. It is the only
       extraterrestrial body to have been <b>visited by humans</b>.
       The first landing was on July 20, 1969 
       (do you remember where you were?);
       the last was in December 1972. 
       The Moon is also the only body from which
       samples have been returned to Earth.  In the summer of 1994,
       the Moon was very extensively mapped by the little spacecraft
       <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#clementine" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#clementine">Clementine</a>.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font><a name="interact"></a>he gravitational forces between the Earth and the Moon
      cause some interesting effects.  The most obvious is the <b>tides</b>. 
      The Moon's gravitational attraction is stronger on the side of the Earth nearest
      to the Moon and weaker on the opposite side.  Since the Earth, and particularly
      the oceans, is not perfectly rigid it is stretched out along the line toward
      the Moon.  From our perspective on the Earth's surface we see two small bulges,
      one in the direction of the Moon and one directly opposite.
      The effect is much stronger in the ocean water than in the solid crust so the
      water bulges are higher.
      And because the Earth rotates much faster than the Moon moves in its
      orbit, the bulges move around the Earth about once a day giving two high tides
      per day.
<br>
<a href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#788" tppabs="ftp://explorer.arc.nasa.gov/pub/SPACE/GIF/earthmo2.gif"><IMG align=right alt="" border=0 width=150 height=150 SRC="THUMB/EARTHMO2.GIF" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/thumb/earthmo2.gif" hspace=4></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the Earth is not completely fluid, either.  The Earth's rotation carries the
      Earth's bulges get slightly ahead of the point directly beneath the Moon.
      This means that the force between the Earth and the Moon is not exactly along
      the line between their centers producing a <b>torque</b> on the Earth and an
      accelerating force on the Moon.
      This causes a net transfer of rotational energy from the Earth to the Moon,
      slowing down the Earth's rotation by about 1.48 milliseconds/century
      and raising the Moon into a higher orbit by about 3.8 centimeters per year.
      (The opposite effect happens to satellites with
      unusual orbits such as
      <a href="PHOBOS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/phobos.html">Phobos</a> and <a href="TRITON~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/triton.html">Triton</a>).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The asymmetric nature of this gravitational interaction
is also responsible for the
      fact that the Moon rotates <a href="HELP~1.HTM#syncrot" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#syncrot">synchronously</a>, i.e. it
      is locked in phase with its orbit so that the same side is
       always facing toward the Earth.
      Just as the Earth's rotation is now being slowed by the Moon's influence so in
      the distant past the Moon's rotation was slowed by the action of the Earth,
      but in that case the effect was much stronger.  When the Moon's rotation rate
      was slowed to match its orbital period (such that the bulge always faced toward
      the Earth) there was no longer an off-center torque on the Moon and a stable
      situation was achieved.
      The same thing has happened to most of the other satellites in the solar system.
      Eventually, the Earth's rotation will be slowed to match the Moon's period, too,
      as is the case with <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html">Pluto</a> and
      <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM#charon" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html#charon">Charon</a>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font>ctually, the Moon appears to wobble a bit (due to its slightly non-circular
       orbit) so that a few degrees of the far side can be
       seen from time to time, but the
       majority of the far side (left)
       was completely unknown until the Soviet spacecraft
       <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#luna3" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#luna3">Luna 3</a> photographed it in 1959.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he Moon has no atmosphere.
But evidence from
       <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#clementine" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#clementine">Clementine</a>  suggests that there
       may be water ice in some deep craters near the Moon's south pole.
       If this turns out to be right, it is of great importance to the future of lunar
exploration.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he Moon's crust averages 68 km thick and varies from
       essentially 0 under Mare Crisium to 107 km north of the crater Korolev
       on the lunar farside.  Below the crust is a mantle
       and possibly a small core.
       Unlike the Earth's mantle, however, the Moon's is only partially molten.
      Curiously, the Moon's center of mass is offset
       from its geometric center by about 2 km in the direction toward the Earth.
       Also, the crust is thinner on the near side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>here are two primary types of terrain on the Moon: the heavily cratered
       and very <a href="HELP~1.HTM#old" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#old">old</a>
       <b>highlands</b>
       and the relatively smooth and younger <b>maria</b>.
       The maria (which comprise about 16% of the Moon's surface)
       are huge impact craters that were later flooded by molten lava.
       Most of the surface is covered with <a name="regolith"><b>regolith</b>,
       a mixture of fine dust and rocky debris produced by meteor impacts</a>.
       For some unknown reason, the maria are concentrated on the near side.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>n addition to the familiar features on the near side, the Moon also has
       <b>South Pole-Aitken</b>
       on the far side which is 2250 km in diameter and 12 km deep making it the
       the largest impact basin in the solar system and <b>Orientale</b>
       on the western limb (as seen from Earth but in the center of the image at left)
which is a splendid example of a multi-ring crater.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font> total of 382 kg of rock samples were returned to the Earth by the 
       <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#apollo" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#apollo">Apollo</a> and
       <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#luna16" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#luna16">Luna</a> programs. These provide most of our
       detailed knowledge of the Moon.
       They are particularly valuable in that they can be dated.
       Even today, 20 years after the last Moon landing,
       scientist still study these precious samples.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>M</font>ost rocks on the surface of the Moon seem to be between 4.6 and 3 billion years
       old.  This is a fortuitous match with the oldest terrestrial
       rocks which are rarely
       more than 3 billion years old. Thus the Moon provides evidence about the
       early history of the Solar System not available on the Earth.
<p>
<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#793" tppabs="http://www.nasm.edu/APOLLO/AS17/LanderScene.jpg"><img align=left alt="" border=0 width=312 height=91 src="THUMB/A17.GIF" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/thumb/a17.gif" hspace=4></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>P</font>rior to the study of the Apollo samples,
      there was no consensus about the origin
       of the Moon.  There were three principal theories: <i>co-accretion</i> which
       asserted that the Moon and the Earth formed at the same time from the
       <a href="ORIGIN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/origin.html">Solar Nebula</a>;
       <i>fission</i> which asserted that the Moon split off of the Earth; and
       <i>capture</i> which held that the Moon formed elsewhere and was subsequently
       captured by the Earth.
       None of these work very well.
       But the new and detailed information from the Moon rocks
       led to the <i>impact</i> theory: that
       the Earth collided with a very large object and that
       the Moon formed from the ejected material.  There are still details to be
       worked out, but the impact theory is now widely accepted.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he Moon has no global magnetic field.  But some of its surface rocks exhibit
       remanent magnetism indicating that there may have been a global magnetic field
       early in the Moon's history.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>W</font>ith no atmosphere and no magnetic field, the Moon's surface is exposed directly
       to the <a href="SOL~1.HTM#solarwind" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html#solarwind">solar wind</a>.  Over its 4 billion year
       lifetime many hydrogen ions from the solar wind have become embedded in
       the Moon's regolith.  Thus samples of regolith returned by the Apollo
       missions proved valuable in studies of the solar wind.
       This lunar hydrogen may also be of use someday as rocket fuel.
