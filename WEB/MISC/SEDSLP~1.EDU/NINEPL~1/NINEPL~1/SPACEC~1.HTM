    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar
    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
    solar orbit. It was intended for a <a href="MARS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Mars</a>
       flyby with Mariner 4.

  <dd>the sister probe to Mariner 3, did reach <a href="MARS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Mars</a> in 1965 and
    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it
    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from
    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the
    geological and biological sense.

       It returned information on the Red Planet that no
    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian
    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once
    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup

  <dt> <a name="pioneer10"><b>Pioneer 10</b> and <b>Pioneer 11</b></a>

       <a href="JUPITE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> in 1973.
  <a name="pioneer11">Pioneer 11</a>
    followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to
    study <a href="SATURN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html">Saturn</a> in 1979.
       The Pioneers were designed to test the ability of spacecraft to survive passage
       thru the asteroid belt and Jupiter's magnetosphere.  The asteroid belt was easy,
       but they were nearly fried by ions trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field. This
       information was crucial to the success of the <a href="#Voyager1">Voyager</a>
       missions.
<p>

      Pioneer 11's RTG power supply is dead.  Its last communication with Earth
      was in November 1995.
      Pioneer 10 continues to gather valuable scientific data but will no longer
      be tracked regularly after March 31, 1997 due to budget cutbacks.
      They are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever to do so.

<p>
      As the first two spacecraft to leave our solar system,
      Pioneer 10 & 11 carry a graphic message in the form of a 6- by
      9-inch gold anodized

       <a href="MERCUR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">Mercury</a> in 1974. The probe
    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in
    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,
    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
    Earth days. Mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974
    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed
    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which
    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.

  <dt> <a name="viking"><b>Viking 1</b></a>
  <dd>       Viking 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on
    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into <a href="MARS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Martian</a>
<A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS14.HTM#1477" tppabs="http://esther.la.asu.edu/asu_tes/TES_Editor/IMAGES/SOL_SYST/MARS/VL_SITES/vikingland_smithsonian.gif"><IMG align=right alt="" border=0 width=90 height=90 SRC="THUMB/VIKING~1.GIF" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/thumb/vikingland_smithsonianICON.gif" hspace=4></a>
       orbit on June
    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse
    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for
    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes
    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of
    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was
    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is
    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and
    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.
<p>
  <dt> <a name="viking2"><b>Viking 2</b></a>
  <dd>  Viking 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in
       <a href="MARS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Martian</a> orbit
    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in
    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
    sister lander, with the exception that its seismometer worked, recording
    one marsquake.
<p>

 The last data from Viking (Lander 1) made its final transmission to Earth
Nov. 11, 1982.  Controllers at JPL tried unsuccessfully for
another six and one-half months to regain contact with Viking
Lander 1.  The overall mission came to an end May 21, 1983.

<p>

    An interesting side note: Viking 1's lander has been designated the
    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the
    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,
    DC is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until
    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.

  <dt> <a name="Voyager1"><b>Voyager 1</b></a>
  <dd>  Voyager 1 (image at top) was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past
       <a href="JUPITE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a> on March
    5, 1979 and by <a href="SATURN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html">Saturn</a>
       on November 13, 1980. Voyager 2 was launched
    August 20, 1977 (before Voyager 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,
    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by <a href="URANUS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html">Uranus</a>
       on January 24, 1986, and
    by <a href="NEPTUN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html">Neptune</a> on August 8, 1989.
       Voyager 2 took advantage of a rare
    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
    outer planet. Voyager 1 could, in principle, have headed towards
       <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html">Pluto</a>,
    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a <a href="TITAN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html">Titan</a> close up.
<p>
    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their
    satellites, and their rings has become immense. Voyager 1&2 discovered
    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and
    <a href="HELP~1.HTM#aurora" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#aurora">aurorae</a>.
       Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major
    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that
       <a href="IO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/io.html">Io</a> has active sulfurous
    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.
<p>
    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets
    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep
    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive
    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle
    is known). <a href="TITAN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html">Titan</a>'s atmosphere was smoggy.
       <a href="MIMAS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mimas.html">Mimas</a>'s appearance was
    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.
    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,
    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.

  <dt> <a name="Voyager2"><b>Voyager 2</b></a>
  <dd>    Voyager 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,
    continued the mission to <a href="URANUS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/uranus.html">Uranus</a> and
       <a href="NEPTUN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html">Neptune</a>.
       Uranus itself was highly
    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was
    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on
    <a href="ARIEL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/ariel.html">Ariel</a>, and
       <a href="MIRAND~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/miranda.html">Miranda</a> was a bizarre patchwork
       of different terrains. 10
    satellites and one more ring were discovered.
<p>
    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,
    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright
    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were
    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed.
       <a href="TRITON~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/triton.html">Triton</a> had a
    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)
<P>
       If no unforeseen failures occur,
       we will be able to maintain communications with both spacecraft
       until at least the year 2030.
       Both Voyagers have plenty of hydrazine fuel -- Voyager 1 is expected
       to have enough propellant until 2040 and Voyager 2 until 2034.  The
       limiting factor is the RTGs (radio-isotope thermal generators).
       The power output from the RTGs is slowly
       dropping each year.  By 2000, there won't be enough power for the UVS
       (ultraviolet spectrometer) instrument.  By 2010, the power will have
       dropped low enough such that not all of the fields and particles instruments
       can be powered on at the same time.  A power sharing plan will go into 
       effect then,
       where some of the F&P instruments are powered on, and others off. 
       The spacecraft can last in this mode for about another 10 years, and after
       that the power will probably be too low to maintain the spacecraft.

       <a href="HALLEY~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html">Comet Halley</a> on March 13,
    1986. The spacecraft carried 10 instruments including a multicolor
    camera, and returned data until shortly before closest approach, when
    the downlink was temporarily lost. Giotto was severely damaged by
    high-speed dust encounters during the flyby and was placed into
    hibernation shortly afterwards.
<p>

    In April, 1990, Giotto was reactivated. 3 of the instruments proved
    fully operational, 4 partially damaged but usable, and the remainder,
    including the camera, were unusable. On July 2, 1990, Giotto made a
    close encounter with Earth and was retargeted to a successful flyby of
    comet Grigg-Skjellerup on July 10, 1992.

  <dt> <a name="wind"><b>Wind</b></a>
  <dd>        After its November 1, 1994, launch, NASA's Wind
satellite will take up a vantage point between the Sun and
the Earth, giving scientists a unique opportunity to study
the enormous flow of energy and momentum known as the solar
wind.
<p>
       The main scientific goal of the mission is to measure
the mass, momentum and energy of the solar wind that somehow
is transferred into the space environment around the Earth.
Although much has been learned from previous space missions
about the general nature of this huge transfer, it is
necessary to gather a great deal of detailed information from
several strategic regions of space around the Earth before
scientists understand the ways in which the planet's
atmosphere responds to changes in the solar wind.
<p>
        The launch also marks the first time a Russian
instrument will fly on an American spacecraft.  The Konus
Gamma-Ray Spectrometer instrument, provided by the Ioffe
Institute, Russia, is one of two instruments on Wind which
will study cosmic gamma-ray bursts, rather than the solar
wind.  A French instruments is also aboard.
<p>
  At first, the satellite will have a
figure-eight orbit around the Earth with the assistance of
the Moon's gravitational field.  Its furthest point from the
Earth will be up to 990,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometers), and
its closest point will be at least 18,000 miles (29,000
kilometers).
<p>
       Later in the mission, the Wind spacecraft will be
inserted into a special halo orbit in the solar wind upstream
from the Earth, at the unique distance which allows Wind to
always remain between the Earth and the Sun (about 930,000 to
1,050,000 miles, or 1,500,000 to 1,690,000 kilometers, from
the Earth).

asteroid 433 Eros in early January 1999.  It will then survey
the rocky body for a minimum of one year, at altitudes as
close as 15 miles (24 kilometers).  Eros is one of the largest
and best-observed asteroids whose orbits cross Earth's path.
These asteroids are closely related to the more numerous "Main
Belt" asteroids that orbit the Sun in a vast doughnut-shaped
ring between Mars and Jupiter.

<dd>      <b>Mars Global Surveyor</b> is the first mission of a new,
decade-long program of robotic exploration of <a href="MARS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Mars</a>, called
the Mars Exploration Program.  This will be an aggressive
series of orbiters and landers to be launched every 26
months, as Mars moves into alignment with Earth.  The
program will be affordable, costing about $100 million per
year; engaging to the public, providing fresh new global and
close-up images of Mars; and have high scientific value
obtained with the development of leading-edge space
technologies.
<p>
    Mars Global Surveyor will be a polar-orbiting
spacecraft at Mars designed to provide global maps of
surface topography, distribution of minerals and monitoring
of global weather.
<p>
    Launched with a Delta II expendable vehicle from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., on November 7 1996, the spacecraft is now
in its 10-month cruise phase; it will arrive at Mars on September 12, 1997,
     where it will be initially
inserted into an elliptical capture orbit.  During the
following four months, thruster firings and aerobraking
techniques will be used to reach the nearly circular mapping
orbit over the Martian polar caps.  Aerobraking, a technique
pioneered by the <a href="#magellan">Magellan</a> mission,
which uses the forces of atmospheric drag to slow the
spacecraft into its final mapping orbit, will provide a
means of minimizing the amount of fuel required to reach the
low Mars orbit.  Mapping operations are expected to begin in
late January 1998.
<p>
   The spacecraft will circle Mars once every two hours,
maintaining a "sun synchronous" orbit that will put the sun
at a standard angle above the horizon in each image and
allow the mid-afternoon lighting to cast shadows in such a
way that surface features will stand out.  The spacecraft
will carry a portion of the <a href="#marsob">Mars Observer</a> instrument payload
and will use these instruments to acquire data of Mars for a
full Martian year, the equivalent of about two Earth years.
The spacecraft will then be used as a data relay station for
signals from U.S. and international landers and low-altitude
probes for an additional three years.
<p>
     International participation, collaboration and
coordination will enhance all missions of the program.
Landers in future years -- 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2005 -- will
capitalize on the experience of the <a href="#pathfinder">Mars Pathfinder</a> lander
mission to be launched in 1996.  Small orbiters launched in
the 1998 and 2003 opportunities will carry other instruments
from the Mars Observer payload and will serve as data relay
stations for international missions of the future.
<p>
     The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft will be acquired
from industry through a competitive procurement.  The
science payload will be provided as government-furnished
equipment that was built to duplicate the instruments flown
on Mars Observer.  The payload includes the Mars orbital
camera, thermal emission spectrometer, ultra-stable
oscillator, laser altimeter, magnetometer/electron
reflectometer and Mars relay system.
<p>
     The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will manage the project
for NASA's Solar System Exploration Division and will
provide the mission design, navigation, and conduct mission
operations.  Tracking and data acquisition will be provided
by a 34-meter subnetwork of the worldwide Deep Space
Network.
<p>
     Project costs for the Mars Global Surveyor through 30
days after launch will be approximately $155 million.<p>

The Mars Pathfinder (formerly known as the Mars Environmental Survey,
or MESUR, Pathfinder) is the second of NASA's low-cost planetary
Discovery missions. The mission consists of a stationary lander
and a surface rover known as Sojourner. The mission has the primary objective of
demonstrating the feasibility of low-cost landings on and exploration
of the Martian surface. This objective will be met by tests of
communications between the rover and lander, and the lander and Earth,
and tests of the imaging devices and sensors.
    <p>
The scientific objectives include atmospheric entry science,
long-range and close-up surface imaging, with the general objective
being to characterize the Martian environment for further exploration.
The spacecraft will enter the Martian atmosphere without
going into orbit around the planet and land on Mars with the aid of

the way down. Prior to landing, the spacecraft will be enclosed by
three triangular solar panels (petals), which will unfold onto the
ground after touchdown.

  <dt> <a name="cassini"><b>Cassini</b></a>
  <dd>  <a href="SATURN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/saturn.html">Saturn</a>
       orbiter and <a href="TITAN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html">Titan</a> atmosphere probe.
       Cassini is a joint
    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.
      Before arriving at Saturn, Cassini will first execute two gravity assist flybys
      of Venus, then one of Earth, and then one of Jupiter (a "VVEJGA" trajectory)
      before arriving at Saturn in June 2004.
      Upon arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of <a href="IAPETU~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/iapetus.html">Iapetus</a>,
       <a href="DIONE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/dione.html">Dione</a> and
       <a href="ENCELA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/enceladus.html">Enceladus</a>. The objectives of the
    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,
    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's
    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.
<p>
    An earlier plan for an asteroid fly-by on the way out similar to the
       highly successful <a href="#galileo">Galileo</a> fly-bys of
       <a href="IDA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/ida.html">Ida</a> and <a href="GASPRA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/gaspra.html">Gaspra</a>
       was scrapped in order to reduce costs.
<p>
    One of the most intriguing aspects of <a href="TITAN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/titan.html">Titan</a>
       is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.

<dt> <a name="pffb"><b>Pluto Express</b></a>
<dd>  (was Pluto Fast Fly-by)  a small, fast, relatively
       cheap initial
       look at the as yet unvisited <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html">Pluto</a>.
 Possible launch in 2001 (if a 1998 new start is
	    authorized). Calls for launch of two spacecraft weighing less
     than 100 kg
	    using Titan IV/Centaur or Proton (possibly with additional solid
	    kick stages) in 2001 and encounters with Pluto and
     <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM#charon" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html#charon">Charon</a>
	    around 2006-8 (depending on trajectory choice).
     Flybys would be at 12-18 km/second; data would be
	    recorded onboard the probes during the short encounters and
	    returned to Earth slowly (due to low power, small antenna sizes,
	    and large distances) over the next year or so.  Russian "Drop
     Zond" probes to sample the atmosphere may be included as well.
<p>
	    Science objectives include characterizing global geology and
	    geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, mapping both sides of each
	    body, and characterizing Pluto's atmosphere (the atmosphere is
	    freezing out as Pluto moves away from the Sun, so launching
	    early and minimizing flight time is critical for this
	    objective). The 7 kilogram instrument package might include a
	    CCD imaging camera, IR mapping spectrometer, UV spectrometer,
	    and radio science occultation experiments.
<p>
	    The PFF spacecraft would be highly a miniaturized descendant of
	    the present class of outer solar system platforms, breaking the
	    trend of increasingly complex and expensive probes such as
	    <a href="#galileo">Galileo</a> and <a href="#cassini">Cassini</a>.
<p>
     There's an article about PFF by its designers in the Sep/Oct 1994
     issue of The Planetary Report, the
     bimonthly newsletter from <a href="PLEA~1.HTM#tps" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/plea.html#tps">The Planetary Society</a>.

<dt> <a name="mpf"><b>Mercury Polar Flyby</b></a>
<dd>As a result of renewed interest in Mercury, there are two related proposals being 
developed as potential Discovery class missions.  Discovery is NASA's new
"cheaper, better, faster" line of solar system exploration spacecraft.  These 
missions are capped at $150 million total mission costs.
The two <a href="MERCUR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mercury.html">Mercury</a>
proposals are the Mercury Polar Flyby (MPF) and Hermes (Mercury orbiter).
MPF's instruments include a neutron spectrometer (water detection), dual
polarization radar (subsurface ice mapping), camera (imaging polar region and 
hemisphere not imaged by Mariner 10).  We believe a flyby is cheaper and
more technically feasible.  MPF is designed to have multiple Mercury encounters
at aphelion only.  At aphelion a spacecraft only has to endure the equivalent of
four times the Earth solar flux.  The orbit of Mercury is eccentric such that at
perihelion there is eleven times Earth solar flux.  An orbiter would have to
endure such conditions requiring elaborate (and expensive) cooling and thermal
shielding systems.
<p>
Hermes is a joint effort between JPL and TRW.
If it is approved, it will be launched in 1999.
