<h3>The Images</h3>

The images in <font size=+1><i>The Nine Planets</i></font> are almost all from NASA. 
Here is a statement from NASA (applying to some but perhaps not all of its images):
<blockquote>

No copyright is asserted for these images.  If a recognizable person
appears in an image, use for commercial purposes may infringe a right
of privacy or publicity.  These images may not be used to state or
imply the endorsement by NASA or by any NASA employee of a comercial
product, process or service, or used in any other manner that might
mislead.  Accordingly, it is requested that if these images are used
in advertising and other commercial promotion, layout and copy be
submitted to NASA prior to release.
<p>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Houston TX  77058
</blockquote>

Here's another NASA statement:
<blockquote>
All of the images presented on NSSDC's Photo Gallery are in the public
domain. As such, they may be used for any purpose. NSSDC does ask,
however, that you acknowledge NSSDC as the supplier of the data. In
addition, where the source of the image (by project or as a specific
person) is credited in the text, you should also acknowledge that,
too.
</blockquote>

Here is the copyright statement for the HST images:

<blockquote>
All of the HST images available via WWW and ftp may be used without
restriction as long as credit information accompanies the picture.
Credit usually includes the principal scientist responsible for the
data, NASA and/or ESA, the European Space Agency. Specific credit
information may be found in the captions accompanying the images as
plain text files. The captions are available via links from the Web
pages as well as separate files in the
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS29.HTM#2914" tppabs="http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/stsci/epa/gif/">gif directory</a> on
the ftp server.
