&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font>areful orbital calculations done in 1950 by
       Jan <a href="HELP~1.HTM#oort" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#oort">Oort</a> indicate that a huge spherical "cloud"
       (now called the <b>Oort Cloud</b>)
       of perhaps a trillion (1e12) or more comets orbit the Sun far beyond the orbit of
       <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html">Pluto</a> from about 30,000 <a href="HELP~1.HTM#au" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#au">AU</a>
       to a <a href="HELP~1.HTM#ly" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#ly">light-year</a> or more.  This is the source of the
       long-period comets.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he Oort Cloud may account for a significant fraction of the mass of the solar
       system, perhaps as much or even more than <a href="JUPITE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>.
       (This is highly speculative, however; we don't know how many comets there are
      out there nor how big they are.)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>he <b><a href="HELP~1.HTM#kuiper" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#kuiper">Kuiper</a> Belt</b>
       is a disk-shaped region past the orbit of
       <a href="NEPTUN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/neptune.html">Neptune</a> roughly  30 to 100
       <a href="HELP~1.HTM#au" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/help.html#au">AU</a> from the Sun containing many small icy bodies.
       It is now considered to be the source of the short-period comets.

<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS18.HTM#1854" tppabs="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb-movie.html"><img align=right alt="" border=0 width=100 height=100 src="THUMB/WY2C.GIF" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/thumb/wy2c.gif" hspace=4></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>O</font>ccasionally the orbit of a Kuiper Belt object will be disturbed by the
       interactions of the giant planets in such a way as to cause to cross the orbit
       of Neptune. It will then very likely have a close encounter with Neptune
       sending it out of the solar
       system or into an orbit crossing those of the other giant planets or even
       into the inner solar system.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>T</font>here are presently six known objects orbiting between Jupiter and Neptune
       (including 2060 Chiron (aka 95 P/Chiron) and 5145 Pholus; see the MPC's
       <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS18.HTM#1855" tppabs="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/Centaurs.html">list</a>).
       The IAU has designated
       this class of objects as <b>Centaurs</b>.
       These orbits are not stable.  These objects are almost certainly "refugees" from
       the Kuiper Belt.  Their future fate is not known.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font>uriously, it seems that the Oort Cloud objects were formed <b>closer</b> to the
       Sun than than the Kuiper Belt objects.  Small objects formed near the giant
       planets would have been ejected from the solar system by gravitational
       encounters. Those that didn't escape entirely formed the distant Oort Cloud.
       Small objects formed
       farther out had no such interactions and remained as Kuiper Belt.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>S</font>everal Kuiper Belt objects have been discovered recently including 1992 QB1
       and 1993 SC (above).
       They appear to be small icy bodies similar to Pluto and
       <a href="TRITON~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/triton.html">Triton</a> (but smaller).
       As of late 1996 there are 39 known trans-Neptunian objects
       (not counting Pluto and
       <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM#charon" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html#charon">Charon</a>); see the MPC's
       <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS18.HTM#1856" tppabs="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/TNOs.html">list</a>.
       Nine of these have distances between 31 and 36 AU, the other eight between
       40 and 45 AU. None have so far been found in the gap in between; this may be
       an effect of Neptune's gravitational attraction.
       Many orbit in 3:2 resonance with Neptune (as does Pluto).
       Color measurements of some
       of the brightest have shown that they are unusually red.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>I</font>t is estimated that there are at least 35,000 Kuiper Belt objects greater
       than 100 km in diameter, which is several hundred times the number (and mass)
       of similar sized objects in the main <a href="ASTERO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html">asteroid</a>
       belt.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>A</font> team of astronomers led by Anita Cochran report that
<a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS18.HTM#1857" tppabs="http://www.stsci.edu/EPA/jpeg/KBComets.jpg"><IMG align=left alt="" border=0 width=100 height=100 SRC="THUMB/KB.GIF" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/thumb/kb.gif" hspace=4></a>
      the <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#hst" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#hst">Hubble Space Telescope</a>
      has detected extremely faint Kuiper Belt objects
      (left).
      The objects are very small and faint perhaps only 20 km or so across.
      There may be as many as 100
      million such comets  in low-inclination orbits and shining brighter
      than the HST's magnitude-28 limit.
      (A follow-up HST observation failed to confirm this observation, however.)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>S</font>pectra and photometric data have been obtained for 5145 Pholus.  Its albedo is
       very low (less than 0.1).  Its spectra indicates the presence of organic
       compounds, which are often very dark (e.g. the nucleus of
       <a href="HALLEY~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html">Comet Halley</a>).
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>C</font><b>hiron</b> is by far the largest known object of this type.
       It is about 170 km in
       diameter, 20 times larger than <a href="HALLEY~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html">Halley</a>.  If it ever is
       perturbed into an orbit that approaches the Sun it will be a truly spectacular
       comet.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>S</font>ome believe that Triton, Pluto and its moon
       <a href="PLUTO~1.HTM#charon" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/pluto.html#charon">Charon</a> are merely the largest examples of Kuiper
       Belt objects.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+2>B</font>ut these are more than distant curiosities.  They are almost certainly pristine
      remnants of the
      <a href="ORIGIN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/origin.html">nebula</a>
      from with the entire solar system was formed.
      Their composition and distribution places important contraints of models of the
      early evolution of the solar system.

<h2>Open Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The very existence of the Oort Cloud is
       somewhat questionable.  Our only evidence is very indirect.
  <li>HST's recent images seem to confirm the existence of the Kuiper Belt.
      But how many of them are there?  What are they made of?
  <li>The proposed <a href="SPACEC~1.HTM#pffb" tppabs="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/spacecraft.html#pffb">Pluto Express</a> mission may be
      also be <a href="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS18.HTM#1868" tppabs="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/pluto/node57.html">extended</a>
      to include a fly-by of a Kuiper Belt object.
