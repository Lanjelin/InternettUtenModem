<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

Selected writing about Mohandas Gandhi, written by the Danish journalist Ellen
 H&oslash;rup (1871-1953). She visited Gandhi and worked for him in the late
 1920s.<BR>

<H2>GANDHI ON WOMEN</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"In Gandhis magazine "Young India" from 1929 there is an article
 entitled "The Hindu Wife", where he is asked for advice regarding a woman
 married to a man who treats her meanly. But Gandhi is against separation. What 
women need is education and upbringing. But when a man ties a women to a pole to
 make her look at his outrageousness, then I don't understand that the women is 
the one who needs education. Gandhi declared that she should go back home and
 find a job.  But she has never learned anything, and possibly her parents are
 so poor, that they can't take her back. Does Gandhi know the words of the
 Chinese mother to her daughter, who, driven to  the uttermost despair, runs
 from her husband back to her mother, who exclaims: "What do you come here for? 
Don't you know I can't help you, or have you forgotten the way to the
 river?"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>But Gandhi is against separation. And even if the parents took her
 back, then she is, according to Hindu law, segregated from anything resembling 
normal life. She is not even seen as a widow. Instead the women has to suffer
 and do without a normal life. Why? Is it justice that she is going to be
 punished because her parents gave her to a bestial man?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In one of the last numbers of "Harijan", Gandhi discusses birth
 control with an English advocate of the cause. Gandhi is against it. He too
 doesn't want children before India has been liberated. But he demands
 abstinence. Only when the intention is to create new life is intercourse
 ethical. If two persons do it only for the sake of the enjoyment, then they
 are, instead of being near the divine, near the devilish. Is this not the
 unnatural teaching of Asceticism, which all healthy people, including the
 scientists, have long ago abandoned as dangerous?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Gandhi says that women are stronger than men. When a woman would
 rather die than give in, the worst beast can't make her do something against
 her will. But when the English woman then asks what a poor woman should do when
 her husband takes another wife, Gandhi answers that the English woman is
 changing the subject. Are there no poor women? Has Gandhi forgotten the
 girl-child married away in the age of 12 to 14? Is she not the one who has to
 fight for her life in order to escape pregnancy every time her husband wants
 her, and who no beast of a man can overcome? Has Gandhi no idea that a woman
 has the same need for devotion as a man, and suffers the same trouble of
 jealousy as Gandhi himself did when he was at school knowing that his wife was 
visiting her friends?"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>GANDHI ON RELIGION</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Gandhi enters the great and admirable fight for the untouchables.
 He fasts for their right to get into the temples for which he is subject to
 attempted assassinations, and he gets the entire priesthood on his back. Gandhi
 has declared that there is no such thing as an untouchable in the holy
 writings, and even if there was, it would conflict with all humanity and
 therefore not could be divine truth. Everybody enthusiastically follows him on 
his Harijan-tour. But the untouchable is a by-product of the caste system, and
 Gandhi fights for the untouchable but wishes to keep the caste system. As if we
 don't have enough with fighting the caste system, which, based on differences
 in money, education, work and sex, is the stain on the world human society.
 Gandhi wants to keep only the four main castes, and he would not allow one
 caste to be regarded as lesser than another. How shall he gain that end in a
 country where the haughtiness of the highest castes is so great that one is
 defiled if but the shadow of an untouchable falls upon one? How can Gandhi
 believe that he can do away with the caste system itself? Does Gandhi's fight
 for the untouchable amount to anything more than the rattling of the prison
 bars of the caste system which also breed the casteless? Why can't he take the 
next step? Of course, Gandhi is not afraid of the anger from those who, in his
 opinion, do wrong. And he won't be the first to break away from that tradition.
 There are two reform movements in India which have abolished both the caste
 system and the idols of the Gods. They are the Bramo-Samaj and the
 Arya-Samaj."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>GANDHI AND THE POOR</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"And so Gandhi goes out to the villages, to his hungry milions, with
 their illiteracy and their superstitions, their indebtedness and their slave
 mentality. What will he teach them, how will he help them? He wants to teach
 the physiology of nutriton, hygiene and handicrafts. This is fine. If they eat 
their rice whole, press their own oil, and spin and weave their own clothes,
 then they will be better fed and they will save a little money for their
 clothing. If in five to six months they work 11 hours per day, they can earn 13
 annas which is the wage the Zamindars pay. <A NAME="Return to text/note 1"> 
<A HREF="#note 1">(1)</A> 
</A>
Because the villagers' requirements are at an absolute minimum in the first place, having food or starving could be one and
 the same thing. The situation in the Indian villages is much like the age of
 villenage in our own country even worse. Extreme pressure comes from taxation
 forced upon them by a foreign power - taxes from which they receive nothing
 back. Not a well, not a road, not a school, not a hospital nor a doctor. They
 have only the option of going to the money-lenders as soon as they can't pay
 the taxes. And the English even collect taxes in  so called hunger-districts.
 Misused by the money-lenders who take up to 200 % interest, the peasants are
 forced to go to the zamindars to sell their future labour in order to keep
 their land. Each year, getting nearer the abyss, they are forced to sell their 
grain as soon as it is ready for harvest. Of couse, the buyers use the peasants'
 privation in order to lower the prices. When the harvest is over, the price may
 be raised so the buyer takes the revenue that could have helped the peasants if
 he could have waited".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Gandhi says that he is out doing purely social work. If he is, I
 cannot agree with him. What he can do could only help a neglible number of
 people. And this is no way for the peasants of India to gain a human existence.
 What they really need is political education, organization and self-confidence 
to make them capable of raising a determined resistance against their
 oppressors. No demands are more justified than theirs, but nothing can gain
 them their justice before they understand they already have a right to
 it".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Gandhi does not teach them that. He brings them the gospel of
 moderation and resignation which in his views is the road to human
 satisfaction. When the masses are not starving, then the money-lenders, the
 zamindars and the capitalists will take what they have left. Poverty doesn't
 bring satisfaction. The possibility for satisfaction is within each human
 being, but nobody has the right to let others suffer from need. Gandhi doesn't 
preach revolt against all those who oppress the peasants. He wants to teach them
 instead to get a little more out of what they already have, to earn something
 in the dry season by hand-labour, even though it is very little because they
 haven't another choice". <A NAME="Return to text/note 2"> 
<A HREF="#note 2">(2)</A> 
</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"But is this not the same gospel which all the churches and priests 
of all religions, in union with the rulers and the capitalists, have preached
 from the beginning of time? And is it not just this that all the advocates of
 the rights of the masses are fighting to destroy; the teaching of moderation
 and resignation to those who all their lives have been nothing but moderate and
 resigned, with reference to the glory of the next life? While those who have
 plenty in this life couldn't imagine exchanging it for the
 hereafter".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Gandhi also brings God. But he also brings his own teaching,
 because he believes that it is the road to satisfaction - which it is. For him.
 This is the difference between Gandhi and other churches and their servants.
 Gandhi thinks that it is he who is exploiting the capitalists because they give
 funds for his work in the villages. He doesn't realise that they are the ones
 who use him to keep the peasants' dissatisfaction down and to support the
 spirit of fatalism and despair which encourages them to run after the carriges 
of the zamindars bowing and thanking him for keeping them alive; just as in
 other countries villeinage peasants like the Danish "Jeppe on the Mount"
 (famous play by the playright Ludvig Holberg), or the Russians who called their
 landlord 'father'".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>GANDHI AND THE WORKERS</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"What is Gandhi's opinion on the workers' struggle? Gandhi does not 
want a class struggle. Capitalists and workers should be good neighbours and
 co-operate. Work is capital too! As soon as the workers are properly educated
 and organized, no capital, no matter how big it is, can overcome them. Yet
 Gandhi himself leads strikes, and this is class struggle. Unions and strikes
 are the workers' weapon in the class struggle. Gandhi doesn't want India to
 become industrialized. He would rather avoid the creation of a workers'
 proletariat. But this is in opposition to the interest of the Indian workers.
 What has driven the Indian workers into their present misery is, first and
 foremost, unemployment. The English took the raw materials of India, which she 
until then had prepared herself, made a living for the English workers by
 producing the final goods, and then forced the Indians to buy from them. The
 sooner India gets an industry the better, so the country can produce its own
 goods. Thereby, the manufacturers' money will stay in the country and more
 Indians will be employed, plus a big labour organization will be a strong
 weapon in the fight for proper wages".</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>GANDHI AS POLITICAN</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Gandhi is not fit to be a politican. The political game is played
 with the same rules as in war. The result of the fight is partly due to the
 strength of the two forces and partly due to their ability to judge the enemy. 
In the First World War thousands of human lives were sacrificed because of poor 
calculations of the strength of the enemy. And most important in war and
 politics is to attack at the right moment, to use the chances when they are
 there and to avoid falling into an ambush.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A personality like Gandhi's is not fit for the war called politics. 
He is an idealist, a visionary. The line he follows is not a political one. He
 does not unchangeably strive toward pre-selected and pre-determinated goals. He
 lacks a definite goal. He says, 'The final goal we know nothing about, but the 
means we are masters of ourselves.' The line Mahatma Gandhi is following has
 gone through many changes, influenced by too many religious, moral and ethical 
considerations. There is something accidental, capricious, about the policy of
 the Congres, resulting in adverse effects upon its relationship with the
 British goverment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This is clearly shown by the incidents of 1922. Gandhi had promised 
the country independence before the year had passed. When it didn't come Gandhi 
decided to begin a no-tax campaign. The whole country prepared feverishly for
 the struggle. Gandhi addressed the ultimatum to the British viceroy. The wave
 of ecstacy reached a peak. But before the answer from the viceroy came, an
 accident happened which overthrew the whole thing. Some peasants, angered by
 the brutality of the police, set fire to a police station and killed some
 constables in Chauri-Chaura. Gandhi, terribly shaken and disappointed by this
 isolated incident of lack of self-control,  stopped the movement throughout the
 entire country.  The other leaders were outraged. And there was a revolt inside
 the Congress. But the moment had passed. The chance lost. Gandhi sacrified the 
political for the ethical.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>One example of how he understands how to unite both parts in an
 effective and dramatic way is his departure from the Congress. He left because 
he felt like a dictator who forced others to follow him against their
 consciousness. This move was an admission of the fact that there was an
 oposition against him and his leadership. Pierre Ceresole said that Gandhi
 hoped that the Congress Party, liberated from the pressure of his personal
 presence, would more easily find the right way in the right spirit. He left in 
order to give the opposition open opportunities. A politician could never act
 more ethically. Even so, Gandhi did not forget the political
 aspects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Before he left, he excluded all opposition members from the working 
group of the Congress Party. He wanted the working group united. And he made it 
a personal referendum. He then departed, leaving a leadership consisting only of
 his own followers, people who would do nothing without him - who admired him as
 a human being and followed him as a prophet. It is impossible to conclude other
 than Gandhi left the Congress in order to strengthen his influence in the
 country and at the same to secure his power within the Congress. Certainly, he 
couldn't have acted more politically at that moment. And seldom, if ever, has a 
single man had as many followers as Gandhi."

The following quote is an example of the average contemporary analyses of
 Gandhi's suggestions for ending poverty and unemployment, offered here as a
 contrast to Ellen H&oslash;rup's analysis."

<BLOCKQUOTE>When asked what measures he would suggest for this great work of
 filling the empty stomachs of the people, Dr. Mann said that much could be done
 by the people themselves. They must put themselves to work, for no country
 could ever hope to be prosperous if the majority of its population were idle
 for six months of the year.<BR>
The people must be given some work, no matter how small the income derived
 therefrom, during the dry season, and Dr. Mann said that no matter in what
 other way Mr. Gandhi  had gone astray, he had penetrated into the secret of the
 poverty of India when he had advocated the spinning wheel, no matter if it
 would only produce a few annas a day". (Richard B. Greigg: Economies af
 Khaddar. Calcutta. 1928. S. Danesen. pp. 107).</BLOCKQUOTE>
