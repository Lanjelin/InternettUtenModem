<H4>Aldrig mere Krig - V&aring;benArkivet</H4>
<I>By Tom Vilmer Paamand 27/04-95</I>

After the wars landmines continue to kill. Even about half of the so called
 "smart" mines are known to forget to self-destruct.<BR>
The governments try to distinguish between anti-tank mines and anti-personnel
 mines. The mines don't. They just kill.<BR>
Many countries use, produce, sell and export mines. Denmark is not one of the
 worsts, but has never decided to say no. There is no export for the moment, but
 it is only due to lack of orders. The companies are just waiting.<BR>
Danish companies do not produce or export anti-personnel mines today. No private
 company has a license to produce parts for such weapons since 1983.<BR>
Neither has no private company a license to produce anti-tank mines. But a few
 companies have a license to produce parts for anti-tank mines.<BR>
Denmark has one company owned by the government, Ammunitionsarsenalet, who do
 not need licenses. They are, for the moment, not producing mines.<BR>
This information is confirmed by the Danish Ministry of Justice.<BR>
The mines used by the military in Denmark are mostly made in other countries.
 They are technically very old, the oldest is from 1947, and are planned to be
 replaced by newer ones from year 2000-2010.<BR>
The Danish government discussed November 95 a proposal to ban anti-personnel
 mines in Denmark. Everybody gave it sweet words - and no support.<BR>
The Danish Airforce bought a new mine from Sweden in 1993, Fordonsmina 13 or
 FFV-013. Since then the export of that mine is stopped while the Swedish
 government discusses if it is anti-tank or anti-personnel.<BR>
The enclosed list of Danish landmine-producing companies is compiled by the
 Danish peace-organisation "Aldrig mere Krig".<BR>
This list does not distinguish between the producers of anti-personnel mines and
 anti-tank mines since anti-personnel mines have not been produced in Denmark
 since the 70'ies - but in 1980 some were renovated for the Danish Army. One
 company produced parts for anti-personnel mines until 1983.<BR>
The list is in no way complete, and a number of the names are only suspects. We 
keep on working to collect new material and the mine-producers keeps on doing
 their work. Some of the companies are closed now, some have changed name or
 owners and some have stopped producing mines. Others might have started.<BR>

The last anti-tank mine was produced here in 1992, the "Pansermine M/88".<BR>
Anti-personnel mines have not been produced since the 50'ies, but in 1980 <BR>
they renovated the "Personelmine M/47" for the Danish army.<BR>
They are, for the moment, not producing mines. This information is confirmed
 <BR>
by the Danish Ministry of Justice.<BR>
But they have not given up producing mines and have recently delivered Anti-tank
 Mine Fuzes to the Swedish Army.<BR>
The filling plant at the Ammunition Arsenal is now being renovated and they are 
installing new equipment for filling of bombs and mines.<BR>
The above information is confirmed by S&oslash;ren Hansen fg. produktionschef
 (acting chief of production) from Ammunitionsarsenalet and the Danish Minister 
of Defence Hans H&aelig;kkerup.<BR>
The Ammunition Arsenal is owned by the Danish government and does not need a
 license to produce arms - but for export. It is a part of the Danish Army
 Material Command. Employees: 270.<BR>

Nea-Lindberg A/S has proprietary technology in relation to production of
 Electronic Mine Fuzes and is the biggest factory of that kind in Denmark. The
 fusez is also exported, many of them to Germany.<BR>
Nea-Lindberg's electronic Anti-tank Mine Fuze M/88 can be fitted to the M19
 anti-tank mine, which is license-produced in Turkey by MKEK, in South Korea by 
the Korea Explosives Company (qv) and the Daewoo Corporation, and in Chile
 (Industrias Cardoen). It is also in service with the US Army.<BR>
The M/88 was developed in cooperation with the Royal Danish Army Material
 Command. Nea-Lindberg is now developing new demining equipment, again together 
with the Royal Danish Army Material Command.<BR>
(<A HREF="#FOLSP">FOLSP</A>) Nea-Lindberg got a license to produce parts for

(<A HREF="#JANMV">JANMV</A> 92) ... The electronic Anti-tank Mine Fuze M/88 was 
developed in co- operation with the Royal Danish Army Material Command. It is
 offered as a cost-effective alternative retrofit solution for existing
 non-metallic mines. The fuze is licence-produced by Royal Ordnance as the RO
 150.<BR>
The M/88 can provide most existing non-metallic mines with a full width
 capability. It can be fitted to the Bar Mine using two plastic straps with snap
 locks and without using tools. ...<BR>
The fuze has an advanced electronic sensor which ensures correct functioning
 regardless of target speed. The sensors can be preset to disregard light
 targets and the fuze has a built-in anti-tilt device. It is also protected
 against electronic mineclearing measures.<BR>
The 7.8 g transfer charge of TNT/RDX 45:55 is integrated into the fuze bottom
 and can be fitted without having to open the fuze. ...<BR>
The M/88 has a 15 min arming delay and will self-neutralise after 90 days.
 Burying depth is up to 150 mm in earth. ... Minimum shelf life is 10 years
 although the battery may have to be changed after 5 years. Weight of the M/88
 is 835 g including the battery. Dimensions are 218x97x54 mm... In production.

 fighting with Oman. It is illegal for Danish companies to sell arms to
 countries actually using them in a war.<BR>
J&oslash;rgen H&oslash;yers armsexport was discussed in the Danish parliament,
 and it was said to be of 105.000 Fuze Mines M606 and Firing Devices M57, which 
should be around 50 tons.<BR>
According to the Danish Statistic Bureau Denmark exported 241 tons of bombs to
 Iran and one of the freight companies had moved at least 700 tons.<BR>
It was never made clear what was right and wrong but it is suspected,
that J&oslash;rgen H&oslash;yer A/S secretly was smuggling mines for another
 Nordic factory, which was not allowed to do this transport self.<BR>
