<I>By Holger Terp</I> 
<BR> 
<BR>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

The Danish journalist Ellen H&oslash;rup (1871-1953) wrote more than 600 feature

 articles and editorials, and more than 300 shorter articles in newspapers,
 magazines and books about international politics, armament and disarmament, and

 imperialism. Her first work was about Gandhi and his non-violent struggle
 against British imperialism in India. Later she wrote against fascism and
 nazism, against totalitarian goverments as a whole, and militarism, including
 NATO. Most of her work was done in the thirties and forties, which made it
 natural for her to write about subjects such as the Spanish Civil War, The
 League of Nations and political as well as religious refugees (long before
 Amnesty International).<BR> 

During the German occupation of Denmark, when she was unable to write about
 foreign political matters, she set her mind upon writing about another
 oppressed group, children. She became a strong critic of Danish public
 childcare, an effort for which she is, after all, not completely forgotten. In 

fact, some people still remember her with gratitude, and a new magazine about
 children's conditions in Denmark is named after her, "ELLEN".  <BR>

Ellen H&oslash;rup was, in many ways, a person ahead of her time. She wrote not 

only about the subjects already mentioned, she also wrote about agriculture and 

pollution. Being one of the first female foreign policy journalists in Denmark
 and internationally, she also took great interest in womens' liberation and
 wrote a great deal about it. Her main focus was, however, her peace work. She
 was a cosmospolite. Not only did Ellen H&oslash;rup speak and write in Danish, 

but she also spoke and wrote exellently in English, Italian, German, Russian and

 French. <BR>

Ellen H&oslash;rup was a member of Danish and international peace groups.
 However, she never was a member of any political party or religioius group,
 even though she had friends in unexpected places. Ellen H&oslash;rup was a
 "grassroots" 50 years before the word was invented. <A NAME="Return to text/note 1"> 
<A HREF="#note 1">(1)</A> 
</A>
<BR>

She was the daughter of the famous Danish anti-militarist, journalist and
 politican Viggo H&oslash;rup (1841-1902). <A NAME="Return to text/note 2"> 
<A HREF="#note 2">(2)</A> 
</A> In October 1884 he founded the daily "Politiken",

 which slowly grew to become one of the biggest newspapers in the country. The
 shares in "Politiken", which she had inherited from her parents, made her
 economically independent, so she could do as she pleased.<BR>

After the death of her mother, in late 1923, Ellen H&oslash;rup divorced her
 husband and settled in Rome. In 1927 she made the acquaintance of Gandhi's
 non-violent fight for freedom and decided to carry on the journalistic work of 

her father by describing the activities of The Congress Party as well as the
 activities of Mahatma (as he was called) Gandhi. She visited Gandhi and worked 

for him in the late 1920s together with other female friends: the world famous
 Danish painter, ceramist and designer Cathinca Olsen and the then equally
 famous Norwegian singer Bokken Lasson. Both worked in the  Friends of India
 Society in Copenhagen and Oslo. <BR>

<H2>INTERNATIONAL PEACE NEWS!</H2>

Despite the fact that her father had taken part in establishing "Politiken", and

 she was a shareholder and member of the board (from 1933 to 1949), as a part of

 the Danish establisment, the paper was not always happy to publish her
 controversial articles and analyses of international politics. But the paper
 did it in spite of a growing political disagreement. Throwing out the daughter 

of the founder and late leading journalist in Scandinavia would not look too
 good in the public's eyes.<BR>

In order to get her pacifist information out to a larger international public,
 as well as in order to be better informed herself, she moved to Geveva in 1933.

 Here, before moving, in October 1932, she established "The International
 Committee for India" and in 1935, the news agency "Journal des Archives". <A NAME="Return to text/note 3"> 
<A HREF="#note 3">(3)</A> 
</A> "The International
 Committee for India" held at least three international conferences in 1932 and 

1933 in Geneva. Some of the organizations and individuals which were connected
 to the Committee were: "The Friends of India Societies" in London, Copenhagen
 and Oslo, "The Indian Conciliation Group", London, "The Womens' International
 League for Peace and Freedom", Alice Paul, Agathe Harrison, Edmond Privat,
 Dorothy Detzer, Edit Pye, Margerith Cousins, Sidney Strong, Magdalene Rolland -

 the sister of Romain Rolland - and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. (Some of the
 women mentioned here were supporters of the Suffragette movement and members of

 "The Womens' International League for Peace and Freedom". Others were
 "Friends").<BR>

"The International Committee for India" published the magazine "Indian Press",
 1934-1935. The peace news agency published the now extremely rare, and to my
 knowledge, never since quoted magazines "Letter from Geneva" and "Journal des
 Archives" in English, French and German. In 1930, in Copenhagen, she had
 already formed the organization and magazine "Indiens Venner" (= Friends of
 India Society). At the time there were similar pro-Gandhi organizations which
 supported the Indian nationalist struggle in Norway, Sveden, England, Belgium, 

France, Bulgaria, Japan and U.S.A., as well as other countries. These
 organizations and their magazines are mostly forgotten today.<BR>

The Danish <EM>"Friends of India Society"</EM> lasted from November 1930 to
 around 1938 and had some 250 members. <A NAME="Return to text/note 4"> 
<A HREF="#note 4">(4)</A> 
</A> Among the members were Danish missionaries who had travelled
 and lived in India for a long time. Among them were Anne Marie Petersen, the
 headmaster of "The Indian National School", Porto Novo; Gandhi's 'dear child'
 Ester F&aelig;ring (Menon), Johannes Bittermann and his wife - who lived in
 India for 42 year and the Swedish missionary Mrs. Karlmark from "The Swedish
 Church Mission". Besides the stories of the Indian liberation movement, the
 magazine also carried cultural and religious articles, thus painting a broader 

picture of India than the ordinary magazines of the peace movements of the
 time.<BR>

<H2>MAHATMA GANDHI</H2>

Ellen H&oslash;rup admired Gandhi whom she visited and worked for in the winter 

of 1929/30 and again in the winter of 1930/31 when she followed him and worked
 for him during his journey from India to the Round Table Conference in London. 

She also corresponded with Gandhi through the years. In one of the first letters

 she wrote to him from Rome, dated May 2, 1929, she writes: <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"In Denmark we have a Socialist-Radical ministry. Two of my friends 

have been ministers, one of foreign affairs, another of justice (former Prime
 Minister and Minister of Justice  C. T. Zahle and former Minister of Foreign
 Affairs P. Munch), so I hope that there shall be no difficulties with my 
 passport for India in a year and a half.

My first article about India has been published. I send you the number of the
 paper although it is in Danish, because I remember your expression when you
 asked me "what I was doing in Rome". My second article is called "Mahatma
 Gandhi and his Ashram". It is already mailed and will be published this month. 

The Danish ministry is a disarmament ministry in accordence with my father's
 ideas". <A NAME="Return to text/note 5/1"> 
<A HREF="#note 5">(5)</A> 
</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

On June 6th 1931 Ellen H&oslash;rup wrote to Bapuji, Gandhi's nickname among
 friends:

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Yes it would have been nice, if we could have met each other
 oftener. But I don't complain. I went to most of your meetings, and I attended 

more than twenty times to the evening prayer. But  I always felt, that I had no 

right to take your time..."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I am on my way back to Denmark, where I shall let my friends make
 me a member of the board of my paper Politiken. During this year I shall stay
 in Copenhagen and try to make the paper a little less yellow and a little more 

truthful. If I can do nothing, I must make "The Friends of India" larger and
 broader and leave the others alone". <A NAME="Return to text/note 6"> 
<A HREF="#note 6">(6)</A> 
</A> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

In December 1931 she published the book <EM>"Gandhis Indien"</EM>, the first
 book written in Danish on Gandhi and the situation in India which shows how
 passionately she felt for the cause of India. It gives witness to the degree to

 which she could penetrate into, and familiarize herself with, Indian ways of
 life and mind. Yet the curious thing is, that however deeply she may be seized 

by the sentiment of the induvidial festive moment, she remained the cool and
 sceptical observer with the sharp eye for the paltriness and ridiculness of her

 fellow human beings.<BR>

In a totally natural way, Ellen H&oslash;rup describes the conditions  and ways 

of life which were enormously remote from the life of contemporary Europeans.
 The reason why she was able to do this is that she did not travel as a typical 

tourist - satisfied with the stereotyped sightseeing usually presented to the
 curious European - she visited the ordinary Indian quarters, dined at the
 native resturants, listened to all kinds of people. She also went to the
 villages where she observed the poverty in which the people lived. <BR>

When Ellen H&oslash;rup, unlike so many of the followers of Gandhi, drifted 
 somewhat away from him, it was not because of the policy of non-violence, which

 she agreed with. But because, in her view, the fight for the liberation of
 India should be still further developed. The workers and the women of India
 should be included more, but Gandhi would support neither the Indian workers'
 unions nor the womens' liberation groups.<BR> 

<H2>ELLEN H&Oslash;RUP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH GANDHI </H2>

In an address held in Copenhagen, for the Danish "Friends of India Society" on
 November 23, 1936 <A NAME="Return to text/note 7"> 
<A HREF="#note 7">(7)</A> 
</A>,
 "My relationship with Gandhi" Ellen H&oslash;rup among other things said,

<BLOCKQUOTE>"His ideas, my admiration for him, the longing to meet the man, who 

gave me what I have been seeking all my life - something which together is
 called devotion, reverence and love - was what led me twice to India. I wanted 

to see Gandhi, and I wanted to see the 350 milion meek Hindus who follow him.
 While in India, I sought out only him and his followers. In every city, my
 first goal was the Kaddar-shop, where I just had to show a little medallion of 

Gandhi which was sold in the streets for 10 cents, before all faces would
 change, all hearts open and all hands be ready to greet me.  I found what I
 sought. But that was all I found. I did what one of my friends wrote that she
 had done!  I identified India with Gandhi. And Gandhi meant, to me, the apostle

 who would bring, not only to India but to the entire world, the gospel of the
 future - the abolishing of violence from mankind.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>And he still does.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>But as the years have passed and after I have beeen to London
 attending the Round Table Conference <A NAME="Return to text/note 8"> 
<A HREF="#note 8">(8)</A> 
</A> India now means more than Gandhi to me.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>And I have become wiser from reading and from meeting many people
 from Gandhi's country, and I have learned that there are different movements in

 India just as there are in any country. And I have drifted from Gandhi in many 

ways. I follow him on his journeys among the peasants and in the cities among
 the workers. I read what he says about the women, and what he says to them when

 they ask for advice. Gandhi admires them highly. He has called them out from
 their isolation, freed them from the purdahs. But Gandhi still has the mind of 

a man, and besides that, the mind of a Hindu." <A NAME="Return to text/note 5/2">

<H2>CONCLUDING REMARKS
</H2>
When Gandhi was nominated for the 1937 Nobel Peace Price by the Norwegian
 chapter of the "Friends of India Society", Ellen H&oslash;rup wrote to a number

 of influential persons to make them support the nomination.  She got positive
 replies from Romain Rolland, C. F. Andrews, The Danish Nobel Laureate Henrik
 Pontoppidan, and the German Nobel Peace Price Laureate Professor Ludvig Quidde,

 the Danish MPs Hassing J&oslash;rgensen and Edv. Larsen, Bart de Ligt, Maria
 Montessori, The Danish chapter of "The Womens' International League for Peace
 and Freedom", as well as support from numerous other Danish organizations and
 individuals. But Gandhi, in spite of the popular Scandinavian and international

 demand, never was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. <A NAME="Return to text/note 9">

<BR>

Ellen H&oslash;rup continued in the late 1930's to write and publish articles
 about Gandhi and the Indian struggle for freedom, and later, in 1948, she
 became a member of the board of the "Danish Indian Friendship Union". <A NAME="Return to text/note 10">

At the age of 81 years Ellen H&oslash;rup died from a combination of lung cancer

 and a cold, which she contracted doing research among the poor farmers in Italy

 in the spring of 1953. Ellen H&oslash;rup died dictating her last articles
 protesting against the Korean War. She was not able to hold a pen in her hand
 nor to sit at the typewriter. <A NAME="Return to text/note 11">

There are not many sources on "Service d'Archives". However, the editor of "The 

Calcutta Review", Mr. Bimalendu Koyal, wrote on June 15th 1936 to Ellen
 H&oslash;rup:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Dear Madam. Many thanks for your learned articles which you kindly 

sent to me for publication in The Calcutta Review. These have already appeared
 and copies of the Review have been sent to you under a seperate cover. We do
 not know how one of your articles sent to me, namely "The Policy of the Great
 Powers", which has appeared in our June issue, has been published
 simultaneously by The Modern Review. We shall in the future be glad to publish 

twelve articles from your pen on international politic..."</BLOCKQUOTE>

"The International Committee for India". See: "Indiens Venner" 1932, no. 12,
 also: vol. 3). 1932 November no. 1, 2, 1933 no. 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 1933 vol 4.
 December, no. 2.<BR>
The magazine "Indian Press" cited stories from European, American and Indian
 newspapers, news agencies and magazines. Among the sources were the magazines: 

"Forward", "Les cahiers des droits de l'homme", "Free Press Journal", "The
 Earthquake Relief", "New Leader", "Indian Bulletin", "Indian Express,
 "Industrial and Labour Information", "Modern Review", Calcutta, "Clarion", and 

"New  Asia", the last magazine was published by the Japanese organization, "New 

Asia Association".<BR>
When the last number of the "Indian Press" was published the "Modern Review" was

 quoted, "It was a mistake on the part of the Congress to have given up foreign 

work..."

<BLOCKQUOTE>"It is true, we must win freedom mainly by our efforts. But the
 sympathy and at least the moral support of foreign nations are valuable"
 (August 1935). Ellen H&oslash;rup then wrote, "Because of the decision taken by

 the National Congress of India, we have decided to suspend the publication of
 our magazine for the time being. We will take it up again as soon as the Indian

 organizations themselves  recognise the necessity of a propaganda campaign in
 foreign countries".</BLOCKQUOTE>

The files of the "Indian Conciliation Group" (1930-1953) was in 1954 placed at
 the Library of The Friends House, London, in "Temporary" boxes no. 41-52.
 During "The Friends" Yearly Meeting of Sufferings, on June 6th 1930, an "Indian

 Affairs Comittee" was establisted.<BR>
This committee lasted till March 1934, but out of the committe grew "The Indian 

Conciliation Group" led by Quaker peace activist Carl Heath. See: YM Proc 1930
 pp. 286-288, YM Proc 1931 pp. 106, YM Proc 1934 pp. 182 and "Reports to Meeting
