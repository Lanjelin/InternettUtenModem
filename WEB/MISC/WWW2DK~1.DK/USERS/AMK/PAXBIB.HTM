<H1>Where is the history of the peace movements?</H1>

Unfortunately, it seems at first view at the library shelves and in the library
 catalogues, that there has not been much writing about the history of the
 international peace movements. In particular this is true if one compares the
 number of publications about the peace movements and the history of the people
 connected to it compared to the number of volumes about international politics
 or armaments, weapons or military matters.<BR>

<H3>Why is it important?</H3>

Why is it important to study the history of the international peace movements?
First, because the peace movements represent an alternative to the wisdom of the
 establishment.<BR>
Their policies are to end wars and armament by peaceful means and create 
 peaceful alternatives in a world ridden with conflicts. Secondly, the peace 
 movements have somewhat failed to reach their goals even though the good news
 of successes can be found. Like the peaceful separation of Norway and Sweden in
 1905. More recently, the successful campaign of INFACT International against General Electric, which caused the company to cancel all activities in nuclear
 weapons.<BR>

<H3>Recycling of ideas</H3>

Wars and armaments continue still since the beginning of the peace movements. Therefore the lessons of history are important, if not to the politicans the
 more to their subjects, in helping us to understand the successes and failures 
 of the peace movements.<BR>
 By using the experience of the past one make sure that the former generations
 of peace workers not are forgotten and thus did not work vainly. By learning of
  successful actions, recycling of ideas and actions becomes possible. Learning 
about peace work in different countries can also help the growth of, and the 
 need for, more international understanding and co-operation. That is: We in 
 the different peace groups are not working alone, even though it sometimes 
 seems like it.<BR>

The apparently small numbers of publications on the history of the peace
 movement are classified under many different headlines: peace movements, social
 movements, non-violent movements, conscientious objectors, etc. These make
 searches for the relevant information rather difficult for those who
 unfortunately not are educated information mediators, computer freaks,
 historians or academicians.<BR>
The records on the history of the
 international peace movements will establish that there are quite a few books
 on organised peace work. Peace work is not limited to a single movement, a
 single country nor groups of countries, nor even that their activities are
 limited i time.<BR>
The recordings of books about the history of the peace
 movements and the persons who are, were active in it, forms the basis of this
 volume. However, the work is not complete, but rather illustrates the broadness
 of the many subjects concerning the different peace groups.<BR>
