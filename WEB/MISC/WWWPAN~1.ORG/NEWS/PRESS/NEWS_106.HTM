<b>BRUSSELS AND LUXEMBOURG</b> - In a landmark ruling today by the European 
Court of First Instance, the European Commission has been forced to open 
up its internal proceedings to greater public scrutiny. 
<p>
The successful legal challenge was mounted by the World Wide Fund For 
Nature (WWF).  It claimed that the Commission was interpreting its own 
Code of Conduct on the release of documents to the public too narrowly.
<p>
"This is an important victory for all who want to see more openness in 
European decision-making," said Tony Long, Director of the European 
Policy Office. "The Court of First Instance has come down on the side of 
the citizen against big government." 
<p>
The Code of Conduct Concerning Public Access to Commission and Council 
Documents came into force on 15 February 1994.  It includes a range of 
exceptions including one which states that the Commission "may refuse 
access (to documents) in order to protect the institutions interest in 
the confidentiality of its proceedings". 
<p>
"This catch-all exemption allowed too much discretion to the Commission," 
added Georg Berrisch, WWF's lawyer from Schön Nolte Finkelnburg & Clemm.  
"Todays Court decision begins to set out some more reasonable boundaries 
to protect the citizens rights to open government."
<p>
The case is the first legal challenge against the European Commission on 
the basis of the Code of Conduct.  John Carvel from the newspaper The 
Guardian brought a successful case against the European Council in 1995. 
<p>
WWF's challenge arose from the refusal by the Commissions 
Secretary-General, Mr David Williamson, to disclose information about the 
allocation of structural funds for a visitors centre in national park 
Mullaghmore, in County Clare in Western Ireland.
