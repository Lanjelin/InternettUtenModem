<b>BERGEN, Norway</b>: As Environmental and Fisheries Ministers fly in 
today to 
tackle the difficult problem of integrating fisheries management in the 
North Sea with overall marine environmental protection, six European 
offices of WWF, the international conservation organisation, urged the  
ministers to come to a meaningful agreement to halt the overfishing of an 
ever dwindling resource.
<p>
With more than 200 species of fish, the North Sea is one of the most 
productive fisheries in the world - but many of the most commercially 
important stocks are almost at the point of collapse. At the same time 
certain seabirds and marine mammals, as well as marine habitats are being 
seriously affected by indiscriminate fishing practices, including 
by-catch and discarding.
<p>
Two years ago,  at the fourth International Conference on the Protection 
of the North Sea, Environmental Ministers and members of the European 
Commission were agreed that the situation was so urgent  it needed 
"immediate" attention. This Intermediate Ministerial (IMM) was convened 
to concentrate on the impacts of fisheries policies and methods on the 
North Sea ecosystems.
<p>
So far, however, there has dissent and confusion surrounding the 
preparatory processes with weakening of the draft text of the Ministerial 
Statment of Conclusions -  and the European Commission insisting on their 
exclusive competence. In particular, specific wording on targets and 
timetables has been completely removed.
<p>
Many of the Environment Ministers want to encompass interactions between 
fisheries, species, habitats and the North Sea food web in a more 
stringent way. They feel that the urgency of the situation is such that 
the political processes need to be unblocked.
<p>
Stephan Lutter, Head of the WWF Delegation to the talks said today: "Time 
is running out. Unless the Ministers want to see other fish stocks going 
down the same road as herring and cod, they must counterbalance the sort 
of approach to fisheries management where the EU waits for a disaster 
before taking action. By which time, its too late. The outcome of this 
IMM must not be neutralised by internal politics because the EU prefers 
to wait until 2002 and the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy."
<p>
WWF is urging Ministers to put immediate recovery plans in place for 
those North Sea stocks that are currently overfished, threatened and 
depleted, which may require the establishment of marine refuges, closed 
or undisturbed areas.  For the benefit  of other species of  marine 
wildlife Ministers must agree actions to control specific practices such 
as beam trawling and consider a discard ban before 2002. Industrial 
fishing, for the production of fishmeal and oil,  should also be 
controlled more stringently.
