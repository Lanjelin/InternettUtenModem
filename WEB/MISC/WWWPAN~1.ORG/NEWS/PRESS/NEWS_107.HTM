<b>GLAND, Switzerland</b> -- As  governments meet in Rome next week to 
examine the  state of the world's fisheries, WWF-World Wide Fund For Nature 
today released new  reports outlining a blueprint for action by international 
and national fisheries authorities to help save  vulnerable shark 
populations, caught mostly while targeting other, more prized fish.
<p>
A joint report by TRAFFIC International* and the Center for Marine 
Conservation (CMC) in Washington, entitled "Managing Shark Fisheries: 
Opportunities for International Conservation" analyses several existing 
international fisheries regimes and identifies the gaps in the 
conservation of sharks. The report makes several recommendations that 
need to be implemented by governments in appropriate international fora.
<p>
"WWF is becoming increasingly alarmed about the status of sharks around 
the world," said Michael Sutton, director of WWF's Endangered Seas 
Campaign.  "Sharks are extremely vulnerable to overfishing because of 
their unique life histories.  Shark fishing amounts to open season on the 
high seas; very few shark fisheries are subject to any form of management 
by national or international authorities.  WWF is urging the FAO 
Committee on Fisheries to take emergency action to deal with this issue 
before it's too late for sharks."
<p>
Other TRAFFIC reports released today focus on the regional trade in 
sharks in Europe, India  and Southeast Asia. As little effort has been 
made by countries to collect even the most basic kind of fisheries 
information, such as the numbers and species of sharks caught, these 
reports provide the best possible guide to the trade in sharks in these 
regions and initiatives that can be taken for shark conservation at 
national and regional levels.
<p>
"TRAFFIC's research has revealed an extremely active trade in sharks and  
shark products worldwide," said Steven  Broad,  Executive Director of 
TRAFFIC International. "However, both the fisheries and trade are so 
poorly monitored that shark stocks could be seriously depleted in some 
areas before management needs can be identified. Specific and accurate 
reporting of shark landings and trade would  be a crucial first step to 
provide future security for shark populations."
<p>
For example, the Southeast Asia region, where the trade is predominantly 
in shark fins, has Indonesia as the worlds top shark fishing nation 
(possibly over 100,000 mt annually). Indonesia has the most diverse shark 
fauna in the world, with at least 350 species, but for how long?  Europe, 
on the other hand, plays an important role as fisher, supplier, 
processor, trader and consumer of shark products. The trade is mainly for 
shark  meat.
<p>
The overall research indicates that though the FAO member countries 
reported shark landings hit a record high in 1994 of 730,000 metric 
tonnes, the actual catch volume is probably far greater. The group of top 
shark fishers includes Argentina, Brazil,  France, India, Indonesia, 
Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, 
Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Taiwan,   UK and USA. 
<p>
"Several existing international fisheries agreements can be applied to 
benefit sharks, but must be strengthened to reflect precautionary sound 
management," said Sonja Fordham, CMC Fisheries Specialist and co-author 
of the CMC/TRAFFIC report.  "In addition, countries should seize 
opportunities to promote shark conservation through international 
wildlife treaties and, in general raise the conservation priority of 
these valuable yet vulnerable species."
