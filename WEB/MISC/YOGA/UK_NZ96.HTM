<h2>10 day retreat on the Coromandel 
<br>October 23 - November 2, 1996 
<br>with Swami Janakananda and Sita </h2>

<p>
<hr></p>

<h2>A 10-day residential course: 25 September - 5 October 1996 </h2>

<h3><b>in Mackay, Queensland</b> </h3>

<p><i>&quot;It is now two days ago since we left the course in Acre and
I still have an elated and self-contradictory feeling of super-charged
energy and deep inner calm.&quot; </i>(Student from a course held in Israel)
</p>

<p><b>The course begins</b> with preparatory exercises for relaxation and
meditation and a gentle and refreshing cleansing process. </p>

<p><b>The main part of the course</b> is centred around different yoga
poses, breathing exercises and methods of cleansing the energy flows of
the body, thus establishing a healthy field of energy in and around your
body. Other methods used are: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>Inner</i> <i>Silence</i> (in Sanskrit: <i>Antar Mauna</i>), a meditation
method through which you can come to terms with your mind and learn to
accept your personality in a constructive way. You develop your capacity
to think creatively and thus realise your visions. But first and foremost,
you get closer to your self and experience your true identity. </li>

<li><i>Ajapa Japa, </i>a preliminary form of <i>Kriya Yoga.</i> In nine
steps you go from the coarse to the finer levels of your being, from using
a special way of breathing to contacting the <i>chakras</i>, the inner
space and your psychic symbol. </li>

<li><i>Yoga Nidra,</i> a unique deep relaxation. </li>

<li><i>Silence (Mauna),</i> a valuable and integrated part of yoga. Two
and a half days of silence raises your awareness further - thus increasing
your capacity to experience. It makes you better able to experience the
finer stages of the meditations that we practice at this point. </li>

<li><i>Lectures</i>. Swami Janakananda and Sita will also give lectures
on the Tantric tradition, yoga and meditation techniques and how these
can be used and integrated in daily life. </li>

<li><i>Dance and Music</i> play a small but important part in the process
of the course. </li>
</ul>
