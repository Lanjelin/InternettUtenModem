<TD>Two deep relaxations, based on Swami Satyananda's classic Yoga Nidra,
created and guided by Swami Janakananda, who has also composed the background
of nature sounds. Music by Roop Verma. As a background and introduction
there is a 18 page booklet inserted in the tape box. 
<P><I>&quot;This tape is a hit, if you can talk about hits within relaxation.&quot;</I>
(A. Thomson, therapist and New Age bookseller in UK) </P>

<P><I>&quot;The tape is one of the most inspiring I have heard for a long
time. It is a multidimensional work of art of a nature that is rarely seen.&quot;</I>
(M. Lammg&aring;rd, musician and therapist, V&auml;xthuset Kaprifol, Sweden)
</P>

<P><I>&quot;After a number of years of having a stressed life with a job
that almost ruined my ability to live in the present, I'm now again happy
to face each new day, not to unnecessarily worry myself about tomorrow.
I have learnt to laugh again. I think it's fantastic.&quot;</I> (E. Berg,
Ludvika, Sweden) </P>

<P>&quot;<I>Yoga Nidra sounds like nothing I've heard before. It is accompanied
by nature sounds, and the Indian musician Roop Verma. Sound symbols for
the various chakras are also played, from that music tradition called Nada
Yoga. Naturally, this practice is an individual experience . Personally,
I find it utterly fascinating. I feel refreshed and revitalised after the
practice, and I know I will continue with it</I>.&quot; (Nils-Olof Jacobsen
in the magazine S&ouml;karen) </P>

<P><I>&quot;Yoga Nidra is much more than a deep relaxation; it is a total
experience that touches and awakens all parts of your being.&quot;</I>
(Swami Janakananda) </P>
