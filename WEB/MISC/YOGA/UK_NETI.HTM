<h1>Nose Cleansing </h1>

<p><i>by Joachim Rodenbeck</i> </p>

<p><i>&quot;As a child I often had bronchitis together with asthma and
since then I have rarely been able to really breathe through the nose.
The day I learned nose cleansing, I was able again for the first time to
breathe completely freely through the nose.&quot; </i>(40 year old course-participant
from Oslo, Norway) </p>

<h2>Why cleanse the nose? </h2>

<p>To cleanse the nose with luke warm salt water is a yoga technique, which
benefit is presently being discovered by still more people. This article
deals with its origins, its possible applications and other things worth
knowing. Nose cleansing, also called neti, is very easy to do. Everybody
can learn it. The few directions given at the end of this article, though,
should be followed carefully. </p>

<p>Neti refreshes, and the nose becomes pleasantly open. The entire nose
area is relaxed and cleaned from inside: Mucus, dust and dirt, even pollen
and allergy provoking particles are gently rinsed out. This simple method
can also help with many ailments or illnesses, e.g. cold, dry mucus membranes,
allergy and asthma. </p>

<h2>In different cultures... </h2>

<p>In the yoga tradition neti is one of the so-called Hatha Yoga methods,
that in various ways clean the body. There are similar methods for the
eyes, stomach and intestines. Neti exists in different variations, but
the most gentle and pleasant way is probably the one where, with the help
of a special pot (see picture), you pour salt water through the nose. Corresponding
methods, in more or less complete forms, can be traced to the most diverse
cultures. </p>

<p>With us here in Scandinavia nose cleansing is known as an old house
hold remedy against colds and infections. Old fishermen tell, that they
have avoided colds throughout their lives by sniffing salt water from the
hand or a small bowl and spitting it out of the mouth again. Similar descriptions
of how people take advantage of the sea water's curative and disinfecting
abilities, one finds, amongst other places, in France, Germany, Finland
and even Jamaica. With our senior citizen groups in Copenhagen, many of
the participants still remember that in their childhood, nose cleansing
was regularly used in the home against colds. At the turn of the century
one could even, at many Scandinavian pharmacists, buy nose cleansing pots
of glass. </p>

<p>The following story originates from south Sweden: On a military base
they had a large container full of salt-water, at the bottom of the container
there was a small tap with a rubber hose. If the soldiers felt a cold coming
on, they would put the hose to their nostril and let the water run through.
That was the most effective means they knew against colds. </p>

<h2>... and today </h2>

<p>For a long time it seemed that this old technique would be forgotten
in favour of modern medicine. When the first yoga teachers from our schools
over twenty years ago came from India to Scandinavia with neti pots they
were almost unknown and many saw them as an exotic curiosity. But today
nose cleansing has become a popular and established method - many see it
as natural body hygiene, an economical and, above all, a healthier alternative
to medicaments such as nasal drops and sprays. Especially in Sweden the
doctors also show a great interest: &quot;<i>We recommend nose cleansing
against dry mucus membranes, to people with allergies and when working
in dusty environments&quot;, </i>says chief physician, Dr. Claude Laurent,
from the ear, nose and throat clinic in Falun in Sweden. He and his colleague,
Dr. Matström from Huddinge Hospital in Stockholm, are two out of many doctors
who recommend neti to their patients. </p>

<p>At the Scandinavian Yoga and Meditation School we teach nose cleansing
on all of our yoga courses, and during the last 20 years approximately
75.000 people in Northern Europe have learnt nose cleansing with us. Now
and again one hears the question: &quot;Why on earth should we clean the
nose?!&quot; But when people have tried neti, they are surprised about
how easy and pleasant it is, and above all what effect it has. Many continue
to use neti daily at home, and return and tell about how it helps them.
</p>

<h2>Students report </h2>

<p>The spectrutm of experiences is broad: There are those who simply recount,
that they feel fresher, more awake and clear in the head after having cleansed
the nose. They first of all emphasise the relaxing effect that can even
relieve or cure different forms of headaches, for instance migraine. </p>

<p>With others nose cleansing has helped against physical ailments or even
serious illnesses. A 19-year old student reports: <i>&quot;I suffered from
chronic sinusitis for years, with headaches, tiredness etc. Medicine didn't
help any more, and an operation was necessary. After I had learnt nose
cleansing, together with a few breathing exercises, I used it daily. The
operation became unnecessary, and today I am completely healthy&quot;.
</i>With sinusitis especially we receive a lot of feedback on the beneficial
effects of neti. To receive the best results with this, neti should be
performed in conjunction with certain breathing exercises. For this, though,
it is necessary to be guided by a competent yoga teacher. </p>

<p>People with allergies also have positive experiences. It improves their
condition when they rinse their nose during the pollen season. A woman
from Stockholm in Sweden related that since her childhood she has suffered
terribly from hay fever - each spring with the usual symptoms: swollen
eyes, that ran with tears, and a completely blocked nose. She has no problems
today, even at the height of the pollen season. She cleans her nose daily,
several times if it is necessary. </p>

<h2>What does physiology say? </h2>

<p>What actually happens as a result of the salt-water bath is described
by professor Paul Stoksted from Odense, Denmark: <i>&quot;In the sinuses
and mucus membranes microscopic hairs are found, the so called cilia, that
all vibrate in the same direction. Under a microscope they resemble a cornfield
swaying in the wind. The cilia are coated with a layer of mucus that catch
dust, bacteria, pollen and white blood corpuscles. Through their motion
the mucus membrane acts as a conveyer belt, transporting the mucus and
caught</i> <i>particles through the nose, down the throat and further on
to the stomach&quot;. </i>Therefore it is not only the mucus membranes
in the nose that are stimulated by the use of neti, but also the rest of
the air passage all the way down to the lungs, which is especially beneficial
to smokers. Actually nose cleansing activates all the mucus membranes in
the body, also in the stomach and in the eyes. Professor Paul Stoksted
continues: <i>&quot;The movement of the cilia hairs can be paralysed by
virus and allergy provoking substances, and also when it dries out, the
mucus becomes tough and crusty and looses its function. Cleansing with
salt water keeps the mucus moist, the cilia hairs are stimulated and encrustations,
dust as well as allergy provoking substances are removed&quot;. </i>If
one has problems with dry mucus membranes, which is often the case with
dry air in offices and other places, one may add a drop of almond oil to
the water (or another plant oil). </p>

<p>Why nose cleansing helps chronically blocked nostrils and sinusitis,
explains Dr. Kenneth Uhre from Tallmogården Sanatorium in Sweden: <i>&quot;The
nasal cavity is connected to the sinuses with small orifices. When during
a cold these channels are closed because of swollen mucus membranes, it
can lead to sinusitis. By nose cleansing these channels are kept clear&quot;.</i>
</p>

<p>Regular use of neti can also prevent colds, as it changes the PH-value
towards alkaline. Because when the mucus membrane is too acidic, that is
to say when the PH-value is too low, the virus can survive and become attached
to the mucus membrane and thus develop into an infection. Contrarily, if
the PH-value is higher, the virus dies. &quot;<i>Many people can even experience
sinusitis-like symptoms when the orifices close for other reasons such
as stress reactions or overwork&quot;, </i>says Dr. Uhre. With this background
it is also clear why neti can consistently relieve psychosomatic ailments
such as asthma since during asthma attacks the mucus membranes become swollen,
and make breathing difficult when the air passage is obstructed by mucus.
</p>

<p>The effects of neti are as you see very comprehensive and can be employed
for many purposes. It is up to each individual how one would use it: As
a daily routine together with brushing the teeth, as &quot;medicine&quot;
when one has use for it, as help when one wants to stop smoking, together
with the breathing exercises of yoga, or simply just when one feels like
being refreshed... </p>

<h2>How to do Nose Cleansing - Neti </h2>

<ul>
<li>To clean the nose, you use a neti-pot, a small pot with a spout that
fits into the nostril and seals it. You fill the pot with luke warm water
and dissolve a teaspoon of ordinary salt there in. </li>

<li><b>Sea salt is unsuitable for nose cleansing. </b>We have repeatedly
experienced that people got a strong allergic reaction when they had sea
salt in the pot - with ordinary salt, on the other hand, there were no
problems. This might be due to the increasing pollution of the seas or
a pollen content of the sea water. </li>

<li>The water in the pot now has the same salt concentration as the body
(0.9%), and will feel comfortable when it runs through the nose. </li>

<li>Do neti over a sink. Hold the pot in one hand and place the spout against
one nostril, so that it fits tightly. Lean forward, breathe relaxed through
the mouth and turn the head to one side (see picture). Now the water will
flow by itself, in through one nostril and out of the other. </li>

<li>When half of the water has run through one nostril, gently blow out
any remaining water and mucus. Then repeat this process in the other nostril.
</li>

<li>In the end the nose should be dried. You bend forward and let your
head hang loosely down, so that the remaining water can run out of the
nose. Close one nostril with the index finger and turn the head alternating
from side to side. Blow gently <b>(not forcefully) </b>through one nostril
at a time - until the nose is dry. This exercise to dry the nose is an
important part of nose cleansing, and should be done thoroughly every time.
</li>

<li>After nose cleansing one can benefit from breathing exercises, first
of all &quot;The blacksmiths bellows&quot; and &quot;Kapalbhati&quot;,
they cleanse the lungs and the respiratory passage and supply the blood
with more oxygen. As a harmonic conclusion of such a small program, you
can do &quot;The alternate nostril breathing&quot; to gain an even better
balance and clarity in the brain. </li>
</ul>
