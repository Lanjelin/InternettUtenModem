<TD>has been using yoga most of his life, and a disciple of Swami Satyananda
since 1968. Swami Janakananda is the founder of the Scandinavian Yoga and
Meditation School, with branches throughout Scandinavia and northern Germany.
His book <I>Yoga, Tantra and Meditation in Daily Life</I>, now translated
into seven languages, has confirmed his international recognition as a
consequential and independent exponent of yoga and meditation. 
<P>Swami Janakananda lives at <I>H&aring;&aring; International Course Center</I>,
southern Sweden. A place where people gather from all over Europe, to attend
advanced residential courses or to live in the ashram - the teaching is
mainly in English, but also in German and the Scandinavian languages. Here
Swami Janakananda, among other things, trains the yoga teachers and teaches
the tantric Kriya Yoga. </P>
