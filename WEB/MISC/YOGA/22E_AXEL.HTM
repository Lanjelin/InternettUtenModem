<H1>Shoulderstand </H1>

<H3>- a pose for the whole body </H3>

<P><I>by Franz Jervidalo</I> </P>

<P><I>&quot;What is this pose good for?&quot;</I> is one of the most frequently
asked questions in the yoga class. <I>&quot;Find out for yourself. Experience
the pose while you are in it,&quot;</I> is a tempting reply. When there
is knowledge beforehand then one is pinned to some particular expected
effects, and misses one's own overall impression. </P>

<P>When this question concerns the shoulderstand, the answer could be more
precise, but not less teasing: <I>&quot;This pose is good for everything.&quot;</I>
<I>Sarvangasana</I>, as the shoulderstand is called in Sanskrit, means
&quot;the pose for the whole body.&quot; </P>

<H3>The inverted poses ... </H3>

<P>Shoulderstand belongs to the group of inverted poses - those poses where
the head is downwards and the legs upwards. </P>

<P>In the article on headstand (see Bindu no. 3) we mentioned how the inverted
poses increase oxygen intake and ease the blood's return flow to the heart,
which is thereby relieved. We described how the increased blood supply
to the brain gives nourishment and oxygen to the cells and tissue, and
how the abdomen, intestines and inner organs are eased as they now hang
inverted. </P>

<H3>... and shoulderstand </H3>

<P>What is special about shoulderstand is that while the body is inverted,
the throat and head are bent in the so-called chin lock. This raises the
blood supply to the entire upper part of the body and stimulates the glands
in that area, in particular the thyroid gland in the throat, which has
to do with the hormonal balance and the cells' metabolism. A healthy thyroid
gland leads to a healthy function of the body's organs and the circulation.
</P>

<P>Moreover, it has been shown that shoulderstand definitely benefits the
breath, and for asthmatics and people with bronchitis it can be an invaluable
supplement to treatment. </P>

<P>With a normal cold the shoulderstand can alleviate the symtoms and accelerate
the healing process. </P>

<P>We shall also see how shoulderstand helps with certain injuries of the
throat and neck resulting from traffic accidents. </P>

<P>But first and foremost it has a harmonizing effect on the whole body,
giving mental balance, strengthening the constitution and preparing the
body for meditation. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="22_skul.jpg" HEIGHT=384 WIDTH=202> </P>

<H3>How to do shoulderstand </H3>

<P>Lie on the back, on a mat or a folded blanket, and calm down. </P>

<P>Slowly raise the legs off the floor and tilt them over the head so that
the back lifts up from the floor. </P>

<P>When the back is in a vertical position, support it with the hands and
forearms. The palms press against the back as close to the shoulder blades
as possible, and the elbows are on the mat, a shoulder widths distance
apart. In this way the torso remains upright while you straighten the legs
vertically. Now the body is standing as straight as a &quot;candle&quot;,
as some also call this pose. But the head is bent and the chin touches
the chest. </P>

<P>When first coming into the shoulderstand you sometimes experience a
certain restlessness in the body and a desire to come down again at once.
But if you remain in the pose a little longer, restlessness will disappear,
replaced by a deep calm, a desire to stay and just rest in the pose. </P>

<P>Therefore, give the body a little time and experience how it is to be
completely motionless in the pose - &frac12;-1 minute to start with. Thereafter
gradually increase the time to 5-10 minutes and remain standing until you
have felt calmness in the body for some time. </P>

<P>Our own experiences are confirmed by an investigation described in the
journal <I>Yoga Mimamsa</I> no. 1 and 2 from 1926. In shoulderstand the
blood pressure increases slightly coming into the pose, which is natural
considering the movement involved, but decreases again and normalizes after
2-3 minutes. After coming out of the pose, the blood pressure falls for
a while to a little below normal. </P>

<P>This signifies that the blood pressure is made more flexible and that
the exercise together with other classical yoga poses prevents a permanent
high or low blood pressure. People also recount that when, for instance,
after a sickness or an operation, their blood pressure is a little high
and will not go down again, then it normalizes when they resume their yoga
practice. </P>

<H3>Respiration </H3>

<P>Ordinarily one inhales and holds the breath when coming into the pose.
Thereafter you breathe normally; if you want to deepen your state in the
pose, then concentrate on the normal breath. </P>

<P>When you have used the shoulderstand for some time and know the peace
that emerges, you can occasionally intensify the effect further by holding
the breath for periods. This has a mental effect, and can help with colds:
after having calmed down, inhale slowly and deeply and hold the breath
as long as is comfortably possible. Breathe slowly and carefully out again.
Let the breath calm down. Repeat the entire process a couple of times more
while staying in the pose. </P>

<P>Before you come out, inhale again and hold the breath - lower the legs
slowly down to the floor. Then lie still and relax. </P>

<H3>In a programme </H3>

<P>Shoulderstand belongs to the sequenceof yoga poses we call the classical
programme. Here it comes after <I>the headstand</I> (and <I>the palm</I>
- where for a moment you stand on your feet - ) and before <I>the plough</I>,
and these poses supplement each other perfectly. </P>

<P>After headstand one more swiftly acquires the calmness in shoulderstand
and its effects are enhanced. </P>

<P>After being in shoulderstand it is natural to lower the legs down over
the head into the plough and thus increase the stretch on the back side
of the body. </P>

<P>In the counter pose, <I>the fish</I>, one lies on the back with the
legs in the lotus pose, taking hold around the toes with the hands (in
an easier variation of the fish, the legs are straight and the palms are
placed under the buttocks). The chest is raised while the head is bent
backwards, resting on the crown. </P>

<P>For a further introduction to the classical programme, and to different
variations and the use of chakras as areas of concentration, we recommend
Swami Janakananda's book, <I>&quot;Yoga, Tantra and Meditation in Daily
Life,&quot;</I> (Rider Books, UK and Weiser, USA). </P>

<H3>A happy story ... </H3>

<P>One of our students earlier had problems with the thyroid gland and
the metabolism. At the time she started attending yoga, it was so severe
that she was scheduled to be operated. She learned shoulderstand and continued
to use it regularly every day, and after a period of three months the production
of hormones became so normal that it was no longer necessary for her to
be operated. </P>

<P>Now, one example does not prove anything, you could say. But the fact
that the shoulderstand's beneficial effect on the thyroid gland, by regular
and systematic use, is described in the yoga literature, confirms the general
value of this story. </P>

<H3>... and a research project </H3>

<P>Not just our own and our student's personal experiences with shoulderstand,
but also research of yoga and meditation shows how effective the pose is.
</P>

<P>Doctors Udupa, Singh and Settiwar, of the Institute of Medical Science
in Benares, India, researched in 1975 the effects of six months regular
use of shoulderstand (together with the counter pose the fish) and compared
the results with similar tests of the headstand and the plough. </P>

<P>It was confirmed that shoulderstand stimulates the body's glands and
metabolism, and the research especially underlined the physiological effects
on the blood circulation and the respiratory system. The ability to hold
the breath is improved and the girth of the chest is enlarged, giving a
greater vital capacity (the volume of air exhaled after a full inhalation).
The researchers' study show that the lungs, in the course of the six months,
became capable of inhaling up to 25% more air, or about a litre more per
breath - and thereby take in more oxygen. </P>

<P>According to several sources, shoulderstand purifies the blood (Swami
Satyananda, Swami Narayanananda, et al.). We must conclude that, among
other things, it is due to the increased oxygen intake that supplies the
lungs and therefore the blood while standing in the pose. Through this
training of the lungs, the respiration generally improves. </P>

<P>Shoulderstand (and the fish, where the chest is expanded and the throat
stretched) therefore is an important pose for one who wants to achieve
that harmony which is defined by yoga, and which forms the basis for real
success with advanced yoga and meditation. </P>

<P>On the basis of this research together with our own experience we can
conclude that the shoulderstand contributes to the alleviation and prevention
of common respiratory problems for people suffering from asthma and bronchitis.
</P>

<H3>Asthma &amp; bronchitis </H3>

<P>A student, who has chronic asthma and bronchitis, has related to us
how she uses shoulderstand: </P>

<P><I>&quot;When I feel bad, I can't do shoulderstand properly, it is too
much of an effort, but there is absolutely no reason to give up! I lie
on my back, bend the legs, roll up on to the shoulders, stretch out into
the correct posture with support from the elbows and remember to do a thorough
chin-lock. I stay as long as I can and roll out in the reverse order. Often
the pose must be interrupted early due to coughing, then I roll quickly
out of it again, sit up, finish coughing and resume the pose again and
again until it is stable. As a counter pose I use the fish in its easy
form, followed by a resting pose, such as the crocodile or the hare.</I>
</P>

<P><I>In my opinion, these exercises are far more effective - at least
as far as I am concerned - than both traditional and modern lung therapy.
The back is massaged and mucus is loosened. In general, sarvangasana helps
in coughing up the mucus. An asthmatic mostly breathes with the upper part
of the lungs. The chin lock forces one to breathe with the stomach and
the pressure upon the diaphragm eases exhalation. In the long run, the
lungs function better, supplemented, of course, by other yoga exercises
and especially breathing exercises.</I> </P>

<P><I>There is no reason to give up when suffering from asthma, even though
there is a tendency to hold back. In the majority of cases, it is possible
to do much more than is thought possible. Think of the many top athletes
who have serious asthma. They are incredibly active anyway and achieve
remarkable results.&quot;</I> (Lilian N&oslash;rhede) </P>

<H3>Neck injuries (whiplash) </H3>

<P>The following account is testimony to that even deep seated muscular
tensions can be resolved by shoulderstand. We have heard from our school
in Bergen, Norway, of people who have received injuries to the neck and
throat as a result of a car driving into the back of their own car. First
the head is thrown backwards with great force, and then thrown forwards.
</P>

<P>After being the victim of such an accident, one is prone to lock in
the pain by creating tensions in the muscles of the neck and head, and
consequently it becomes chronic - the pain can be so intense, that it is
impossible to work. Though it is not always visible on an X-ray. Years
ago, people suffering this injury were not taken seriously by the authorities.
However that has changed. Now victims of whiplash receive an invalid pension.
</P>

<P>Here is an example, where a woman with this injury came to yoga classes.
She started like everybody else with a beginners program of small easy
exercises from pawanmuktasana (Swami Janakananda's book and Bindu no. 4).
To loosen the tensions she used especially, and with great care, the warm
up exercises for the neck and throat before head rolling, and head rolling
itself. This gave a noticeable improvement, but the pain and headaches
persisted. At the end of winter, the class she was in reached that stage
where they were able to use the classical programme with the shoulderstand
and plough. In the beginning she found the two poses agonizing to be in,
but after using them for a short period, she loosened the tensions completely
and the pain disappeared. <I>&quot;I feel like a new person&quot;</I>,
was her surprised comment. </P>

<H3>Children and shoulderstand </H3>

<P>Children and adolescents in puberty should not do shoulderstand in the
way we use it in yoga, where we stay in it for extended periods. While
the thyroid gland is developing it should be left in peace. When the thyroid
gland is completely developed, one can begin to use shoulderstand. As far
as we know this is the only yoga pose with limitations concerning children.
</P>

<H3>Your own practice </H3>

<P><I>&quot;People cannot feel or think properly when their mind is not
in a comfortable state; the various parts of the human body are so harmoniously
arranged that if just the smallest part hurts then the whole system is
disturbed. To reach an accurate insight into anything, or rather, to feel
it clearly with the heart, the use of asana is necessary.&quot;</I> (Sri
Yukteswar) </P>

<P>Shoulderstand can be learnt quite quickly by most, also by those who
can not as yet, or dare not, do the headstand. If one is in doubt as to
whether it is advisable to do shoulderstand, then ask a qualified yoga
teacher. Also seek advice if you suffer from swollen thyroid gland, high
blood pressure or a weak heart. </P>

<P>Shoulderstand keeps the body vital and healthy, especially considering
its effect on the back, where the tissue around the nerves and at the nerve
ends are abundantly supplied with blood. The spine is a yogi's main instrument,
it is not just the nerve channels governing the body that are found here,
but also the principal energy currents (nadi) and four of the nine main
psychic centers (chakra). Therefore, one strives to keep the back healthy
and free of tensions and blockages. </P>

<P>This implies, among other things, that, when you use the yoga exercises
regularly, you will not encounter a great lack of energy - or unexpected
and disharmonious experiences of a sudden increase of energy. The fundamental
aim of yoga is to support a harmonious evolution of man, that does not
happen in unexpected jerks, caused by the whims of nature or outer influences
and stimuli, but as a even growth. </P>

<P>Shoulderstand can be done once or several times a day, but wait, as
with all other yoga practices, until four hours after a large meal.
