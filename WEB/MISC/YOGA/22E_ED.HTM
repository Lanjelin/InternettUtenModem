<H3>A global collective meditation </H3>

<P>One Sunday in August, 1994, a collective meditation took place the world
over, from Europe to Australia. In London, for example, thousands of people
gathered at Wembley Stadium to chant OM continuously from 12.00 midday
to 12.08. We also took part. At our H&aring;&aring; course center, we were
just ending a month long Kriya Yoga course, so this meditation was to be
the last before departure. </P>

<P>After this meditation, I received a letter with a question on another
meditation that was also to take place simultaneously in different parts
of the world. The intention was that, with thoughts, one could repair the
earth's energy grid of lines that run through the landscape, and make contact
with lost civilisations. Thereby, from what I understood, we would be able
to avoid global catastrophes. Other similar meditations are done to reduce
pollution, some to end the war in Bosnia, etc, etc. I answered the letter
with the following: </P>

<P>&quot;Concerning the interesting stuff about energy grids, Lemuria (
a prehistoric continent, older than Atlantis, supposedly situated in the
Pacific Ocean) and so on, fine, if it will do the individual participating,
and the rest of us, any good. </P>

<P>In the meantime I will teach a few more students yoga for their daily
and their spiritual lives, to help them in the here and now - whilst everyone
is waiting for the great miracle. What they are waiting for, I know not.
Life itself is the great miracle.&quot; </P>

<P>Certainly one can direct energies towards a cause and manipulate thoughts
and project them with good intent, but it is a question of whether one
can call such an activity meditation. Therefore, one must discriminate.
I am forced to explain that - what traditionally is called meditation,
which we, together with many others do - is the deepest and most penetrating
meditation. A meditation definitely worth daring: it requires only to let
go of all demands to reach results, whether it be therapeutic or psychic,
or to want the meaning of everything explained; and to have a strong desire
to just be, to rest in oneself and take part in life and experience it...
</P>

<P>To make sure that what we do is not based upon figments of the imagination,
and to reach that deep and intense awareness we call meditation, we use
a tried and tested meditation technique. To really meditate is so much
stronger than the other, which I will here refer to as wishful thinking
and hypnosis.The state of pure being has nothing to do with thoughts, it
is something you experience, not limited to expectations, it is something
you<I> are</I>. </P>

<P>When you rest in yourself, yes, even when you are on the way to this,
and you feel that you can let go of tensions, old attitudes and states,
then everything falls into place around you and harmony arises. By manipulation,
on the other hand, you use your energy on small details far removed from
the essence of your being. You therefore never come close to real peace
and energy. </P>

</P>

<H3>Meditation is definitely of current interest </H3>

<P>Editorials in magazines and newspapers concern themselves with current
events and tendencies. Can there then at all be an editorial in a periodical
about yoga and meditation - isn't yoga timeless? </P>

<P>The answer to that is, that at all times the original, the artistic
and effectual, the genuine and deep, is threatened by misunderstanding,
by dilution, by negligence and fear; these creep in when something becomes
fashionable. </P>

<P>Time and again throughout history an original mystical tradition has
been watered down by people who want something to cling to, rather than
wake up and expand their consciousness and get to know themselves. Through
the sensationalism and misunderstanding of such people, the precious becomes
inaccessible for the many. The so-called &quot;easy&quot; solutions, whereby
one makes up things instead of learning more than one knows already, narrows
the scope and blurs the picture. </P>

<P>Euphoria is easy to bring about, and explanations and mythologies can
always be invented - but profound peace, inner strength, and a knowledge
of one's own being, is something quite different. </P>

<H3>Action creates change </H3>

<P><I>Action creates change</I>, was a political slogan of the 70's, but
the expression is valid inwardly as well. When you act, you also change.
If you want to grow and discover more about yourself, then dreaming and
making plans is not the best solution, if they are not immediately followed
up by action. </P>

<P>I came by this insight when, for a period of my life, I decided only
to make those plans that I meant to carry out. That resolution cleansed
my mind and had an unbelievable effect on my ability to act. </P>

<P>Real meditation in itself is also an act. It does not build upon dreams
or fantasies, but leads to a place where deep calmness, tolerance and a
keen awareness reign. There is no talk of ideals or beautiful thoughts
here, but of experience. The paradox, however, is that such a meditation
rubs off on life and becomes the starting point for outward strength and
action. </P>

<P>If one avoids taking part in life's many activities and believes that
to dream and produce thoughts for an external purpose is to meditate, then
one easily ends up in a no-man's land, where nothing happens apart from
one's own imaginary and conceptual world (and then it doesn't matter if
these thoughts are shared with others). </P>

<P>Certainly there is something called creative visualisation, and apparently
it can bring about results - at least in the short run. But what is there
to compare it with, if one hasn't experienced the essence of meditation?
</P>

<H3>Transformation of the personal life </H3>

<P>I have frequently seen people end a course and go home with an entirely
new radiance. A radiance that they perhaps do not perceive immediately,
but at home things fall into place around them and what they need seems
to come by itself. </P>

<P>Naturally this is due to the old secret - when I really have the desire
and the will to do something, then providence appears at my side. The inhibitions
that hindered me from taking initiatives, I have removed through yoga.
I see what I want, or in which direction I want to go, and opportunities
present themselves.... </P>

<H3>Transformation of the surroundings </H3>

<P>A few years ago, the organisation Transcendental Meditation arranged
a large collective meditation in The Globe, Stockholm. I thought this was
a good initiative, but I was surprised when I heard a couple of participants
relate what they themselves had done. They had sent out good thoughts into
the world - thoughts of peace, etc. </P>

<P>Once in the 70's, TM did an experiment in Atlanta, USA. Over a period,
a group of people met every day in a house in a slum quarter and meditated.
The method they used was genuine meditation, in the sense that they did
not try to manipulate with or influence the surroundings. They just devoted
themselves to the technique they used, namely a mantra. Briefly explained,
it is a sound they repeat mentally in the mind for about half an hour,
once or twice a day, with good results for their well-being. </P>

<P>At the conclusion of the period, after they had left the slum and the
house where they had meditated, they allowed some qualified researchers
to study whether the meditation had had any effect on the surroundings.
Statistics of serious crimes such as murder, rape and assaults were compared
before, during and after the period of meditation. The research revealed
that during the period of meditation, the serious crimes had fallen to
a minimum, but returned to &quot;normal&quot; for the area after the conclusion
of the meditations. </P>

<P>Therefore I was greatly surprised to hear that the TM participants in
Stockholm had been occupying themselves with thoughts and conceptions.
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="ya2_rd.gif" HEIGHT=140 WIDTH=139 ALIGN=BOTTOM> </P>

<H3>Good thoughts - evil thoughts </H3>

<P>Are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;positive&quot; thoughts of no use? Yes,
if they do not foster guilt, shame or tensions, when trying to suppress
the &quot;evil&quot; thoughts, then at least the &quot;good&quot; counter
balance the &quot;evil&quot; ones. If we fight the thoughts, we end up
getting entangled in them, and they do not let go. In meditation you avoid
fighting the thoughts - for example, by looking at them attentively without
clinging to them - and eventually you realise that you are not the thoughts.
Thus the interest for them is lost and the mind calms down. Of course,
this is not done by willpower or with effort, but by the meditation method
used. Thoughts are dropped and awareness is maintained with the meditation
object. The state is concentrated and deepened. </P>

<P>It does not mean that one should not think good thoughts. Some people
send good thoughts in all four directions, and up and down, before they
start their meditation, but this belongs to the ritual with which they
surround their meditation, and not to the meditation itself. This is the
equivalent of religious rituals and meditations where the gods are first
called upon to awaken energy and protection, before commencing with the
actual meditation. I have nothing to say about this, only that it has my
respect. I know that if one meditates on God with no other purpose than
love and a desire to do it, then the meditation is irresistible. </P>

<P>However, I prefer the attitude that Lao Tze expresses with these words:
</P>

<P><I>&quot;...when Tao is lost, there is goodness. When goodness is lost,
there is kindness. When kindness is lost, there is justice. When justice
is lost, there is ritual. Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty,
the beginning of confusion. Knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping
of Tao. It is the beginning of folly.Therefore the truly great man dwells
on what is real and not what is on the surface. On the fruit and not the
flower. Therefore accept the one and reject the other...&quot; </I>and
he continues:<I>&quot;Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom, and it will be
a hundred times better for everyone; give up kindness, renounce morality,
and men will rediscover filial piety and love; give up ingenuity, renounce
profit, and bandits and thieves will disappear.&quot;</I> (Tao Te Ching;
translated by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English.) </P>

<P>The depth achieved when nothing other than meditation is sought, is
vast and can not at all be compared with &quot;positive thinking&quot;
or hypnosis, which are other words for many methods in fashion today. Just
as the past thousand years or more have suffered from too much discipline
and blind authority, so will the future suffer from a lack of discipline
and of not being able to stay with one thing. A great deal of confusion
will arise as a result of this, when one forgets oneself and runs from
one sensational method to the next - the goal is lost from sight. </P>

<H3>Behind the thoughts </H3>

<P>I can also compare the way I have talked of meditation to the effect
of yoga poses, as I experience them. When various yoga poses are used in
a programme, then the individual exercises have, without a doubt, a specific
effect on certain organs or functions of the body. We can see this from
the research we are currently publishing in this periodical. But the use
of a yoga programme also has a <I>general</I> effect. An effect, which
is not about details, but an overall state of harmony. That which we experience
as well-being, energy and concentration when we have done the exercises.
</P>

<P>It is this general harmony I am interested in. I am certain that when
it arises, possible disharmonious areas in the body or in the body's energy
field will be affected by the whole. When the exercises are repeated regularly
over a longer period, then sickness will disappear. </P>

<P>To me there appears to be a paradox in the &quot;modern&quot; way of
curing sicknesses. To be able to cure, one must first and foremost, according
to the prevailing opinion, know all about sickness, and not of health.
In the Tantric tradition we start from the diametrically opposite point,
that is, of the f<I>it and healthy person</I>. A cure does not happen by
&quot;fighting&quot; the sickness, but by returning to that optimal health,
which in Sanskrit is defined by the word <I>swastha</I>, meaning both:
<I>to rest in oneself, to be oneself </I>- and - <I>to be fit and healthy,
in one's natural state</I>. </P>

<P>With this definition in mind, it can be understood why one should not
manipulate in meditation, but seek the highest goal, which I can only describe
with these modest words: <I>a total letting go - and being</I>. </P>

<P>No doubt it could also be expressed in other ways, religious, philosophical,
etc. And not claiming that I have the only definition on coming close to
the essence of one's being without strain,I shall again cite Lao Tze, and
let him say it in his way: </P>

<P><I>&quot;Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub; it is the center hole
that makes it useful.Shape clay into a vessel; it is the space within that
makes it useful.Cut doors and windows for a room; it is the holes which
make it useful.Therefore profit comes from what is there; usefulness from
what is not there.&quot; </I>(Tao Te Ching) </P>

<P>Now it is a question of whether <I>non-effort</I> is easy or difficult?
Yes and no, it must be learnt, and yet it is simple, like in <I>the twilight
hour</I> which we describe in this issue of Bindu. But for that disciple
who wants to achieve non-effort, the training principally involves giving
up straining and learning to receive, or rather to realise that everything
comes by itself, if the goal is held in sight and one stays on the path.
When one has learnt not to follow all impulses, all desires to assert oneself
and say something, instead of listening and experiencing, then great inspiration
is gained. When one has realised silence, then one's speech has greater
effect. The journey can be straightforward and easy when one knows surrender,
but it can also be painful and full of resistance; and at times the one
who pretended to be a disciple runs away, when expectations and ideals
are larger than the ability to experience the obvious and simple. </P>

<P>I follow a method in my meditation that safeguards, that it does not
turn into ideas, expectations or self hypnosis, but provides a real experience,
so the relaxation becomes genuine and consciousness is expanded harmoniously...
</P>

<P>All the same, I would like to support the idea of collective meditation,
globally or just in our school. If you are or have been a student of ours,
you are welcome every Sunday at 8 pm (European time), when we meditate
in the various schools. Or you can join us at home, wherever that is. </P>
