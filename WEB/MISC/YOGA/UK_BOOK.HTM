<H4>Swami Janakananda's book in a revised and extended edition (Rider Books,
UK and Weiser, USA) </H4>

<P>This book offers an alternative to the way many books deal with yoga,
when they maintain the misunderstanding that one must take on a new life
style to use yoga and meditation. </P>

<P>Swami Janakananda does not only stress the practical side of yoga and
meditation in this book, but shares the Tantric wisdom and view, that gives
you the freedom to practise yoga and meditation entirely on your own terms.
</P>

<P>Many attempts have been made to explain yoga from a scholarly or religious
viewpoint. This book instead describes yoga from within, based on the author's
own understanding - from a yogi's point of view. Yoga has, through many
thousands of years, developed into a system that deals with human development
and health. We find traces of yoga from the past on earth's various continents.
Today yoga and meditation are both one of the most used alternative therapy
forms in many countries, and a basis for an active and creative life for
many people. </P>

<P>As you follow the exercises in this book, you will realise that yoga
is based on a profound knowledge of human nature: A knowledge not limited
to any age, life-style or nationality. It is the fruit of a living tradition,
where knowledge is passed directly from teacher to student, from generation
to generation. Step by step you are guided through the subject, and in
a practical manner you can benefit from the different poses, breathing
exercises, meditations and the Tantric sexual yoga. </P>

<H3>A readers recommendation </H3>

<P>&quot;I am writing this letter to tell you how pleased I am with the
book 'Yoga, Tantra and Meditation in Daily Life'. I have also recently
bought the tape 'Yoga Nidra'. I am very pleased of what I saw and heard.
I have read many yoga books and tried to follow them, but they were not
filled with much information. Your book tends to go into more detail about
each asana, breathing exercise and meditation. Many of my friends didn't
understand yoga until I showed them your book and they found it very fascinating.
Personally, I have tried different kinds of exercises such as weight lifting
which afterwards made me feel very tired and sore. I also tried Tai Chi,
which is similar to yoga and meditation, but I found out that yoga gives
a better overall relaxing effect than Tai Chi. I have only been doing yoga
for about eight months, but I am inspired by yoga more and more each day.
I have been doing the classical poses in the 'Yoga, Tantra and Meditation'
book now for a few months. In closing, I would like to thank you for the
wonderful material and some day I would like to travel to Sweden and go
to your school. </P>

<P><I>Sincerely, </I></P>
