- periodical on Yoga - Tantra - Meditation
</H3><P ALIGN=Left>
Bindu is published by Scandinavian Yoga and Meditation School.
We started releasing Bindu again in 1993 with the ambition of
publishing four issues per year. But as we also need time to teach,
and at the same time do not want to reduce the quality of Bindu,
it is more manageable for us with two issues per year. Bindu is available
in english, german, swedish and danish.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Bindu is based on voluntary work at all levels, from writing and
photography to printing.
<P ALIGN=Left>Each month we change the number of Bindu that you may
<A HREF="#ReadNow">read here</A>. If you send your full name and
adress to
<A HREF="mailto:bindu@inet.uni-c.dk">bindu@inet.uni-c.dk</A>, we will send
you a free copy of the latest issue of Bindu.
