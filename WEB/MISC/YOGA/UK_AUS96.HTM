<H2>10-day residential courses</H2>

<P><I>&quot;It is now two days ago since we left the course in Acre and
I still have an elated and self-contradictory feeling of super-charged
energy and deep inner calm.&quot; </I>(Student from a course held in Israel)</P>

<P><B>The course begins</B> with preparatory exercises for relaxation and
meditation and a gentle and refreshing cleansing process.</P>

<P><B>The main part of the course</B> is centred around different yoga
poses, breathing exercises and methods of cleansing the energy flows of
the body, thus establishing a healthy field of energy in and around your
body. Other methods used are:</P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Inner</I> <I>Silence</I> (in Sanskrit: <I>Antar Mauna</I>), a meditation
method through which you can come to terms with your mind and learn to
accept your personality in a constructive way. You develop your capacity
to think creatively and thus realise your visions. But first and foremost,
you get closer to your self and experience your true identity.</LI>

<LI><I>Ajapa Japa, </I>a preliminary form of <I>Kriya Yoga.</I> In nine
steps you go from the coarse to the finer levels of your being, from using
a special way of breathing to contacting the <I>chakras</I>, the inner
space and your psychic symbol.</LI>

<LI><I>Yoga Nidra,</I> a unique deep relaxation.</LI>

<LI><I>Silence (Mauna),</I> a valuable and integrated part of yoga. Two
and a half days of silence raises your awareness further - thus increasing
your capacity to experience. It makes you better able to experience the
finer stages of the meditations that we practice at this point.</LI>

<LI><I>Lectures</I>. Swami Janakananda and Sita will also give lectures
on the Tantric tradition, yoga and meditation techniques and how these
can be used and integrated in daily life.</LI>

<LI><I>Dance and Music</I> play a small but important part in the process
of the course.</LI>
