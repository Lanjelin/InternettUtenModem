<H1>You can not pull at the grass to make it grow </H1>

<H3>but the earth is enriched when children do yoga </H3>

<P>The above statement I heard at a conference in Paris, November 1994.
The title of the conference was &quot;Invent Tomorrow's Education&quot;.
Yoga teachers, educators, school teachers, psychologists, researchers and
others presented their visions and experiences for a more humane education
for children and young people. There were three hundred participants from
14 countries. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="22_kobr.jpg" HEIGHT=237 WIDTH=346> </P>

<P>The lectures covered a wide field, from very theoretical; for instance,
there was half an hours account on the nature of silence, analysed from
all angles and presented by a very loud lecturer; to concrete experiences
with the use of yoga, relaxation and meditation methods in the class room.
While I sat there in the conference hall, a story came to mind: Two doors,
on one it said &quot;heaven&quot;, and on the other &quot;lectures on heaven&quot;.
The floor in front of the door leading to lectures on heaven was worn down
while the floor in front of the door to heaven was almost untouched. </P>

<P>But - theoretical or practical - the general theme was a wish to introduce
methods and ideas, which make it possible to learn, to understand and to
relate to the subjects which are taught, from the basis of oneself, with
motivation, energy and joy. The driving force is not only that a certain
curriculum should be learnt and that the teacher expects a specific outcome,
but also that the children are not just stuffed with knowledge learnt by
rote. One lecturer referred to a survey carried out in the French educational
system, which showed that 95% of students felt stressed by school. </P>

<P>The organisers of the conference, R.Y.E. (Research on Yoga in Education)
wrote in a presentation folder: <I>&quot;Teachers are asked to go through
an ever more overloaded curriculum, but nothing is done to develop the
memory. The children are told: 'Now listen!', but they are not taught how
to concentrate.&quot;</I> </P>

<P>Lecturer Jacques de Coulon, yoga teacher and head master of a high-level
secondary school in Switzerland: <I>&quot;There should be different levels
within education. If you compare a human being with a stagecoach, then
the actual coach is the physical body. The horses are the emotions and
the coachman the intellect. It is obviously important that a close cooperation
exists between the coachman and the horses. In the stagecoach there is
a traveller, and he is the spiritual level, and here we deal with the meaning
of life, because the traveller knows the destination of the journey, he
knows where he wants to go. You can have a coachman who can really control
and direct the horses, but if he does not know where the traveller wants
to go, he will just go round in circles.Education ought to develop all
of these levels and promote the interaction between them. Yoga creates
interaction between the physical level, emotions, intellect and the spiritual
level.In the educational system in Switzerland, where I work, 90% of the
disciplines belong on the intellectual level.&quot;</I> </P>

<P>Leading a workshop was Paula Gatti from Montevideo in Uruguay, where
she is one of two yoga teachers employed in a school with 200 pupils. At
the start of a school day the whole school does a 10 minute relaxation
or meditation and the same takes place at the end of the day - all 200
pupils at exactly the same time. All classes have two yoga lessons a week
in a room used only for yoga. All other lessons start with a few minutes
of silence. Either the pupils sit completely still with their eyes closed
or - the smaller children - draw in silence. According to Paula the teachers
experience the pupils as far more motivated, they find more joy in the
work and have a greater sense of solidarity, when compared to ordinary
schools. The title of the workshop was &quot;A happy school in Montevideo&quot;.

<P>R.Y.E. is originally a French organisation founded and run by Micheline
Flak who is a student of Swami Satyananda. R.Y.E. has branches in many
of the larger cities in France, as well as in five other countries, and
aims to spread the use of yoga in schools and other educational facilities.
One of R.Y.E.'s activities is to educate teachers, so that they become
capable of using various physical exercises, breathing exercises and relaxation
techniques in their teaching. The methods are modified so that the pupils
either sit on or stand behind their chairs. A condition for taking part
in the education is that you practise yoga regularly yourself. </P>

<P>At the Scandinavian Yoga and Meditation School, we often have contact
with schools in the various countries where we work. We are visited by
classes and we go out to the schools to make an introduction with both
theory and a practise, where the pupils do not remain sitting on their
chairs but get on to the floor and do an entire yoga programme, relaxation
and meditation. </P>

<P>Some classes also choose to follow three lessons on three consecutive
days, and in this manner they gain a clearer experience of how, for instance,
they become better, through yoga, at directing their energy towards that
which is important to them and how they can improve their ability to concentrate.
</P>

<P>That a school teacher, in the middle of a lesson by means of simple
exercises, is able to create attention and interest among the pupils is
very valuable. The greatest benefit from doing yoga at school, though,
in our opinion is gained by combining the exercises mentioned above with
actual yoga classes a few times a week, taught by a yoga teacher who has
a comprehensive education. </P>

<P>It is very inspiring and refreshing to teach groups of children or young
people, because they have a natural curiosity and motivation to explore
what happens when you do yoga. And the questions they ask are very honest
and direct. If you study children you see that from birth they have an
incredible ability - and sometimes from one second to the next - to change
their state of consciousness. A child can be going at full speed until
all of a sudden it becomes occupied with something and forgets everything
around it. Who has not experienced, for example in a bus, a child who stares
at you. A gaze that simply rests on you, uninterruptedly, without losing
concentration for a single second, while you have looked away several times.
One often experiences that children approach yoga in a very direct way,
as if it is something they already know. </P>

<P>The relaxation Yoga Nidra is always very popular, also at our usual
yoga classes for children. For about 20 minutes they lie completely still
with closed eyes and listen; Yoga Nidra is a relaxation where one is neither
asked to relax, nor has to imagine that one is relaxed, the relaxed state
is called forth by the technique. At the end of Yoga Nidra one should see
various images, and this is something children are both very fond of and
do with no effort at all. At some schools the tape with Yoga Nidra is used
regularly in class, as a method of <B>really</B> taking a break and &quot;wiping
out the mental blackboard&quot;, to offer the pupils an opportunity and
time to digest all of the information and impressions they receive. </P>

<P>Yoga is a means of returning to being yourself, in the middle of the
life you are living, so that again you can experience, act - and learn.
