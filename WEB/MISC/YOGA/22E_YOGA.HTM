<H3>for increased body awareness and inner harmony - account from a weekend
course at H&aring;&aring; Course Center </H3>

<P><I>by Camilla Sternberg</I> </P>

<P>Yoga is an old Sanskrit word meaning union or wholeness. And wholeness
was really what I experienced during three days at the Scandinavian Yoga
and Meditation School's H&aring;&aring; Course Center in Hamneda, South
Sweden. The course center lies in a beauti- ful area and it felt wonderful
to be there - entirely removed from stress and demands and I was completely
able to concentrate on what I was there for - to learn yoga.&quot;Yoga
and meditation were not originally part of any religious system. Their
objective is broader: not to bind people in ignorance and prejudice but
rather to transform and develop human consciousness. In this way free and
independent individuals are created, who make their own experiences, fulfill
their potential, each living in a personal and truly social way.&quot;As
quoted from the book Yoga, Tantra and Meditation in Daily Life by Swami
Janakananda. After participating in a three days course in yoga, I understand
what that means - to transform and expand the human consciousness. I am
much more conscious of my body and my thoughts, and feel I have received
a fantastic tool to meet myself with. </P>

<P>This does not in any way concern running away from what is difficult,
some kind of ready made positive thinking - no, it is more about being
yourself and daring to be so - a natural way of getting to know yourself
and to well-being.My first course in yoga started with an intestinal cleansing
(not something obliga- tory to take part in the course) but I did everything
directly. A certain number of glasses of saltwater and simple exercises,
the water flowed through the intestines instead of through the urinary
tract, which I experienced as a wonder and a great release.After a beautiful
afternoon's rest, the course started Friday evening with an intro- duction
by two very pleasant and professional yoga teachers: Adam Moltke and Sita.Slowly
and softly we were led into the world of yoga, movements, breathing exercises
and relaxation. When I went to bed the first evening, I felt a great peace
and slept the whole night, which I had not done for a long time. I woke
at 6 the next morning and felt surprisingly fresh. We met in the yoga room
at 7 o'clock and started with a candle meditation. This involved gazing
at the flame of a candle at eye level whilst sitting crossed legged in
a yoga pose. After a while we blew out the light, closed our eyes and the
flame's afterimage appeared on the retina. We were instructed to move the
afterimage to a point between the eyebrows. After having done this a few
times during the stay at H&aring;&aring;, it was easy to move the flame
and really be concentrated. Afterwards, as mentioned, followed two days
of intensive physical exercise, breathing and meditation exercises. </P>

<P>Weeks afterwards, I still long for the yoga room. In that room I have
done exercises that I thought impossible for me.I get up every morning
now and do my yoga exercises for half an hour. If sometimes I find I do
not have time for it, then I do it in the afternoon. The yoga course in
itself has helped me to take that time for myself. I feel an increased
sense of well-being, greater concentration and inner harmony and a very
noticeable effect is that I lost 3 kg, I have no desire to stuff myself
unnecessarily. I have a strong feeling when there is something the body
does not want. Increased awareness it is called. </P>

<P>I do not experience this as something mystical - but as something natural.
The physical exercises make me more aware of my own body, here I gain both
strength and training of the muscles. My lung capacity has increased due
to the breathing exercises, I breathe in the correct way nearly all the
time (it takes time for women) and the meditation exercises are delightful
and really something a modern person needs. </P>

<P>The best of all is that I can do a little or a lot, I am not fixed to
one particular programme. Already after three days at H&aring;&aring; I
know enough exercises to be able to benefit from them.And it is exciting
and developing - a way to remain balanced and participate in what is happening.This
three day course is sufficient to be able to use yoga for a very long time
to come, but I am sure it will not be long before I go on their ten days
course - we shall see - there will be a report about that! I shall return!
