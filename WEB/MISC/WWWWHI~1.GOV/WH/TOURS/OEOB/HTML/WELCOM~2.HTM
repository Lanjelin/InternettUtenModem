<Quote>Welcome to the Old Executive Office Building. Your tour of this
beautiful building will serve as a looking glass to America's rich
architectural and historical past. As you walk down the marble
corridors, you will follow the same steps taken by some of the most
important people in the world. Behind the large wooden doors, inside
grand rooms glowing with stencil-painted walls and bold wrought iron
moldings, decisions were made that dramatically shaped the world as
we know it today. The old saying, "If only these walls could talk",
fits this building most appropriately. It was here in the Old State,
War and Navy Building, which is now the OEOB, that America's role as a
world super power was born. The ongoing effort to preserve and restore
this grand old building is a source of pride for all Americans. We
hope you enjoy your visit.</quote>
