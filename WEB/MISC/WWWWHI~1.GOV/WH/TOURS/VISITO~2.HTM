<p>
All White House tours are 
free. <b>CHANGES IN TOUR SCHEDULES</b> are occasionally made because of 
official events. Notice may not be given until that morning. The Visitors 
Office 24-hour recording at <b>(202) 456-7041</b> provides the most 
up-to-date information. The TDD (telephone device for the deaf) is 
(202) 456-2121. Visitors should confirm tour schedules by calling the 
information line the night before and the morning that they plan to visit. 
When cancellations do occur, the Visitors Office tries to notify each 
office that has group tours scheduled for that day. It is the 
responsibility of 
that office to notify its guests. It is occasionally necessary to close 
individual rooms on the tour; however, notice about closed rooms is not 
possible.
<p>
<b>TOUR PARKING</b> is not available at the White House and use of 
public transportation is strongly encouraged. The closest Metrorail 
stations to the White House Visitor Center (15th Street, near E Street) are 
Federal Triangle (blue and orange lines) and Metro Center (blue, orange, 
and red lines). 
<p>
<b>PUBLIC TELEPHONES / RESTROOMS</b> are not available at the White 
House; they are in the Visitor Pavilion on the Ellipse, at 15th and E 
Streets and in the White House Visitor Center.

<h2>Tour Tickets and Schedule</h2>
</center>
The White House is open for <b>SELF-GUIDED WALK-THROUGH TOURS</b> from 
10:00 a.m. until 12 noon, Tuesday through Saturday. Free, timed tickets are 
distributed from the White House Visitor Center (WHVC), at 15th Street 
near E Street. National Park Service personnel assist visitors with 
directions and information. 
Visitors may see two videos and numerous exhibits while waiting in a 
comfortable and interesting place. First spending 20-90 minutes at the 
Visitor Center greatly enhances enjoyment and understanding of the public 
tour. Once inside the House, self-guided tours usually take 20-35 
minutes.
<p>
Tickets are issued on the day of the tour only, on a 
first-come, first-served basis starting at 7:30 a.m. One person may 
obtain up to <b>four</b> tickets. The number of tickets for each day is 
limited (approximately 4,500). The ticket desk closes at 12 noon, or 
earlier if the supply for that day is distributed. It is advisable to 
arrive early (and impossible to predict what time one should arrive to 
"guarantee" tickets). Tickets are only valid the day issued. Advance tickets 
for the public self-guided tours are not available.
<p>
During the peak season (third Tuesday in March until the Saturday before 
Labor Day), groups should use the "bus zone" for easier 
distribution of tickets. About one-third of each day's tickets are held 
for groups arriving by bus. Beginning at 7:30 a.m., National Park Service 
personnel board buses parked in the westbound curb lane of Constitution 
Avenue, between 15th and 17th Streets NW. Each person on the bus is given 
a timed ticket. At 9:30 a.m., or when the supply for that day is 
distributed, the bus zone closes. Buses may not remain in the zone after 
tickets are distributed.
<p>
Self-guided tours take place at:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Group tours</b> at 9:45 a.m.
<li><b>Public tour</b> from 10:00 a.m. until 12 noon
</ul>
<p>
<b>GUIDED TOURS</b> are escorted by a U.S. Secret Service/Uniformed 
Division Officer who describes each room on the ground and state floors. 
Usually included are the Library, Vermeil, China, and Diplomatic 
Reception rooms on the ground floor and the East, Green, Blue, Red, and 
State Dining rooms on the state floor. Group and ticketed tour visitors 
are combined into groups of about 70 people. Once inside the House, tours 
usually last about 30 to 45 minutes. Guided tour narrations are geared 
for teenage and older visitors. 
<p>
Guided tours scheduled for:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Group tours</b> at 8:00 a.m.
<li><b>Congressional Ticketed</b> tours at 8:15 a.m., 8:30 a.m., and 8:45 
a.m. 
<li><b>Access tours for hearing-impaired or visually-impaired groups and 
individuals, with advance notice by written request to the Visitors 
Office.</b> 
</ul>
<p>
<h4>Special Considerations</h4>
<b>CHILDREN</b> ages seven and under do not 
need a tour ticket for 
Congressional and Agency tours, but do need one for the ticketed public 
tour system. Strollers are checked at the entrance gate and are 
reclaimed upon exit on Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>
<b>PROHIBITED ON TOURS:</b> Animals, except guide dogs; backpacks 
(oversized); balloons; food; guns/ammunition; knives with blades over 3 
inches/8 centimeters; mace; nunchuks; smoking, and suitcases.
<p>
<b>PHOTOGRAPHY</b> (still or video) is not permitted inside the White 
House. Cameras may be carried inside, and may be used outside. 
<p>
People in wheelchairs, or with other mobility disabilities, on the 
self-guided tours, should use the northeast gate on Pennsylvania Avenue, 
and with up to six members of their party, are admitted without waiting 
in line and without tickets.  The Library and Vermeil rooms on the ground 
floor are not viewed when entering at the northeast gate.  Photos and a 
text description of these rooms are available to visitors using 
this entrance.
