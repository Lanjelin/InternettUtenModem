<h3>History of the White House Easter Egg Roll</h3>
The original site of the Easter Egg Roll was the grounds of the United 
States Capitol. The event began during the Presidency of James Madison 
(1809-1817) at the suggestion of his wife, Dolley Madison. Mrs. Madison 
was fascinated to learn that Egyptian children rolled colored eggs on the
     site of the Pyramids. She thought the children of the Washington 
area would enjoy this enchanting activity. 
<P>
In 1877, under orders from members of Congress, Capitol policemen 
required the children to leave the grounds. Some Congressmen, tired of 
slipping and sliding on the remains of boiled eggs, felt the
grounds should no longer be torn up in such a way. Some sources tell 
us that one irritated nursemaid, followed by several of her charges, 
stormed down to the White House where she demanded access to the White 
House grounds for egg rolling. Others claim that President Rutherford B. 
Hayes, riding by the Capitol grounds in his carriage, saw the tearful children and
invited them to the White House for their egg roll. 
<P>
In 1878 President Hayes and his wife Lucy officially opened the 
White House grounds to the children of the area for egg rolling on Easter 
Monday. The event has been held on the South Lawn ever since, except 
during World War I and World War II. During the war years the Easter Egg Roll
     was held at the National Zoo, and other Washington locations. 
<P>
The White House Easter Egg Roll is eagerly awaited each year by 
thousands of children. It is always held on the Monday after Easter, on 
the South Lawn of the White House. Children hunt for brightly colored wooden signature eggs hidden in hay. Many of these 
eggs have been signed by famous people, including the athletes, astronauts, musicians, and 
celebrities from film, television, and theatre who visit the White House 
during the year. Of course, the real treasures are the eggs personally 
signed by the President and First Lady (as well as Socks)! 
<P>
By the late 1800s such games as "Egg Picking," "Egg Ball," "Toss and 
Catch," and "Egg Croquet" were popular Easter Monday activities. The 
children attending the event take part in many newer activities, but 
rolling a hard-boiled egg across the lawn is still a 
highlight of the day.
