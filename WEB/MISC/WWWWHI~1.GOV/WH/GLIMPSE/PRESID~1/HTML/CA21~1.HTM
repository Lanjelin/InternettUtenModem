<b>Biography:</b>  Dignified, tall, and handsome, with clean-shaven chin and 
side-whiskers, Chester A. Arthur "looked like a President."
<p>
The son of a Baptist preacher who had emigrated from northern Ireland, 
Arthur was born in Fairfield, Vermont, in 1829.  He was graduated from Union 
College in 1848, taught school, was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in 
New York City.  Early in the Civil War he served as Quartermaster General of 
the State of New York.
<p>
President Grant in 1871 appointed him Collector of the Port of New York.  
Arthur effectively marshalled the thousand Customs House employees under his 
supervision on behalf of Roscoe Conkling's Stalwart Republican machine.
<p>
Honorable in his personal life and his public career, Arthur nevertheless 
was a firm believer in the spoils system when it was coming under vehement 
attack from reformers.  He insisted upon honest 
administration of the Customs House, but staffed it with more employees than 
it needed, retaining them for their merit as party workers rather than as 
Government officials.
<p>
In 1878 President Hayes, attempting to reform the Customs House, ousted 
Arthur. Conkling and his followers tried to win redress by fighting for the 
renomination of Grant at the 1880 Republican Convention. Failing, they 
reluctantly accepted the nomination of Arthur for the Vice Presidency.
<p>
During his brief tenure as Vice President, Arthur stood firmly beside 
Conkling in his patronage struggle against President Garfield.  But when 
Arthur succeeded to the Presidency, he was eager to prove himself above machine
politics.   
<p>
Avoiding old political friends, he became a man of fashion in his garb and 
associates, and often was seen with the elite of Washington, New York, and 
Newport.  To the indignation of the Stalwart Republicans, the onetime 
Collector of the Port of New York became, as President, a champion of civil
 service reform.  Public pressure, heightened by the assassination of Garfield, forced an
 unwieldy Congress to heed the President.
<p>
In 1883 Congress passed the Pendleton Act, which established a bipartisan 
Civil Service Commission, forbade levying political assessments against 
officeholders, and provided for a "classified system" that made certain 
Government positions obtainable only through competitive written examinations.
The system protected employees against removal for political reasons.
<p>
Acting independently of party dogma, Arthur also tried to lower tariff rates so
 the Government would not be embarrassed by annual surpluses of revenue.  
Congress raised about as many rates as it trimmed, but Arthur signed the 
Tariff Act of 1883.  Aggrieved Westerners and Southerners looked to the 
Democratic Party for redress, and the tariff began to emerge as a major 
political issue between the two parties.
<p>
The Arthur Administration enacted the first general Federal immigration law.
Arthur approved a measure in 1882 excluding paupers, criminals, and lunatics.  
Congress suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, later making the 
restriction permanent.   
<p>
Arthur demonstrated as President that he was above factions within the Republican
 Party, if indeed not above the party itself. Perhaps in part his reason was 
the well-kept secret he had known since a year after he succeeded to the 
Presidency, that he was suffering from a fatal kidney disease.  He kept himself
 in the running for the Presidential nomination in 1884 in order not to appear 
that he feared defeat, but was not renominated, and died in 1886.  Publisher
 Alexander K. McClure recalled, "No man ever entered the Presidency so 
profoundly and widely distrusted, and no one ever retired ... more 
generally respected."
