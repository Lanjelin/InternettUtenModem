Familiar Quotations</A></B>
<P>
<b>Biography:</b>  On April 30, 1789, George Washington, standing on the 
balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in 
New York, took his oath of office as the first President of the United States.  "As the
first of every thing, <i>in our situation</i> will serve to establish a 
Precedent," he wrote James Madison, "it is devoutly wished on my part, 
that these precedents may be fixed on true principles."
<p>
Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family, he learned the morals, manners, and body of 
knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman.
<p>
He pursued two intertwined interests: military arts and western expansion.  At 16 he helped 
survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas, Lord Fairfax.  Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754, 
he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War.  The next year, as 
an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and 
two horses were shot from under him.
<p>
From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution, Washington managed his lands around 
Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses.  Married to a widow, Martha Dandridge
Custis, he devoted himself to a busy and happy life.  But like his fellow planters, Washington 
felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations.  
As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute, he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance
to the restrictions.
<p>
When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775, Washington, one 
of the Virginia delegates, was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army.  On 
July 3, 1775, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, he took command of his ill-trained troops and 
embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years.
<p>
He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British.  He reported to 
Congress, "we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action, or put anything to the Risque, 
unless compelled by a necessity, into which we ought never to be drawn."  Ensuing battles saw 
him fall back slowly, then strike unexpectedly.  Finally in 1781 with the aid of French 
allies--he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.
<p>
Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon.  But he soon realized that the 
Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well, so he became a prime mover 
in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787.  When the new 
Constitution was ratified, the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President.
<p>
He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress.
But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern.  When the
French Revolution led to a major war between France and England, Washington refused to accept 
entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who was 
pro-French, or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who was pro-British.  Rather, 
he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger.
<p>
To his disappointment, two parties were developing by the end of his first term.  Wearied of 
politics, feeling old, he retired at the end of his second.  In his Farewell Address, he urged 
his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions.  In foreign 
affairs, he warned against long-term alliances.
<p>
Washington enjoyed less than three years of retirement at Mount Vernon, for he died of a 
throat infection December 14, 1799.  For months the Nation mourned him.</p>
