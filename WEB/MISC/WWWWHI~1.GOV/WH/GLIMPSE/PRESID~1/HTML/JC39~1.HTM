<B>Inaugural Address</A></B>
<p>
<b>Biography:</b>  Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government "competent 
and compassionate," responsive to the American people and their 
expectations.  His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising 
energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was 
impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations.
<p>
Carter, who has rarely used his full name--James Earl Carter, Jr.--was 
born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia.  Peanut farming, talk of 
politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his 
upbringing.  Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, 
Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith.  The Carters have three sons, 
John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff),
and a daughter, Amy Lynn.
<p>
After seven years' service as a naval officer, Carter returned to 
Plains.  In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he
 was elected Governor of Georgia.  Among the new young southern governors, 
he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, 
and the removal of racial barriers.
<p>
Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a
 two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum.  At the Democratic 
Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator 
Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate.  Carter campaigned hard 
against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times.  Carter
 won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford.
<p>
Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation 
and unemployment.  By the end of his administration, he could claim an 
increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit,
measured in percentage of the gross national product.  Unfortunately, 
inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to 
reduce them caused a short recession.
<p>
Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs.  
He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy 
and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate
production.  He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform
and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries.  
He sought to improve the environment.  His expansion of the national park 
system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands.  To
 increase human and social services, he created the Department of 
Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed
 record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs.
<p>
In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human 
rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations.  
In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped
 bring amity between Egypt and Israel.  He succeeded in obtaining 
ratification of the Panama Canal treaties.  Building upon the
 work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the 
People's Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II 
nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union.
<p>
There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
 caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact.  
The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated
 the news during the last 14 months of the administration.  The 
consequences of Iran's holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to
 Carter's defeat in 1980.  Even then, he continued the difficult 
negotiations over the hostages.  Iran finally released the 52 Americans 
the same day Carter left office.
<p>
After leaving the White House, Carter returned to Georgia, where in 1982 
he founded the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta to promote peace and 
human rights worldwide. The Center has initiated projects in more than 65 
countries to resolve conflicts, prevent human rights abuses, build 
democracy, improve health, and revitalize urban areas. He and his wife, 
Rosalynn, still reside in Plains.
