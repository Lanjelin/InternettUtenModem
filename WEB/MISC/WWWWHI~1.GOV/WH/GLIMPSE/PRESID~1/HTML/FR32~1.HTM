<b>Biography:</b>  Assuming the Presidency at the depth of the Great Depression,
Franklin D. Roosevelt helped the American people regain faith in themselves.
He brought hope as he promised prompt, vigorous action, and asserted in his 
Inaugural Address, "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
<p>
Born in 1882 at Hyde Park, New York--now a national historic site--he 
attended Harvard University and Columbia Law School.  On St. Patrick's 
Day, 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt.
<p>
Following the example of his fifth cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt, whom he
greatly admired, Franklin D. Roosevelt entered public service through politics, but
as a Democrat.  He won election to the New York Senate in 1910.  President Wilson
appointed him Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and he was the Democratic nominee
for Vice President in 1920.
<p>
In the summer of 1921, when he was 39, disaster hit-h-e was stricken with 
poliomyelitis. Demonstrating indomitable courage, he fought to regain the use of his legs, particularly 
through swimming.  At the 1924 Democratic Convention he dramatically appeared on crutches 
to nominate Alfred E. Smith as "the Happy Warrior." In 1928 Roosevelt became Governor of 
New York.
<p>
He was elected President in November 1932, to the first of four terms.  By March
there were 13,000,000 unemployed, and almost every bank was closed.  In his first
"hundred days," he proposed, and Congress enacted, a sweeping program to bring recovery
to business and agriculture, relief to the unemployed and to those in danger of losing 
farms and homes, and reform, especially through the establishment of the Tennessee
Valley Authority.
<p>
By 1935 the Nation had achieved some measure of recovery, but businessmen and
  bankers were turning more and more against Roosevelt's New Deal program.  They
 feared his experiments, were appalled because he had taken the Nation off the gold
 standard and allowed deficits in the budget, and disliked the concessions to labor.  
Roosevelt responded with a new program of reform: Social Security, heavier taxes on the
wealthy, new controls over banks and public utilities, and an enormous work relief program 
for the unemployed.
<p>
In 1936 he was re-elected by a top-heavy margin.  Feeling he was armed with a popular
 mandate, he sought legislation to enlarge the Supreme Court, which had been invalidating 
key New Deal measures.  Roosevelt lost the Supreme Court battle, but a revolution in 
constitutional law took place.  Thereafter the Government could legally regulate
 the economy.    
<p>
Roosevelt had pledged the United States to the "good neighbor" policy, transforming
 the Monroe Doctrine from a unilateral American manifesto into arrangements for
 mutual action against aggressors.  He also sought through neutrality legislation to keep
 the United States out of the war in Europe, yet at the same time to strengthen nations
 threatened or attacked.  When France fell and England came under siege in 1940, he
 began to send Great Britain all possible aid short of actual military involvement.
<p>
When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt directed
 organization of the Nation's manpower and resources for global war.
<p>
Feeling that the future peace of the world would depend upon relations between the
 United States and Russia, he devoted much thought to the planning of a United Nations,
 in which, he hoped, international difficulties could be settled.
<p>
As the war drew to a close, Roosevelt's health deteriorated, and on April 12, 1945,
 while at Warm Springs, Georgia, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
