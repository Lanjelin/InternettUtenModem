<b>Biography:</b>  Bringing to the Presidency his prestige as commanding general of 
the victorious forces in Europe during World War II, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower obtained a truce in Korea and worked incessantly during his 
two terms to ease the tensions of the
Cold War.  He pursued the moderate policies of "Modern Republicanism," pointing
out as he left office, "America is today the strongest, most influential, and most 
productive nation in the world."
<p>
Born in Texas in 1890, brought up in Abilene, Kansas, Eisenhower was the third of
seven sons.  He excelled in sports in high school, and received an appointment to
West Point.  Stationed in Texas as a second lieutenant, he met Mamie Geneva Doud, 
whom he married in 1916.
<p>
In his early Army career, he excelled in staff assignments, serving under Generals
John J. Pershing, Douglas MacArthur, and Walter Krueger.  After Pearl Harbor, General 
George C. Marshall called him to Washington for a war plans assignment.  He commanded 
the Allied Forces landing in North Africa in November 1942; on D-Day, 1944, he was 
Supreme Commander of the troops invading France.
<p>
After the war, he became President of Columbia University, then took leave to
assume supreme command over the new NATO forces being assembled in 1951.  Republican 
emissaries to his headquarters near Paris persuaded him to run for President in 1952.
<p>
"I like Ike" was an irresistible slogan; Eisenhower won a sweeping 
victory.
<p>
Negotiating from military strength, he tried to reduce the strains of the Cold War.
In 1953, the signing of a truce brought an armed peace along the border of South
Korea.  The death of Stalin the same year caused shifts in relations with Russia.
<p>
New Russian leaders consented to a peace treaty neutralizing Austria.  Meanwhile, both
Russia and the United States had developed hydrogen bombs.  With the threat of such
 destructive force hanging over the world, Eisenhower, with the leaders of the British,
 French, and Russian governments, met at Geneva in July 1955.
<p>
The President proposed that the United States and Russia exchange blueprints of
 each other's military establishments and "provide within our countries facilities for
 aerial photography to the other country." The Russians greeted the proposal with silence,
 but were so cordial throughout the meetings that tensions relaxed.
<p>
Suddenly, in September 1955, Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in Denver, Colorado.
 After seven weeks he left the hospital, and in February 1956 doctors reported his
 recovery.  In November he was elected for his second term.
<p>
In domestic policy the President pursued a middle course, continuing most of the New
 Deal and Fair Deal programs, emphasizing a balanced budget.  As desegregation of
 schools began, he sent troops into Little Rock, Arkansas, to assure compliance with
 the orders of a Federal court; he also ordered the complete desegregation of the
 Armed Forces.  "There must be no second class citizens in this country," he wrote.
<p>
Eisenhower concentrated on maintaining world peace.  He watched with pleasure
 the development of his "atoms for peace" program--the loan of American 
uranium to "have not" nations for peaceful purposes.
<p>
Before he left office in January 1961, for his farm in Gettysburg, he urged the 
necessity of maintaining an adequate military strength, but cautioned that vast, long-continued military expenditures could breed potential dangers to our way of life.  He 
concluded with a prayer for peace "in the goodness of time." Both themes remained timely
 and urgent when he died, after a long illness, on March 28, 1969.
