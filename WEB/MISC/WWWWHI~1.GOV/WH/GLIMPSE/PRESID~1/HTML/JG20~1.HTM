<b>Interesting Fact:</b>  James Garfield was the second president shot in
office.  Doctors tried to find the bullet with a metal detector invented
by Alexander Graham Bell.  But the device failed because Garfield was
placed on a bed with metal springs, and no one thought to move him.  He
died on September 19, 1881.
<p>
<b>Fast Fact:</b> James A. Garfield died from an assassin's bullet only
six months after he took office.

<B>Inaugural Address</A></B>
<p>
<b>Biography:</b>  As the last of the log cabin Presidents, James A. Garfield
attacked political corruption and won back for the Presidency a measure of 
prestige it had lost during the Reconstruction period.
<p>
He was born in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, in 1831.  Fatherless at two, he later 
drove canal boat teams, somehow earning enough money for an education.  He was 
graduated from Williams College in Massachusetts in 1856, and he returned to the 
Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later Hiram College) in Ohio as a classics 
professor.  Within a year he was made its president.
<p>
Garfield was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1859 as a Republican.  During the 
secession crisis, he advocated coercing the seceding states back into the 
Union.
<p>
In 1862, when Union military victories had been few, he successfully led a 
brigade at Middle Creek, Kentucky, against Confederate troops.  At 31, Garfield 
became a brigadier general, two years later a major general of volunteers.
<p>
Meanwhile, in 1862, Ohioans elected him to Congress.  President Lincoln 
persuaded him to resign his commission: It was easier to find major generals 
than to obtain effective Republicans for Congress.  Garfield repeatedly won 
re-election for 18 years, and became the leading Republican in the House.
<p>
At the 1880 Republican Convention, Garfield failed to win the Presidential 
nomination for his friend John Sherman.  Finally, on the 36th ballot, Garfield 
himself became the "dark horse" nominee.
<p>
By a margin of only 10,000 popular votes, Garfield defeated the Democratic 
nominee, Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock.
<p>
As President, Garfield strengthened Federal authority over the New York 
Customs House, stronghold of Senator Roscoe Conkling, who was leader of the 
Stalwart Republicans and dispenser of patronage in New York.  When Garfield 
submitted to the Senate a list of appointments including many of Conkling's 
friends, he named Conkling's arch-rival William H. Robertson to run the
Customs House.  Conkling contested thenomination, tried to persuade the Senate to
block it, and appealed to the Republican caucus to compel its withdrawal.
<p>
But Garfield would not submit: "This...will settle the question whether the 
President is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United 
States.... shall the principal port of entry ... be under the control of the 
administration or under the local control of a factional senator."
<p>
Conkling maneuvered to have the Senate confirm Garfield's uncontested nominations
 and adjourn without acting on Robertson. Garfield countered by withdrawing all nominations except Robertson's; the Senators would have to confirm him or sacrifice 
all the appointments of Conkling's friends.
<p>
In a final desperate move, Conkling and his fellow-Senator from New York 
resigned, confident that their legislature would vindicate their stand and 
re-elect them.  Instead, the legislature elected two other men; the
Senate confirmed Robertson.  Garfield's victory was complete.
<p>
In foreign affairs, Garfield's Secretary of State invited all American 
republics to a conference to meet in Washington in 1882. But the conference never
took place.  On July 2, 1881, in a Washington railroad station, an embittered 
attorney who had sought a consular post shot the President.
<p>
Mortally wounded, Garfield lay in the White House for weeks.  Alexander Graham
 Bell, inventor of the telephone, tried unsuccessfully to find the bullet with 
an induction-balance electrical device which he had designed.  On September 6, 
Garfield was taken to the New Jersey seaside.  For a few days he seemed to be 
recuperating, but on September 19, 1881, he died from an infection and
internal hemorrhage.
