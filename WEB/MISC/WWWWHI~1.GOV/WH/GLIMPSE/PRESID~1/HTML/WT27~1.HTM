<b>Fun Fact:</b> William Taft gave the White House its first set of
"wheels."  He had the stables converted into a garage for four cars, all
ordered in 1909.
<p>
President Taft was a huge man, weighing more than 300 pounds.  A special
bathtub was installed for him in the White House, big enough to hold four
men.
<p> 
<b>Fast Fact:</b>  William Howard Taft:  the only man to become President
and then chief justice.

<B>Inaugural Address</A></B>
<p>
<b>Biography:</b>  Distinguished jurist, effective administrator, but poor politician,
William Howard Taft spent four uncomfortable years in the White House.  Large, jovial, 
conscientious, he was caught in the intense battles between Progressives and conservatives, and 
got scant credit for the achievements of his administration.
<p>
Born in 1857, the son of a distinguished judge, he was graduated from Yale, and returned to 
Cincinnati to study and practice law.  He rose in politics through Republican judiciary 
appointments, through his own competence and availability, and because, as he once wrote 
facetiously, he always had his "plate the right side up when offices were falling."    
<p>
But Taft much preferred law to politics.  He was appointed a Federal circuit judge at 34. He 
aspired to be a member of the Supreme Court, but his wife, Helen Herron Taft, held other 
ambitions for him.
<p>
His route to the White House was via administrative posts.  President McKinley sent him to the 
Philippines in 1900 as chief civil administrator.  Sympathetic toward the Filipinos, he improved 
the economy, built roads and schools, and gave the people at least some participation in 
government.
<p>
President Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and by 1907 had decided that Taft should be his 
successor.  The Republican Convention nominated him the next year.
<p>
Taft disliked the campaign--"one of the most uncomfortable four months 
of my life." But he pledged his loyalty to the Roosevelt program, popular 
in the West, while his brother Charles reassured eastern Republicans.  William Jennings Bryan, running on the Democratic ticket for a 
third time, complained that he was having to oppose two candidates, a western progressive Taft 
and an eastern conservative Taft.
<p>
Progressives were pleased with Taft's election.  "Roosevelt has cut enough hay,"
 they said; "Taft is the man to put it into the barn." Conservatives were delighted to be
 rid of Roosevelt--the "mad messiah."
<p>
Taft recognized that his techniques would differ from those of his predecessor.  Unlike
 Roosevelt, Taft did not believe in the stretching of Presidential powers.  He once
 commented that Roosevelt "ought more often to have admitted the legal way of reaching the same 
ends."   
<p>
Taft alienated many liberal Republicans who later formed the Progressive Party, by
 defending the Payne-Aldrich Act which unexpectedly continued high tariff rates.  A
 trade agreement with Canada, which Taft pushed through Congress, would have
 pleased eastern advocates of a low tariff, but the Canadians rejected it.  He further antagonized
 Progressives by upholding his Secretary of the Interior, accused of failing to
 carry out Roosevelt's conservation policies.
<p>
In the angry Progressive onslaught against him, little attention was paid to the fact that
 his administration initiated 80 antitrust suits and that Congress submitted to the states
 amendments for a Federal income tax and the direct election of Senators.  A postal savings 
system was established, and the Interstate Commerce Commission was directed
 to set railroad rates.
<p>
In 1912, when the Republicans renominated Taft, Roosevelt bolted the party to
 lead the Progressives, thus guaranteeing the election of Woodrow Wilson.
<p>
Taft, free of the Presidency, served as Professor of Law at Yale until President
 Harding made him Chief Justice of the United States, a position he held until just before
 his death in 1930.  To Taft, the appointment was his greatest honor; he wrote: "I don't remember
 that I ever was President."
