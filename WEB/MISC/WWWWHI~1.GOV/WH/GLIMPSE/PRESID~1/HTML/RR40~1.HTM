<B>Second Inaugural Address</A></B>
<P>
<b>Biography:</b>  At the end of his two terms in office, Ronald Reagan viewed with satisfaction
 the achievements of his innovative program known as the Reagan Revolution,
 which aimed to reinvigorate the American people and reduce their reliance upon Government.  
He felt he had fulfilled his campaign pledge of 1980 to restore "the great,
 confident roar of American progress and growth and optimism."
<p>
On February 6, 1911, Ronald Wilson Reagan was born to Nelle and John Reagan in
 Tampico, Illinois.  He attended high school in nearby Dixon and then worked his way
 through Eureka College.  There, he studied economics and sociology, played on the
 football team, and acted in school plays. Upon graduation, he became a radio sports
 announcer.  A screen test in 1937 won him a contract in Hollywood.  During the next two
 decades he appeared in 53 films.
<p>
He has two children, Maureen and Michael, from his first marriage, to actress Jane
 Wyman.  In 1952 he married Nancy Davis, also an actress; their children 
are Patricia Ann and Ronald Prescott.
<p>
As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan became embroiled in disputes over
 the issue of Communism in the film industry; his political views shifted from liberal to
 conservative.  He toured the country as a television host, becoming a spokesman for
 conservatism.  In 1966 he was elected Governor of California by a margin of a million
 votes; he was re-elected in 1970.
<p>
Ronald Reagan won the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980 and chose as his
 running mate former Texas Congressman and United Nations Ambassador George
 Bush.  Voters troubled by inflation and by the year-long confinement of Americans in
 Iran swept the Republican ticket into office. Reagan won 489 electoral votes to 49 for
 President Jimmy Carter.
<p>
On January 20, 1981, Reagan took office. Only 69 days later he was shot by a would-be
 assassin, but quickly recovered and returned to duty.  His grace and wit during the 
dangerous incident caused his popularity to soar.
<p>
Dealing skillfully with Congress, Reagan obtained legislation to stimulate economic
 growth, curb inflation, increase employment, and strengthen national defense.  He
 embarked upon a course of cutting taxes and Government expenditures, refusing to deviate 
from it when the strengthening of defense forces led to a large deficit.
<p>
A renewal of national self-confidence by 1984 helped Reagan and Bush win a second
 term with an unprecedented number of electoral votes.  Their victory turned away Democratic 
challengers Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro.
<p>
In 1986 Reagan obtained an overhaul of the income tax code, which eliminated many
 deductions and exempted millions of people with low incomes.  At the end of his administration,
 the Nation was enjoying its longest recorded period of peacetime prosperity
 without recession or depression.
<p>
In foreign policy, Reagan sought to achieve "peace through strength." During
 his two terms he increased defense spending 35 percent, but sought to improve relations
 with the Soviet Union.  In dramatic meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he
 negotiated a treaty that would eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Reagan declared war against international terrorism, sending American bombers
 against Libya after evidence came out that Libya was involved in an attack on American soldiers in a West Berlin nightclub.
<p>
By ordering naval escorts in the Persian Gulf, he maintained the free flow of oil 
during the Iran-Iraq war.  In keeping with the Reagan Doctrine, he gave support to anti-
 Communist insurgencies in Central America, Asia, and Africa.
<p>
Overall, the Reagan years saw a restoration of prosperity, and the goal of peace
 through strength seemed to be within grasp.
