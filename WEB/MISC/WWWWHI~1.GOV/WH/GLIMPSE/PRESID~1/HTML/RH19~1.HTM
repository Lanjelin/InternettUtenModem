<b>Fun Fact:</b>  In 1879, the first telephone was installed in the White
House.  At first it was hardly used, because there weren't many other
phones in Washington to call.
<p>
<b>Fast Fact:</b> Rutherford B. Hayes gained the Presidency by a margin
of only one electoral vote.

Familiar Quotations</A></B>
<p>
<b>Biography:</b>  Beneficiary of the most fiercely disputed election in American 
history, Rutherford B. Hayes brought to the Executive Mansion dignity, honesty, and
moderate reform.
<p>
To the delight of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Lucy Webb Hayes carried out
 her husband's orders to banish wines and liquors from the White House.
<p>
Born in Ohio in 1822, Hayes was educated at Kenyon College and Harvard Law  School.  After five years of law practice in Lower Sandusky, he moved to 
Cincinnati, where he flourished as a young Whig lawyer.
<p>
He fought in the Civil War, was wounded in action, and rose to the rank of brevet 
major general.  While he was still in the Army, Cincinnati Republicans ran him for the
House of Representatives.  He accepted the nomination, but would not campaign, 
explaining, "an officer fit for duty who at this crisis would abandon his post to 
electioneer... ought to be scalped."
<p>
Elected by a heavy majority, Hayes entered Congress in December 1865, troubled
  by the "Rebel influences ... ruling the White House." Between 1867 and 1876 he
  served three terms as Governor of Ohio.
<p>
Safe liberalism, party loyalty, and a good war record made Hayes an acceptable 
Republican candidate in 1876.  He opposed Governor Samuel J. Tilden of New York.
<p>
Although a galaxy of famous Republican speakers, and even Mark Twain, stumped
  for Hayes, he expected the Democrats to win.  When the first returns seemed to 
confirm this, Hayes went to bed, believing he had lost.  But in New York, Republican 
National Chairman Zachariah Chandler, aware of a loophole, wired leaders to stand firm:
  "Hayes has 185 votes and is elected." The popular vote apparently was 4,300,000 for
  Tilden to 4,036,000 for Hayes.  Hayes's election depended upon contested electoral
 votes in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida.  If all the disputed electoral votes
 went to Hayes, he would win; a single one would elect Tilden.
<p>
Months of uncertainty followed.  In January 1877 Congress established an Electoral
 Commission to decide the dispute.  The commission, made up of eight Republicans and
 seven Democrats, determined all the contests in favor of Hayes by eight to seven.  The
 final electoral vote: 185 to 184.
<p>
Northern Republicans had been promising southern Democrats at least one Cabinet
 post, Federal patronage, subsidies for internal improvements, and withdrawal of troops
 from Louisiana and South Carolina.
<p>
Hayes insisted that his appointments must be made on merit, not political 
considerations.  For his Cabinet he chose men of high caliber, but outraged many 
Republicans because one member was an ex-Confederate and another had bolted the party 
as a Liberal Republican in 1872.
<p>
Hayes pledged protection of the rights of Negroes in the South, but at the same time
 advocated the restoration of "wise, honest, and peaceful local self-government." This
 meant the withdrawal of troops.  Hayes hoped such conciliatory policies would lead
 to the building of a "new Republican party" in the South, to which white businessmen
 and conservatives would rally.
<p>
Many of the leaders of the new South did indeed favor Republican economic policies
 and approved of Hayes's financial conservatism, but they faced annihilation at the 
polls if they were to join the party of Reconstruction.  Hayes and his Republican 
successors were persistent in their efforts but could not win over the "solid South."
<p>
Hayes had announced in advance that he would serve only one term, and retired to
 Spiegel Grove, his home in Fremont, Ohio, in 1881.  He died in 1893.
