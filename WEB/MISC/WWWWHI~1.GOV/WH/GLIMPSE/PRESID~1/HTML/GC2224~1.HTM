Familiar Quotations</A></B>
<P>
<b>Biography:</b>  The First Democrat elected after the Civil War, Grover Cleveland was the 
only President to leave the White House and return for a second term four years later.</p>
<p>
One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in New Jersey in 1837.  
He was raised in upstate New York. As a lawyer in Buffalo, he became notable for his single-minded
concentration upon whatever task faced him.
<p>
At 44, he emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House
 in three years.  Running as a reformer, he was elected Mayor of Buffalo in 1881, and
 later, Governor of New York.
<p>
Cleveland won the Presidency with the combined support of Democrats and reform
 Republicans, the "Mugwumps," who disliked the record of his opponent James G.
 Blaine of Maine.
<p>
A bachelor, Cleveland was ill at ease at first with all the comforts of the White
 House.  "I must go to dinner," he wrote a friend, "but I wish it was to eat a pickled
 herring a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' instead of the French stuff I shall find."
 In June 1886 Cleveland married 21-year-old Frances Folsom; he was the only President
 married in the White House.
<p>
Cleveland vigorously pursued a policy barring special favors to any economic
 group.  Vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas, he wrote: "Federal aid in such cases encourages the
 expectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . . "
<p>
He also vetoed many private pension bills to Civil War veterans whose 
claims were fraudulent.  When Congress, pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic, passed a bill granting pensions for 
disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland vetoed it, too.
<p>
He angered the railroads by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by
 Government grant.  He forced them to return 81,000,000 acres.  He also signed the
 Interstate Commerce Act, the first law attempting Federal regulation of the railroads.
<p>
In December 1887 he called on Congress to reduce high protective tariffs.  Told that
 he had given Republicans an effective issue for the campaign of 1888, he retorted,
 "What is the use of being elected or re-elected unless you stand for 
something?"  But Cleveland was defeated in 1888; although he won a larger 
popular majority than the Republican candidate Benjamin Harrison, he received fewer electoral votes.
<p>
Elected again in 1892, Cleveland faced an acute depression.  He dealt directly with the
 Treasury crisis rather than with business failures, farm mortgage foreclosures, and unemployment.
 He obtained repeal of the mildly inflationary Sherman Silver Purchase Act and, with the aid of 
Wall Street, maintained the Treasury's gold reserve.
<p>
When railroad strikers in Chicago violated an injunction, Cleveland sent Federal troops
 to enforce it.  "If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a post
 card in Chicago," he thundered, "that card will be delivered."
<p>
Cleveland's blunt treatment of the railroad strikers stirred the pride of many
 Americans.  So did the vigorous way in which he forced Great Britain to accept
 arbitration of a disputed boundary in Venezuela.  But his policies during the depression
 were generally unpopular.  His party deserted him and nominated William Jennings
 Bryan in 1896.
<p>
After leaving the White House, Cleveland lived in retirement in Princeton, New Jersey.  
He died in 1908.
