<b>Biography:</b>With the Assassination of Lincoln, the Presidency fell upon an old-fashioned
southern Jacksonian Democrat of pronounced states' rights views.  Although an honest and 
honorable man, Andrew Johnson was one of the most unfortunate of Presidents.  Arrayed against
him were the Radical Republicans in Congress, brilliantly led and ruthless in their 
tactics.  Johnson was no match for them.
<p>
Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1808, Johnson grew up in poverty.  He was apprenticed 
to a tailor as a boy, but ran away.  He opened a tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, 
married Eliza McCardle, and participated in debates at the local academy.
<p>
Entering politics, he became an adept stump speaker, championing the common man and 
vilifying the plantation aristocracy. As a Member of the House of Representatives and the 
Senate in the 1840's and '50's, he advocated a homestead bill to provide a free farm for the 
poor man.
<p>
During the secession crisis, Johnson remained in the Senate even when Tennessee seceded, 
which made him a hero in the North and a traitor in the eyes of most Southerners.  In 1862 
President Lincoln appointed him Military Governor of Tennessee, and Johnson used the state as
a laboratory for reconstruction.  In 1864 the Republicans, contending that their National
Union Party was for all loyal men, nominated Johnson, a Southerner and a Democrat, for Vice 
President.
<p>
After Lincoln's death, President Johnson proceeded to reconstruct the former Confederate 
States while Congress was not in session in 1865.  He pardoned all who would take an oath of 
allegiance, but required leaders and men of wealth to obtain special Presidential pardons.
<p>
By the time Congress met in December 1865, most southern states were reconstructed, slavery
was being abolished, but "black codes" to regulate the freedmen were beginning to appear.    
<p>
Radical Republicans in Congress moved vigorously to change Johnson's program. They gained 
the support of northerners who were dismayed to see Southerners keeping many prewar leaders 
and imposing many prewar restrictions upon Negroes.
<p>
The Radicals' first step was to refuse to seat any Senator or Representative from the old 
Confederacy.  Next they passed measures dealing with the former slaves.  Johnson vetoed the 
legislation.  The Radicals mustered enough votes in Congress to pass legislation over his 
veto--the first time that Congress had overridden a President on an 
important bill.  They passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which established Negroes as American citizens and 
forbade discrimination against them.
<p>
A few months later Congress submitted to the states the Fourteenth Amendment, which 
specified that no state should "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without 
due process of law."
<p>
All the former Confederate States except Tennessee refused to ratify the amendment; 
further, there were two bloody race riots in the South.  Speaking in the Middle West, Johnson 
faced hostile audiences.  The Radical Republicans won an overwhelming victory in Congressional
elections that fall.
<p>
In March 1867, the Radicals effected their own plan of Reconstruction, again placing
 southern states under military rule.  They passed laws placing restrictions upon the
 President.  When Johnson allegedly violated one of these, the Tenure of Office Act, by
 dismissing Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, the House voted eleven articles of impeachment 
 against him.  He was tried by the Senate in the spring of 1868 and acquitted by
 one vote.
<p>
In 1875, Tennessee returned Johnson to the Senate.  He died a few months later.
