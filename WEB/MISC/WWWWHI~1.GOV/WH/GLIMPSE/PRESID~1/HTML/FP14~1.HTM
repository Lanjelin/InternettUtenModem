<B>Inaugural Address</A></B>
<P>
<b>Biography:</b>  Franklin Pierce became President at a time of apparent 
tranquillity.  The United States, by virtue of the Compromise of 1850, seemed to have weathered its 
sectional storm.  By pursuing the recommendations of southern advisers, 
Pierce--a New Englander--hoped to prevent still another outbreak of that storm.  
But his policies, far from preserving calm, hastened the disruption of the Union.
<p> 
Born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, in 1804, Pierce attended Bowdoin 
College.  After graduation he studied law, then entered politics.  At 24 he was 
elected to the New Hampshire legislature; two years later he became its Speaker.
During the 1830's he went to Washington, first as a Representative, then as a 
Senator.
<p>
Pierce, after serving in the Mexican War, was proposed by New Hampshire 
friends for the Presidential nomination in 1852.  At the Democratic Convention, 
the delegates agreed easily enough upon a platform pledging undeviating support of
 the Compromise of 1850 and hostility to any efforts to agitate the slavery 
question.  But they balloted 48 times and eliminated all the well-known candidates
before nominating Pierce, a true "dark horse."
<p>
Probably because the Democrats stood more firmly for the Compromise than 
the Whigs, and because Whig candidate Gen. Winfield Scott was suspect in the 
South, Pierce won with a narrow margin of popular votes.
<p>
Two months before he took office, he and his wife saw their eleven-year-old son
killed when their train was wrecked.  Grief-stricken, Pierce entered the 
Presidency nervously exhausted.
<p>
In his Inaugural he proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity at home, and 
vigor in relations with other nations.  The United States might have to acquire 
additional possessions for the sake of its own security, he pointed out, and 
would not be deterred by "any timid forebodings of evil."
<p>
Pierce had only to make gestures toward expansion to excite the wrath of 
northerners, who accused him of acting as a cat's-paw of Southerners eager to 
extend slavery into other areas.  Therefore he aroused apprehension when he 
pressured Great Britain to relinquish its special interests along part of the 
Central American coast, and even more when he tried to persuade Spain to sell 
Cuba.
<p>
But the most violent renewal of the storm stemmed from the Kansas-Nebraska 
Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise and reopened the question of slavery 
in the West.  This measure, the handiwork of Senator Stephen A. Douglas, grew in 
part out of his desire to promote a railroad from Chicago to California through 
Nebraska.  Already Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, advocate of a southern 
transcontinental route, had persuaded Pierce to send James Gadsden to Mexico to 
buy land for a southern railroad.  He purchased the area now comprising
  southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico for $10,000,000.
<p>
Douglas's proposal, to organize western territories through which a railroad
 might run, caused extreme trouble.  Douglas provided in his bills that the 
residents of the new territories could decide the slavery question for themselves.
The result was a rush into Kansas, as southerners and northerners vied 
for control of the territory.  Shooting broke out, and "bleeding Kansas" became a prelude to
 the Civil War.
<p>
By the end of his administration, Pierce could claim "a peaceful condition 
of things in Kansas." But, to his disappointment, the Democrats refused to 
renominate him, turning to the less controversial Buchanan.  Pierce returned to 
New Hampshire, leaving his successor to face the rising fury of the sectional 
whirlwind.  He died in 1869.
