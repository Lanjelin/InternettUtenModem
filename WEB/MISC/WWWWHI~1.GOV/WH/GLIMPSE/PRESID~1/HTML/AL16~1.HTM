<b>Fun Fact:</b>  During the Civil War, telegraph wires were strung to
follow the action on the battlefield.  But there was no telegraph office
in the White House, so Lincoln went across the street to the War
Department to get the news.
<p>
<b>Fast Fact:</b>  Abhorring war, Abraham Lincoln accepted it as the only
means to save the Union.

<b>Biography:</b>  Abraham Lincoln warned the South in his Inaugural 
Address: "In <i>your</i> hands, my dissatisfied fellow
 countrymen, and not in <i>mine</i>, is the momentous issue of civil war.  
The government will not assail <i>you</i>.... <i>You</i> have no oath 
registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while <i>I</i> shall have 
the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it."    
<p>
Lincoln thought secession illegal, and was willing to use force to defend Federal law
  and the Union.  When Confederate batteries fired on Fort Sumter and forced its surrender, he called on the states 
for 75,000 volunteers.  Four more slave states joined the
  Confederacy but four remained within the Union.  The Civil War had begun.
<p>
The son of a Kentucky frontiersman, Lincoln had to struggle for a 
living and for
  learning.  Five months before receiving his
  party's nomination for President,             he
  sketched his life:
   <p> 
"I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky.  My parents were both
  born in Virginia, of undistinguished families--second families, perhaps I 
should say.  My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a family of the name of Hanks.... My
  father ... removed from Kentucky to ... Indiana, in my eighth year.... It was a
  wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods.  There I grew
  up.... Of course when I came of age I did not know much.  Still somehow, I could
  read, write, and cipher ... but that was all."
 <p>
Lincoln made extraordinary efforts to attain knowledge while working 
on a farm, splitting rails for fences, and keeping store at New Salem, 
Illinois.  He was a captain in the Black Hawk War, spent eight years in the Illinois legislature, and rode 
the circuit of courts for many years.  His law partner said of him, "His ambition was a little engine that knew no rest."
<p>
He married Mary Todd, and they had four boys, only one of whom lived 
to maturity.
<p>
In 1858 Lincoln ran against Stephen A. Douglas for Senator.  He lost the election,
 but in debating with Douglas he gained a national reputation that won him 
the Republican nomination for President in 1860.
<p>
As President, he built the Republican Party into a strong national 
organization.  Further, he rallied most of the northern Democrats to the Union cause.
<p>
On January 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation that 
declared forever free those slaves within the Confederacy.    
<p>
Lincoln never let the world forget that the Civil War involved an even larger issue.  This
 he stated most movingly in dedicating the military cemetery at Gettysburg: "that we
 here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under
 God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the
 people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."
<p>
Lincoln won re-election in 1864, as Union military triumphs heralded an end to the
 war.  In his planning for peace, the President was flexible and generous, encouraging
 Southerners to lay down their arms and join speedily in reunion.
<p>
The spirit that guided him was clearly that of his Second Inaugural Address, now inscribed on one wall of the Lincoln 
Memorial in Washington, D. C.:
<p>
"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God
 gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds.... "
<p>
On Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated at Ford's Theatre 
in Washington by John Wilkes Booth, an actor, who somehow thought he was helping the South.
 The opposite was the result, for with Lincoln's death, the possibility of peace with
 magnanimity died.
