<b>Fun Fact:</b>  Though President Richard Nixon disliked much of the
press, he had the White House swimming pool filled in, to give reporters
more room when covering White House events.  But one president's
decisions about the White House don't always please the next.  After
Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and Gerald Ford became
president, his friends had another pool dug on the White House lawn.
<p>
<b>Fast Fact:</b> The Watergate scandal forced Richard M. Nixon to resign 
the Presidency.

<b>Biography:</b>  Reconciliation was the first goal set by President 
Richard M. Nixon.  The Nation was painfully divided, with turbulence in the 
cities and war overseas.  During his Presidency, Nixon succeeded in ending 
American fighting in Viet Nam and improving relations with the U.S.S.R. and 
China.  But the Watergate scandal brought fresh divisions to the country and
ultimately led to his resignation.
<p>
His election in 1968 had climaxed a career unusual on two counts: his early 
success and his comeback after being defeated for President in 1960 and for 
Governor of California in 1962.
<p>
Born in California in 1913, Nixon had a brilliant record at Whittier College 
and Duke University Law School before beginning the practice of law.  In 1940, 
he married Patricia Ryan; they had two daughters, Patricia (Tricia) and Julie.  
During World War II, Nixon served as a Navy lieutenant commander in the 
Pacific.
<p>
On leaving the service, he was elected to Congress from his California 
district.  In 1950, he won a Senate seat.  Two years later, General Eisenhower 
selected Nixon, age 39, to be his running mate.
<p>
As Vice President, Nixon took on major duties in the Eisenhower 
Administration.  Nominated for President by acclamation in 1960, he lost by a 
narrow margin to John F. Kennedy.  In 1968, he again won his party's
nomination, and went on to defeat Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and 
third-party candidate George C. Wallace.
<p>
His accomplishments while in office included revenue sharing, the end of the 
draft, new anticrime laws, and a broad environmental program.  As he had 
promised, he appointed Justices of conservative philosophy to the Supreme 
Court.  One of the most dramatic events of his first term occurred in 1969, 
when American astronauts made the first moon landing.
<p>
Some of his most acclaimed achievements came in his quest for world 
stability.  During visits in 1972 to Beijing and Moscow, he reduced tensions 
with China and the U.S.S.R.  His summit meetings with Russian leader
Leonid I. Brezhnev produced a treaty to limit strategic nuclear weapons.  In 
January 1973, he announced an accord with North Viet Nam to end American 
involvement in Indochina. In 1974, his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, 
negotiated disengagement agreements between Israel and its opponents, Egypt 
and Syria.
<p>
In his 1972 bid for office, Nixon defeated Democratic candidate George 
McGovern by one of the widest margins on record.
<p>
Within a few months, his administration was embattled over the so-called 
"Watergate" scandal, stemming from a break-in at the offices of the 
Democratic National Committee during the 1972 campaign.  The break-in was 
traced to officials of the Committee to Re-elect the President.  A number
of administration officials resigned; some were later convicted of offenses 
connected with efforts to cover up the affair.  Nixon denied any personal 
involvement, but the courts forced him to yield tape recordings which 
indicated that he had, in fact, tried to divert the investigation.
<p>
As a result of unrelated scandals in Maryland, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew 
resigned in 1973.  Nixon nominated, and Congress approved, House Minority 
Leader Gerald R. Ford as Vice President.
<p>
Faced with what seemed almost certain impeachment, Nixon announced on August
 8, 1974, that he would resign the next day to begin "that process of healing 
which is so desperately needed in America."
<p>
In his last years, Nixon gained praise as an elder statesman.  By the time 
of his death on April 22, 1994, he had written numerous books on his 
experiences in public life and on foreign policy.
