<p>
<b>Biography:</b>  On New Year's Day, 1825, at the last of his annual White House 
receptions, President James Monroe made a pleasing impression upon a Virginia lady
who shook his hand:
<p>
"He is tall and well formed.  His dress plain and in the old style.... 
His manner was quiet and dignified.  From the frank, honest expression of 
his eye ... I think he well deserves the encomium passed upon him by the 
great Jefferson, who said, 'Monroe was so honest that if you turned his 
soul inside out there would not be a spot on it.' "
<p>
Born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1758, Monroe attended the College of
  William and Mary, fought with distinction in the Continental Army, and 
practiced law in Fredericksburg, Virginia.
<p>
As a youthful politician, he joined the anti-Federalists in the Virginia Convention
  which ratified the Constitution, and in 1790,  an advocate of Jeffersonian policies, 
was elected United States Senator.  As Minister  to France in 1794-1796, he 
displayed strong sympathies for the French cause; later, with Robert R. Livingston, 
he helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase.    
<p>
His ambition and energy, together with the backing of President Madison, made him
  the Republican choice for the Presidency in 1816.  With little Federalist 
opposition, he easily won re-election in 1820.

<p>Monroe made unusually strong Cabinet choices, naming a Southerner, John C. Calhoun, 
as Secretary of War, and a northerner, John Quincy Adams, as Secretary of State.  Only Henry Clay's refusal kept Monroe from adding an outstanding Westerner.
<p>
Early in his administration, Monroe undertook a goodwill tour.  At Boston, his visi  was hailed as the beginning of an "Era of Good Feelings." Unfortunately these "good feelings" did not endure, although Monroe, his popularity undiminished, followed
nationalist policies.
<p>
Across the facade of nationalism, ugly sectional cracks appeared.  A painful 
economic depression undoubtedly increased the dismay of the people of the Missouri 
Territory in 1819 when their application for admission to the Union as a slave 
state failed. An amended bill for gradually eliminating slavery in Missouri 
precipitated two years of bitter debate in Congress.
<p>
The Missouri Compromise bill resolved the struggle, pairing Missouri as a slave state
 with Maine, a free state, and barring slavery north and west of Missouri forever.
<p>
In foreign affairs Monroe proclaimed the fundamental policy that bears his name, 
responding to the threat that the more conservative governments in Europe might try to
 aid Spain in winning back her former Latin American colonies.  Monroe did not begin
 formally to recognize the young sister republics until 1822, after ascertaining that
 Congress would vote appropriations for diplomatic missions.  He and Secretary of
 State John Quincy Adams wished to avoid trouble with Spain until it had ceded the
 Floridas, as was done in 1821.
<p>
Great Britain, with its powerful navy, also opposed reconquest of Latin America and
 suggested that the United States join in proclaiming "hands off." Ex-Presidents 
Jefferson and Madison counseled Monroe to accept the offer, but Secretary Adams 
advised, "It would be more candid ... to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and
 France, than to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war."
<p>
Monroe accepted Adams's advice.  Not only must Latin America be left alone, he
 warned, but also Russia must not encroach southward on the Pacific coast.  ". . . the
 American continents," he stated, "by the free and independent condition which they
 have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future
 colonization by any European Power."  Some 20 years after Monroe died in 1831,
 this became known as the Monroe Doctrine.
