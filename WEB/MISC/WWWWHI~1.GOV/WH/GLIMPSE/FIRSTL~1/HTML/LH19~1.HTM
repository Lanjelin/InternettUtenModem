<b>Biography:</b>  There was no inaugural ball in 1877--when Rutherford B. 
Hayes and his wife, Lucy, left Ohio for Washington, the outcome of the 
election was still in doubt.  Public fears had not subsided when it was 
settled in Hayes' favor; and when Lucy watched her husband take his oath 
of office at the Capitol, her serene and beautiful face impressed even 
cynical journalists.
<p>
She came to the White House well loved by many.  Born in
Chillicothe, Ohio, daughter of Maria Cook and Dr. James Webb, she lost
her father at age two.  She was just entering her teens when Mrs. Webb
took her sons to the town of Delaware to enroll in the new Ohio Wesleyan
University, but she began studying with its excellent instructors.  She
graduated from the Wesleyan Female College in Cincinnati at 18,
unusually well educated for a young lady of her day.
<p>  
"Rud" Hayes at 27 had set up a law practice in Cincinnati, and
he began paying calls at the Webb home.  References to Lucy appeared in
his diary: "Her low sweet voice is very winning ... a heart as true as
steel.... Intellect she has too.... By George!  I am in love with her!"
Married in 1852, they lived in Cincinnati until the Civil War, and he
soon came to share her deeply religious opposition to slavery. Visits 
to relatives and vacation journeys broke the routine of a
happy domestic life in a growing family. Over twenty years Lucy bore eight
children, of whom five grew up.
<p>
She won the affectionate name of "Mother Lucy" from men of the
23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry who served under her husband's command in
the war.  They remembered her visits to camp--to minister to the wounded,
cheer the homesick, and comfort the dying.  Hayes' distinguished combat
record earned him election to Congress, and three postwar terms as 
governor of Ohio.  She not only joined him in Washington for its winter social
season, she also accompanied him on visits to state reform 
schools, prisons, and asylums.  As the popular first lady of her 
state, she gained experience in what a woman of her time aptly called 
"semi-public life."
<p> 
Thus she entered the White House with confidence gained from her
long and happy married life, her knowledge of political circles, 
her intelligence and culture, and her cheerful spirit.  She enjoyed 
informal parties, and spared no effort to make official entertaining 
attractive.  Though she was a temperance advocate and liquor was banned at 
the mansion during this administration, she was a very popular 
hostess.  She took criticism of her views in good humor (the famous nickname 
"Lemonade Lucy" apparently came into use only after she had left the 
mansion).  She became one of the best-loved women to preside over the 
White House, where the Hayeses celebrated their silver wedding 
anniversary in 1877, and an admirer hailed her as representing "the new 
woman era."
<p> 
The Hayes term ended in 1881, and the family home was now
"Spiegel Grove," an estate at Fremont, Ohio.  There husband 
and wife spent eight active, contented years together until her death 
in 1889.  She was buried in Fremont, mourned by her family and hosts of 
friends.
<p>
