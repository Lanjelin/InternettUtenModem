<b>Biography:</b>  Daughter of the richest man in a small town--Amos 
Kling, a successful businessman--Florence Mabel Kling was born in Marion, Ohio, in 1860, to 
grow up in a setting of wealth, position, and privilege.  Much like her 
strong-willed father in temperament, she developed a self-reliance rare 
in girls of that era.
<p>
A music course at the Cincinnati Conservatory completed her education.  
When only 19, she eloped with Henry De Wolfe, a neighbor two years her 
senior.  he proved a spendthrift and a heavy drinker who soon deserted 
her, so she returned to Marion with her baby son.  Refusing to live at 
home, she rented rooms and earned her own money by giving piano lessons 
to children of the neighborhood.  She divorced De Wolfe in 1886 and 
resumed her maiden name; he died at age 35.
<p>
Warren G. Harding had come to Marion when only 16 and, showing a flair 
for newspaper work, had managed to buy the little <i>Daily Star</i>.  
When he met Florence a courtship quickly developed.  Over Amos Kling's 
angry opposition they were married in 1891, in a house that Harding had 
planned, and this remained their home for the rest of their lives.  (They 
had no children.)
<p>
Mrs. Harding soon took over the <i>Star</i>'s circulation department, 
spanking newsboys when necessary.  "No pennies escaped her," a friend 
recalled, and the paper prospered while its owner's political success 
increased.  As he rose through Ohio politics and became a United States 
Senator, his wife directed all her acumen to his career.  He became 
Republican nominee for President in 1920 and "the Duchess," as he called 
her, worked tirelessly for his election.  In her own words:  "I have only 
one real hobby--my husband."
<p>
She had never been a guest at the White House; and former President Taft, 
meeting the President-elect and Mrs. Harding, discussed its social 
customs with her and stressed the value of ceremony.  Writing to Nellie, 
he concluded that the new First Lady was "a nice woman" and would 
"readily adapt herself."
<p>
When Mrs. Harding moved into the White House, she opened mansion and 
grounds to the public again--both had been closed through President 
Wilson's illness.  She herself suffered from a chronic kidney ailment, 
but she threw herself into the job of First Lady with energy and willpower.
Garden parties for veterans were regular events on a crowded social 
calendar.  The President and his wife relaxed at poker parties in the 
White House library, where liquor was available although the Eighteenth 
Amendment made it illegal.
<p>
Mrs. Harding always liked to travel with her husband.  She was with him 
in the summer of 1923 when he died unexpectedly in California, shortly 
before the public learned of the major scandals facing his administration.
<p>
With astonishing fortitude she endured the long train ride to Washington 
with the President's body, the state funeral at the Capitol, the last 
service and burial at Marion.  She died in Marion on November 21, 1924, 
surviving Warren Harding by little more than a year of illness and sorrow.
