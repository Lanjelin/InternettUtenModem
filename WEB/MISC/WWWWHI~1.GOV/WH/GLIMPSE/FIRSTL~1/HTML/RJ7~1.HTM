<b>Biography:</b>  Wearing the white dress she had purchased for her 
husband's inaugural ceremonies in March 1829, Rachel Donelson Jackson was buried in the 
garden at The Hermitage, her home near Nashville, Tennessee, on Christmas 
Eve in 1828.  Lines from her epitaph--"A being so gentle and so 
virtuous slander might wound, but could not dishonor"--reflected his 
bitterness at campaign slurs that seemed to precipitate her death.
<p>
Rachel Donelson was a child of the frontier.  Born in Virginia, she 
journeyed to the Tennessee wilderness with her parents when only 12.  At 
17, while living in Kentucky, she married Lewis Robards, of a prominent 
Mercer County family.  His unreasoning jealousy made it impossible for 
her to live with him; in 1790 they separated, and she heard that he was 
filing a petition for divorce.
<p>
Andrew Jackson married her in 1791; and after two happy years they 
learned to their dismay that Robards had not obtained a divorce, only 
permission to file for one.  Now he brought suit on grounds of adultery.  
After the divorce was granted, the Jacksons quietly remarried in 1794.  
They had made an honest mistake, as friends well understood, but whispers 
of adultery and bigamy followed Rachel as Jackson's career advanced in 
both politics and war.  He was quick to take offense at, and ready to 
avenge, any slight to her.
<p>
Scandal aside, Rachel's unpretentious kindness won the respect of all who 
knew her--including innumerable visitors who found a comfortable welcome 
at The Hermitage.  Although the Jacksons never had children of their own, 
they gladly opened their home to the children of Rachel's many 
relatives.  In 1809 they adopted a nephew and named him Andrew Jackson, 
Jr.  They also reared other nephews; one, Andrew Jackson Donelson, 
eventually married his cousin Emily, one of Rachel's favorite nieces.
<p>
When Jackson was elected President, he planned to have young Donelson for 
private secretary, with Emily as company for Rachel.  After losing his 
beloved wife he asked Emily to serve as his hostess.
<p>
Though only 21 when she entered the White House, she skillfully cared for 
her uncle, her husband, four children (three born at the mansion), many 
visiting relatives, and official guests.  Praised by contemporaries for 
her wonderful tact, she had the courage to differ with the President on 
issues of principle.  Frail throughout her lifetime, Emily died of 
tuberculosis in 1836.
<p>
During the last months of the administration, Sarah Yorke Jackson, wife 
of Andrew Jackson, Jr., presided at the mansion in her stead.
