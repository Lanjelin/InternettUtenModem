<b>Biography:</b>  Inheriting New England's strongest traditions, Abigail 
Smith was born in 1744 at Weymouth, Massachusetts.  On her mother's side she was descended 
from the Quincys, a family of great prestige in the colony; her father 
and other forebearers were Congregational ministers, leaders in a society 
that held its clergy in high esteem.
<p>
Like other women of the time, Abigail lacked formal education; but her 
curiosity spurred her keen intelligence, and she read avidly the books at 
hand.  Reading created a bond between her and young John Adams, Harvard 
graduate launched on a career in law, and they were married in 1764.  It 
was a marriage of the mind and of the heart, enduring for more than half 
a century, enriched by time.
<p>
The young couple lived on John's small farm at Braintree or in Boston as 
his practice expanded.  In ten years she bore three sons and two 
daughters; she looked after family and home when he went traveling as 
circuit judge.  "Alas!" she wrote in December 1773, "How many snow banks 
divide thee and me...."
<p>
Long separations kept Abigail from her husband while he served the 
country they loved, as delegate to the Continental  Congress, envoy 
abroad, elected officer under the Constitution.  Her letters--pungent, 
witty, and vivid, spelled just as she spoke--detail her life in times of 
revolution.  They tell the story of the woman who stayed at home to 
struggle with wartime shortages and inflation; to run the farm with a 
minimum of help; to teach four children when formal education was 
interrupted.  Most of all, they tell of her loneliness without her 
"dearest Friend."  The "one single expression," she said, "dwelt upon my 
mind and played about my Heart...."
<p>
In 1784, she joined him at his diplomatic post in Paris, and observed 
with interest the manners of the French.  After 1785, she filled the 
difficult role of wife of the first United States Minister to Great 
Britain, and did so with dignity and tact.  They returned happily in 
1788 to Massachusetts and the handsome house they had just acquired in 
Braintree, later called Quincy, home for the rest of their lives.
<p>
As wife of the first Vice President, Abigail became a good friend to 
Mrs. Washington and a valued help in official entertaining, drawing on 
her experience of courts and society abroad.  After 1791, however, poor 
health forced her to spend as much time as possible in Quincy.  Illness 
or trouble found her resolute; as she once declared, she would "not 
forget the blessings which sweeten life."
<p>    
When John Adams was elected President, she continued a formal pattern of 
entertaining--even in the primitive conditions she found at the new 
capital in November 1800.  The city was wilderness, the President's House 
far from completion.  Her private complaints to her family provide blunt 
accounts of both, but for her three months in Washington she duly held 
her dinners and receptions.
<p>
The Adamses retired to Quincy in 1801, and for 17 years enjoyed the 
companionship that public life had long denied them.  Abigail died in 
1818, and is buried beside her husband in United First Parish Church.  
She leaves her country a most remarkable record as patriot and First 
Lady, wife of one President and mother of another.
