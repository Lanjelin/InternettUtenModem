<b>Biography:</b>  Cousins in a close-knit Dutch community, Hannah Hoes 
and Martin Van Buren grew up together in Kinderhook, New York.  Evidently he wanted to 
establish his law practice before marrying his sweetheart--they were not 
wed until 1807, when he was 24 and his bride just three months younger.  
Apparently their marriage was a happy one, though little is known of 
Hannah as a person.
<p>
Van Buren omitted even her name from his autobiography; a gentleman of 
that day would not shame a lady by public references.  A niece who 
remembered "her loving, gentle disposition" emphasized "her modest, even 
timid manner."  Church records preserve some details of her life; she 
seems to have considered formal church affiliation a matter of importance.
<p>
She bore a son in Kinderhook, three others in Hudson, where Martin served 
as county surrogate; but the fourth son died in infancy.  In 1816 the 
family moved to the state capital in Albany.  Soon the household included 
Martin's law partner and three apprentices; relatives came and went 
constantly, and Hannah could return their visits.  Contemporary letters 
indicate that she was busy, sociable, and happy.  She gave birth to a 
fifth boy in January 1817.
<p>
But the following winter her health was obviously failing, apparently 
from tuberculosis.  Not yet 36, she died on February 5, 1819.  The Albany 
<i>Argus</i> called her "an ornament of the Christian faith."
<p>
Her husband never remarried; he moved into the White House in 1837 as a 
widower with four bachelor sons.  Now accustomed to living in elegant 
style, he immediately began to refurbish a mansion shabby from public use 
under Jackson.  Across Lafayette Square, Dolley Madison reigned as 
matriarch of Washington society; when her young relative-by-marriage 
Angelica Singleton came up from South Carolina for a visit, Dolley took 
her to the White House to pay a call.
<p>
 Angelica's aristocratic manners, excellent education, and 
handsome face won the heart of the President's eldest son, Abraham.  They 
were married in November 1838; next spring a honeymoon abroad polished 
her social 
experience.  Thereafter, while Abraham served as the President's private 
secretary, Angelica presided as the lady of the White House.  The only 
flaw in her pleasure in this role was the loss of a baby girl.  Born at 
the White House, she lived only a few hours.  In later years, though 
spending much time in South Carolina and in Europe, Angelica and her 
husband made their home in New York City; she died there in 1878.
