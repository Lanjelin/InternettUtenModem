<b>Biography:</b>  Silks and satins little Sarah took for granted, growing 
up on a plantation near Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  Elder daughter of Captain Joel 
and Elizabeth Childress, she gained something rarer from her father's 
wealth.  He sent her and her sister away to school, first to Nashville, 
then to the Moravians' "female academy" at Salem, North Carolina, one of 
the very few institutions of higher learning available to women in the 
early 19th century.  So she acquired an education that made her 
especially fitted to assist a man with a political career.
<p>
James K. Polk was laying the foundation for that career when he met her.  
He had begun his first year's service in the Tennessee legislature when 
they were married on New Year's Day, 1824; he was 28, she 20.  The story 
goes that Andrew Jackson had encouraged their romance; he certainly made 
Polk a political protege, and as such Polk represented a district in 
Congress for 14 sessions.
<p>
In an age when motherhood gave a woman her only acknowledged career, 
Sarah Polk had to resign herself to childlessness.  Moreover, no lady 
would admit to a political role of her own, but Mrs. Polk found scope for 
her astute mind as well as her social skills.  She accompanied her 
husband to Washington whenever she could, and they soon won a place in 
its most select social circles.  Constantly--but privately--Sarah was 
helping him with his speeches, copying his correspondence, giving him 
advice.  Much as she enjoyed politics, she would warn him against 
overwork.  He would hand her a newspaper--"Sarah, here is something I 
wish you to read..."--and she would set to work as well.
<p>
A devout Presbyterian, she refused to attend horse races or the theater; 
but she always maintained social contacts of value to James.  When he 
returned to Washington as President in 1845, she stepped to her high 
position with ease and evident pleasure.  She appeared at the inaugural 
ball, but did not dance.
<p>
Contrasted with Julia Tyler's waltzes, her entertainments have become 
famous for sedateness and sobriety.  Some later accounts say that the 
Polks never served wine, but in December 1845 a Congressman's wife 
recorded in her diary details of a four-hour dinner for forty at the 
White House--glasses for six different wines, from pink champagne to ruby 
port and sauterne, "formed a rainbow around each plate."  Skilled in 
tactful conversation, Mrs. Polk enjoyed wide popularity as well as deep 
respect.
<p>
Only three months after retirement to their fine new home "Polk Place" in 
Nashville, he died, worn out by years of public service.  Clad always in 
black, Sarah Polk lived on in that home for 42 years, guarding the memory 
of her husband and accepting honors paid to her as honors due to him.  
The house became a place of pilgrimage.
<p>
During the Civil War, Mrs. Polk held herself above sectional strife and 
received with dignity leaders of both Confederate and Union armies; all 
respected Polk Place as neutral ground.  She presided over her house 
until her death in her 88th year.  Buried beside her husband, she was 
mourned by a nation that had come to regard her as a precious link to the 
past.
