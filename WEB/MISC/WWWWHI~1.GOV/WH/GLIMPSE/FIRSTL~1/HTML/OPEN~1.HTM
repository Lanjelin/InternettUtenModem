The American people have made the role of the First Lady one of the most 
important jobs in the country.  It happened because each First Lady from 
Martha Washington onward contributed to her husband's historical 
reputation.  It is a tribute to American women that, coming from 
different social and economic backgrounds, from many different 
geographical regions, and with diverse education preparation, each First 
Lady served our country so well.  Each left her own mark, and each tells 
us something special about our history.
<p>
The White House Historical Association has published <i>The First Ladies 
</i> to give us an opportunity to know these fascinating women better.  
The biographies were written by Margaret B. Klaphthor, Curator Emeritus 
of the Smithsonian Institution.  Mrs. Klapthor has spent 50 years 
studying our First Ladies, and her findings put each woman into 
perspective.  She highlights their individual achievements as well as 
their qualities that make them similar.  As we learn about them, we begin 
to see that these women usually reflect the time in which they lived, so 
much so that a look at their lives becomes a panorama of women's history 
in America.  Managing the social life at the White House and the 
personal welfare of the President and their families, the First Ladies 
set a standard for the women of their day.  In addition, they brought 
their own interests to the same wide audience.
<p>
From the relative obscurity of the earliest First Ladies, a few shine 
like stars.  We see Abigail Adams passionate love for John Adams, in her 
patriotism, and in her political and social beliefs.  Dolley Madison 
dazzles Washington with her social skills and also proves to be an
especially astute politician who aids her husband's presidential 
activities.  Sarah Polk also assists her husband's political 
career. Acting as the President's private secretary, she enjoys more politics than entertaining. 
<p>
The period beginning with the Civil War brought First Ladies  who saw in 
their role an opportunity for service to the less fortunate.  Mary Todd 
Lincoln spent hours visiting with wounded Civil War soliders.  Lucy Webb 
Hayes deeply touched the nation with her compassion for the poor and less 
privileged.  Edith Roosevelt sewed for the needy.
<p>
With the 20th century, the role of the First Lady included women with 
professional careers.  Ellen Wilson was an accomplished artist; Grace 
Coolidge taught the deaf; and Lou Henry Hoover was a geologist.  Others, 
such as Eleanor Roosevelt, used their positions to speak out for peace, 
justice, equality for women and "the needs of the common people".
<p>
I take courage from reading <i>The First Ladies</i>, and I hope 
that, like me, all of you who read these brief profiles will be motivated 
to learn more about this interesting group of Americans.
