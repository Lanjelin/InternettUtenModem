<b>Biography:</b>  Whistle-stopping in 1948, President Harry Truman often 
ended his campaign talk by introducing his wife as "the Boss" and his daughter, Margaret, as 
"the Boss's Boss," and they smiled and waved as the train picked up 
steam.  The sight of that close-knit family gallantly fighting against 
such long odds had much to do with his surprise victory at the polls that 
November.
<p>
Strong family ties in the southern tradition had always been important 
around Independence, Missouri, where a baby girl was born to Margaret 
("Madge") Gates and David Wallace on February 13, 1885.  Christened 
Elizabeth Virginia, she grew up as "Bess."  Harry Truman, whose family 
moved to town in 1890, always kept his first impression of her -- "golden 
curls" and "the most beautiful blue eyes."  A relative said, "there never 
was but one girl in the world" for him.  They attended the same schools 
from fifth grade through high school.
<p>
In recent years their daughter has written a vivid sketch of Bess as a 
girl:  "a marvelous athlete--the best third baseman in Independence, a 
superb tennis player, a tireless ice skater--and she was pretty 
besides."  She also had many "strong opinions....and no hesitation about 
stating them Missouri style--straight from the shoulder."
<p>
For Bess and Harry, World War I altered a deliberate courtship.  He 
proposed and they became engaged before Lieutenant Truman left for the 
battlefields of France in 1918.  They were married in June 1919; they 
lived in Mrs. Wallace's home, where Mary Margaret was born in 1924.
<p>
When Harry Truman became active in politics, Mrs. Truman traveled with 
him and shared his platform appearances as the public had come to expect 
a candidate's wife to do.  His election to the Senate in 1934 took the 
family to Washington.  Reluctant to be a public figure herself, she 
always shared his thoughts and interests in private.  When she joined his 
office staff as a secretary, he said, she earned "every cent I pay her."  
His wartime role as chairman of a special committee on defense spending 
earned him national recognition--and a place on the Democratic ticket as 
President Roosevelt's fourth-term running mate.  Three months after their 
inauguration Roosevelt was dead.  On April 12, 1945, Harry Truman took 
the President's oath of office--and Bess, who managed to look on with 
composure, was the new First Lady.
<p>
In the White House, its lack of privacy was distasteful to her.  As her 
husband put it later, she was "not especially interested" in the 
"formalities and pomp or the artificiality which, as we had learned..., 
inevitably surround the family of the President."  Though she 
conscientiously fulfilled the social obligations of her position, she did 
only what was necessary.  While the mansion was rebuilt during the second 
term, the Trumans lived in Blair House and kept social life to a minimum.
<p>
They returned to Independence in 1953.  After her husband's death in 
1972, Mrs. Truman continued to live in the family home.  There she 
enjoyed visits from Margaret and her husband, Clifton Daniel, and their 
four sons.  She died in 1982 and was buried beside her husband in the 
courtyard of the Harry S. Truman Library.
