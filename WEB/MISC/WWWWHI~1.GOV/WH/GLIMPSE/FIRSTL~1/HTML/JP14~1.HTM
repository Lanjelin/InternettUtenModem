<b>Biography:</b>  In looks and in pathetic destiny young Jane Means 
Appleton resembled the heroine of a Victorian novel.  The gentle dignity of her face reflected 
her sensitive, retiring personality and physical weakness.  Her father 
had died--he was a Congregational minister, the Reverend Jesse Appleton, 
president of Bowdoin College--and her mother had taken the family to 
Amherst, New Hampshire.  And Jane met a Bowdoin graduate, a young lawyer 
with political ambitions, Franklin Pierce.
<p>
Although he was immediately devoted to Jane, they did not marry until she 
was 28--surprising in that day of early marriages.  Her family opposed 
the match; moreover, she always did her best to discourage his interest 
in politics.  The death of a three-day-old son, the arrival of a new 
baby, and Jane's dislike of Washington counted heavily in his decision to 
retire at the apparent height of his career, as United States Senator, in 
1842.  Little Frank Robert, the second son, died the next year of typhus.
<p>
Service in the Mexican War brought Pierce the rank of brigadier and local 
fame as a hero.  He returned home safely, and for four years the Pierces 
lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshired, in the happiest period of their 
lives.  With attentive pleasure Jane watched her son Benjamin growing up.
<p>
Then, in 1852, the Democratic Party made Pierce their candidate for 
President.  His wife fainted at the news.  When he took her to Newport 
for a respite, Benny wrote to her: "I hope he won't be elected for I 
should not like to be at Washington and I know you would not either."  
But the President-elect convinced Jane that his office would be an asset 
for Benny's success in life.
<p>
On a journey by train, January 6, 1853, their car was derailed and Benny 
killed before their eyes.  The whole nation shared the parents' grief.  
The inauguration on March 4 took place without an inaugural ball, and 
without the presence of Mrs. Pierce.  She joined her husband later that 
month, but any pleasure the White House might have brought her was gone.  
From this loss she never recovered fully.  Other events deepened the 
somber mood of the new administration:  Mrs. Fillmore's death in March, 
that of Vice President Rufus King in April.
<p>
Always devout, Jane Pierce turned for solace to prayer.  She had to force 
herself to meet the social obligations inherent in the role of First 
Lady.  Fortunately she had the companionship and help of a girlhood 
friend, now her aunt by marriage, Abigail Kent Means. Mrs. Robert E. Lee 
wrote in a private letter: "I have known many of the ladies of the White 
House, none more truly excellent than the afflicted wife of President 
Pierce.  Her health was a bar to any great effort on her part to meet the 
expectations of the public in her high position but she was a refined, 
extremely religious and well educated lady."
<p>
With retirement, the Pierces made a prolonged trip abroad in search of 
health for the invalid--she carried Benny's Bible throughout the 
journey.  The quest was unsuccessful, so the couple came home to New 
Hampshire to be near family and friends until Jane's death in 1863.  She 
was buried near Benny's grave.
