<b>Biography:</b>  Unique among First Ladies, Harriet Lane acted as 
hostess for the only President who never married:  James Buchanan, her favorite uncle and her 
guardian afer she was orphaned at the age of eleven.  And of all the 
ladies of the White House, few achieved such great success in deeply 
troubled times as this polished young woman in her twenties.
<p>
In the rich farming country of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, her family 
had prospered as merchants.  Her uncle supervised her sound education in 
private school, completed by two years at the Visitation Convent in 
Georgetown.  By this time, "Nunc" was Secretary of State, and he 
introduced her to fashionable circles as he had promised, "in the best 
manner."  In 1854 she joined him in London, where he was minister to the 
Court of St. James.  Queen Victoria gave "dear Miss Lane" the rank of 
ambassador's wife; admiring suitors gave her the fame of a beauty.
<p>
In appearance "Hal" Lane was of medium height, with masses of light hair 
almost golden.  In manner she enlivened social gatherings with a 
captivating mixture of spontaneity and poise.
<p>
After the sadness of the Pierce administration, the capital eagerly 
welcomed its new "Democratic Queen" in 1857.  Harriet Lane filled the 
White House with gaiety and flowers, and guided its social life with 
enthusiasm and discretion, winning national popularity.
<p>
As sectional tensions increased, she worked out seating arrangements for 
her weekly formal dinner parties with special care, to give dignitaries 
their proper precedence and still keep political foes apart.  Her tact 
did not falter, but her task became impossible--as did her uncle's.  
Seven states had seceded by the time Buchanan retired from office and 
thankfully returned with his niece to his spacious country home, 
Wheatland, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
<p>
From her teenage years, the popular Miss Lane flirted happily with 
numerous beaux, calling them "pleasant but dreadfully troublesome."  
Buchanan often warned her against "rushing precipitately into matrimonial 
connexions," and she waited until she was almost 36 to marry.  She chose, 
with her uncle's approval, Henry Elliott Johnston, a Baltimore banker.  
Within the next 18 years she faced one sorrow after another:  the loss of 
her uncle, her two fine young sons, and her husband.
<p>
Thereafter she decided to live in Washington, among friends made during 
years of happiness.  She had acquired a sizable art collection, largely 
of European works, which she bequeathed to the government.  Accepted 
after her death in 1903, it inspired an official of the Smithsonian 
Institution to call her "First Lady of the National Collection of Fine 
Arts."  In addition, she had dedicated a generous sum to endow a home for 
invalid children at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.  It became 
an outstanding pediatric facility, and its national reputation is a 
fitting memorial to the young lady who presided at the White House with 
such dignity and charm.  The Harriet Lane Outpatient Clinics serve 
thousands of children today.
