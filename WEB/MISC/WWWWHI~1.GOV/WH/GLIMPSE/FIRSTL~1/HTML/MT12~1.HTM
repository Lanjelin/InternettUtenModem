<b>Biography:</b>  After the election of 1848, a passenger on a 
Mississippi riverboat struck up a conversation with easy-mannered Gen. Zachary Taylor, not knowing his 
identity.  The passenger remarked that he didn't think the general 
qualified for the Presidency--was the stranger "a Taylor man"? "Not much 
of one," came the reply.  The general went on to say that he hadn't voted 
for Taylor, partly because his wife was opposed to sending "Old Zack" to 
Washington, "where she would be obliged to go with him!"  It was a 
truthful answer.
<p>
Moreover, the story goes that Margaret Taylor had taken a vow during the 
Mexican War: If her husband returned safely, she would never go into 
society again.  In fact she never did, though prepared for it by genteel 
upbringing.
<p>
"Peggy" Smith was born in Calvert County, Maryland, daughter of Ann 
Mackall and Walter Smith, a major in the Revolutionary War according to 
family tradition.  In 1809, visiting a sister in Kentucky, she met young 
Lieutenant Taylor.  They were married the following June, and for a while 
the young wife stayed on the farm given them as a wedding present by 
Zachary's father.  She bore her first baby there, but cheerfully followed 
her husband from one remote garrison to another along the western 
frontier of civilization.  An admiring civilian official cited her as one 
of the "delicate females...reared in tenderness" who had to educate 
"worthy and most interesting" children at a fort in Indian country.
<p>
Two small girls died in 1820 of what Taylor called "a violent bilious 
fever," which left their mother's health impaired; three girls and a boy 
grew up.  Knowing the hardships of a military wife, Taylor opposed his 
daughters' marrying career soldiers--but each eventually married into the 
Army.
<p>
The second daughter, Knox, married Lt. Jefferson Davis in gentle defiance 
of her parents.  In a loving letter home, she imagined her mother 
skimming milk in the cellar or going out to feed the chickens.  Within 
three months of her wedding, Knox died of malaria.  Taylor was not 
reconciled to Davis until they fought together in Mexico; in Washington 
the second Mrs. Davis became a good friend of Mrs. Taylor's, often 
calling on her at the White House.
<p>
Though Peggy Taylor welcomed friends and kinfolk in her upstairs sitting 
room, presided at the family table, met special groups at her husband's 
side, and worshiped regularly at St. John's Episcopal Church, she took no 
part in formal social functions.  She relegated all the duties of 
official hostess to her youngest daughter, Mary Elizabeth, then 25 and 
recent bride of Lt. Col. William W.S. Bliss, adjutant and secretary to 
the President.  Betty Bliss filled her role admirably.  One observer 
thought that her manner blended "the artlessness of a rustic belle and 
the grace of a duchess."
