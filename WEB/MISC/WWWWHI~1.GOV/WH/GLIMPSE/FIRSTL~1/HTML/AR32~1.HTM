<b>Biography:</b>  A shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, 
Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all 
creeds, races, and nations.  Her constant work to improve their lot made 
her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most 
reviled--women of her generation.
<p>
She was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely 
Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore.  When her 
mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her 
adored father died only two years later.  Attending a distinguished 
school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop 
self-confidence among other girls.
<p>
Tall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of 
being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded.  In her 
circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt.  They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with 
her uncle the President giving the bride away.  Within eleven years 
Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy.  "I suppose I was 
fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, 
young society matron," she wrote later in her autobiography.
<p>
In Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, 
Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate.  She gained a 
knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant 
Secretary of the Navy.  When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, 
she tended him devotedly.  She became active in the women's division of 
the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive.  
From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his 
death, she dedicated her life to his purposes.  She became eyes and ears 
for him, a trusted and tireless reporter.
<p>
When Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood 
social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed 
the role of First Lady accordingly.  She never shirked official 
entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness.  She also 
broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the 
country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions 
candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, "My Day."
<p>
This made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, 
her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to 
many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World 
War II.  As she had written wistfully at 14:  "...no matter how plain a 
woman may be if truth &amp; loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be 
attracted to her...."
<p>
After the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde 
Park estate; she told reporters: "the story is over."  Within a year, 
however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United 
Nations.  She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to 
wane in 1962.  She died in New York City that November, and was buried 
at Hyde Park beside her husband.
