<b>Biography:</b>  First of First Ladies to hold a job after marriage, 
Abigail Fillmore was helping her husband's career.  She was also revealing her most striking 
personal characteristic: eagerness to learn and pleasure in teaching others.
<p>
She was born in Saratoga County, New York, in 1798, while it was still on 
the fringe of civilization.  Her father, a locally prominent Baptist 
preacher named Lemuel Powers, died shortly thereafter.  Courageously, her 
mother moved on westward, thinking her scanty funds would go further in a 
less settled region, and ably educated her small son and daughter beyond 
the usual frontier level with the help of her husband's library.
<p>
Shared eagerness for schooling formed a bond when Abigail Powers at 21 
met Millard Fillmore at 19, both students at a recently opened academy in 
the village of New Hope.  Although she soon became young Fillmore's 
inspiration, his struggle to make his way as a lawyer was so long and ill 
paid that they were not married until February 1826.  She even resumed 
teaching school after the marriage.  And then her only son, Millard 
Powers, was born in 1828.
<p>
Attaining prosperity at last, Fillmore bought his family a six-room house 
in Buffalo, where little Mary Abigail was born in 1832.  Enjoying 
comparative luxury, Abigail learned the ways of society as the wife of a 
Congressman.  She cultivated a noted flower garden; but much of her time, 
as always, she spent reading.  In 1847, Fillmore was elected state 
comptroller; with the children away in boarding school and college, the 
parents moved temporarily to Albany.
<p>
In 1849, Abigail Fillmore came to Washington as wife of the Vice 
President; 16 months later, after Zachary Taylor's death at a height of 
sectional crisis, the Fillmores moved into the White House.
<p>
Even after the period of official mourning the social life of the 
Fillmore administration remained subdued.  The First Lady presided with 
grace at state dinners and receptions; but a permanently injured ankle 
made her Friday-evening levees an ordeal--two hours of standing at her 
husband's side to greet the public.  In any case, she preferred reading 
or music in private.  Pleading her delicate health, she entrusted many 
routine social duties to her attractive daughter, "Abby."  With a special 
appropriation from Congress, she spent contented hours selecting books 
for a White House library and arranging them in the oval room upstairs, 
where Abby had her piano, harp, and guitar.  Here, wrote a friend, Mrs. 
Fillmore "could enjoy the music she so much loved, and the conversation 
of...cultivated society...."
<p>
Despite chronic poor health, Mrs. Fillmore stayed near her husband 
through the outdoor ceremonies of President Pierce's inauguration while a 
raw northeast wind whipped snow over the crowd.  Returning chilled to 
the Willard Hotel, she developed pneumonia; she died there on March 30, 
1853.  The House of Representatives and the Senate adjourned, and public 
offices closed in respect, as her family took her body home to Buffalo 
for burial.
