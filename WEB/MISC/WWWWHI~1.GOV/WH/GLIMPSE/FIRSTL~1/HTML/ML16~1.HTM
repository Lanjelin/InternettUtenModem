<b>Biography:</b>  As a girlhood companion remembered her, Mary Todd was 
vivacious and impulsive, with an interesting personality--but "she now and then could 
not restrain a witty, sarcastic speech that cut deeper than she 
intended...."  A young lawyer summed her up in 1840: "the very creature 
of excitement."  All of these attributes marked her life, bringing her 
both happiness and tragedy.
<p>
Daughter of Eliza Parker and Robert Smith Todd, pioneer settlers of 
Kentucky, Mary lost her mother before the age of seven.  Her father 
remarried; and Mary remembered her childhood as "desolate" although she 
belonged to the aristocracy of Lexington, with high-spirited social life 
and a sound private education.
<p>
Just 5 feet 2 inches at maturity, Mary had clear blue eyes, long lashes, 
light-brown hair with glints of bronze, and a lovely complexion.  She 
danced gracefully, she loved finery, and her crisp intelligence polished 
the wiles of a Southern coquette.  
<p>
Nearly 21, she went to Springfield, Illinois, to live with her sister 
Mrs. Ninian Edwards.  Here she met Abraham Lincoln--in his own words, "a 
poor nobody then."  Three years later, after a stormy courtship and 
broken engagement, they were married.  Though opposites in background and 
temperament, they were united by an enduring love--by Mary's confidence 
in her husband's ability and his gentle consideration of her excitable ways.
<p>
Their years in Springfield brought hard work, a family of boys, and 
reduced circumstances to the pleasure-loving girl who had never felt 
responsibility before.  Lincoln's single term in Congress, for 1847-1849, 
gave Mary and the boys a winter in Washington, but scant opportunity for 
social life.  Finally her unwavering faith in her husband won ample 
justification with his election as President in 1860.
<p>
Though her position fulfilled her high social ambitions, Mrs. Lincoln's 
years in the White House mingled misery with triumph.  An orgy of 
spending stirred resentful comment.  While the Civil War dragged on, 
Southerners scorned her as a traitor to her birth, and citizens loyal to 
the Union suspected her of treason.  When she entertained, critics 
accused her of unpatriotic extravagance.  When, utterly distraught, she 
curtailed her entertaining after her son Willie's death in 1862, they 
accused her of shirking her social duties.
<p>
Yet Lincoln, watching her put her guests at ease during a White House 
reception, could say happily: "My wife is as handsome as when she was a 
girl, and I...fell in love with her; and what is more, I have never 
fallen out."
<p>
Her husband's assassination in 1865 shattered Mary Todd Lincoln.  The 
next 17 years held nothing but sorrow.  With her son "Tad" she traveled 
abroad in search of health, tortured by distorted ideas of her financial 
situation.  After Tad died in 1871, she slipped into a world of illusion 
where poverty and murder pursued her.
<p>
A misunderstood and tragic figure, she passed away in 1882 at her 
sister's home in Springfield--the same house from which she had walked as 
the bride of Abraham Lincoln, 40 years before.
