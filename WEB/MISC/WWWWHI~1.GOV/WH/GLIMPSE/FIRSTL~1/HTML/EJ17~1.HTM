<b>Biography:</b>  "I knew he'd be acquitted; I knew it," declared Eliza 
McCardle Johnson, told how the Senate had voted in her husband's impeachment trial.  Her 
faith in him had never wavered during those difficult days in 1868, when 
her courage dictated that all White House social events should continue 
as usual.
<p>
That faith began to develop many years before in east Tennessee, when 
Andrew Johnson first came to Greeneville, across the mountains from North 
Carolina, and established a tailor shop.  Eliza was almost 16 then and 
Andrew only 17; and local tradition tells of the day she first saw him.  
He was driving a blind pony hitched to a small cart, and she said to a 
girl friend, "There goes my beau!"  She married him within a year, on May 
17, 1827.
<p>
Eliza was the daughter of Sarah Phillips and John McCardle, a shoemaker.  
Fortunately she had received a good basic education that she was 
delighted to share with her new husband.  He already knew his letters and 
could read a bit, so she taught him writing and arithmetic.  With their 
limited means, her skill at keeping a house and bringing up a family--five children, in all--had much to do with Johnson's success.
<p>
He rose rapidly, serving in the state and national legislatures and as 
governor.  Like him, when the Civil War came, people of east Tennessee 
remained loyal to the Union; Lincoln sent him to Nashville as military 
governor in 1862.  Rebel forces caught Eliza at home with part of the 
family.  Only after months of uncertainty did they rejoin Andrew Johnson 
in Nashville.  By 1865 a soldier son and son-in-law had died, and Eliza 
was an invalid for life.
<p>
Quite aside from the tragedy of Lincoln's death, she found little 
pleasure in her husband's position as President.  At the White House, she 
settled into a second-floor room that became the center of activities for 
a large family:  her two sons, her widowed daughter Mary Stover and her 
children; her older daughter Martha with her husband, Senator David T. 
Patterson, and their children.  As a schoolgirl Martha had often been the 
Polks' guest at the mansion; now she took up its social duties.  She was 
a competent, unpretentious, and gracious hostess even during the 
impeachment crisis.
<p>
At the end of Johnson's term, Eliza returned with relief to her home in 
Tennessee, restored from wartime vandalism.  She lived to see the 
legislature of her state vindicate her husband's career by electing him 
to the Senate in 1875, and survived him by nearly six months, dying at 
the Pattersons' home in 1876.
