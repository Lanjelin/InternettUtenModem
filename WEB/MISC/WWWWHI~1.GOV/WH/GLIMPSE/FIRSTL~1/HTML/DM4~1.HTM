<b>Biography:</b>  For half a century she was the most important woman in 
the social circles of America.  To this day she remains one of the best known and best loved 
ladies of the White House--though often referred to, mistakenly, as 
Dorothy or Dorothea.
<p>
She always called herself Dolley, and by that name the New Garden Monthly 
Meeting of the Society of Friends, in Piedmont, North Carolina, recorded 
her birth to John and Mary Coles Payne, settlers from Virginia.  In 1769 
John Payne took his family back to his home colony, and in 1783 he moved 
them to Philadelphia, city of the Quakers.  Dolley grew up in the strict 
discipline of the Society, but nothing muted her happy personality and 
her warm heart.
<p>
John Todd, Jr., a lawyer, exchanged marriage vows with Dolley in 1790.  
Just three years later he died in a yellow-fever epidemic, leaving his 
wife with a small son. 
<p>
By this time Philadelphia had become the capital city.  With her charm 
and her laughing blue eyes, fair skin, and black curls, the young widow 
attracted distinguished attention.  Before long Dolley was reporting to 
her best friend that "the great little Madison has asked...to see me this 
evening."
<p>
Although Representative James Madison of Virginia was 17 years her 
senior, and Episcopalian in background, they were married in September 
1794.  The marriage, though childless, was notably happy; "our hearts 
understand each other," she assured him.  He could even be patient with 
Dolley's son, Payne, who mishandled his own affairs--and, eventually, 
mismanaged Madison's estate.
<p>
Discarding the somber Quaker dress after her second marriage, Dolley 
chose the finest of fashions.  Margaret Bayard Smith, chronicler of early 
Washington social life, wrote: "She looked a Queen...It would be 
<i>absolutely impossible</i> for any one to behave with more perfect 
propriety than she did."
<p>
Blessed with a desire to please and a willingness to be pleased, Dolley 
made her home the center of society when Madison began, in 1801, his eight 
years as Jefferson's Secretary of State.  She assisted at the White House 
when the President asked her help in receiving ladies, and presided at 
the first inaugural ball in Washington when her husband became Chief 
Executive in 1809.
<p>
Dolley's social graces made her famous.  Her political acumen, prized by 
her husband, is less renowned, though her gracious tact smoothed many a 
quarrel.  Hostile statesmen, difficult envoys from Spain or Tunisia, 
warrior chiefs from the west, flustered youngsters--she always welcomed 
everyone.  Forced to flee from the White House by a British army during 
the War of 1812, she returned to find the mansion in ruins.  Undaunted by 
temporary quarters, she entertained as skillfully as ever.
<p>
At their plantation Montpelier in Virginia, the Madisons lived in 
pleasant retirement until he died in 1836.  She returned to the capital 
in the autumn of 1837, and friends found tactful ways to supplement her 
diminished income.  She remained in Washington until her death in 1849, 
honored and loved by all.  The delightful personality of this unusual 
woman is a cherished part of her country's history.
