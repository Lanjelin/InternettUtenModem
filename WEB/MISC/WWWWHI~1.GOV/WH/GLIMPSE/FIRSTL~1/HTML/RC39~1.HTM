<b>Biography:</b>  "She's the girl I want to marry," Jimmy Carter told his 
mother after his first date with 17-year-old Rosalynn Smith, who had 
grown up as a friend and neighbor of the Carter family in Plains, Georgia.
<p>
Born in Plains on August 18, 1927, Rosalynn was the first of four 
children in the family of Allethea Murray Smith and Wilburn Edgar Smith.  
She grew up in a small-town atmosphere that nurtured strong ties to 
family and dedication to church and community.  When she was 13, her 
father died and her mother became a dressmaker to help support the 
family.  As the oldest child, Rosalynn worked beside her mother, helping 
with the sewing, the housekeeping, and the other children.
<p>
Times were difficult, but Rosalynn completed high school and enrolled in 
Georgia Southwestern College at Americus.  In 1945, after her freshman 
year, she first dated Jimmy Carter, who was home from the U.S. Naval 
Academy at Annapolis.  Their romance progressed, and in 1946 they were 
married.
<p>
The young couple went to Norfolk, Virginia, Ensign Carter's first duty 
station after graduation.  The Navy kept them on the move.  Their sons 
were born in different places:  John William in Virginia, James Earl III 
in Hawaii, and Donnel Jeffrey in Connecticut.  The Carters' only 
daughter, Amy Lynn, was born in Georgia in 1967.
<p>
When his father died in 1953, Jimmy left the service, and the Carters 
returned to Plains to run the family business.  Managing the accounts of 
the peanut, fertilizer, and seed enterprise, Rosalynn soon found herself 
working full-time.
<p>
Jimmy entered politics in 1962, winning a seat in the Georgia Senate.  
Rosalynn, an important member of his campaign team, helped develop 
support for her husband's successful bid for the governorship of Georgia 
in 1970.  During his Presidential campaigns, Rosalynn traveled 
independently throughout the United States.  Her belief in her husband's 
ability to lead the nation was communicated in a quiet, friendly manner 
that made her an effective campaigner.
<p>
A skillful speaker and a hardworking First Lady, Mrs. Carter managed 
routine duties and special projects in her office in the East Wing.  She 
attended Cabinet meetings and major briefings, frequently represented the 
Chief Executive at ceremonial occasions, and served as the President's 
personal emissary to Latin American countries.
<p>
As First Lady, she focused national attention on the performing arts.  
She invited to the White House leading classical artists from around the 
world, as well as traditional American artists.  She also took a strong 
interest in programs to aid mental health, the community, and the 
elderly.  From 1977 to 1978, she served as the Honorary Chairperson of the 
President's Commission on Mental Health.
<p>
After returning home, Mrs. Carter wrote her autobiography, <i>First Lady 
From Plains</i>, published in 1984.  She is currently vice chair of The

Center</a> in Atlanta, founded in 1982 to promote peace and human 
rights worldwide. At the Center, she leads a program to diminish stigma 
against mental illness and to promote greater access to mental health 
care. She also is a partner with the ex-president in projects to resolve 
conflict, promote human rights, improve global health, and build 
democracy in some 65 countries.
