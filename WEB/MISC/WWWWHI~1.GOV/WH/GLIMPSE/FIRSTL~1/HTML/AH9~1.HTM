<b>Biography:</b>  Anna Harrison was too ill to travel when her husband 
set out from Ohio in 1841 for his inauguration.  It was a long trip and a difficult one 
even by steamboat and railroad, with February weather uncertain at best, 
and she at age 65 was well acquainted with the rigors of frontier journeys.
<p>
As a girl of 19, bringing pretty clothes and dainty manners, she went out 
to Ohio with her father, Judge John Cleves Symmes, who had taken up land 
for settlement on the "north bend" of the Ohio River. She had grown up a 
young lady of the East, completing her education at a boarding school in 
New York City.
<p>
A clandestine marriage on November 25, 1795, united Anna Symmes and Lt. 
William Henry Harrison, an experienced soldier at 22.  Though the young 
man came from one of the best families of Virginia, Judge Symmes did not 
want his daughter to face the hard life of frontier forts; but eventualy, 
seeing her happiness, he accepted her choice.
<p>
Though Harrison won fame as an Indian fighter and hero of the War of 
1812, he spent much of his life in a civilian career.  His service in 
Congress as territorial delegate from Ohio gave Anna and their two 
children a chance to visit his family at Berkeley, their plantation on 
the James River.  Her third child was born on that trip, at Richmond in 
September 1800.  Harrison's appointment as governor of Indiana Territory 
took them even farther into the wilderness; he built a handsome house at 
Vincennes that blended fortress and plantation mansion.  Five more 
children were born to Anna.
<p>
Facing war in 1812, the family went to the farm at North Bend.  Before 
peace was assured, she had borne two more children.  There, at news of 
her husband's landslide electoral victory in 1840, home-loving Anna said 
simply: "I wish that my husband's friends had left him where he is, happy 
and contented in retirement."
<p>
When she decided not to go to Washington with him, the President-elect 
asked his daughter-in-law Jane Irwin Harrison, widow of his namesake son, 
to accompany him and act as hostess until Anna's proposed arrival in 
May.  Half a dozen other relatives happily went with them.  On April 4, 
exactly one month after his inauguration, he died, so Anna never made the 
journey.  She had already begun her packing when she learned of her loss.
<p>
Accepting grief with admirable dignity, she stayed at her home in North 
Bend until the house burned in 1858; she lived nearby with her last 
surviving child, John Scott Harrison, until she died in February 1864 at 
the age of 88.
