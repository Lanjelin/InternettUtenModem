<h2><i>Preface to the Collection</i></h2>
<br clear=all>
<p> 
Pride of the American nation, the White House
collection of fine arts owes its existence to 
the scores of individuals and organizations 
that have nurtured and supported it.  They have 
been diverse in outlook, taste and purpose, but 
their vision and generosity have given 
coherence to the collection as a whole.</p>
<p> 
All the <a 
href="../../PRESID~1/HTML/PRESID~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/presidents.html">
Presidents</a> and <a 
href="../../FIRSTL~1/HTML/FIRSTL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/firstladies.html">
First Ladies</a>, including even the Washingtons, 
though they never occupied the <a 
href="../../TOUR/HTML/INDEX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/tour/html/index.html">
Executive Mansion</a>, have in one way or another made significant 
contributions. <br>

Stuart's idealized portrait of 
the first President (at right), cornerstone of the collection, both 
inspires us and evokes calm assurance of national community.</p>
<p>
First Ladies of recent decades deserve great credit for much of the 
art featured in this collection on-line.  <a 
href="../../FIRSTL~1/HTML/JK35~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/jk35.html">
Jacqueline Kennedy</a> set the goal of collecting works by the country's 
finest artists.  <a 
href="../../FIRSTL~1/HTML/CJ36~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/cj36.html">
Lady Bird Johnson</a> enthusiastically continued that pursuit.  <a 
href="../../FIRSTL~1/HTML/PN37~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/pn37.html">
Patricia Nixon's</a> efforts added 18 portraits to Presidents and First 
Ladies.</p>
<p> 
<a href="../../FIRSTL~1/HTML/EF38~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/ef38.html">
Elizabeth Ford</a>, <a href="../../FIRSTL~1/HTML/RC39~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/rc39.html">
Rosalynn Carter</a>, <a href="../../FIRSTL~1/HTML/NR40~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/nr40.html">
Nancy Reagan</a>, and <a href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5597" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/bb41.html">
Barbara Bush</a> also have taken a special interest in the history of the 
mansion.  And First Lady <a href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS56.HTM#5648" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/hc42.html">
Hillary Clinton</a> has also made substantial contributions of time and 
energy to the promotion of art in the White House. In fact, the White House 
has hosted two exhibitions of twentieth century American sculpture in her term thus far.<a 
href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS56.HTM#5650" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/art/html/sculpture.html">  One of those exhibitions</a> is 
available on-line. Each recent First Lady has worked 
tirelessly to encourage contributions of funds and gifts of art.</p>
<p>
They, and the collection itself, have been immeasurably helped by former 
curators of the White House--Lorraine Pearce, William Elder, James Ketchum,
and Clement Conger--and by the present associate curator, Betty Monkman, 
and other members of the curatorial staff.  From the care of the White 
House paintings to the authentication of new acquisitions, these experts 
have implemented professional standards worthy of the best museums.</p>
<p>
Exceptional contributions of time, knowledge, and personal resources on 
the collection's behalf have come from three men: the late James W. 
Fosburgh, an original member of Mrs. Kennedy's Fine Arts Committee for 
the White House; Robert L McNeill, Jr., a longtime member of the 
Committee for the Preservation of the White House; and the late Dr. 
Melvin Payne, Chairman of the Board of the National Geographic Society, 
which cooperated with the White House Historical Association in the 
publication of the book upon which this on-line collection is based and 
other books about the presidential residence. The Association, chartered 
in 1961, has been a major benefactor, making possible the acquisition of 
dozens of works of art.  Today it continues to "enhance understanding, 
appreciation and enjoyment of the Executive Mansion".</p>
