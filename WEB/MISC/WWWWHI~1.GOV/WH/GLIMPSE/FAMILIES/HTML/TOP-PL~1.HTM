<h1><i>The First Family at Home</i></h1>
<h2>First Families Throughout the Centuries</h2>
</center>
<hr>
In spite of all the aids, comforts, and privileges that come to a 
President and his family, homemaking in a house that is also a national 
monument has its drawbacks. When <a 
href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5530" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/cc30-plain.html">President Coolidge</a> 
arrived at the White House in 1923, he tried to continue his pleasant 
after-dinner habit of sitting on his front porch--the great North 
Portico--and watching the people go by on Pennsylvania Avenue.  So many 
pedestrians stopped to stare at him, however, that he gave up his modest 
form of relaxation.  President Coolidge, too, once invited a Missouri 
Senator friend to accompany him on an evening walk outside the grounds.  As 
they returned to the mansion, the Senator remarked facetiously, "I 
wonder who lives there."  "Nobody," replied the President.  "They just 
come and go."
<p>
Though Chief Executives have moved in and out with regularity, 
the White House has always been a place of extremely personal living.  
Indeed, the attention commanded by the Presidency intensifies and 
exaggerates the normal joys and sorrows of everyday family experience, 
the high moments of birth and death that are part of life here as in any 
other home.  One of the most endearing aspects of life at the Executive 
Mansion can be glimpsed from the hundreds of stories that have come down 
through the years about the many children who have lived there.
<p>
The very young ones were usually grandchildren, since few men have 
reached the top rung of the political ladder in their early years.  And the 
first of all children whose shouts and laughter echoed through the 
mansion was 4-year-old granddaughter of <a 
href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5524" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/ja2-plain.html">John</a> and <a 
href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5532" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/aa2-plain.html">Abigail Adams</a>.  
<a href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5525" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/tj3-plain.html">Jefferson</a>'s eight 
years in the presidency were cheered and brightened by 
the many visits of his married daughters, Martha Randolph and Maria 
Eppes.  On one of the visits, in the winter of 1805, Mrs. Randolph gave 
birth to her eighth child--James Madison Randolph--the first baby born in 
the Executive Mansion.
<p>
The most photographed Presidential grandchild of the 19th century must 
have been "Baby McKee," who lived in the White House with grandfather 
<a href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5536" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/bh23-plain.html">Benjamin Harrison</a> 
and his four-generation family during the early 
1890's.  Little Benjamin was often photographed as he drove his own goat 
cart about the grounds.  The goat once ran away with Baby McKee.  As the 
goat darted off with the boy and raced down the White House driveway onto 
Pennsylvania Avenue, the portly President himself, dressed in top hat and 
frock coat, followed in hot pursuit.
<p>
<a href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5538" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/al16-plain.html">President Lincoln</a> 
and <a 
href="../../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS55.HTM#5541" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/firstladies/html/ml16-plain.html">Mary Lincoln</a> were 
loving and indulgent parents who often
said, "Let the children have a good time."  This the children did, and 
the President's friends and colleagues quite probably felt at times he 
was too permissive when he failed to punish Tad for bombarding the door 
with his toy cannon during a Cabinet meeting, or when the boy stopped his 
father's callers to sell refreshments and wheedle money for war charities 
at stands he set up at the mansion.
