<b>When <a href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs55.htm#5525" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/glimpse/presidents/html/tj3-plain.html">Thomas 
Jefferson</a> was President, from 1801 to 1809, our government 
bought the Louisiana Territory.  The Louisiana Purchase made the United 
States twice as big as it had been!  President Jefferson believed 
strongly in democracy and equality.  He felt that people should not bow 
to the President, so he shook hands with everyone he met.
