<H3>REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN ANNOUNCEMENT TO LAUNCH THE COALITION FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN</h3>
<h3>The East Room</H3></CENTER>
<p>		
             THE PRESIDENT:  I want to thank all those who have been 
a part of this.  Alex Kroll, thank you for what you said and for 
reminding us that we're about the business of helping parents, not 
disrespecting the difficulties they face.  Christine Benero, thank 
you.  Eva Kasten, the Executive Vice President of the Advertising 
Council, thank you.  I thank the Benton Foundation, the AT&T 
Foundation, the Packard Foundation.
<p>
             I'd like to thank the people in our administration 
probably most directly involved in helping our children who are here 
today -- Secretary Riley, Secretary Shalala, and Harris Wofford, the 
head of the Corporation for National Service.  
<p>
             But most of all, I want to thank Bradley Pine and Lonzo 
Warren for coming here to share their story.  Their relationship is a 
powerful example of what could be done all over America if we move 
from vague rhetoric to specific action directed at helping and 
supporting all of our children.  
<p>
             Just think of what would happen in this country if every 
single child who needed a mentor had one.  Think of what would happen 
if every person out there who is willing to volunteer to help knew 
where to go and how to do it.  The public service message we just saw 
that Hillary and I were honored to participate in is simply designed 
to remind every American that there are children out there who need 
our support, and to tell every American who wants to serve that there 
is a way to serve and we will help you do it.
<p>
             We know that being a parent is the most difficult and 
important job in the world.  And we know that everyone has to help.  
Hillary has been working on these children's issues since before I 
met her, a long time ago now, and I think that the book that she 
wrote did capture the image of the village raising our children.  But 
it should not be allowed to obscure the fact that what that really 
means is that each and every one of us has a personal responsibility 
to do our part.  And also, thanks to this effort, it will be easier 
for people to understand how to exercise that responsibility.
<p>
             I'm especially fond of the work that we have done in 
this regard.  We've done all we could to encourage citizen service.  
We now have more than 50,000 young people working in AmeriCorps, 
earning money to go to college.  Many, many of them are helping our 
children in supportive ways. 
<p>
             Last summer, we launched our America Reads program to 
try to mobilize one million volunteer tutors in America to make sure 
that by the year 2000 every single 8-year-old in this country can 
read independently and will have a chance to make the most of his or 
her education.  Today, I am pleased to announce that Scholastic Books 
is donating one million books to help us reach that goal.  We need 
more companies like Scholastic Books to give more Americans the 
opportunity to serve.
<p>
             In January, I was proud to stand right here with 
President Bush and General Colin Powell and former Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros to announce that we are 
convening the first ever President's Summit of Service in April in 
Philadelphia, to bring together business, religious, community 
leaders committed to support citizen service with resources and 
volunteers.  With their help, I hope we can make the plea we make in 
this public service announcement a reality for tens of thousands of 
more people in the United States. 
<p>
             This public service announcement is just what it seems 
to be.  It seeks to help in mobilizing a volunteer force of 
Americans.  It reflects the wisdom that no impersonal bureaucracy can 
ever replace the magic that we saw here between Bradley and Lonzo, or 
the feeling that Lonzo expressed for his own family, who are here 
with him today.  What we can do is to make it possible for more 
things like that to happen, and to give our children the basic 
supports they need to make it happen.  But in the end, we must make 
this vast, big, complicated society of ours more of a society in 
which we all feel that we should volunteer and, like Bradley, we know 
we're going to be better off for doing it; we'll get more out of it 
than we give.  We have to create the networks to facilitate that kind 
of volunteerism.
<p>
             The public service announcement, as you saw, gives 
people a number to call, a web site to visit, to learn about 
organizations in their very own communities where they can volunteer 
their time --to become a reading tutor or a math coach, or a mentor 
to a child in need.  Beginning today, anyone visiting the White House 
home page on the Internet will be able to connect to the coalition's 
web site with just a click of the mouse, and find out what they can 
do to help.  
<p>
             The more people this message reaches, the more children 
will be helped.  So far, some of our biggest television, cable and 
radio networks have committed to air this message during times when 
it will have the best chance of inspiring the largest number of 
people.  Newsweek, The New York Times and People Magazine will also 
run the message in their pages.  And movie-goers will see it in 
theatres all over the country, thanks to promotion slide and cinema 
advertisers.  This is a very good start.
<p>
             But let me encourage other media organizations around 
the country to help to make sure this message is heard by as many 
people as possible -- to help to work with us to encourage the spirit 
of service in America, to strengthen our families, to improve the 
lives of our children one at a time.  
<p>
             Whenever you think about what else we can do, just think 
of Bradley and Lonzo and multiply it by millions, and imagine the 
America we can make together.  Thank you.  God bless you.  
(Applause.)
