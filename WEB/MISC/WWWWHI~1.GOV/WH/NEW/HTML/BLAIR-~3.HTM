Introduction by Vice President Al Gore</h3>

In 1993, President Clinton asked me to figure out how to make government 
work better and cost less.  We called it reinventing government.  The 
need to reinvent was clear.  Confidence in government -- which is simply 
confidence in our own ability to solve problems by working together -- 
had been plummeting for three decades.  We either had to rebuild that 
faith or abandon the future to chaos.
<p>
We had reason to hope we could succeed.  Corporate America had reinvented 
itself to compete and win.  The same ideas and some new wrinkles were 
starting to work at the state and local level.  But it was going to be 
incredibly difficult, the largest turnaround ever, and management experts 
said it would take at least eight years.
<p>
Not quite four years later, my hope of succeeding has grown to 
confidence.  We have thousands of examples of reinvention  islands of 
excellence in every agency  delivering better service and saving money.  
And public confidence in government has rebounded  up nearly 9 percent 
since 1993, according to a recent Roper poll.  We are succeeding. We know 
how to do it.  
<p>
Everyone in government knows big challenges remain.  It is time for 
faster, bolder action to expand our islands of excellence and reinvent 
entire agencies -- time to entirely reinvent every department of government.
<p>
So, even before the second inauguration, President Clinton and I called 
the new <a href="../../CABINET/HTML/CABINE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/Cabinet/html/cabinet_links.html">Cabinet</a> to Blair 
House to give them their reinvention marching orders.  This <a 
href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs44.htm#4454" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cgi-bin/good-bye.cgi?url=http://www.npr.gov">book</a> 
contains the instructions we 
gave the Cabinet in a set of papers on that Saturday, January 11, 1997.
<p>
The papers are:<br>
<br>
<b>practical</b> -- there is not much about paradigm
	shift theories and such<br>
<br>
<b>written as rules</b> --  we left out the things we were
	unsure of<br>
<br>
<b>focused on the highest impact rules for
	reinvention success</b><br>
<br>
<b>golden</b> --  built on the experiences of the brightest, 			
most creative, heroic people in public service so far.<br>
<p>
The book divides our papers into three chapters.  The first chapter is 
about how to <b>deliver great service</b> --  treating the public the way 
top companies treat their customers.  Remember, we are trying to restore 
America's confidence in solving big problems through self-government, 
problems like drugs and crime and the need for better education.  How can 
people trust government to do big things if we can't do little things 
like answer the phone promptly and politely?
<p>
The second chapter tells how to <b>foster partnership and community 
solutions</b>.  We have to do big things without big government.  Luckily, 
partners are ready to help.  Businesses have proven effective partners in 
achieving a cleaner environment, worker safety, and other regulatory 
compliance goals.  Communities can solve their own problems with a little 
help and opportunity from their federal partners.  And when labor and 
management work as partners, everybody wins.
<p>
The last chapter is about how to <b>reinvent to get the job done with 
less.</b>  
The first section there is the most important for top leaders.  It 
describes the key to unlocking the enormous, unused, human potential of 
the federal workforce.  Unlocking that potential will make everything 
else possible -- it is the only way.  The chapter has other tips for 
surviving in a balanced budget world -- like shifting resources and 
authority from headquarters to the front lines, and capitalizing on the 
positive power of competition.
<p>
When the President and I gave the papers in this book to Cabinet 
Secretaries, we also asked each of them to set clear, uplifting goals and 
make sure everyone understands how the goals relate to their own jobs.  
We asked the Cabinet to line up their plans, budgets, personnel 
performance appraisals, and other management systems with their goals, 
and then to measure the results they seek.  This is good advice for the 
Cabinet and for every leader in government.
<p>
Indeed, if you work anywhere in government, there is something in these 
papers for you.  Every supervisor needs to get power to the front lines 
and raise the spirit of the workforce.  Every service provider needs to 
put customers first.  Every regulator needs to use the leverage available 
through partnerships.  Everyone in government needs to know all the rules 
of the road to reinvention, because we need everyone's push to propel us 
down that road fast enough.
<P>
I told the Cabinet at Blair House that they would know they had succeeded 
with reinvention when all the people in their departments understood the 
goals and values of the organization, and could use them to adjust 
quickly to changing circumstances.  I also said how federal employees 
would recognize success:  When they wake up in the middle of the night 
and can't get back to sleep right away, they will be thinking about how 
to do their jobs better.
<P>
Where reinvention has taken hold federal employees do that.  Their faith 
in the system has been restored.  Applied to every part of government, 
these ideas can do the same for America.
<p>
Not long ago, most Americans believed that we could do practically 
anything by working together -- defeat communism, go to the moon, you name 
it.  We can have that faith in unity again.  We can have the strength of 
unity again.  We need it for the 21st Century.
