<center><h3>WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS "BRIEFING ROOMS"<br>
Gives Americans Easy Access to Federal Statistics</h3></center>
<hr> 
 The White House unveiled today the <a href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs40.htm#4018" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/fsbr">Federal Statistics Briefing 
 Rooms</a>, making Federal statistics much more 
 accessible to average Americans through the White House Home Page 
 on the Internet.
<p>
 "This service will give Americans quick, easy access to key 
 current economic and social statistics," Office of 
 Management and Budget (OMB) Director Alice M. Rivlin said at a 
 morning news briefing, where she was joined 
 by Sally Katzen, Administrator of OMB's Office of Information and 
 Regulatory Affairs, and the heads of various 
 statistical agencies.  "It is a prime example of Federal agencies 
 working together to improve service for their 
 customers."<p>
 The briefing rooms, at <a href="../../../../tppmsgs/msgs40.htm#4018" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/fsbr">http://www.whitehouse.gov/fsbr</a> , include two 
 rooms -- the Economic Statistics Briefing 
 Room and the Social Statistics Briefing Room.  They present 
 current releases of selected economic and social 
 indicators organized not by agency, but themes -- e.g., Output, 
 Income, Employment, Production, Money, Prices, 
 Transportation, International Statistics, Demographics, Education, 
 Health, and Crime.<p>

 Each theme includes key data series on a single World Wide Web 
 (WWW) page that, in turn, provides hyperlinks 
 to WWW pages at the source agencies' Web sites.  Included in each 
 theme are the most current release, graphic 
 displays of the series over time, brief phrases highlighting the 
 trends or noteworthy aspects of the current release, 
 and the name of the agency that produced the statistic.
  <p>

 "Now we have, for the first time, the beginnings of `one-stop 
 shopping' for Federal statistics," Katzen said.  "We 
 also have established links to the agencies that generate the 
 statistics so that those who wish can explore in depth at 
 the source." <p>
 
In the past, the decentralized structure of the Federal 
 Government's statistical system sometimes made it hard for 
 Americans -- even frequent data users, such as economic 
 forecasters or social science researchers -- to locate and 
 access the information of particular interest to them.
<p> 
In the last three years, however, many statistical agencies have 
 made great progress in developing easy access to 
 their own data and databases through the Internet, and in 
 particular, the World Wide Web.  Data users accessing 
 information from one Federal agency may even find out about 
 related statistics available from another agency, 
 thanks to cross-agency links that some agencies are providing.
<p> 
Now, the Economic Statistics and Social Statistics Briefing Rooms 
 will further ease and speed access to the 
 Nation's  information resources.  They were developed by OMB's 
 Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, with 
 technical coordination and development from the Office of Science 
 and Technology Policy and the Office of 
 Administration.
