<H3>RADIO ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE NATION</h3>
<h3>Office of the President</h3>
</center>
<p>
 THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  This week we learned that 
America's economy continues to grow, steady and strong, creating 
almost 600,000 new jobs in the first two months of this year alone, 
and about 12 million in the last four years.  We can make this time 
one of enormous promise for America, but only if we make sure that 
all Americans who are willing to work for it  have the chance to reap 
the rewards of our prosperity. 
<p>
This morning I want to talk to you about what we can do 
to lift the permanent underclass into a thriving and growing middle 
class; and to announce new steps the national government will take to 
move people from welfare to work.
<P>
             Four years ago, when I became President, I pledged to 
end welfare was we know it.  We worked with states to launch welfare 
reform experiments to require work.  We cracked down on child support 
enforcement, increasing child support payments by 50 percent.  We 
required teen mothers to stay in school and live at home if they 
wanted to receive welfare.  Today, I'm pleased to report that due to 
these efforts and our growing economy we've already moved 2.6 million 
people off the welfare rolls -- a record number.
<P>
             Last summer, we took the most dramatic step of all when 
I signed the bipartisan welfare reform legislation that imposed time 
limits, required work and extended child care and health care so that  
people can move from welfare to work without hurting their children.  
The new law ended the old welfare system when we said to those on 
welfare:  responsibility is not an option, it must be a way of life.
<P>
             Now, all the rest of us have our responsibility, indeed, 
our moral obligation, to make welfare reform work, to make sure that 
those who now must work, can work.  We must move another 2 million 
more people off the welfare rolls in the next four years.  And, 
frankly, we must recognize that many of these people will be harder 
to reach and will need more help than those who moved off the rolls 
in the past four years.
<P>
             This cause must engage the energy and the commitment of 
everyone in our society -- of business, houses of worship, labor 
unions, universities, civic organizations, as well as government at 
every level.  Above all, we must harness the private sector to bring 
jobs and hope to our hardest-pressed neighborhoods.  We are working 
with leaders of American business to help mobilize other businesses 
to hire people off welfare.  My balanced budget plan would give 
businesses tax incentives to hire people and would give job placement 
firms a bonus for every person they place from welfare into a job.  
<P>
             States can do more, too.  I have called upon every state 
to use the power that has now been given to them under the new 
welfare law, to turn welfare checks into private sector paychecks.  
And the national government must do its part and set an example.  Our 
national government is now the smallest it has been in three decades 
-- but it is still the nation's largest employer.  We must do our 
part.  So today I am committing a national government action plan to 
hire people off welfare.
<p>
             I am formally directing the heads of each agency and 
department of our federal government to do everything they can to 
hire people off the welfare rolls into available jobs in government, 
consistent with the laws already on the books for hiring federal 
workers.  Because this effort is so important, I am asking Vice 
President Gore, who has led our reinventing government effort and 
done so much to make our government work better as it costs less, to 
oversee this endeavor.
<p>
             I want these agencies to use the Worker-Trainee program, 
which the government already has in place, to train workers quickly 
and move them into entry-level jobs.  Then if the people do well for 
three years, they can join the civil service.  And I am asking every 
member of my Cabinet to prepare a detailed plan for hiring welfare 
recipients -- what jobs they will fill, how they will recruit welfare 
recipients, how they will make sure these people have the chance to 
work hard, perform well and, thereby, deserve to keep their jobs.  
The members of the Cabinet will present these plans to me in one 
month at a special Cabinet meeting.
<P>
             The job of moving people from welfare to work as the law 
requires will not be easy.  But we must help them as they help 
themselves.  And we need to help all low income government workers.  
We need to make sure they take advantage of the Earned Income Tax 
Credit, the tax cut that already has helped 15 million of our hardest 
pressed working families.  We should give these workers help with 
transportation to work, and we must help them to find affordable 
child care.
<P>
             Government can help to move people from welfare to work 
by acting the way we want all employers to act -- demanding high 
performance from workers, but going the extra mile to offer 
opportunity to those who have been on welfare and want to do 
something more with their lives.  If we all do that we can, we can 
move into the 21st century strong, united and with the America Dream 
alive for all our people.  
<p>
 Thanks for listening
<P>
             END
