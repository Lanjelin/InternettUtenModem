<i>As the President said on August 22, 1996, the signing of the
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996
should "be remembered not for what it ended but for what it began: a new
day that offers hope, honors responsibility, rewards work, and changes
the terms of the debate." <a

(Remarks at the Signing Ceremony)</a>.
<p>
The implementation of this bill is critical to ensuring the President's 
vision
is fulfilled. This page has been designed to assist the public in 
understanding
the law and provide access to available federal information.<p></i>
