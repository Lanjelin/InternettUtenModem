<i>As the President said on August 22, 1996, the signing of the
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996
should "be remembered not for what it ended but for what it began: a new
day that offers hope, honors responsibility, rewards work, and changes
the terms of the debate." <a
