<p>

OMB's predominant mission is to assist the President in overseeing the
preparation of the Federal budget and to supervise its administration in
Executive Branch agencies.  In helping to formulate the President's
spending plans, OMB evaluates the effectiveness of agency programs,
policies, and procedures, assesses competing funding demands among agencies,
and sets funding priorities.  OMB ensures that agency reports, rules,
testimony, and proposed legislation are consistent with the President's budget
and with Administration policies.  
<p>
In addition, OMB oversees and coordinates the Administration's procurement, 
financial management, information, and regulatory policies.  In each of 
these areas, OMB's role is to help improve administrative management, to
develop better performance measures and coordinating mechanisms, and to reduce
any unnecessary burdens on the public.
