<a name=intro><h3>Introduction</h3></a>

<p>The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) provides 
advice to the President concerning the quality and adequacy of 
intelligence collection, of analysis and estimates, of 
counterintelligence, and of other intelligence activities.  The PFIAB, 
through its <a href="../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS58.HTM#5896" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/pfiab/eo12863.html#iob">Intelligence Oversight Board</a>, 
also advises the President on the legality of foreign intelligence 
activities.</p>

<p>Operating under <a href="../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS58.HTM#5896" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/pfiab/eo12863.html">Executive Order 12863</a> signed 
by President Clinton on September 13, 1993, the PFIAB currently has 
eleven members selected from among distinguished citizens outside the 
government who are qualified on the basis of achievement, experience and 
independence.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS58.HTM#5899" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/pfiab/boardmembers.html#rudman">Warren Rudman</a>, the vice chairman, 
currently heads the board.</p>

<a name=role><h3>The Role of The Board</h3></a>

<p>Unique within the government, the PFIAB has traditionally been tasked 
with providing the President with an independent source of advice on the 
effectiveness with which the intelligence community is meeting the 
nation's intelligence needs and the vigor and insight with which the 
community plans for the future.</p>

<hr>

<a name=history><h3>The History Of The Board</h3></a>

<p>The Board was established in 1956 by President Eisenhower and was 
originally called the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign 
Intelligence Activities.  It gained its current name under President 
Kennedy and it has served all Presidents since that time except for 
President Carter.  <a href="../../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS59.HTM#5902" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/pfiab/chairpersons.html">A record of previous 
chairpersons</a> is available.</a></p>

<p>For nearly four decades the PFIAB has acted as a nonpartisan body 
offering the President objective, expert advice on the conduct of U.S. 
foreign intelligence.  This role reflects the vital assistance that 
intelligence provides the President in meeting his executive 
responsibilities.  The President must have ample, accurate and timely 
intelligence; and most recent Presidents have sought the assistance of a 
separate, unbiased group -- the PFIAB -- to advise them on intelligence 
matters.</p>

<hr>

<a name=operations><h3>PFIAB Operations</h3></a>

<p>Through meetings with intelligence principals, substantive briefings, 
and visits to intelligence installations, the PFIAB seeks to identify 
deficiencies in the collection, analysis, and reporting of intelligence; 
to eliminate unnecessary duplication and functional overlap; and to 
ensure that major programs are responsive to clearly perceived needs and 
that the technology employed represents the product of the best minds and 
technical capabilities available in the nation.</p>

<hr>

<a name=product><h3>PFIAB Product</h3></a>

<p>Independent of the intelligence community and free from any day-to-day 
management or operational responsibilities, the PFIAB is able to render 
advice which reflects an objective view of the kinds of intelligence that 
will best serve the country and the organizational structure most likely 
to achieve this goal.  The effect of the Board's recommendations over the 
years has been to influence the composition and structure of the 
intelligence community, the development of major intelligence systems, 
and the degree of collection and analytic emphasis that is given to 
substantive areas.</p>

<p>In carrying out their mandate, the members of the PFIAB enjoy the 
confidence of the President and have access to all the information 
related to foreign intelligence that they need to fulfill their vital 
advisory role.</p> <P>
