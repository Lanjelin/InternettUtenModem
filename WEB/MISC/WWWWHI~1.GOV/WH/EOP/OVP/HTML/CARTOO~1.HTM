Over the years, Al Gore's caricature has appeared in numerous local
and national cartoon strips.  Vice President Al Gore has amassed a
large personal collection of cartoons characterizing his public life.
Below are a few examples from his personal collection.<P>

This cartoon features a stiff and wooden Vice President Al Gore.  The
Vice President often mocks characterizations of himself as stiff and
wooden.  Many of his public appearances start off with such
self-effacing jokes as: "The doctors said I have to wear this new cast
for about five months... and the old full body cast for several more
years," or "Al Gore is so boring that his secret service code name is
Al Gore."  (Reproduced with the permission of Mark Alan Stamaty)

This cartoon depicts a NEW Al Gore as the character from the movie
Terminator 2.  As a member of the United States Senate, Al Gore's
early and steadfast leadership has influenced American policy in such
areas as the environment, science, space, technology and foreign
affairs.  (Reproduced with the permission of Jack Ohman)
