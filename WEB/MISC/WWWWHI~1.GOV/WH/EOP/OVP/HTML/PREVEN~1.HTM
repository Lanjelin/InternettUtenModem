as Chair of the Act's Crime Prevention Council.  He also designated Carol
Rasco, Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, as Vice Chair of the
Council.  Other members of the Council include the Attorney General, the
Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the
Secretary of housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the
Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Interior,
the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, and the Director of the
Office of management and Budget.<p>

	The mandate of the Council is to coordinate, integrate, and streamline the
various crime prevention programs throughout the Executive branch as well as to
further the development of additional effective approaches to crime prevention.
Specifically, the Act requires the Council to coordinate crime prevention
planning; create a comprehensive crime prevention program catalogue; assist
communities and community based organizations seeking information and grant
simplification.  The Council is also authorized to make grants for summer and
after-school educational recreational programs; mentoring and tutoring
