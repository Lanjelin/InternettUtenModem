<P> Gore's Congressional career began when he was elected to the
U.S. House of Representatives in 1976 where he served eight years
representing the then 4th District of Tennessee. He was elected to the
U.S. Senate in 1984 and was re-elected in 1990, becoming the first
candidate in modern history -- Republican or Democratic -- to win all 95
of Tennessee's counties. A candidate for the Democratic nomination for
President in 1988, Gore won more than three million votes and
Democratic contests in seven states.

<P> Gore was born on March 31, 1948, and is the son of former
U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr. and Pauline Gore. Raised in Carthage,
Tennessee, and Washington, D.C., he received a degree in government
with honors from Harvard University in 1969. After graduation, he
volunteered for enlistment in the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam.
