A Chicago native, Mrs. Clinton and her two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony,
grew up in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois as a close-knit family.  Here,

ALT="[PHOTO: Rodham Family Portrait]"></A> she is pictured with her 
father Hugh, her mother Dorothy, and brother
Hugh, Jr.  Throughout her childhood, the foundations of her lasting
commitment to family, work and service were established.  It is this
commitment and the belief that we "all have an obligation to give
something of ourselves to our community," that has helped to shape her
role as our nation's First Lady.
<P>
As a young student, Mrs. Clinton organized food drives, served in
student government, and was a member of the National Honor Society.
She was a member of the local Methodist youth group, and she was also
a Girl Scout. As First Lady, she currently serves as honorary
President of the Girl Scouts of America.  Here,

Upon taking office, President Clinton made health care reform one of
the highest priorities of his Administration.  In 1993, he asked
the First Lady to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform.
During the next 19 months, Mrs. Clinton travelled across the country
talking to doctors, nurses, health care professionals and people from
all walks of life

about ways to improve the current health care system and how best to  
ensure that every American has the right to quality, affordable health
care.  Here,
Mrs. Clinton speaks at a health care rally at the University of
Colorado.

<P>
When the Clintons arrived in Washington, D.C., Mrs. Clinton felt that she
had not only public responsibilities as First Lady, but also the
important private responsibility to make the historic, and formal,
White House a true home for her husband and their daughter Chelsea

height="64" width="93" ALT="[PHOTO: President and Mrs. Clinton with 
Chelsea]"></A>.
For example, because the private living quarters did not have an
informal place to gather for meals, she decided to have the serving
kitchen on the second floor converted into a family kitchen.  There,
the three of them could gather around the table just as they had in
Arkansas.

<P>
One of Mrs. Clinton's many responsibilities as First Lady is to
oversee the White House Special Events.  Here, the President and
Mrs. Clinton greet a crowd of children and their parents for the
annual White House Easter Egg Roll

Every year, children and their parents are invited to come and enjoy
the festivities which include: Easter Egg hunts; Easter Egg rolls; a
petting zoo; entertainment and face painting on the South Lawn of the
White House and Ellipse Park.

<P>
The holiday season is another popular time at the White House.  Every
year, the Christmas tree in the Blue Room is a favorite attraction for
the tour goers.  For Christmas 1993, in celebration of the year of the
American Craft, artisans from around the country were invited to
contribute ornaments for the Blue Room tree, using the theme of
angels.  The tree skirt was hand-made by quilters from each of the 50
states and territories, and over 1,000 artists contributed to the
Christmas display.  Here,

The First Lady is also an art lover.  As she has said, sculpture happens to
be one of her favorite art forms.  In fact, her first date with
President Clinton was in the sculpture garden at Yale University.  As
First Lady, Mrs. Clinton worked with the Committee for the
Preservation of the White House, and the White House Historical
Society to bring an exhibit of 20th century sculpture to the 
<A HREF="GARDEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/Garden.html">First
Ladies' Garden of the White House</A>

The first part of the exhibit, which opened in October, 1994, included
twelve pieces that are on loan to the White House from ten midwestern
art collections.  Mrs. Clinton and the Committee for the Preservation
of the White House hope to continue the exhibit with pieces of
sculpture from public art collections from every region of the
country.  In establishing this exhibit

height="93" width="64" ALT="[PHOTO: Mrs. Clinton in the sculpture garden

Mrs. Clinton wanted to showcase the best of American Sculpture, in
America's home, making it accessible to the many people who visit the
White House every day.

In July 1993, the First Lady accompanied the President on his first foreign
trip as President to Tokyo, Japan for the annual G-7 Summit of the
industrialized nations.  Here,

In the summer of 1994, they travelled to Naples, Italy, again for the
G-7 Summit.

Mrs. Clinton is also a SERIOUS baseball fan!  As a child, she attended
Cubs games at Wrigley Field in Chicago with her father and brothers.
Last year, she was invited to Wrigley Field to throw out the first
ball of the Cubs' 1994 season

Like her predecessors, Hillary Rodham Clinton brings to the role of
First Lady her own special talents, experiences, style, and interests.
As she continues her efforts to help others, she remains devoted in her
commitment to her family, work, and service.
