<H1>Twentieth-Century American Sculpture <br>at the White House</H1>

<HR>
The twelve works of art selected from American art museums for this
special exhibition span over seventy years of the 20th century, and
represent a diverse and vital aspect of our cultural heritage.
Conceived by
<A HREF="HILLAR~2.HTM" tppabs="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/HILLARY_Home-plain.html">Mrs. Clinton</A> 
and drawn from public collections in the heartland of the nation and
installed in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden of the White House, the
exhibition has been organized under the auspices of the <A HREF="../../../../../tppmsgs/msgs48.htm#4862" tppabs="http://www.gatech.edu/CARLOS/AAMDO/">
Association of Art Museum Directors.</A>

<P>
Over half of the inclusions in this exhibition are by living American
artists.  Diverse in their ideas, idioms, and chosen medium, they span
several artistic generations.  Divided almost equally between
figuration and abstraction, all evoke references to nature and the
human figure.

We hope you enjoy the following virtual tour of the exhibit.
