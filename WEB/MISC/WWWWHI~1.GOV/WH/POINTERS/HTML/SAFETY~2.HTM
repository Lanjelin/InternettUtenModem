Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</a>
<p>
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is a federal agency created in 1980 by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), or what is more commonly known as Superfund legislation. Congress enact








ed Superfund as part of its response to two highly publicized and catastrophic events: discovery of the Love Canal hazardous waste site in Niagara Falls, New York, and an industrial fire in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, which set off the release of highly to








xic fumes into the air in a densely populated area. Congress also created ATSDR to implement the health-related sections of laws that protect the public from hazardous wastes and environmental spills of hazardous substances.
<p>
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 established <b>ATSDR</b> as an agency of the Public Health Service with mandates to 1) establish a National Exposure and Disease Registry; 2) create an inventory of








 health information on hazardous substances; 3) create a list of closed and restricted-access sites; 4) provide medical assistance during hazardous substance emergencies; and 5) determine the relationship between hazardous substance exposure and illness.
<p>
The mission of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry is to prevent exposure and adverse human health effects and diminished quality of life associated with exposure to hazardous
substances from waste sites, unplanned releases, and other sources of pollution present in the environment.

U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>
<p>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), under the Department of ransportation, was established by the Highway Safety Act of 1970, as the successor to the National Highway Safety Bureau, to carry out safety programs under the National T








raffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 and the Highway Safety Act of 1966. It also carries out consumer programs established by the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, enacted in 1972.
<p>
<b>NHTSA</b> is responsible for reducing deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by setting and enforcing safety performance standards for motor vehicle equipment, and through grants to state and loc








al governments to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs.
<p> 
<b>NHTSA</b> investigates safety defects in motor vehicles, sets and enforces fuel economy standards, helps states and local communities reduce the threat of drunk drivers, promotes the use of safety belts, child safety seats and air bags, investigates od








ometer fraud, establishes and enforces vehicle anti-theft regulations and provides consumer information on motor vehicle safety topics.
<p>
 <b>NHTSA</b> also conducts research on driver behavior and traffic safety, to develop the most efficient and effective means of bringing about safety improvements.
<p> We have a toll-free Auto Safety Hotline to provide recall information, receive motor vehicle SAFETY complaints and furnish consumers with a wide range of information on auto safety. The Hotline operates from 8 am to 10 pm Eastern Time, Monday thru Fri

Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board</a>
<p>
Under its enabling statute, (Public Law 100-456) the Board is 
responsible for independent, external oversight of all activities in 
DOE's nuclear weapons complex affecting nuclear health and safety.  The 
Board reviews operations, practices, and occurrences at DOE's defense
