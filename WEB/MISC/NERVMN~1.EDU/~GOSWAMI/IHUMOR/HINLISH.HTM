In our great 'linguistic melting pot country', we speak Hindilish.
  The entire range of emotions can be measured in Hindish,
Benglish, Punjish, Tamlish and Gujjish. Here is a letter showing
this.
<P>
 
<P>
Hey Yaar there !
<P>
Bhat man, no nooj fram you far lang time ? Bhat matter eej ? Hab you
forgotten me ? Myself, Deepak Khanna from IIT Kanpur. Same Kolege,
same nolej, yaar. Hee hee.
<P>
Arre bhai, yesterday I go restaurant and they ask, what bil you hab ?
Cadberry ? Papsee ? Or one bottle Thunderbolt, one 'baees ka pauwa'
and one lag piece ?  Or bil it be straight 'chempen' ? Talking of
alcohol, do you know there are three kinds of beer in India ? One you
drink, one you sleep with (called 'taddy beer' - you hug it) and one
you having nothing to do with, since you cannot 'beer' it. Not to talk
of the Gujju Beers of Dalal Street who in these Bull Harshad Mehta days,
ask each other, (instead of the customary 'kem che ?') 'scam che ?'
<P>
Coming back to good old Punjaaaaab, everything is 'fitta-fit', thank
you.  'The loins of Bhatinda welcome you' says a roadside sign. The
greatest of their loins, Ajit (of the 'Tawny','Raabert' and 'Mona
Darrrling' fame) inaugurated the 'Groin young loins, mathlab Leo as in
leopard' Club just the other day.
<P>
The Bengalis like to 'shit outside' in the cool 'bridge'. Of course,
it is impossible to cross the Howrah 'breeze' these days, especially
during the 'crush' hour, when your clothes in the crowded buses get
'crust'.
<P>
Bengalis do not have 's' sound and Oriyas do not have 'sh'. So when
Bengalis sing 'God shave the queen', Oriyas shout 'Same, same'.
<P>
Delhi 'sacooter taxi vallas' will say 'Woh Susu ki' referring to
Maruti Suzuki.
<P>
And a Delhi teenager might ask a restaurant waiter to 'rape the
snakes' (wrap the snacks) and 'snakes' could be anything from 'peeza'
to 'baig-dish' (baked dish) to 'senwich' or a plain 'aam-late'. And
the waiter asks 'Do you want them raped separate, separate or together ?'
<P>
Which all amounts to BJP. No, not the Bharatiya Janata Party, but
'Bada Jollu Party' of Tamil Nadu (this acronym refers to a 'lecher')
with its 'jalrafying' tendencies. Ready-aaa ? In Tamil Nadu, 'somebody
else' becomes 'somebody yells' and villages become 'vill-aage' and
marriages, 'marr-aaage' and people vacation in 'Gova' and
'Lenden'. And not to forget that bakery called 'Standard
confessionary' (sic) in Madras who are the 'biggest loafers in
town'. And Madras folks are also concerned about others' opinions and
wonder 'What will four people think, saaar ?'
<P>
Which brings us to my native land, Rajasthan. One english tutor was
heard telling his pupil that 'pittal' is 'bras'. And also that 'Mooli'
is 'carrot'. The mother of the student overheard and came in and asked
'Isn't Mooli radish ?' To which the embarrassed teacher replied 'Yes,
yes, Mooli is sometimes reddish and sometimes whitish.'
<P>
And two IIT Kanpur professors were bickering about regional
accents. When one Bihari professor got up to make a speech "Bhy bharchu
of the authority bheshted in me ...." he was interrupted by his
Malayali colleague, (A Malayali colleague = Malayaleague) who commented
"What atrocious accent !". Stung, the Bihari retorted. "Bhat bil you shay ?"
"Why, I would say it 'praperly'" said the  Malayali "Like 'By wertu yof
the yatarity wasted in me...."
<P>
I am not knowing if you are doing the understanding ?
