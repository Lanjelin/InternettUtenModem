<FONT  SIZE=+2 COLOR=#FF0080><B><CENTER>10 Rules of Indian film-making </CENTER></B></FONT>
  
<BR><BR>
    1) Two brothers separated in childhood will always grow up on
<BR>
       different sides of the law. The law-breaker, however, will
<BR>
       suddenly turn over a new leaf before the end, bash up the
<BR>
       villain (who is the *real* bad guy), and be pardoned for all
<BR>
       his sins before the last-scene family reunion. (This is 
<BR>
       possible only if he has a heroine - see rule 2 below).
<BR>
    
<BR>
    2) If the number of heroes is not equal to the number of heroines,
<BR>
       the excess heroes/heroines will a) die b) join the Red Cross 
<BR>
       and take off to Switzerland before the end of the movie. 
<BR>
<BR>  
  
  3) If there are 2 heroes in a movie, they will fight each other
<BR>
       savegely for at least 5 minutes (10 if they are brothers).
<BR><BR>
    
 
    4) Any court scene will have the dialogue "Objection milord". If 
<BR>
       it is said by the hero, or his lawyer, it will be overruled.
<BR>
       Else, it will be sustained.
    
<BR><BR>
 
    5) The hero's sister will usually marry the hero's best friend
<BR>
       (i.e. the second hero). Else, she will be raped by the villain
<BR>
       within the 1st 30 minutes, and commit suicide.
 
 <BR><BR>   
 
    6) In a chase, the hero will always overtake the villain, 
<BR>
       even on a bullock-cart, or on foot. 
 
<BR><BR>    
 
    7) When the hero fires at the villain(s), he will never a) miss
<BR>
       b) run out of bullets. When the villain fires at the hero, he
<BR>
       will always miss (unless the hero is required to die, as in
<BR>
       rule 2).
<BR>
<BR>    
 
    8) Any fight sequence shall take place in the vicinity of a 
<BR>
       stack of a) pots b) barrels c) glass bottles, which will
<BR>
       be smashed to pieces.
 
<BR><BR>    
 
    9) Any movie involving lost+found brothers will have a song
<BR>
       sung by a) the brothers b) their blind mother (but of course,
<BR>
       she has to be blind in order to regain her sight in the climax)
<BR>
       c) the family dog/cat. 
<BR>
<BR>
    
  10) Police inspectors (when not played by the hero) come in two 
<BR>
        categories: 
<BR>
            a) Scrupulously honest, probably the hero's father - killed 
<BR>
               by the villain before the titles. 
<BR>
            b) Honest, but always chasing the anti-hero (as in Rule 1), 
<BR>
               saying "Tum kanoon se bach nahin sakte", only to pat him 
<BR>
               in the back in reel 23. Usually, this inspector's daughter 
<BR>
               is in love with the anti-hero.
<BR>
            c) The corrupt inspector, (usually the real villain's 
<BR>
               sidekick) unceremoniously knocked about by the hero(s)
<BR>
               in the climax.
