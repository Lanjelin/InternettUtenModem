My Dear 'Anamica':
<P>
You must be surprised to receive this 'Prem Patra' from me.  Let me make my
'Pahechan' to you as 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge'.  Though I am an
'Awaara', I am also your 'Deewana'.
<P>
I am making you a 'Prarthna' to enter my 'Zindagi' as a 'Priyatama'.  Even
though I do not have any 'Sambandh' with you, I still consider you as my
'Dream Girl' with 'Lal Dupatta Malmal Ka'.  There are only 'Do Raaste' left
for me.  One is to get your love by 'Tyag' or to go the 'Rangeela' way.
<P>
Wouldn't you like to be 'Mere Jeevan Saathi' as you are 'Lakhon Mein Ek'?  I
also hope that you will 'Guide' me in 'Bahar' as we are made for 'Ek Duje Ke
Liye'.
<P>
We will live in 'Naya Zamana' where we will have a 'Suhana Safar'.  In this
'Himalay Ki God Mein', our 'Bandhan' is going to be tied with 'Preet Ki Dor'.  I
hope that we will have nothing but 'Anand' in  'Ye Dillagi'.
<P>
Aren't you bored of 'Akele Hum Akele Tum' life?  Let this 'Baazigar' be your
'Boy Friend' and we start 'Pehli Mohabbat'.  This 'Chahat' is going to lead
to a 'Milan' where you are going to call me everyday for 'Aao Pyar Karen'.
<P>
Now, 'Phir Kab Miloge' as 'Tumse Accha Kaun Hein'?  As you know my love is
'Himalay Se Uncha' and hopefully our 'Mulakat' will be 'An Evening in Paris'.
'Aa Gale Lag Jaa'!
<P>
'Hum Aapke Hain Koun...?'
<P>
'Prem Pujari'
