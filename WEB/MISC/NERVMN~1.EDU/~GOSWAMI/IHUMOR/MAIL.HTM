Another Sardarji Joke<BR>
**********************<BR>
A sardar walking on the street, suddenly notices a banana peel on his<BR>
way. imagine what the sardar tells himself......<BR>
<BR>
            "Sala aaj bki girna padega"<BR>
<BR><BR>
**********************<BR>
Pres. Zail Singh buys some common sense<BR>
**********************<BR>
This is about a day when Mr. Zail Singh was the President of the country.<BR>
All sardars in the country went to him this day and told him that people<BR>
tease them by making jokes about them that when the clock stucks 12:00,<BR>
all sardars go mad and act like crazy. They complained that this is not<BR>
true. They also complained that people talk about sardar having no common<BR>
sanse. Therefore, they demanded him to go bring for them common sense.<BR>
<BR><BR>
Mr. Zail Singh was confused and asked his secretary to give him some<BR>
suggestions. The secretary adviced him to go to Japan, since quality is<BR>
guaranteed.<BR>
<BR><BR>
The next day Mr. Zail Singh rushes off to Japan. At the Osaka Airport he<BR>
hires a cab and asks him to take him to a shop where he can get common<BR>
sense.<BR>
<BR><BR>
The cab driver was pissed, he told him that there is no shop in Japan<BR>
that sells such stuff. Infact every human being has common sense since<BR>
birth. And that one should know how to make use of it. Mr. Zail Singh<BR>
asked him to explain in detail.<BR>
<BR><BR>
He started explaining by giving an example. The example was that there<BR>
are 4 members in his family, his wife, his son, and his daughter. He then<BR>
asked Mr. Zail Singh to guess the fourth members of the family. Mr. Zail<BR>
Singh said, "How am i supposed to know who is the forth member in your<BR>
family". The driver said, "fool, its me"<BR>
<BR><BR>
Mr. Zail then understood and said,"oh! is this what common sense is?,<BR>
Indian sardars are fools and stupid, this is so easy"<BR>
<BR><BR>
The next day he goes back to India and announces all sardars to get<BR>
together for a mass sardar lunch. He starts explaining with the same<BR>
example. He says," there are 4 members in my family, my son, my daughter,<BR>
and my wife, guess who is the fourth one?". All sardars shouted, "We<BR>
don't know".<BR>
<BR><BR>
he then yells at them,"You fools, stupid, good for nothing. It is so<BR>
simple, the fourth member of the family is that taxi driver"<BR>

*************************************<BR>
This is is a letter from a sardarji mother to her<BR>
son at school ...<BR>
**************************************<BR>
<BR><BR>
Pyaarey Puttar,<BR>
<BR><BR>
Vahe Guru. I am writing this letter slow because I<BR>
know you can't read fast.  We don't live where we<BR>
did when you left home. Your dad read in the<BR>
newspaper that most accidents happen 20 miles<BR>
from your home, so we moved! I won't be able to<BR>
give you the address as the last sardar who stayed<BR>
in this house took the numbers with them for their<BR>
next house, so they wouldnt have to change their<BR>
address.<BR>
<BR><BR>
This place is really nice. It even has a washing<BR>
machine. I'm not sure it works too well, last week<BR>
I put in three shirts and pulled the chain and I<BR>
HAVE NOT SEEN THEM SINCE.<BR>
<BR><BR>
THE weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice<BR>
last week. The first it rained for three days and the<BR>
second time for four days. The coat you wanted me<BR>
to send you, your aunt said it would be a little too<BR>
heavy to send in the mail with all the buttons, so we<BR>
cut them off and put them in the pocket.<BR>
<BR>
We got another bill from the funeral home. It said<BR>
that if we don't make the last payment on<BR>
GRANDMA'S FUNERAL, she will come up again.<BR>
Your father has another job. He has 500 men under<BR>
him. He is cutting the grass in the cemetery. Your<BR>
sister had a baby this morning, I havent found out<BR>
whether it is a boy or girl, so I don't know whether<BR>
you are an aunt or uncle!<BR>
<BR><BR>
Your uncle jatindar fell into a whiskey vat.  Some<BR>
men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off<BR>
and drowned. We cremated him and he burned for<BR>
3 days.<BR>
<BR><BR>
Three of your friends went off  the bridge in a<BR>
pick-up truck.  One was driving and the other two<BR>
were in the back. the driver got out, he rolled down<BR>
the window and swam to safety. the other 2 friends<BR>
drowned because they couldn't get the gate down.<BR>
<BR><BR>
there isn't much more news at this time. nothing<BR>
much has happened.<BR>
<BR><BR>
love, mom
<BR><BR>
p.s. i was going to send you some money, but the<BR>
envelope was already sealed.<BR>
