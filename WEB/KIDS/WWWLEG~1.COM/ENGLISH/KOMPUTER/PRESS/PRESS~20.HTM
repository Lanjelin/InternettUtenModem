<P>
In 1996 the LEGO Group's large international retail assortment will comprise 337 (very) different sets with lots of opportunities for creative and developmental play activities for children between six months and 16 years of
age all over the world. We take children's needs and development seriously.
<P>
A total of 153 new sets will be launched in the <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/DUPLO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/duplo.html">DUPLO</A>, <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/SYSTEM~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/system.html">LEGO SYSTEM</A> and <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/TECHNI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/technic.html">LEGO
TECHNIC</A> product programmes. They include the brand new LEGO SYSTEM product line Western, the entertaining Time Cruisers and the fascinating <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/TECHNI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/technic.html">LEGO TECHNIC</A> fibre-optic light elements.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="1"></A>The <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/DUPLO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/duplo.html">DUPLO</A> Product Programme</H3>
For the very young
last year's big novelty for the youngest children was <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/DUPLO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/duplo.html">DUPLO</A> Primo, a
multifunctional stacking system consisting of large, colourful decorated
elements that appeal to and stimulate little children's senses and motor
skills in an amusing and entertaining way. More Primo sets are being launched
in February.
<P>
<H3>DUPLO Building Line</H3>
Two major new sets are being added to this section of the <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/DUPLO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/duplo.html">DUPLO</A> range, which
mainly consists of basic elements. One of the sets is a rescue team with a
fireman and a nurse, the other a circus with a little elephant and several
human figures. They will also be available in February, together with
several smaller sets with figures and decorated elements.
<P>
<H3>DUPLO Play Line</H3>
This is the product line in which the various themes are drawn from everyday
life. One of the exciting new sets, which will be introduced in 1996, is a police
station, but the biggest novelty of the year is the farm. It features several new animals (including a horse with a movable head), a tractor with various implements and a farmer in a checked shirt. All these new products will be
launched in September.
<P>
<H3>Play Train</H3>
There are three new DUPLO Play Train sets: a push train and two electric
trains - a beginner model and a larger, more advanced one with functions such
as start and stop signals. When the train is not running, the motor stops
automatically after two minutes to save energy. The new trains will be introduced in May.
<P>
<H3>Play House</H3>
The Play House, which can be furnished exactly as the child wants, is to have
even more features from May. For example, there are a new bathroom and a play
area, which can have a pony and its rider.
<P>
<H3>Toolo</H3>
Young "engineers" can design to their heart's content with the sets in the
Toolo series. Next year's new products, which will be in the shops in May, are
an airplane (with elements that can also be made into a racing car) and a
large fire engine.

<H2><A NAME="2"></A>The <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/SYSTEM~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/system.html">LEGO SYSTEM</A> Product Programme</H2>
<H3>FreeStyle</H3>
FreeStyle is the series in which everything is possible and there are no
"wrong" ways of doing things. January will see the launch of supplementary sets
with masses of basic elements, as well as two new sets with building plates as
lids.
<P>
<H3>Belville</H3>
Four new sets in the Belville product line for girls will be on the market in
August. There are a little playground with a swing and a somewhat larger ballet
studio. The hospital, with lots of details such as plaster of Paris for broken
legs, is a brand new
Belville theme. Lastly, there is a large
villa, crammed with all the features that little girls enjoy.  
<P>
<H3>Town</H3>
Time Cruisers are the big news in <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/SYSTEM~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/system.html">LEGO SYSTEM</A> Town. The sets contain elements
from various product lines - Castle, Aquazone, Space, Pirates and <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/TECHNI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/technic.html">LEGO TECHNIC</A>
- for building models representing past, present and future. Starting in
August, young builders will be able to "travel in time" with their
Time Cruiser models.
<P>
Other new products in Town include a Formula 1 pit and a vehicle transporter.
There are also a new aerobatics aircraft, a large Universal set with all the
elements needed for a small townscape, a large new police station and a
gold-smugglers' hideaway.
<P>
The Paradisa series, intended primarily for girls, is acquiring a Country Club
complete with horses and stables. There is also a
smaller set with a horse and trap. These new products will be in the shops as from January.
<P>
<H3>Train and Ships</H3>The new Train sets, to be launched in September, include a goods train and a
passenger train, both with lots of functions.
<P>
Three new ships will be launched in April.
<P>
<H3>Western - a brand new product line</H3>
The new Western product line will be introduced in September. There are six
large and small sets, with lots of opportunity for the action games that boys
enjoy. There are bandits, covered wagons, a sheriff's office, a jailhouse, an
abandoned gold mine and a Main Street, just like the ones in cowboy films, with
a general store. The biggest set contains the elements needed to build the
LEGOREDO fort, the soldiers' headquarters.
<P>
<H3>Pirates</H3>
The six new Pirate sets, large and small, will be available from May. The
"Santa Cruz" has splendid textile sails and flag. The sail of the pirate's
brig, however, has been ripped by cannonballs, but it can still be hoisted.
<P>
<H3>Aquazone</H3>
The popular Aquazone product line, introduced in 1995, is to have three new
sets, to be marketed in April. One of them is an
Aquashark base, complete with an undersea vessel.
<P>
<H3>Space</H3>
The Space line, which has been on the market since 1979, is as successful as
ever. In March, there are to be seven sets in the new "Explorien" series, with
new magnetic functions and labels with metallic and holographic effects.
<P>
<H3>Model Team</H3>
Model Team is for the patient, meticulous
builder. The new product for 1996, to be
launched in September, is "Black Cat" - the ultimate US truck with lots of functional reality.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="3"></A>The <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/TECHNI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/technic.html">LEGO TECHNIC</A> Product Programme</H2>
The LEGO TECHNIC programme is split between Starter and Advanced sets. Even in
the
smallest <A HREF="../PRODUCTS/TECHNI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/products/technic.html">LEGO TECHNIC</A> models the accent is on genuine technology, with
mechanical or electronic functions. There is to be a new departure in February with the launch of a Multi-Module set in the Starter series. There are building
instructions for a total of nine models which can be built on the basis of the
three main models. There are also five other new vehicles.
<P>
A beach buggy and a large aircraft with many technical details are to be
launched in February in the Advanced series.
<P>
There will also be two sets with the new Fiber Optic elements that glow in the dark. The larger of the two sets contains the elements for a
large spaceship or a submarine, complete with two motors to control their
exciting functions.
<P>
All in all, it promises to be yet another great year for new products from the
LEGO Group, which remains to be the only European toy manufacturer in the
international Top Ten. In 1995, LEGO products were sold in 138 countries.
<P>
The LEGO Group - purveyor of creative experiences, toys and educational
materials to children everywhere.
