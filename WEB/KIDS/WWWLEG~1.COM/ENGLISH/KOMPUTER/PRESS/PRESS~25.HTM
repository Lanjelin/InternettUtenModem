<H1>The world's largest LEGO &#174; car at F.T.I. Technoland 1996 !</H1>
<P>
When the Flanders Technology International Fair opens in Gent, Belgium on 15 April this year, visitors will be able to admire the largest LEGO car ever built.
<P>
The LEGO TECHNIC car is a faithful copy of the Super Car launched in toy shops all over the world last year. The only difference is that the car at the exhibition will be 10 times the size in every dimension. It has 500 times as many bricks - no fewer than 650,000 LEGO TECHNIC elements.
<P>

<H2>More than 1000 Kg !</H2>
<P>
The car, which is 475 cm long, 230 cm wide and 150 cm high, weighs more than 1,000 kg. It took the designers around 1,500 hours to develop and enlarge the car. Then 4,400 hours were needed to build and glue it. 
<P>
The model has the same technical finesses and details as the new LEGO TECHNIC Super Car. It has a longitudinal low V8 engine, chain drive and double exhaust. The car is steered through all four wheels. Other features include independent suspension, tiltable headlights and adjustable wing mirrors.
<P>
One of the world's largest motor manufacturers
<P>
The LEGO Group has been producing cars and car components - toys of course - for the past 60 years. The early ones were made from wood, then came plastics. This year, a total of around 60 million vehicles will be manufactured.
<P>
The LEGO Group makes technology accessible at F.T.I. Technoland !
<P>
During the event, which takes place from April 15 until 21, technology is being introduced in an accessible manner. All visitors will be able to experience tangible applications set to change life either today or tomorrow, such as the information superhighway, Video on Demand, Virtual Reality, etcetera.
<P>
Next to the exciting LEGO TECHNIC Supercar you can discover how the LEGO Group closely monitors technological change.
