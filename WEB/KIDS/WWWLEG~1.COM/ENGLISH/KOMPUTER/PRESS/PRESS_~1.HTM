        </ul>
        <p><b>From the very earliest times in human history, it
        has been a popular pastime to play with creative
        materials - sand, clay, water and paints. Later, there
        were wooden blocks - and later still, in the 20th
        century, construction toys made their appearance. They
        were made of rubber, wood, clay, metal and bakelite and
        other synthetic materials. In 1932, the LEGO Company in
        Denmark began making high quality wooden toys - including
        stacking and building bricks. </b></p>
        <p><b>In 1947, in addition to producing wooden toys, the
        company began manufacturing plastic toys: dolls, motor
        cars, animals, babies' rattles - and the familiar
        building bricks also began to appear in plastic. </b></p>
        <h3><a name="0"><b>The LEGO Brick</b></a></h3>
        <p><b>In 1949, something of consequence - but relatively
        unnoticed - occurred in Billund: plastic building
        components were launched under the name &quot;Automatic
        Binding Bricks&quot; (in post-war Denmark many products
        were given English names). These two components had studs
        on the top. They could be built on top of one another,
        but with very little clutching power. They were inspired
        by two plastic building bricks made by the British firm,
        Kiddicraft, which sold them only in Britain. </b></p>
        <p><b>With the cooperation of a tooling works in
        Copenhagen, the design of the brick was modified and
        moulds were made. The modifications in relation to the
        Kiddicraft bricks included altering round corners to make
        them sharp and changing inches to cm and mm, which
        altered the size of the brick by approx. 0.1 mm from the
        Kiddicraft brick. In addition, the studs on the bricks
        were flattened on top. The bricks which were marketed in
        Denmark had four studs or eight studs. Their name was
        later changed to &quot;LEGO Mursten&quot; (&quot;LEGO
        Building Bricks&quot;). They are the bricks we usually
        refer to as &quot;a rather primitive forerunner of the
        LEGO Brick proper dating from 1958&quot;. In the LEGO
        range of the early 1950´s, which comprised about 200
        wooden and plastic products, LEGO Building Bricks
        attracted only little attention. In fact, they did not
        sell well - generally speaking, all they could be used
        for were building simple walls and houses. </b></p>
        <h3><a name="1"><b>LEGO System of Play</b></a></h3>
        <p><b>It was not until 1954 that the Billund company
        realised that its future could well lie in the
        development of LEGO Building Bricks. The Danish toy trade
        was looking for products offering a strong concept and
        system. The idea captured the attention of Godtfred Kirk
        Christiansen.<br>       <p><b>The LEGO Building Brick, which now accounted for a
        modest 5-10% of the company's sales, was the only product
        in the existing range that could be developed into a
        system and mass-produced. The company launched a major
        development project, headed by Godtfred Kirk
        Christiansen. Within a year (in 1955), it was able to
        introduce in Denmark what it called &quot;The LEGO System
        of Play&quot;, based on small cars, the LEGO Building
        Brick and something resembling the flat baseplates we
        know today. The system was developed over the next few
        years - and in January 1958, something rather
        revolutionary happened. </b></p>
        <h3><a name="2"><b>Inventing the Tubes</b></a></h3>
        <p><b>LEGO Bricks were refined and developed over a
        period of years. The work focused on improving clutching
        power. Godtfred Kirk Christiansen's solution to the
        problem was to invent the now familiar tubes inside what
        had previously been hollow bricks. </b></p>
        <p><b>These tubes ensured really strong clutching power,
        stability - and new possibilities for other combinations.
        It was now possible for six 8-stud bricks (of the same
        colour) to be combined in almost 103 million ways! This
        had been impossible with the tubeless LEGO Brick, which
        now gave way to a better and more interesting product
        (but the older bricks could still be used with their new
        &quot;cousins&quot;). </b></p>
        <p><b>The invention of the tubes inside the LEGO Brick
        led to the LEGO patent (basic patent), which Godtfred
        Kirk Christiansen applied for in 1958. He was granted the
        patent in Denmark and in a number of other countries,
        including Great Britain (1961), and the brick the company
        now produced was essentially identical to the LEGO Brick
        sold today. </b></p>
        <h3><a name="3"><b>Utilising an Idea</b></a></h3>
        <p><b>After launching the LEGO Brick in 1949, the company
        - thanks to its &quot;LEGO System of Play&quot; in 1955
        and its tubes in 1958 - had a unique product on which to
        base its future development. In 1963, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen published the now well-known 10 characteristics for an ideal LEGO product of the future:
        </b>
        <p><UL><LI>unlimited play potential<br>
    <LI>for girls, for boys<br>
       <LI> fun for every age<br>
       <LI> year-round play<br>
       <LI> healthy and quiet play<br>
       <LI> long hours of play<br>
       <LI> imagination, creativity, development<br>
        <LI>the more LEGO , the greater its value<br>
       <LI> extra sets available<br>
       <LI> quality in every detail</UL></p>
 The most remarkable aspect
        of the LEGO story has been the ability of the Group's
        employees - for many years with the close involvement of
        Godtfred Kirk Christiansen - to visualize and use the
        product idea ... to make constant improvements to the
        basic idea ... to continuously develop new elements and
        play themes ... and to broaden the scope of the company's
        product range. </b></p>
        <p><b>LEGO DUPLO Bricks, launched internationally in 1969, are
        one of the most noteworthy examples of this process.
       LEGO DUPLO Bricks are eight times the size of LEGO Bricks -
        every dimension is multiplied by two. A stroke of
        technical genius allows LEGO DUPLO Bricks and LEGO Bricks to
        be linked together in the same model - the LEGO DUPLO studs
        are hollowed out to act as tight sleeves around the
        internal tubes of LEGO Bricks. </b></p>
