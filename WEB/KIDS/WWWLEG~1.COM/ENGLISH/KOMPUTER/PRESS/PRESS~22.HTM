- new LEGO Group initiatives<P>
<IMG SRC="!PRESSLA.GIF" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/press/!pressla.gif" ALT="LEGO Jourmalist"><P>
The LEGO Group is moving into the fascinating digital world and in that context we are currently in the process of establishing two new software departments, one in Denmark and another in Great Britain.<P>

The aim - based on the world's best toy concept - is to develop digital key technologies, primarily in Denmark. In addition, we expect to develop and market software for children related to and based on the LEGO product. This will be achieved through our entry into strategic alliances with business partners. This process will be coordinated by the department in Great Britain.<P>

It was as long ago as 1986 that we launchedthe first LEGO DACTA products (for the educational market) that made possible both teaching and play with computer-controlled LEGO models. Further development resulted in the introduction of more advanced products. The employees who have worked with LEGO software over the years will form a natural part of the new team.<P>

Further advances in computer technology and the growing popularity of PCs among private consumers means that the time is now ripe for the LEGO Group to enter this area in earnest. As a result of the development and marketing of, for example, cd-rom products, it is possible to achieve synergy between the physical LEGO bricks and the potential of the computer in the fields of information and education.<P>

The well-known LEGO product lines will continue to have priority in product development, but it is now possible to add a wide range of new opportunities - and thus extending the product's usefulness. In other words, the underlying objective is to build on the tremendous goodwill and acceptance that we have achieved over the years by fulfilling the full range of requirements of today's consumers.<P>
<IMG SRC="COMMANDO.GIF" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/press/commando.gif" ALT="LEGO Space cruiser"><P>
Our wish is to make a contribution to the development of software for young people that is based on our primary concept of stimulating children's imagination and creativity.<P>
 
We expect the Billund department to build up to a staff of 40-50 people during the next few months. Among their tasks will be the development of software based on and related to the LEGO product and the further development of the basis for future work, including a LEGO 3-D database containing every LEGO element.<P>

Our expectation is that this process will lead to the marketing of the first products later this year (a cd-rom from Mindscape) and in 1997, but we cannot be more specific at the present time.<P>
