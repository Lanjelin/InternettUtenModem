<H1>LEGO SCALA&#174;</H1>

<H2>- an exciting new product for girls. <BR>
Presentation: 22nd January in Billund</H2>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="SCALAP~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/press/scalapige.gif"></CENTER><P>
There is good news for girls aged five years and above. From March 1997, shops in selected European countries will be selling 10 sets in the new LEGO SCALA range. The products are being launched after being tested on delighted girls and their mothers in e.g. Germany and France.<P>
LEGO SCALA is a brand-new, flexible doll's house concept that is capable of infinite variation. Girls can decide the layout and furnishings for themselves. The various doll's houses, décor and charmingly detailed furniture and accessories can be combined, changed and extended according to taste. The product combines the traditional doll's house and role play that have always been favourites among girls with LEGO modelbuilding's characteristic flexibility and creativity. There are lots of fascinating details and realistic functions in the system - e.g. cupboards and chests with doors and drawers that can be opened and closed, carpets, parasols, lamps, bed linen, curtains, kitchen utensils, books, flowers and other decorations. The system can to a degree be integrated with elements from other LEGO product programmes.<P>
<H3>Dolls with functions</H3>
There are six different dolls in the various sets - a father, two mothers and three teen-age daughters - between 14 and approx. 17 cm tall. The dolls' limbs can be moved in a lifelike way. Their arm and leg joints are flexible and they can hold things in their hands. The girls have lovely hair and the dolls are easy to dress and undress. There is also a baby and some of the sets contain household pets - a cat and her kittens, for example.<BR>
The system features the yellow and pink pas-tel colours that girls love. The atmosphere is warm and friendly, with the family at the centre of things. A total of 140 new elements and 40 textile items - clothing, soft furnishings and bed linen have been developed for the LEGO SCALA product.<P>

In the first instance, the 10 new sets will be introduced in Europe - in Austria, Den-mark, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland in March, and in France in September. The LEGO SCALA sets will retail at between approx. DKK 70 and approx. DKK 1.000.<P>

Jørgen Bruhn, Corporate Senior Vice President, LEGO Futura A/S (the LEGO Group's international product development company) says: "With the launch of the LEGO SCALA product programme, the LEGO Group has extended the range of products it makes for girls of five years and upwards. Together with the LEGO SYSTEM Belville line, LEGO SCALA offers girls a unique range of products, developed on the basis of their own 
 taste in toys and play.<P>

<H3>New Belville sets too</H3>
The LEGO SYSTEM Belville line is intended for girls who like to build. Construction is quick and simple and there are masses of opportunities for role play. There will be six new Belville sets in the shops from April onwards, including a riding school, pony trekking and a circus princess - all with lots of interesting and charming details. The new sets will retail at between DKK 35 and approx. DKK 500.<P>
