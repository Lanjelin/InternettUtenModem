<H2>The competition</H2>
In the finals the children, seven girls and 46 boys, who are consequently
national building champions - were divided into four groups: the youngest
group with five children from 3-5 years of age, the middle group with 17
children from 6-9 years, the oldest group with 21 children from 10-14 years -
and a special technical group with 11 children from 8-16 years. The children
(with their parents) came from Austria - Belgium/Luxembourg - Croatia - Czech
Republic - Estonia - Finland - Germany - Holland - Italy - Korea - Latvia -
Lithuania - The Philipines - Poland - Russia - Slovakia - Sweden - Switzerland
- Taiwan - Thailand - Ukraine - and Uzbekistan.<P>

The children were given between 1 1/2 - 2 1/4 hours to build exactly what they
wanted. The youngest were each given 803 DUPLO and LEGO SYSTEM elements, the
6-9 years old participants got 889 LEGO  SYSTEM elements, while the 10-14
years old could build with 764 LEGO SYSTEM elements, one motor and one battery box. In the
technical group the children had 1,512 LEGO SYSTEM and TECHNIC elements, one
motor and one battery box at their disposal.<P>

When the building had been finished the 53 creations were judged by a jury of
seven persons with Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, president, LEGO A/S, at the head.
The jury worked for several hours - prizes and diplomas were presented to the
winners at 18:00 in LEGO Center.<P></B></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
