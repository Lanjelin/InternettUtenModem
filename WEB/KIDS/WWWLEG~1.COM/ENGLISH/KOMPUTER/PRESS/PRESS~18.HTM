<H1>KZ Camp made by LEGO bricks!</H1>

<H2>- it is N-O-T sponsored by the LEGO Group</H2>

If you hear about a KZ camp made of LEGO bricks via your local radio or TV station it is correct. Here is the story:
 The Polish artist's <U>fake</U> LEGO sets, which are currently being displayed in an art gallery in Copenhagen, (the capital of Denmark) are <U>not</U> sponsored by the LEGO Group.<P>

In 1996 the artist received a small quantity of LEGO bricks - he informed our Polish sales company in Warsaw that he would build houses and maybe a hospital. Without informing us, he instead manufactured several <U>fake</U> LEGO sets with article numbers and LEGO SYSTEM logos on them - as well as a black text on yellow background where it says that the work of art is "sponsored by LEGO SYSTEM". The illustrations on these <U>fake</U> LEGO sets are photos of various KZ sceneries - built of the LEGO elements which he was given in order to create something entirely different. If the artist had described his ultimate project to us in advance, he naturally would <U>not</U> have received a single LEGO element from us!<P>

Vainly, we have already expressed great dissatisfaction towards the artist with the fact that he has used and thereby abused the LEGO Group's registered trademarks and LEGO SYSTEM logo. This can damage our global reputation if anyone thinks that we have sponsored the project. At least in Denmark, the limits of the term "artistic freedom" are rather wide so as matters stand now, we will not take legal actions in Denmark.<P>
