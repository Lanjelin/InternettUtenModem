<H1>LEGOLAND Windsor opens</H1>

<P>


Children will take centre stage at LEGOLAND Windsor on Thursday 28th March from 10.00 a.m. onwards, when Britain's newest theme park has its Grand Opening, celebrated with an informal party for more than 1,500 schoolchildren from the Windsor area. They will be joined by 700 specially invited guests from many countries - will have the chance to enjoy the new park's attractions before it opens its gates to the public for the first time on Friday, 29th March 1996.
<P>
The new park at Windsor, the first LEGOLAND Park outside Denmark, represents an investment of close to DKK 750 million (GBP 85 million), wholly financed by the LEGO Group. Aquarter of a million tickets have already been sold via the special advance-booking system. The park expects to welcome 1.4 million visitors in its first season, which closes in October. 
<P>
Apart from adding a new dimension to the spectrum of activities in the Windsor area, the new park has also boosted local employment, with the recruitment of 600 seasonal employees and a further 75 people on the permanent staff.
<P>
Many of the activities at LEGOLAND Windsor have been inspired by LEGOLAND Billund, which was opened in 1968. LEGOLAND Billund is Denmark's biggest tourist attraction outside Co-penhagen. It was visited by 1.3 million
people during the 1995 summer season.
<P>
"Our business objective in further developing the LEGOLAND concept is to harness and expand the unique reputation which the LEGO Group enjoys among children and adults, retailers and our other business partners around the world," says Bob Montgomery, LEGOLAND Windsor's Managing Director. "We are committed to giving children and their families a real-life experience of the LEGO values - creativity, fun, development, play and learning - in an environment in which children themselves are the heroes.
<P>
"LEGOLAND Windsor is also committed to quality, safety and service. The words of the company's founder, Ole Kirk Christiansen, 'Only the best is good enough', are reflected in everything we do - our toys, preschool and school products, family parks and licensed products such as clothing and books. Even our advance-booking system stems from this commitment to quality, because we don't want children kept in long queues in an over-
crowded park, which would spoil their enjoyment," adds Bob Montgomery.
<P>
The LEGO Group is planning to open further LEGOLAND Parks in other parts of the world. From the year 2000 onwards, new parks will be opened at approximately three-year intervals. The next, LEGOLAND Carlsbad, near San Diego, California is scheduled to open in 1999.
