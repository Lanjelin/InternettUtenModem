<P>
- the LEGO Group goes into cyberspace
<P>
On Friday 22nd March 1996 at 18:45:50 (Danish time), the LEGO Group joined the Internet via its own World Wide Web in Denmark. Between 15 and 20 million net surfers all over the world can now retrieve original, genuine and authorised LEGO information and images for display on their PCs. (We have intentionally waited a week before announcing the event. We first wanted to test the system - and get the first feedback from Internet user discussion groups.)
<P>
Our primary target group comprises girls, boys and their parents, who have themselves (probably) been LEGO builders and collectors in their time. We are also addressing a number of other interest groups - e.g. media
people who have a professional need for quick access to current LEGO facts and figures.
<P>
In recent years, several private, unauthorised "LEGO homepages" have appeared on the network - especially from the USA. There is also a large and very active discussion club (rec.toys.lego). We have observed this trend with great interest - we have in fact felt rather flattered by it. At the same time, however, we have not necessarily felt particularly enthusiastic that others have used our LEGO logo and have clearly been unaware of the authorised LEGO house style in their texts. Equally, even though no serious breaches have occurred, there was a risk that they might unintentionally misinform others about LEGO products and events in the LEGO universe. We have now dealt with this potential problem by supplying our own, authorised information to net surfers, including some friendly guidance about legal matters, trademarks and copyright.
<P>
We are also offering an amusing way of playing the network game via a personal menu which we have called "My Own Homepage". Once you have set it up, you surf between Internet addresses by clicking on LEGO bricks. You can also join the LEGO Surfers' Club.
<P>
It is a modest beginning, but we expect to add a facility for retrieving such items as video clips and screensavers.
<P>
We also plan to include special pages which the various LEGO companies can use to supply targeted regional and national information. The LEGO address on the Internet is:
<P>
http://www.LEGO.com
<P>
The LEGO World Wide Web has been optimised for Netscape version 2.0 browser software, which permits a degree of animation, as used in several places in the LEGO Internet program.
