<H1>New 15,000m² LEGO factory and 
administration building in Korea</H1>The LEGO Group's new factory and administration building in Korea will be inaugurated on Wednesday 23rd October 1996. The new facilities, which are in Ichon, Kyonggi Province, approx. 60 kilometres south-east of Seoul, are being opened just under two years after construction began in December 1994. The project represents an investment of almost DKK 200 million.<P>

The new complex has an area of just over 15,000 m², to which has to be added the 2,500 m² warehouse built on the site in 1993. LEGO Korea Co. now has 17,500 m² of buildings on a 38,000 m² site (an area equivalent to some eight football pitches) in an area of great natural beauty on the outskirts of Ichon, optimally located in relation to the Korean motorway network.<P>

Commenting on the opening Youn Ha Rhee, LEGO Korea's General Manager, said:<BR>
"The LEGO product, which dominates the worldwide construction-toy market, has been the leading international brand in Korea for many years."<BR>
"With the opening of our new advanced factory and offices in Ichon, we shall be in a position to give even better service and more enjoyment to consumers. We look forward to a future in which there is steadily growing success for both LEGO Korea and the Group as a whole."<P><CENTER>
