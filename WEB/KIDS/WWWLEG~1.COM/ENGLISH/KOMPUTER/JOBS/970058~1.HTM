<H1>SAP Consultants</H1></CENTER>



Due to many challenging and coming tasks in progress deeply rooted in the
so-called "Backbone Project", we are now applying for supplementary resources
for the SAP organization.<P>

<H3>The Job:</H3>

As SAP consultant you have the possibility of getting an all round knowledge on
the standard system SAP R/3 - and the implementation of this system - in a fast
and solid way. See the job as an investment.<P>

You will be a resource in one of the many projects and "situated" in the
project team in question you have the daily back up and access to sparring
around you. Be it said: only your ambitions set limits to your involvement even
from day 1.<P>

Through the project course you will participate in clarification/determination
of business processes and standards related to these, and you must parallel
with this be responsible for setup and test of parts of SAP R/3. Also ABAP
programming and activities as regards infrastructure will occur dependent on
contents and possibilities of the project.<P>

<H3>Qualifications:</H3>

The decisive is that you have ambitions and cannot stop pursuing an objective
until it has been reached. It is also a demand that you think and act
service-oriented as much of your time will take place away from your desk and
in the customer’s half. Finally, an open and cheerful mind will suit the
informal tone we use among ourselves.
<P>
We expect that you are able to analyse problems, find concrete solutions and
realize them together with the team. We would appreciate if you have a further
education but first of all we are looking for persons that can convince us that
they match the above-mentioned.<P>

<H3>Further Questions:</H3>

If you have further questions, you are welcome to contact Søren Wamsler,
E-mail: <P>
