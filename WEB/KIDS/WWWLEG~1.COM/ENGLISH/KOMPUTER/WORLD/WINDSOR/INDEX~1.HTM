<P>
Imagine a land that큦 dedicated to children. A land that inspires adventure, excitement and fun, where the entertainment is hands-on and children are in control. This is LEGOLAND Windsor - a different sort of family theme Park.<P>
<I>Our mission: To give children and their families a real life experience of the LEGO core values - creativity, fun, development, play and learning - in a unique environment where the child is the hero.</I><P>
LEGOLAND Windsor is the ultimate clubhouse for LEGO fans! We have thrills of a different kind and rides on a different scale. Learn to drive a car and earn your own license; pan for gold; brave The Pirate Falls; star in a show; or unravel the mystery in the Explorer큦 institute. With over 40 rides, shows and attractions, and set in 150 acres of beautiful parkland, LEGOLAND Windsor offers a full and exiting day out, for children aged two to twelve and their families.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="1">The Imagination Centre</A></FONT><BR>
As its name suggests, the Imagination Centre provides the tools and stimulus for creative play. In the workshops children can design buildings to test on earthquake tables, engineer cars to beat all contenders on a car speed test ramp, or control LEGO Models through computers. Children can learn through play in these workshops and in the LEGO&#174; DACTA&#174; Pavilions, which are reserved for school parties during termtime. Here a series of hands on education programmes, related to the national curriculum key stages one to three, are offered.<P>
There are two rides in this area, the Sky Rider, a pedal powered ride that circumnavigates the centre, and the Space Tower, where children pull themselves up to the top of a tower to inspect the UFO hovering overhead, before "abseiling" to the bottom. Beside this a masive new animated LEGO TECHNIC dinosaur will be added.<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 VSPACE=20 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right SRC="BY.JPG" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/world/windsor/by.jpg">
<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="2">Miniland</A></FONT><BR>
Miniland contains detailed scenes from around Europe including scenes from London, Amsterdam, Paris and Edinburgh, 
all bustling with traffic, trains, boats and humour. There are some 800 model
buildings and another 700 models of trains, cars, ships, cranes, bridges,
fountains and people. One hundred model designers worked for two and a
half years and used some 25 million bricks to create Miniland.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="3">The DUPLO&#174; Gardens</A></FONT><BR>
Here, in keeping with the DUPLO brand, are delights for the younger members of
the family. But older children and parents will
also find much to amuse and attract them. There's a DUPLO Train, a Helicopter ride, puppet
theatre, Fairy Tale Brook Boat Ride (full of wit and surprises) and perhaps
best of all, is an area called The Waterworks. Here the children will take
charge, making water flow uphill and fountains squirt, play tunes, power
models, gurgle and swirl.<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 VSPACE=20 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right SRC="TRAFFIC.GIF" tppabs="http://www.lego.com/scratch/komputer/world/windsor/traffic.gif">
<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="4">LEGO&#174; Traffic</A></FONT><BR>
Next to the DUPLO Gardens is one of the greatest attractions for older
children - electric cars they drive themselves. Children have to negotiate
traffic lights, pedestrian crossings and roundabouts to earn their very own
LEGOLAND Driver큦 Licence, and as this is England, many people have the added challenge 
of learning to drive on the left hand side of the road! Or they can go
sailing in the Boat Driving School, where powered boats have to be steered
between buoys, through boiling rapids, avoiding the rest of the fleet.<P>

<A NAME="5"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>My Town</FONT><BR>
Here the LEGO Town play theme comes to life. The buildings are
grouped around a harbour, complete with lighthouse, which forms the centrepiece
for a spectacular live action stunt show. Inside the main building are
walk-through experiences designed to amaze all ages: shiver in
ice caves; swelter in tropical jungles; explore the backstage secrets of the
Magic Theatre<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="6">Brickadilly큦&#174; Circus and Fairground</A></FONT><BR>

In My Town, the circus is always in town. But this is LEGOLAND Windsor, so
children don't just watch the clown show, they are the show.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="7">The Wild Woods</A></FONT><BR>

In the most heavily wooded area of the site <i>"There are Pirates lurking."</i>
Here you can pan for gold, follow a treasure trail through The Rat Trap - a
fearsome labyrinth of tree top walkways, scramble nets and chutes (beware of
the dreaded Death Drop) - or ride the Pirate Falls, a flume ride where all sorts of surprising things happen along the way - some witty, some silly and some just a bit scary.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="8">Restaurants</A></FONT><BR>

The Swiss international hotel and catering group M&ouml;venpick has been
appointed as sole
catering consultant to operate six different outlets in LEGOLAND Windsor including the
 'Crossed Ribs' Pirates Restaurant in the Wild Woods,
the 'Pasta Patch' in the DUPLO Gardens and 'March&eacute;' in My Town, the
largest restaurant in the Park. Visitors select their food from a range of
fresh produce which is prepared and cooked in front of them.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="9">Live Shows</A></FONT><BR>

The fun starts with the <I>Welcome Show</I> whose antics begin at The Beginning. There큦 <I>The Brickbuilders Fun-House Jam</I> in the Imagination Theatre, which is a colourfull and involving live music and dance show. You큞l find the <I>Fairytales, Fables and Fun</I> puppet show in the DUPLO Gardens, telling some famniliar stories with a twist of humour. My Town Harbour is the launch pad for  <I>Time-Travel Adventures</I>, a spectacular high-drive stunt show incorporating acrobatic skills and traditional pantomime. Then there큦 the <I>Brickadilly큦 Circus</I>, where children star in the show, learning clowning skills and the intrepid can brave the High Wire Bike.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="10">Special Events</A></FONT><BR>

During the season there will be a series of special events. Join us for spectacular Laser, Light and Fireworks Extravaganza that will be held on 1st and 2nd November 1997, or for one of the special activity weekends for LEGO Club members on 19th and 20th April and 20th and 21st September.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="11">School Parties</A></FONT><BR>

With the help of primary and secondary school teaching staff, an exciting range of
educational programmes has been researched and developed to meet the needs of
National Curriculum Key Stages 1, 2 and 3. Workshops and resource packs have
been developed using the LEGO DACTA products specially developed for use in
schools.<P>
