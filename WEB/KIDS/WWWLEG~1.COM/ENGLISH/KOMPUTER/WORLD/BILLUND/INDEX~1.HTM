Just about everything is built from brightly coloured LEGO bricks.
It took 44.5 million LEGO bricks to build this unique theme park.<P>
1.3 million people visited LEGOLAND Park in 1995 during the 6-month summer season.
This is the largest number of visitors in the Park's 27-year history.<P>
The "all inclusive" price system is ideal for families with children. Once the entrance has been paid, everything in the Park is free - except the Traffic School.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="1">The History:</A></FONT><BR>
It was the ever increasing number of enthusiastic and inquisitive persons that came to the LEGO factory in Billund in the mid-sixties that resulted in a decision by Godtfred Kirk Christiansen to establish an "open-air LEGO exhibition".<P>LEGOLAND Park큦 first season ran from June to October 1968. 625,000 guests visited the Park the very first season - surpassing even the wildest expectations.<P>
Since then, the number of LEGO models, activities, rides, employees and guests has escalated. <P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><BR>
<A NAME="2">Miniland:</A><BR></FONT>
In Miniland, you will see detailed LEGO brick models of some of Europe's most idyllic and famous places. Scenes from Holland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, England and, of course, Denmark.
The models are built on a 1:20 scale of the same types of bricks that are sold in LEGO building sets.
Calling the models detailed is almost an understatement. In the city scenes cars, trucks, and buses fill the streets. LEGO people line the sidewalks and sit at outdoor caf&eacute;s. LEGO Trains travel through cities and towns and across mountains. Boats, ranging from small leisure boats to ferries and royal yachts sail the MINILAND rivers. There are even working harbors and locks. At the new airport, the planes actually taxi between the gates and the runways.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="3">DUPLO&#174; Land:</A></FONT><BR>
DUPLO Land is for LEGOLAND Park큦 youngest visitors: a colourful, enjoyable playland with attractions such as DUPLO Train, DUPLO Planes and DUPLO Cars.
The themes for this exciting play area reflect the DUPLO product range. There is a police station, a farm and a fire station. All three are equipped with a wealth of details, including light and sound elements.
The 4,000 m DUPLO Land also contains Circus DUPLONI, with its challenging play activities. Every day, the Park's young visitors are invited to help build large DUPLO models. And, of course, the area also has DUPLO bricks by the thousands, ready for play. Parents can also join in the fun.<P>


<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="4">Pirateland:</A></FONT><BR>
Journey into the secret caves of Pirateland and watch Captain Roger and his pirates feast, frolic, serenade se&ntilde;oritas, find treasure and fight Governor Broadside's troops. All with lifesized LEGO brick models.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="5">LEGOREDO&#174; Town:</A></FONT><BR>
The Wild West town of the Park with cowboys, indians, a sheriff, gold diggers, Country and Western music.
Visit the Indian Chief, "Playing Eagle",  and become a member of his tribe. You can buy an Indian feather and bake bread over the camp fire.
In the jailhouse of LEGOREDO Town, you can meet the sheriff and maybe even become his deputy for the day.
In LEGOLDMINING,  you can pan for "gold" and have the "gold" melted into a "gold coin" by the gold digger, who is running the gold mine.
Take the Mine Train into the mountain, where you will see running mine wagons, explosions, gold diggers, etc.
The Timber Ride is a roller coaster in the true Wild West style. You pass the fantastic giant relief "The Great Bison Hunt" in cars made of "hollow logs."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="6">LEGO&#174; Canoe:</A></FONT><BR>
On a splashing canoe, you sail past many animals from the North American wilderness, all built on a 1:1 scale of 1,250,000 LEGO bricks, of course!<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="7">LEGO TECHNIC Land:</A></FONT><BR>
A workshop for those who would like to build exciting, technical models of LEGO TECHNIC elements and test out their functions by combining them with a computer.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><A NAME="8">Traffic School:</A></FONT><BR>
Children from 8-13 years of age are given a 20-minute course on traffic safety. The course is supervised by a skilled instructor, who directs the students while they drive their cars.
When completing the course, the children receive their own LEGOLAND driver's license.<P>
- These are just some of all the exciting rides in LEGOLAND Billund.
You have to come and explore it for yourself!!!
