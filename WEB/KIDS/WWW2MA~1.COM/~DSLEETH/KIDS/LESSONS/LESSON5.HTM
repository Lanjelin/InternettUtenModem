Lesson 5 - Organizing Files Is Like Organizing the Fridge
      </h2></center>
      <h2>
How Do You Keep Track Of All Those Files?
      </h3>
      <p>
      <font size=4>
As you know,&nbsp;  a file is a collection of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It has a name,&nbsp;  a size and a date.
DOS computers allow names that are 8 characters maximum,&nbsp;  then a dot,&nbsp;  then a 3 character maximum
extension.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Such as readme.txt or lesson5.htm.&nbsp;&nbsp;  After working with a computer
for a while,&nbsp;  you can end up with a huge quantity of files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So,&nbsp;  'they' invented directories.
   <p>
Directories were invented to help you organize your files,&nbsp;  but,&nbsp;  they often seem
to confuse people.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The people at Apple call directories 'Folders' but that doesn't help
much either.&nbsp;&nbsp;  One of the reasons it doesn't help is that people are not used to putting
folders inside folders inside other folders,&nbsp;  however that is exactly what you do with Directories.
   <p>
Think of directories as <b>boxes</b> to put things in.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Boxes,&nbsp;  with things
in them,&nbsp;  can be put inside other boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We do it all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Look inside your
kitchen,&nbsp;  your kitchen is a big box.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Inside that box is a refrigerator box and a lot of cupboard
boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We don't need to label the kitchen box with a sign that says 'Kitchen' because
everyone has learned what the kitchen looks like.&nbsp;&nbsp;  However with directories on our
hard drive,&nbsp;  we can't actually see the boxes so we label (name) them so we can see them,&nbsp;  and
know which box we are in.
   <p>
So let's walk into the 'kitchen' directory-box.&nbsp;&nbsp;  In DOS you do that by typing
cd \ Enter to make sure you are starting fresh (at the 'root',&nbsp;  more later) and then typing
cd kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is all in your head,&nbsp;  of course,&nbsp;  you probably don't have
a directory-box called 'kitchen' on your hard drive,&nbsp;  but you could.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And for sure
you do in your house.
   <p>
So now we are in the kitchen directory-box.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Over there is the 'refrigerator' directory-box.
Everyone recognizes it but it could have a label and if it was a directory-box on your
hard drive,&nbsp;  you might call it 'fridge'.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is a directory-box inside the kitchen directory-box.
   <p>
Here comes a very important fact that will cause you no end of grief until you really 'get it'.
Directories,&nbsp;  with files in them,&nbsp;  can be inside other directories,
   <b>AND YOU CAN'T SEE INSIDE UNTIL YOU GO IN</b>.
   <p>
You can't see what's in the fridge until you open the door!  Inside the fridge,&nbsp;  once you open the door
is a bunch of files,&nbsp;  I mean food,&nbsp;  and a lot of other little directory-boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  What's
inside those other directory-boxes?  WHO KNOWS!  YOU CAN'T TELL TILL YOU GO IN THEM!
   <p>
Sure some of them are labelled,&nbsp;  like 'Milk'.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But you don't really know it's milk until
you peak inside!  It could be gravy from last week,&nbsp;  or it could be anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Same
with all those other little Tupperware directory-boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some have labels,&nbsp;  but that doesn't
mean that the label is right - you have to look inside.
   <p>
So,&nbsp;  with directory-boxes on your hard drive,&nbsp;  you can put boxes inside boxes.
Here is a picture of a Windows95 DOS box showing a directory-box called 'word' with 4 files in it.
      <p>

      </center>
      <p>
You can
make a directory-box inside another directory-box and call it Docs.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Inside the Docs
directory-box you can put document files.
      <p>
      <center>
   <img src="IMAGES/DOCS.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/docs.gif">
      </center>
      <p>
<b>IMPORTANT</b> Please notice in the picture above that I have typed <tt><b>dir</b></tt>
to list what is in the directory-box <b>and I can't see FILE_A.DOC,&nbsp;  FILE_B.DOC and ADDRESS.DOC and LETTER.DOC
because I am in a different directory-box</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can only see the names of the files and directory-boxes
that are inside the same box as you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You can't see the files and directory-boxes
that are in the Kitchen,&nbsp;  without going into the Kitchen.
<p>



Now you decide you want to separate personal
documents from business docs so you make a directory-box called 'mystuff' inside the
directory-box called Docs.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now in Docs you have both files and a directory-box.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is very
common and the way things work.
<p>
[NOTE: This next screen shot will show you the whole process of changing from
one directory to the <tt><b>word</b></tt> directory to the Docs directory and
then making a new directory called mystuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I have made comments,&nbsp;  which start
with <tt><b>REM</b></tt> just to show you the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fully understanding
how to do all this is the subject of future lessons.]
      <p>
      <center>
   <img src="IMAGES/MYSTUFF1.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/mystuff1.gif">

   <img src="IMAGES/MYSTUFF3.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/mystuff3.gif">
      </center>
      <p>
Then time goes by and you accumulate lots of files in 'mystuff' so
you decide to make another directory-box inside Docs
for 'HisStuff'.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Now you have files and two directory-box inside the directory-box called Docs.
   <p>
After a while,&nbsp;  the directory-box MyStuff gets a lot of stuff in it so you make a directory-box
inside MyStuff called OldStuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;  And on and on until you have a real rats nest in there.
Now you know what hard drives look like.
   <p>
When you are thinking about how files are stored on the hard drive,&nbsp;  think of them as
in directory-boxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The whole hard drive then,&nbsp;  can be thought of as one big
directory-box with many files and directory-boxes in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;  This outer box is called
the <i>Root</i> directory and is shown on the screen as '\'.
   <p>
The name of the
hard drive,&nbsp;  or floppy drive for that matter is C: or A: or B: or D: etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Most
directory-boxes are named by you,&nbsp;  for example 'mystuff',&nbsp;  but that first big
'Mother of all Directory-Boxes' is named by the computer and is always called \,
which is a pretty silly name.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So we call it 'root',&nbsp;  which is just a silly nickname
for the silly name \.
      <p>
      <center>
   <img src="IMAGES/ROOT.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/root.gif">
      </center>
      <p>
Now,&nbsp;  when a program manual tries to fool you by telling you to change to your 'Root'
directory,&nbsp;  you will know that you don't have to search all over your hard drive
for the directory-box called 'Root'.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You know that 'Root' is just the silly nickname
for the 'Mother of all Directory-Boxes' called \.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You also may know that the DOS
command to change directories is CD.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So you simply type cd \,&nbsp;  meaning change directory to \ or Root!
I wonder how many thousands of hard drives have had a directory named 'root' made
on them by people who have not read these lessons,&nbsp;  so they can <i>Change to the root directory</i>?
