Lesson 4 - Files Are Like LP Records
	</h2></center>
	<h2>
The Record Comparison
	</h3>
	<h4>
	<p>
One way of understanding something is to compare it
to something that you already know.
	<p>
	<h3>
LP Records
	</h3>
First of all what basically is a file?&nbsp;&nbsp;  One comparison is to
records,&nbsp; I mean the record player,&nbsp; 33 RPM vinyl records that have been replaced by CD's.
If you are too young to remember these,&nbsp; then just think of audio CD's.
	<p>
If you look at the surface of a record,&nbsp; you can see where each of the 'cuts' or songs
is.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each one of these songs represents a file.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is a file of audio information,&nbsp;
that can be understood and turned into music by your stereo player.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each <i>song file</i>
has a title,&nbsp; a length and a location on the record.
	<p>
Each <i>computer file</i> has
a title,&nbsp; a length and a location.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We cannot make use of the contents of a <i>computer file</i>
without a computer and a program to understand the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We can't make use of
the <i>song file</i> without a stereo that has been programmed to understand that type of record.
Although all <i>song files</i> are essentially the same,&nbsp; we classify them as rock,&nbsp; classic
and so on,&nbsp; according to what is inside the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We do the same with computer files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We
call them graphics files,&nbsp; text files and programs,&nbsp; depending on what is inside the file.
	<p>
Having songs on a record or CD is not hard
to understand,&nbsp; and yet they are very similar to computer files,&nbsp; so files in a
computer system can't be too hard to understand either.
	<p>
One of the things you
often do with computer files is to copy them,&nbsp; from one place to another.&nbsp;&nbsp;  With records,&nbsp;
you can copy a song from the record to a tape,&nbsp; but
you can't copy it to another record.
	<p>
Computer files can be copied more easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The reason for this is that a stereo player can only play files,&nbsp; it can read them and turn them into sound
and put that sound on the output device,&nbsp; the speakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  This is what is meant by read only files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  But
a stereo player can not write files,&nbsp; whereas a tapedeck can and a computer can.
	<p>
The computer can read files and put them on the output device.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It can also <i>write</i> files.
It has to be this way or you wouldn't be able to copy files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So while songs on a record
and computer files on a hard disk are very very similar,&nbsp; the one major advantage that computers
have is that they can <b>make</b> the files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's like you have your own recording studio
for computer files!

On a LP Record,&nbsp; you may have about a dozen files (songs).&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is not too hard to keep
track of 12 files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You can quite easily pick up the needle and put it down on the 4th
file.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Even if a computer hard drive was limited to about 12 files,&nbsp; you still can't see them.
So in a computer system,&nbsp; there is no such thing as the 4th file over,&nbsp; but,&nbsp; instead,&nbsp; you
just refer to the files by their names.
	<p>
It you want DOS to put 'play' the file called wp.exe,&nbsp; you simply type <tt><font size=5> wp </font></tt>.
Or,&nbsp; if you want to see what is inside a file,&nbsp; you can use the DOS command
<tt><font size=5> type </font></tt> and tell DOS to <tt><font size=5> type readme.txt </font></tt>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
DOS will 'play' the file <tt><font size=5> readme.txt </font></tt>.
	<p>
While the old records had about 12 files,&nbsp; modern hard drives can have many thousands
of files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  This could be very difficult to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is the reason,&nbsp; and I guess the only
reason,&nbsp; that there are <i>directories</i>,&nbsp; so you can organize all your files.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which leads up to the next lesson!
