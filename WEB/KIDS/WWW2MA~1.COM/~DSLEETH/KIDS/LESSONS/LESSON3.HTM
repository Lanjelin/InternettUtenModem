Lesson 3 - Files,&nbsp; the Overview
	</h2></center>
	<h4>
The idea about files and directories is very important and actually
if you can get a firm grasp of files,&nbsp;
you are then on the downward side of the learning curve.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If you understand files,&nbsp;
you'll be able to figure out most things,&nbsp; and a lot of the black magic involved
in using a computer,&nbsp; and a lot of the fear,&nbsp; will simply disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;
These lessons will spend a lot of time talking about files.
	<p>
First I'll give a quick overview of files and then we will make comparisons
between files and things you already know.
	<h3>
What do I mean by <i>Files</i>?
	</h3>
Files are clumps of computer data stored somewhere in your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each file has a
name,&nbsp; a location,&nbsp; and a length,&nbsp; and usually a date of when it was last changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Files are stored in several places.
	<ul>
	<dd><li>
on floppy disks
	<dd><li>
on hard drives
	<dd><li>
on CD's
	<dd><li>
in the computers memory (RAM)
	<dd><li>
in the computers special read only memory (ROM)
	<dd><li>
on tapes of a tape back-up device.
	</ul>
Any files that are in the memory of the computer are lost when the power is turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That is not as scary as it sounds because what you usually have in memory is only a temporary
copy of the file,&nbsp; the original stays on the hard drive or floppy or wherever
it is usually kept.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pretty well the only time the original is in memory is
when you are creating a new file and haven't saved it yet.

	<h3>
What Do Files Do?
	</h3>
Files hold and store information that can be read by the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's all they do.

	<h3>
What Kinds of Files Are There?
	</h3>
All files are basically the same,&nbsp; they all have a name,&nbsp; a location,&nbsp; a date and
they all hold information.&nbsp;&nbsp;  However,&nbsp; they can hold lots of different kinds
of information,&nbsp; so we often think of this as different kinds of files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Actually
it is just the type of information that is different.
	<p>
Here are some of the main types of files you will encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;  They often
have certain letters at the end of their names so you can tell from their names what sort
of information is inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Some files you can easily look at the information
inside and many others you can't,&nbsp; at least not without a program that is
specifically designed to look inside that type of file.

	<h3>
What do you do with files?
	</h3>
What you do with a file depends on the type of information that it holds,&nbsp; but
some things can be done with all files.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<ul>
	<dd><img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Run them - if they hold a program.
	<p>
	<dd><img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Look inside them,&nbsp; if they hold graphics information or text.
	<p>
	<dd><img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Listen to them,&nbsp; if they hold audio information.
	<p>
	<dd><img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Copy them - this is one of the main things you will do.&nbsp;&nbsp;  When you run
a program,&nbsp; what actually happens is that the file,&nbsp; with the program inside,&nbsp; is copied from the long term
storage device into the RAM,&nbsp; where its' list of instructions are executed (run).&nbsp;&nbsp;  You also copy files from
a floppy to your hard drive or from one place on your hard drive to another.
	<p><dd>
   <img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Move them - This is like copying except that the original is NOT left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is often safer to copy a file from one place to another and then delete the original,&nbsp;
once you are sure the copy went well.
	<p><dd>
   <img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Delete them.&nbsp;&nbsp;  When you no longer need a particular file,&nbsp; you can zap it.
	<p><dd>
   <img src="IMAGES/BLTBLUE.GIF" tppabs="http://www2.magmacom.com/~dsleeth/kids/lessons/images/bltblue.gif">
Create them.&nbsp;&nbsp;  When you compose a document in a word processor or any other
program such as an editor or spreadsheet,&nbsp; you are creating a new file.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Usually
saving goes hand in hand with creating.
	</ul>
	<p>
That is enough for an overview.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You probably now are pretty sure what I mean
when I talk of a file.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Next comes two comparisons of files to things that
are familiar and then a sort of history of files.&nbsp;&nbsp;  A lot of this
information is repeated again and again,&nbsp; so if you don't understand what I mean,&nbsp;
don't worry about it,&nbsp; I'll be saying it again later!&nbsp;&nbsp;  As I said,&nbsp; getting a firm
grasp of handling files is essential to becoming a computer guru.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's almost
all you need.
