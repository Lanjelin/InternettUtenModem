<p><a name="top"><strong>Let&#180;s meet in G&ouml;teborg, April 1997</strong></a></p>
<p><a name="top">Sweden and G&ouml;teborg welcome you to the 3rd Swimming World Short Course Championships the 
17-20 of April 1997. The competitions will be held in Scandinavium, one of the largest indoor 
arenas i Scandinavia. There we will build a pool with the same size as in Valhallabadet, the 
competition pool for the European Cup in 1982. This will assure a very special feeling for the 
athletes, officials, representatives for media and spectators. Anything like this has never been done.</a></p>
<p><a name="top">In December 1993 the 1st Swimming World Short Course Championships was held in an indoor 
pool in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. Two years later a pool was built at the famous beach 
Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the 2nd Swimming World Short Course Championships. 
The 3rd in G&ouml;teborg will be a mix of Palma and Rio. The difference is that the Championships will 
be held in April. Therefore all the world best swimmers can participate as the NCAA 
Championships are held in March. Many of the best swimmers in the world study and swim at 
various universities in the USA. In April they can be in G&ouml;teborg for an excellent performance 
closing the short course season.</a></p>
<p><a name="top">But we have choosen G&ouml;teborg as a competition site also for other reasons. The Scandinavium is 
situated in the centre of G&ouml;teborg and everything, just everything, is within walking distance from the 
pool. The hotels are just some hundred meters away, both for the delegates, officials, athletes and 
representatives of the media. Just a few minutes walk from the hotels you will find restaurants of all 
kinds, shopping, theaters, cinemas, concerthalls and other facilities you might be interested in.</a></p>
<p><a name="top">We would also like to point at the easy access to G&ouml;teborg, by air, ferry or rail and the fact that 
almost everybody in G&ouml;teborg speeks English. In 1982 G&ouml;teborg hosted the European Cup in 
Swimming and since the World- and European Championships in various sports, i.e. European 
Championships in football and in 1995 the World Championships in Athletics were arranged in 
G&ouml;teborg. So, the city is used to and has a well known knowledge of arranging world class 
competitions.</a></p>
<p><a name="top">Close to the competition site there is a centre of congress and exhibition where clinics and 
congresses can be arranged in connection with the 3rd Swimming World Short Course 
Championships.</a></p>
