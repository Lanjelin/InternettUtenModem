<BR><BR CLEAR="all"><BR> In 1826 Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion, who had
just deciphered the mystery of hieroglyphs, opened a section at the Louvre which
was dedicated to Ancient Egypt. He created this museum by purchasing the
collections of the British and French consuls in Egypt.</P>
<P>From the mid XIXth century, the department began to grow, thanks to
purchases of private collections, to the division of objects found during
excavations, in particular those of August Mariette in Saqqara, to acquisitions
made during sales of collections made up in Egypt, and to digs led by the French
Institute of Oriental Archeology in Cairo.</P>
