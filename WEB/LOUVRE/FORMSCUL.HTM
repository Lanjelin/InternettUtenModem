<P>In 1794, when the slaves sculpted by Michelangelo for the tomb of Jules II
came into the Louvre after they were seized as <I>&eacute;migr&eacute;s'</I>
property, they formed an exception. In fact, until then only antique sculpture
had been allowed in the museum.<BR>In 1824 five rooms, dedicated to the works
of the XVIth and XVIIIth centuries, were opened under the name &quot;Galerie
d'Angoul&ecirc;me&quot;. The Middle Ages were incorporated after 1850. In 1863,
the addition to the Louvre of the Campana collection enriched the small core of
Italian sculpture.
</P>
<P>After the war in 1870, Louis Courajod determined to make his department into
a &quot;living progression of the history of French sculpture&quot;. Formerly
part of the Antiquities department, the Department of Sculptures only achieved
autonomous status in 1893. Since then, the collections have continuously grown
in size.</P>
