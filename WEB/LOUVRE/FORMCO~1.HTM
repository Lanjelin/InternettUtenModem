<H3>How the Collection was Formed</H3>
<P>Since 1847 the Louvre has included an <I>Assyrian museum</I> which was
closely linked to the archeological discovery of the Ancient Orient. Paul-Emile
Botta, Ernest Renan, and subsequently Ernest de Sarzez (with the discovery of
the site at Tello and of the Sumer civilisation) encouraged the formation of a
special section. Their efforts were crowned in 1881 with the creation of an
autonomous department of Oriental Antiquities.</P>
<P>The collections bear witness to several civilisations spread over a vast
geographical area: Iran, Mesopotamia, the Levant and Anatolia, Cyprus and Punic
North Africa.
