<H3>How the Collection was Formed</H3>
<P>The &quot;Cabinet des Dessins&quot;, created in 1671 thanks to the
acquisition of the collection of Everard Jabach, and which currently contains
more than 130,000 items, has never left the Louvre. It was subsequently
supplemented by the inestimable fund of drawings by Charles Le Brun, Pierre
Mignard and Antoine Coypel.</P>
<P>The purchase in 1775 of some 1,000 drawings and albums sold by Pierre-Jean
Mariette, which are today considered to be amongst the chefs-d'oeuvre of the
Louvre, demonstrates the growing importance, throughout the XVIIIth century, of
the demands of collectors in this sphere. The fund has grown continuously since,
through purchases and gifts, in particular those of Etienne Moreau-N&eacute;laton
in 1927 and Baron Arthur Chass&eacute;riau in 1934.</P>
<P>The beautiful collection of Baron Edmond de Rothschild, offered to the
Louvre in 1935, is also worthy of mention. Filling an entire amateur's
exhibition room itself, it contains more than 40,000 engravings, close on 3,000
drawings and 500 illustrated books.</P>
