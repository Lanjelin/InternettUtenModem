<P>It was the Sino-American architect Ieoh Ming Pei who took over the first
major part of the modernisation concept for the museum. His project, which
involved the construction of a huge pyramid in the centre of the cour Napol&eacute;on,
was exhibited at the palais de l'Elys&eacute;e in 1983, where it caused
considerable controversy right from the outset. A lifesized simulation was
planned and executed in 1985, when the project was given final approval.</P>
<P>Architect Pei's pyramid, surrounded by fountains, which marks the entrance
to the new museum, thus only constitutes a very small part of renovation works
and enlargements of unprecedented scale. They include the restoration of the
buildings, transformation into exhibition areas of the former Finance Ministry,
creation of an underground parking area for 80 coaches and 600 private cars, a
shopping area (&quot;Carrousel du Louvre&quot;), the French Museum Research
Laboratory, the amphitheatre of the Ecole du Louvre, spaces for the Union des
arts d&eacute;coratifs, technical equipment and fashion presentation rooms.</P>
<P>At road level, the jardin du Carrousel has been redesigned, and the terrace
covering the former avenue du G&eacute;n&eacute;ral-Lemonnier will form a
continuous area linking up the jardin des Tuileries, which has also been
completely restored. This will create 30 hectares of garden area.</P>
