<H4>The Louvre Palace and Museum</H4>
<P>The Louvre Palace and Museum, as a museum institution, extends well beyond
the collections which it houses. When it enters a museum and subjects itself to
the both rational and profane principles of museology, the destiny and
significance of any work of art are profoundly altered. It runs the risk of
simply becoming an inventory number or a forgotten piece.
<BR>Similarly, the extraordinary success of the Louvre has gradually subjected
the public to the rules of a wildly expanding tourist industry.
<BR>It was essential, when defining an audiovisual policy at the Louvre museum,
to leave plenty of space for exploration of the institution itself through the
thousand and one aspects of its life and its organisation, and also through the
main principles by which it is governed, so that, in an awareness of the
unavoidable biases which the museum must display, those visiting the Louvre are
better able to find the path which makes the museum the privileged place in
which they can enjoy their own personal encounter with the work of art.
