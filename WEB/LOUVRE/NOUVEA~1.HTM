<P>The Second Republic and the Second Empire pursued the same policy. The
museum, more of which was opened to the public, continued to extend its
collections and to add new areas, such as those of the Etruscans, Archaic Greece
and the Ancient Orient.</P>
<P>Napoleon III commissioned the architect Visconti to complete the Palace.
Hector Lefuel, who succeeded him on the site, led the work and imposed his ideas
in an excessive and self-opinionated manner. The section which separated the two
palaces was torn down, symmetrical blocks enclosed the new cour Napol&eacute;on,
the fa&ccedil;ades were covered with a riot of decoration and the North wing
closed off the whole unit. The Nouveau Louvre, which was inaugurated in 1857,
finally completed the &quot;Grand Dessein&quot; or Grand Design. Transformations
which were completed in 1869 changed the appearance of the South-West wing.</P>
<P>The benefit of these efforts was enjoyed for only two years, since the
palais des Tuileries was destroyed by fire in 1871.</P>
