<P>The medieval fortress from which the present day palace originates was built
by King Philippe Auguste at the end of the XIIth century. The restoration work
on the Cour Carr&eacute;e and the excavation work necessary for construction of
the pyramid and the Carrousel area enabled archeological digs to be undertaken,
and for the various phases of occupation of the palace and the quarter to be
seen. <BR>The architectural structures of the basement will henceforth be
included in the visit tours. Thus it is possible to walk along the moats of the
medieval fortress under the Cour Carr&eacute;e, to pass around the base of the
dungeon to get to the salle Saint-Louis (XIIIth century), or, when going to the
underground carpark, to walk along the so-called Charles V moats.</P>
<P>Amongst the items discovered during these digs, one of the most remarkable
is a parade helmet belonging to Charles VI, which was reconstituted from the one
hundred and sixty nine fragments which were found scattered about. It is on show
in the Salle Saint-Louis (Sully Wing).
