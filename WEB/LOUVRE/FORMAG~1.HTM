origin of the collections in this department dates back to those of Fran&ccedil;ois
Ier and Henri IV, to which were added those of Richelieu and Mazarin in the
XVIIth Century. Special collections, the property of &eacute;migr&eacute;s which
were seized under the Revolution, make up a museum of antiques which was planned
in 1795 and opened in 1800 when the works requisitioned by Bonaparte during his
campaigns in Italy arrived at the Louvre.</P>
<P>When Napoleon fell, most of the antiques which came in during the period of
the Revolution and the Empire found their way back to Italy, with the exception
of those which were then bought from their owners. Various donations (the <I>Venus
de Milo</I> in 1821) and purchases of collections (Tochon in 1820, Chevalier
Durand in 1825 and 1836) were supplemented during the reign of Charles X by the
results of digs and scientific explorations. Worthy of particular mention are
the arrival at the Louvre of the collection of the Marquis de Campana in 1862
and the dispatch by Champoiseau in 1863 of the <I>Winged Victory of Samothrace</I>
which, twenty years later, was positioned where it still stands today, at the
top of the Daru staircase. The terracotta vases and statuettes make up an
exceptional ensemble which ranks amongst the finest in the world.</P>
