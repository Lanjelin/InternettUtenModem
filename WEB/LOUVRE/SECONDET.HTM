<H3>100 secondes pour une oeuvre</H3>
<P>The short films dedicated to the plastic arts - paintings, sculptures,
antiquities, objets d'art, are generally suspected of not showing enough
respect. However it is rare for anyone to spend more than 7 to 10 seconds in
front of an exhibit.<BR> Offering 100 seconds of attentive and progressive
discovery of a work breaks the record for the normal time dedicated to each of
the works seen during a visit.
<BR>Filming art means showing it, guiding.
<BR>The plastic arts benefit from being associated with the cinema: the light,
the framing, relating the parts to the whole, the rhythm, the sound and the
music which are forms of commentary.
<BR>How can we dissociate works of art from the gaze that gives them their
mystery and their magic? The cinema makes it possible to preserve this gaze and
it thus becomes an indissociable element of the work.
<BR>This series aims to entertain, surprise, amuse and reveal. Produced by
film-makers and directors from throughout the world, these showings of a work in
100 seconds, which exclude technical commentary in favour of poetry and humour,
are free and subjective visions of works from the museum's collections.
