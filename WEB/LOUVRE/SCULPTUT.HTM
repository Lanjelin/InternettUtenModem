<H3>Sculptures</H3>
<P>Sculpture is so intimately a part of our civilisation, integrated into
monuments, the fa&ccedil;ades of buildings, garden decoration or in the centre
of squares, that it ends up being forgotten. Asleep in their architectural and
urban frames, the works are only extremely rarely examined on their own merit.
<BR>At the museum, protected, staged, taken out of context, out of the period
in which they were born, frequently transformed by time, they lose some of their
meaning.
<BR>The &quot;Sculptures&quot; series aims to encourage us to look in greater
depth at some of them, selected without any notion of classification, as key
works within art history. It is to be a journey through time, highlighting
famous works, listening to the signals which they emit, the emotion which they
contain, the history in which they are steeped.
<BR>Each film will relate to one sculpture within the Louvre museum's
collections (followed by those of other French and foreign museums). It is an
attempt, both rational and sensitive, to unveil the mysteries of such works.
