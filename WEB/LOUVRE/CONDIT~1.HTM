<H3>Why works of art should not be touched</H3>
<P>Works of art are unique and fragile.<BR> They have survived centuries and
must be preserved for future generations.
<BR>Touching, even lightly, a painting, object, sculpture or piece of furniture
causes damage. <BR>Especially when this gesture is repeated thousands of times.
<BR>Help us protect our common heritage.
