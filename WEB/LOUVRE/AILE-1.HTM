<P>It was President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand who took the decision to
transfer the offices of  5,000 civil servants of the Ministry of Finance from
the north wing of the Louvre palace to Bercy (in the east of Paris). This
liberated 22,000 m&#178; of exhibition area, and initiated the second stage of
the project.</P>
<P>The Richelieu Wing was inaugurated by President Mitterrand on 18th November
1993, the date of the Louvre museum's bicentenary.</P>
<P>The Richelieu Wing houses the following collections: French sculptures,
around two roofed courtyards (cour Marly and cour Puget); and the first part of
the itinerary of Oriental Antiquities and Islamic Art, notably with the cour
Khorsabad.  The first floor is dedicated to Objets d'art; the second floor
includes Flemish and Dutch paintings, that benefit from a new natural lighting
system. On the same floor starts the itinerary of French paintings. Two caf&eacute;s
and various documentation rooms are also available to the public.
