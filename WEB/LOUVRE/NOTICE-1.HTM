<H1>The Louvre Server</H1>
<P>With effect from 14th July 1995, it has been possible to connect to the
Louvre museum server on the Internet at the address http://www.louvre.fr/.</P>
<P>Designed as an introduction to a visit to the museum, this server provides
the following information:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The chapter &quot;Magazine&quot; aims to periodically highlight a work
taken from the museum's collection via an article written by one of the curators
of the Louvre. You will also find information on the new features of the museum
under this heading (only available in the French version).</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Practical Information&quot; provides timetables, admission charges,
access and visit information for the museum.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Cultural Activities Programme&quot; describes the current programme
of temporary exhibitions (in English) and series of lectures, symposia, films
and concerts (only available in French).</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Publications and Databases&quot; provides a bibliography of printed
publications (some of which are in English), audiovisual and interactive
productions (in French) produced by  the Louvre museum, as well as information
about the museum's databases.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;The Collections&quot; presents a selection of the works of art from
each of the seven departments of the museum.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Two titles &quot;The Louvre Palace and Museum&quot; and &quot;The Grand
Louvre&quot; trace the history of the Louvre from the fortress to the pyramid.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Partners and Mailboxes&quot; permits a dialogue between the visitors
of the site and the Louvre museum, and also gives a list of partners and other
Internet sites which are accessible via the Louvre server.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>The &quot;Survey&quot; will help us to better know the visitors of our
site.</LI></UL>
<P>The Louvre server has been designed and developed entirely by the Louvre
museum itself, which holds exclusive rights to all the elements of the server:
text, commentaries, photographs, music and in general terms, all contributions
which are protected by the provisions of the Intellectual Property Code.</P>
<P>Reproduction and/or representation of all or part of the server for any
purpose other than private use by the public is prohibited and will be liable to
the penalties laid down in the law of 4th February 1994.</P>
<P>Modification, addition or removal of any element of the server whatsoever is
strictly prohibited.</P>
<P>The Louvre Museum refuses all liability with respect to the information
appearing in the server, and recommends that those using the server should
contact the museum for confirmation of rendez-vous points, timetables and other
information which may be the subject of updates.</P>
<P>The data in the programme makes no claim to be exhaustive, and persons using
the server who wish to acquire a greater depth of knowledge for purposes other
than simple consultation of the server for personal use, are recommended to
supplement this information from other sources. The Louvre Museum cannot be held
responsible for the incomplete or controversial nature of the information
appearing in this server.</P>
<P>The Louvre Museum accepts no responsibility for setting up and monitoring
the proper technical functioning of the network. It refuses all liability as
regards any incidents which may occur at any time and for any duration, such as
interruptions to the server, irregular screen projection, breakdown of
interactive links or any other difficulty which may make movement within the
program difficult or impossible.</P>
<P>All persons connected are exclusively responsible for payment of the
telecommunications, subscription and equipment expenses associated with their
use of the Internet, for which the Louvre may not be held liable.</P>
<P>These directions constitute a fundamental and determining condition for the
provision of the Louvre programme by the Louvre Museum. Each person connected to
the Louvre programme undertakes to read this instruction first and to respect
all of its terms.</P>
