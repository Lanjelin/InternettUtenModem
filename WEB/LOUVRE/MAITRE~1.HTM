<H4>Au Louvre avec les Ma&icirc;tres </H4>
<P>This film invites us on an original journey, that of the Louvre undertaken
by artists in the XIXth and XXth centuries. The Louvre is and always has been a
place of inspiration, of apprenticeship, of reference.
<BR>Courbet made his d&eacute;but there, Degas made innumerable copies, C&eacute;zanne
came there right up to the end of his life. In more recent times, Picasso,
copying the <I>Femmes d'Alger</I>, asked himself: &quot;I wonder what Delacroix
would say if he saw these pictures. I would say to him: you think of Rubens and
paint Delacroix. Similarly, when I think of you, I paint something else.
<BR>Thus, through their witnesses, their writings, their sketch books and their
paintings, these artists make the Louvre into a privileged place in which
creation has taken shape and been nurtured for two centuries.
