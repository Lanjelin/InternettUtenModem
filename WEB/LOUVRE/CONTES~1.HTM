<H3>Contes et l&eacute;gendes</H3>
<P>To make her films, Edwige Kertes brings together museum stars which no-one
before her could have imagined filming together, all with the watchful
complicity of the curators of the departments concerned. These are stars which
live in frequently very different display cabinets, in distant galleries,
because they don't all come from the same periods. We discover this fact from
the closing credits, in which the main characters used are listed in order of
appearance, with their names and their precise historical origins. Thus we have
a goddess Hathor from 1250 B.C. and, in the same story, with a dog Anubis from
the IIIrd century B.C., a crocodile (the god Sobek) dating from 500 B.C.
<BR>Thanks to the voice of Muriel Bloch, the statuettes become characters, the
amulets become d&eacute;cors to which are added authentic landscapes filmed
where the items originate (Egypt, Greece etc.). Edwige Kertes has not only
created a new type of fictional film, but above all, a new genre of art film
specially intended for children.
