<H3>How the Collection was Formed</H3>
<P>The Louvre museum has custody of approximately 6,000 European paintings,
completed between the end of the XIIIth century and the middle of the XIXth
century. As the conservatory of French painting, the Louvre also aims to reflect
all the artistic cultures of Europe. Its origin goes back to the &quot;Cabinet
des tableaux&quot; constituted at Fontainebleau by Fran&ccedil;ois I at the
beginning of the XVIth century, which was greatly enriched from the beginning of
the XVIIth century. At the end of Louis XIV's reign it included 1,478 paintings
by the masters, making it one of the richest European collections of the time.</P>
<P>When the &quot;Mus&eacute;um des Arts&quot; was opened at the Louvre in
1793, the collections from the &quot;Acad&eacute;mie royale de peinture et de
sculpture&quot; and paintings confiscated from &eacute;migr&eacute;s and the
church were added to the royal fund of paintings.</P>
<P>For the sake of clarity for visitors, the works were organised in 1794 into
national schools. Since then there has been an active policy of increasing the
collections; purchases (Campana collection in 1862) and donations (Doctor La
Caze, 1869; Thomy Thi&eacute;ry, 1902; Moreau-N&eacute;laton, 1906; Chauchard,
1909, etc.) have enriched the collection of paintings.</P>
<P>When the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay was created in 1986, most of the post 1848
works left the Louvre and went to join the Impressionists in this new
establishment which is close by. Since then, the collections in the Louvre have
been reorganised on the 2nd floor around the Cour Carr&eacute;e, Sully Wing
(French paintings), and in Richelieu Wing (Northern and French schools) and
Denon Wing (Italian and Spanish paintings).</P>
