<P>The S&egrave;vres porcelain factory, personal property of the King since
1759 (still a state factory) played a major role in the evolution of style in
the XVIIIth century, for several reasons: <BR></P>
<UL>
<LI>a rigorous choice of key artists, recruited for the creation of models as
well as for their execution (for example the silversmith J.-Cl. Duplessis, the
painter J.-J. Bachelier, the sculptors E.-M. Falconnet et L.-S. Boizot) ;</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI> an energetic corporate and artistic management, closely observed by the
directors of the &quot;B&acirc;timents du Roi&quot;, in particular the count of
Angiviller.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the interest of the King and the court, whose insatiable taste for luxury
and novelty stimulated the creative imagination of the S&egrave;vres artists;</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>almost total liberty of creation for the artists who, working under royal
protection, did not feel subject to the economic contingencies of rentability.
</LI></UL>
<P>To avoid  &quot;heavyness and the trivial&quot;, to give &quot;lightness,
subtlety, novelty and variety&quot;, those were the orders given around 1750 by
the first artistic director of the factory, the academician Hendrick van Hulst;
these orders were largely respected by his successors for whom the S&egrave;vres
factory was an immense territory of exploration.
