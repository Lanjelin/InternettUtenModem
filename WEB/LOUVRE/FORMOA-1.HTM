<H3>How the Collection was Formed</H3>
<P>Custodian of the Crown Jewels of France and the illustrated vases collected
during the XIIth century by Abbot Suger, added to the Louvre in 1793, the
Department of Objets d'Art can also consider itself one of the heirs to the
Crown Furniture Repository, of which a large proportion of the collections came
to the Louvre in 1796.<BR> Similarly to the other departments, it also
benefited from seizures at the time of the Revolution.</P>
<P>Edme-Antoine Durand in 1825 and Pierre R&eacute;voil in 1828 both sold the
Louvre their representative collections of Medieval and Renaissance arts,
forming a coherent ensemble of items in all manner of materials. In 1830 the
Treasury of the Order of the Holy Ghost, built up by Henri III and remaining
almost intact, came in its turn into the Louvre. The Second Empire saw a new and
spectacular extension to the collection, with the creation in 1852 of the mus&eacute;e
des Souverains, the donation in 1856 of the Charles Sauvageot collection, and in
1862 the addition of the Campana majolica collection. The arrangement of the
museum become more structured between 1861 and 1863, when the galerie d'Apollon
was in turn made into an exhibition gallery.</P>
<P>After 1870, the collections of the Mus&eacute;e des Souverains regained
their original destination, but the musem receives furniture and objects from de
Saint-Cloud and Tuileries palaces. In 1901, the collection of XVIIth and XVIIIth
centuries is inaugurated.</P>
