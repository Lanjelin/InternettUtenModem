half of the XIXth century  <BR CLEAR="all"><BR></P>
<P>In 1882, after twelve years of projects and of beating about the bush, the
demolition of the Tuileries ruins put an end to the building's palatial
function. But Lefuel rebuilt the &quot;Pavillon de Flore&quot; and &quot;Pavillon
de Marsan&quot; blocks and the North wings, which housed the Finance Ministry.
The history of the Louvre Palace henceforth became linked to that of the Museum.</P>
<P>Once again, its appearance was altered with new decorations, for example the
great staircase (1934), which is now dominated by the <B>Winged Victory of
Samothrace</B>, the antichamber of Henri II, the ceiling of which is adorned
with a composition by Georges Braque (1953). As a national museum, the Louvre
has continued through the XXth century to enrich its collections and to display
them to advantage.</P>
<P>But by the seventies, the available space was not longer able to cope with
the growing collections and with the public popularity of the museum. A radical
solution was needed. Thus most of the post 1848 work was transferred in 1986 to
the mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, which was created on the opposite bank of the Seine,
and renovation work began on the Louvre itself.</P>
<P>Everything has been designed in such a way as to allow as many members of
the public as possible to gain access to the museum. A welcoming reception and a
pleasant visit have been prime factors. In the Auditorium, the public are
offered concerts, lectures and films.</P>
<P>By rethinking its function as a museum, the Louvre Palace has rediscovered a
rich and animated life at the heart of the city.</P>
