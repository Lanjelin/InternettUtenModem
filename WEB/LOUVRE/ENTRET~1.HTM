<H3>Entretiens du Louvre</H3>
<P>&quot;Andr&eacute; Chastel, Charles Sterling, Richard Krautheimer, Francis
Haskell - for the first time on television, the veil is lifted from the great
art historians. Beyond their strong personality, their life, their exceptional
destiny which is gradually revealed, each film takes the spectator through the
complexities of their research, which are inextricably linked to the
intellectual history of this century. Four meetings, four warm portraits which
are free of the ponderous nature of traditional interviews.

<DT>Art history is treated as an independent discipline. This is the aim of the
series: <B>Entretiens du Louvre</B>.  In this series, we aim to air all points
of view. Connoisseurship is closest to that of the custodians, whose job it is
to deal with dating and attribution, with a kind of expertise. We intend to show
all the processes, all the trends, and thus to demonstrate the diversity of
research and points of view. Some people aim to create a historical methodology
based on documentary sources, others wish to broadly call upon the human
sciences, others on iconology and iconography, or even on the history of taste
and ideas. In this series, we have attempted to demonstrate this rich variety
through these men. This is why there is no preferred order. Each film is a whole
in itself. Art history is the work of strong personalities.</DT></DL>
<UL>
<LI>Chastel: a rounded personality, he was the most complete French art
historian, and his influence over two generations of art historians, curators
and academics has been quite determining.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI> Sterling: we have shown the role of research for a museum curator.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI> Francis Haskell is the youngest in the series. This film truly grasps the
international activity of an art historian. From Oxford to Paris and to Rome, we
see how the invisible threads are woven, causing each country to develop his
taste and his knowledge of art on a terrain and through a history which is
unique to him.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Richard Krautheimer is the doyen of currently active art historians. He is
both an archeologist and a Renaissance art historian. He thus bears witness to
three lines of experience, German, American and finally Italian. As a specialist
in the first Christian churches, the <I>Corpus</I> which he has produced
enabled us to present one of the essential tools of art history.</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Federico Zeri truly illustrates the vitality of Italy in the sphere of art
history, being without doubt the greatest connoisseur of Italian painting since
Longhi. <BR>Interview with Michel Laclotte, director of the Louvre museum
(1987-1994).</LI></UL>
