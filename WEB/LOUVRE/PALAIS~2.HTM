<P>In 1528, Fran&ccedil;ois Ier had the &quot;grosse tour&quot; destroyed, and
decided in 1546 to transform the former fortress into a luxury residence. The
work, which was supervised by Pierre Lescot, continued under Henri II and
Charles IX, involved two new wings which occupy two sides of the former
fortress. Jean Goujon decorated the fa&ccedil;ade and the great hall of this
Renaissance wing.</P>
<P>In the west, in a place known as the Tuileries, Catherine de M&eacute;dicis
had a huge palace built, which she left incomplete. As soon as he arrived in
Paris in 1594, Henri IV decided to join the Louvre with the Tuileries to form a
gigantic palace. This was the &quot;Grand Dessein&quot; or Grand Design, of
which he had the first stage completed, the Grande Galerie.</P>
<P>Under Louis XIII and Louis XIV, the architects Le Mercier and subsequently
Le Vau built the &quot;Cour Carr&eacute;e&quot;, four times the size of the
former Renaissance courtyard. To the East, facing the city, a committee of
architects, led by Perrault, planned the &quot;colonnade&quot;. Poussin,
Romanelli and Le Brun decorated the apartments and the &quot;galeries&quot;. 
But this golden age enjoyed by the Louvre came to an abrupt end in 1678, when
Louis XIV chose Versailles as his centre of power. The double palace remained
incomplete for a long time. During the entire XVIIIth century, new projects
contributed to the &quot;Grand Dessein&quot; of the Bourbons, which architects
Gabriel and Soufflot are attempting to bring to perfection.
