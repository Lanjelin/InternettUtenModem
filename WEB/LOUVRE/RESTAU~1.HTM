<P>As time went on, the histories of the Palace and of the Museum became
intertwined.</P>
<P>In 1806, Napol&eacute;on arranged for work to be continued by his architects
Percier and Fontaine. The North Wing was extended along the new rue de Rivoli.
Under the Restoration, the museum, which had lost its chefs-d'oeuvre, had to be
restored, and an active acquisitions policy developed in a number of areas. 
<BR>Renaissance and Modern sculptures from the mus&eacute;e des Monuments fran&ccedil;ais
(1824), Egyptian works collected by Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion (1826), the
mus&eacute;e naval (1827), the Spanish collection of Louis-Philippe and Assyrian
antiquities originating from the excavations of Paul-Emile Botta (1847).
</P>
<P>Efforts to improve presentation continued, of which the mus&eacute;e
Charles-X, which was inaugurated in 1827, still remains a living example. The
ceilings of the rooms dedicated to Egyptian and Antique collections are
decorated by huge compositions illustrating the collections presented.</P>
