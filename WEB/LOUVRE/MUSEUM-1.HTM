<P>It was the Revolution which was to accomplish the already very advanced plan
to make the existing collections accessible to the public. A commission was
entrusted with the job of organising the &quot;Mus&eacute;um central des Arts&quot;
which opened in 1793. Apart from the collections of the king and those of the
Academy, it included the property seized from the Church and from &eacute;migr&eacute;s.</P>
<P>After 1794, very many works of art came to the Louvre via the victorious
revolutionary armies, with a view to establishing a major European museum here.
Masterpieces from Italy arrived in Paris with great ceremony in July 1798. The
sheer number of these necessitated a reorganisation of the museum, which was
redecorated and inaugurated in 1800.</P>
<P>Renamed the &quot;mus&eacute;e Napol&eacute;on&quot; in 1803, it continued
to grow under the management of Vivant Denon, via orders, purchases and war
captures. The collection was serious depleted as a result of works which were
returned to the allies in 1815.</P>
