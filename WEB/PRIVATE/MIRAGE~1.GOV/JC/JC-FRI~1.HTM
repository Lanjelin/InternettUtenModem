Some great friends...

<P>
I value my friends more than words could ever express, but I hope to 
illustrate, to at least a small degree, just how wonderful they are
and why I love them.

<P>This picture really only gives you some idea of how funny Andrea
really is. Sometimes she tries so hard...to not be funny. But she can
always make you laugh harder than you ever thought possible, and at the
same time she is one of the most selfless, caring people I know. Of
course, she's also ultra-cool because she plays the french horn too.
(What else needs to be said? =)

<P>I met Audra in 7th grade when she moved to Ames from Maine, 
but we've only become good friends
within the last couple years. Some of our favorite activities 
together include walking in the woods, going to musicals and plays,
dressing up, and playing make believe. She is simply one of the most
unique and beautiful people I know, and it's not an understatement
to say I look up to her (she's 6'3"). She is graced not only with
beauty and kindness, but she also has an artistic eye that has 
developed her love for photography and other forms of art. She wants
to be a fairy when she grows up; as far as I'm concerned, she already is one.

<P>Charles and I discovered the true meaning of a good hoagie as we
visited one of my favorite Italian restaurants every day for lunch
as an excuse to escape from work for an hour. After my job ended, we decided
being friends was actually a pretty cool thing and you can still 
find us watching movies or just hanging out most weekends. Of course,
the best part is Shantih, his cat, who is really just too cool for
words. =)

Rachel
</font>
<BR>
<img src="" ALT="[No picture available]" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>While a year age difference separates us, not much else keeps us
apart. Since our parents were good friends in high school and have been
ever since, we've essentially grown up together. She's a talented figure
skater, clarinet player, and a great runner. We have so many memories
running back to the days of My Little Ponies and homemade videos, we
could laugh for the rest of our lives just remembering them.

<img src="JC-ROB.GIF" tppabs="http://mirage.scl.ameslab.gov/jc/jc-rob.gif" ALT="[Me and Rob]" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>I met Rob via CU-SeeMe, a video-teleconferencing program that allows
you to communicate visually and with audio. In August 1995, we happened
to be in Albuquerque at the same time so we decided to take the opportinty
to meet in person! As you can see, he's about a foot taller than me,
but he's mostly harmless. =) We communicate regularly through email,
and he remains my reliable connection to the CU-SeeMe world when I'm absent.
He's also far beyond cool, and not just because that's what nerds are these
days, but because he's so nice, has a great voice, and is absolutely 
hilarious!!

<P>Sam is so close to me, we're practically sisters (and are often
mistaken as such). Until I met Sam, I had never had so much respect 
for individuality; she is endlessly unique in many beautiful ways. I love
visiting her on her acreage where she keeps her three horses, two dogs,
and an abundant number of cats. In the fall of '96, she will be a
freshman at Colorado State University studying equine science. Because I
know I will miss her so much, I'm counting on taking trips out to see
her, and hopefully we'll have some time and money for our mutally-loved
sport of downhill skiing!

Sarah
</font>
<BR>
<img src="JC-SARAH.GIF" tppabs="http://mirage.scl.ameslab.gov/jc/jc-sarah.gif" ALT="[Me and Sarah]" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>Not only does she have the most beautiful red hair of anyone I know,
Sarah is also one of the most opinionated and respectful people I've met. 
She considers herself very liberal and open-minded and there's no reason 
for anyone to disagree with her on that! Kindness is one of her strongest 
points, but her intelligence is certainly along the same level. One thing we love
about the many road races we run is that we can always run together because we know the
other person isn't worried about running too fast. ;-)
