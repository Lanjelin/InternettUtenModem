Besides caring for the sweetest leopard gecko in existance (aka Jasper, see

activities, such as:

Horseback riding</A>
</font>
<DD>I began riding regularly about eight years ago when I started
attending the riding camp at Camp Hantesa. I fell in love with the sport 
and began taking private lessons when I was about 13. I ride english, 
mostly hunter-jumper, but I've also had some training in dressage. I 
don't ride now as much as I'd like, but I still love the sport and 
consider it one of my favorites.

Cross country <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#361" tppabs="http://sunsite.unc.edu/drears/running/running.html">
running</A>
</font>
<DD>This is really a rather masochistic sport, and I'm not even sure
myself why I enjoy putting myself through this sort of pain. But I
really do love having the endurance to run six miles straight and being
able to say I actually I have some solid muscle in my legs. What I love
even more are the friends I make on the cross country team and the endless
fun we always manage to have.

Music</a>
</font>
<DD>I've been playing the french horn since fifth grade, and I truly
believe it is one of the most beautiful instruments in the world. In
September of 1995, I purchased my first horn: a gorgeous silver-nickel
Holton H179 double horn. I named her <a href="SP01.GIF" tppabs="http://mirage.scl.ameslab.gov/jc/sp01.gif">Angeline</A> and she is quite simply
one of the most wonderful things in my life. I also play a little piano
and love listening to a wide variety of music.

Surfing the Internet</A>
</font>
<DD>Since you're visiting this page, I have a feeling you understand
this little addiction of mine. I don't surf around as much as I used to or as
much as I'd like to, but I love how I always come across the neatest things.

Writing letters for <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#363" tppabs="http://www.amnesty.org/">
Amnesty International</A>
</font>
<DD>If I'm not spending a large portion of my time helping those who need
help, I feel useless and pathetic. I write letters for Amnesty International
because I admire their organization, and I realize there are many violations
of human rights everywhere in the world; I can't let myself just watch it
happen if there's something I can do about it.

Skiing</A>
</font>
<DD>This includes downhill and cross country skiing, but downhill is my
greatest passion. Utah ranks among my favorite when it comes to top ski
resorts! I've also enjoyed hitting the slopes at Breckenridge, Keystone,
Copper Mountain, Arapahoe Basin, and Lake Tahoe. Unfortunately, Iowa doesn't
have much in the way of mountains, and the midwest in general is just stuck
with big hills. When I can't get out to the mountains, I usually hit the
slopes in Minnesota or settle for some nice, relaxed cross country skiing
in the park behind my house.

Belly dancing!!</A>
</font>
<DD>Belly dancing has always fascinated me, but it wasn't until September '95
that I finally acted upon this interest. I took an 8-week course at our
local center for the arts, learned the basics of belly dancing moves,
and absolutely fell in love with the art! It's a great way to relieve
stress, keep in shape, and show off your stomach! In the fall, my school
newspaper printed 
<A HREF="BELLY~1.HTM" tppabs="http://mirage.scl.ameslab.gov/jc/belly.html">an article</A> about people taking this belly dancing class.
There's a great quote by me in there!
