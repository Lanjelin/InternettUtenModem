<P>
<font size=+1>F</font>our seniors at Ames High attend a dance class at
the Octagon Center for the Arts.  This isn't your ordinary dance class;
you won't find any pirouettes or funky jazz steps.  Instead, they are
taught different gyrations of the hips in the ancient Middle Eastern art
form of belly dancing.

Elbert belly dance every Wednesday night from 7 to 8:30.

<font size=+1>T</font>eaching the class is Majeska, who prefers to use
her stage name.  Majeska has been teaching belly dancing in Ames and
Ankeny for five years.  "Belly dancing gives a person not only grace and
a good workout, but also a great deal of confidence," Majeska said. 
Majeska is part of a group which dances at Cafe Northwest the first
Friday of every month.

<font size=+1>T</font>he students are taught a various amount of dances
each week set to Middle Eastern music.  "At first it was sort of hard to
take the class seriously, but now it's a lot of fun and unusual," Slocum
said.

<font size=+1>P</font>eck agrees.  "I just started and I think it's a
really great alternative to your normal everyday exercise," she said.

<P>
<font size=+1>A</font>ccording to Elbert, "belly dancing gives you a
chance to expose yourself in a decent way that people wouldn't expect."

<P>
<font size=+1>N</font>o matter how someone views belly dancing, it
definitely goes beyond the average after school activity.
