<font size=+1>On July 3rd, 1995, Joe Metzger and Stehpen Elbert spent 
the afternoon taking down a 6' antenna and replacing it with a 12' one.
Reason being: our wireless ethernet connection wasn't holding up its
reputation as fast and powerful...in fact, nothing was getting through at
all. Since this kind of setup is relatively new in Ames, Iowa, we
weren't altogether sure what was causing the loss of transmission. We
reasoned that there was probably too much foliage blocking the
transmission between our house and the receiving antenna at Ames Lab,
and the fact that we live low in a valley doesn't really help.
<I>However,</I> the larger antenna, which is about 10 feet higher than
the previous one, helped significantly! I
don't know how much fun it was putting the monstrous thing up, as I stayed
safely on the ground pretty much the whole time, but I certainly had fun
taking pictures with our new <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#401" tppabs="http://www.info.apple.com/qtake/press.html">
Apple QuickTake 150 digital camera!</A> And
here you can see what I ended up with, as well as the dramatic
happenings that took place that day. :-)</P>

First, compare with the old 6' antenna. . .<BR>
