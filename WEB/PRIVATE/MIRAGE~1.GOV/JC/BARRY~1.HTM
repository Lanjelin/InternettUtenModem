If you're looking for a vacation travel destination that blends
excitement with huge amounts of corn, I strongly recommend Iowa.  I
recently spent a few days there, and I can honestly say that it was
comparable to experiences I have had in sophisticated prestige travel
destinations such as Paris, France, in the sense that I was not once
engulfed by hog manure. 
</DD>
</P>

<P>
<DD>
I was concerned about this, however.  The second day I was in Iowa, the
top story on the front page of The Des Moines Register was headlined: 
"THOUSANDS OF FISH KILLED BY MANURE SPILL."
</DD>
</P>

<P>
<DD>
The story stated that a leak in a storage basin at a major hog farm had
resulted in "a mammoth hog manure spill," estimated at 1.5 million
gallons, which--to give you a sense of magnitude--is more than the U.S.
House produces in a week.  
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
The story had said that state officials were especially alarmed because
the manure spilled into a section of the Iowa River considered to be
"one of the most prized canoe areas of the state."  I can see where it
could put a real crimp in a person's canoeing vacation: You're paddling
peacefully down the Iowa River when you hear this faint rumbling noise,
which gets louder and louder until it sounds like a freight train, and
you turn around, and there, thundering right at you--this would be just
like the tidal-wave scene in "The Poseidon Adventure," only more
aromatic--is the dreaded, biblically prophesied Wall of Swine Doots, and
at that instant you realize that even if you do survive, you will never
be welcome in an elevator again.
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
Of course it would be absurd to suggest that everybody who visits Iowa
will be engulfed by manure leaking from storage basins.  Some people
could also be hit by manure shot from guns.  You think I am making this
up, but that is only because you did not read The Wall Street Journal
article about the Iowa hog industry, written by Scott Kilman and sent to
me by many alert readers.  This article states that Iowa's large hog
farms have "huge waste lagoons, some emptied by 'manure guns' that fling
their cargo through the air onto surrounding fields--and occasionally
onto passing cars."
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
I am certainly not in a position to be critical, inasmuch as I live in
Miami, an area also known for shooting at people's cars.  But at least
we have the common decency to use bullets.
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
Anyway, my point is that aside from the manure danger, there's no reason
in the world not to vacation in Iowa, unless you're concerned about
piranhas.  I quote here from an Associated Press story that also
appeared in The Register when I was out there:
</DD>

<DD>
<B>"Sioux City, Ia.--</B>For the second time in a week, a fisherman has
reeled in a piranha from the Missouri River just south of Sioux City's
downtown area. . . . A third report of a piranha came from Blue Lake at
Lewis and Clark Park near Onawa."
</DD>
</P>

<P>
<DD>
The story quotes a state fishery official as saying that piranha reports
are "not unusual" in Iowa.  He also notes, reassuringly, that "piranhas
will bite but so will bluegill, bass and snapping turtles, all of which
can be found in Blue Lake."
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
That certainly makes <I>me</I> feel better.  Clearly the lesson here is
that if you, the Iowa vacationer, would prefer for whatever personal
reason not to be consumed by marine life, it would be wise for you to
refrain from jumping into the water except in an emergency, such as when
you're trying to evade an incoming round of gun-fired hog manure.
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
But aside from the piranhas and the attack manure, I can't think of a
single thing that could possibly spoil your Iowa vacation, unless you
plan to have breakfast.  I refer to a July 14 Register story sent in by
many concerned readers, stating that fire-fighters in Cedar Rapids were
called to the General Mills plant to extinguish--I swear I am not making
this up--"spontaneously igniting Cheerios."
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
So, OK, you have fish attacking, manure rampaging and cereal bursting
into flame.  Also, during July's severe heat wave in Iowa, there were
news reports of--I am not making this up, either--cows exploding.  But I
am still urging you to take your vacation in Iowa.  Why?  I can answer
that question in five words, which you have probably already guessed:
the world's largest popcorn ball.  Yes.  It turns out that Sac County is
the Popcorn Capital of the World, and in an effort to promote this fact
and get in the Guinness Book of World Records, people there constructed
a popcorn ball that is 22 feet in circumference.  It weighs more than a
ton.
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
I'd read an Associated Press article about the popcorn ball, sent to me
by several alert readers, so when I was in Iowa I drove up to Sac County
to take a look at it.  I have seen some of the world's greatest
attractions--the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Canyon, Ray Charles--and I can
honestly say that this popcorn has them all beat, at least in terms of
sugar content.  Jim Stock, president of Stock Popcorn in Lake View, told
me that the popcorn ball, which travels around on its own trailer, is
available on a limited basis to make public appearances.
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
So if you can't get to Iowa this summer, maybe you can arrange to have
what is probably the largest single snack item in the universe come to
your town.  It would definitely add "a touch of class" to any wedding,
bar mitzvah or funeral.
</P>
</DD>

<P>
<DD>
But I hope you can get to Iowa.  I had a great time, and found Iowans to
be extremely friendly.  Of course, that will change once this column
appears.  The state tourism commission will probably come after me.  And
they'll be packing the Doot Gun.
