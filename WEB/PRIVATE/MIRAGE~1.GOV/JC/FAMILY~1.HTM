<H2>My dad's really a goofy guy.</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>Sometimes it's hard to take him seriously, but underneath all 
his silliness is a caring father who swears he tries his hardest to avoid 
embarrassing his daughter with his (often creative) fashion statements.<BR>
<I>On New Year's Eve '94, when this picture was taken, my dad proposed wearing
his cool new hat on our next ski trip. My response? "Um, Dad? Get real."</I>

<P>Carol Elbert works as a children's librarian at the Ames Public Library.
Our house is literally overflowing with children's books, but it's not all 
bad (I get to have stories read to me!). Outside of books, my mom enjoys
cooking (she's a great cook!), spending time with friends, and being
motherly.<BR>
<I>Mom will look happy in any picture, whether she is or not. Or maybe
she's just always happy. =)</I>

<H2>The trials and joys of being Lisa's sister...</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>Having a five year age difference between siblings isn't always easy
(Lisa's 22), but the differences seem to thin out as we forget that we
hate each other and learn we have more in common. I really admire my
sister's artistic ability (she plans to become a photojournalist), her
ability to pick up languages, and her ceaseless
admiration of nature. She's a junior at Carleton College in 
Northfield, MN, and is actively involved in the SCA (Society for
Creative Anachronisms).

<H2>A reptilian side to the family.</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>My parents would probably disagree when it comes to declaring a small
lizard as part of the family, but the truth is, Jasper just makes up the
reptilian side of our family. (and everyone knows the importance of
that!) I bought her November 25, 1994, and she's now a little over a
year old. Her history includes an exciting
move into a bigger cage and the revealing of the fact that she is in
fact female...not male as I had originally thought (which is quite an
interesting story in itself).<BR>
<I>Peering into the GeckoCam from her old cage, Jasper says hello to the
world.</I>
