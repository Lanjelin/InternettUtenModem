<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Live Events Help</H3>


<B>Live Events</B> is your hour-to-hour, day-to-day guide to what's on in
cyberspace.
You'll find a wide variety of programming here: concerts, sporting events,
live interviews, video programming, chats, online games, and radio
broadcasts from all over the world.</P>


<P><B>Live Events</B> is similar to a television programming grid, with a few Web
enhancements thrown in. Live Events lets you narrow
your choices by time, date, service, and programming category (such as
sports and business). </P>

<P><B>When you click</B> on Live Events icon on NetGuide Live's home page,
you're transported to a list of programs happening now somewhere
on the Internet or on online services (America Online, Microsoft Network,
CompuServe, and Prodigy). </P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">How Live Events is arranged</FONT><br><B>Listings are</B>
arranged in columns, with the service, the event name, subject categories
and start time appearing from left to right:<br>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Service name</B> represents a specific programmer, such as
HotWired, AudioNet or America Online, or a "generic" World Wide Web service
(represented in the service column as WWW).<p>

<B>The event name</B> begins with the specific channel on the named service
(or, in the case of events listed as "WWW," with the name of the programmer
Webcasting the event) followed by a brief description of the show, game,
game or chat; clicking on the program description yields a detailed
description. If the event is on the
Net, you'll see a "Go To Event" button that links directly to the site
hosting the chat,
Webcast, or other happening. If the event is on one of the online services
(America Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy), you'll
find
the keyword you need to type when connected to that service.<p>

<B>The category column</B> shows the interest area (sports, for instance)
into which the event falls.<p>

<B>The start time</B> indicates the hour the event starts in Pacific time.
</P> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Program descriptions</FONT><br>
 <B>Clicking on</B> the short program descriptions that appear in Live Events
will yield a detailed description (it will appear immediately below the
general listing of programs in the lower half of the white area) that also
provides information on the type of event
and the kind of software (if any) needed to participate. If the event is on the
Net, you'll see a "Go To Event" button that links directly to the site
hosting the chat,
Webcast, or other happening. If the event is on one of the online services
(America Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy), you'll
find
the keyword you need to type when connected to that service.</P>


<p><font size="+2">Live Events menus</font><br>
<B>Below Live Events</B> itself is a group of menus (they appear in an area
with a purple background) that allow you to narrow your program selection
by date, time, channel or subject category. In the upper left of the box
you'll find a pulldown menu that displays the hours of the day in eight
three-hour segments; in the box's upper right is a pulldown menu that
allows you to select events over a seven-day period (today and the
following six days). To the left below the time menus you'll find a
scrolling menu of programming services; to the right is a scrolling menu of
subject categories. </P>

<P><font size="+2">Live Events examples</font><br>

<B>If you want</B> to see technology-related events for noon on the day you
are viewing, choose "Noon-3pm" in the time menu, ignore the day menu (today
is the default choice), "All Service" in services menu and "Technology" in
the categories menu. </P>

<P><B>If you want</B> to zero in on only those events to be offered
tomorrow on ESPNET SportsZone, you would choose "All Day" in the time menu,
the appropriate day in the day menu, "ESPN SportsZone" in the services
menu, and "All Subjects" in the event menu.</P>

<P><B>Home late</B> on a Friday night--no video stores open, nothing to watc
h on your 97 cable TV channels? Want to see whether there's anything hot on
the Net to divert you? Choose "9pm-Midnight" in the time menu, Friday in
the day menu, "All Services" in the services menu, and "All Subjects" in
the category menu.</P>
