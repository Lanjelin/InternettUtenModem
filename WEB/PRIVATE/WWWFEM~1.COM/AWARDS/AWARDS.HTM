<TR><TD>I have become number one on Team Holm's list of homepages
        made by Danish women. You can go and vote for me again and see 
        their list of other Danish women on the net.

    <TD>The wonderful people at nerd.com have decided to give
        me their "Geek of the Week" award! They have a really
        cute description of my site and you can also go and
        meet some other nerds there. Nerds of the world; unite! *lol*

<TR><TD>Rebecca Kemp and Mike Gallant have given me their "One Foxy Site"
        award. I think this fox picture is just sooo cute and I am proud to 
        display it on my awards page.. (I have always been crazy for animals!)

    <TD>Starr Lyn has welcomed me into the family of proud Diamond Award
        owners. Her homepage is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen
        and I am very grateful she decided to give me this award.

<TR><TD>Godess (and she insists on being spelled this way) gave me this
        darling little award. She also offered med her special &quot;I'm 
        not addicted&quot; award but as we all know, I love the net too much 
        to receive a prize like that.. ;)

    <TD>The first award I ever recieved was the "Magic Elegance Award" from
        Cecilia Price. Thank you so much! It meant a lot to me that people
        started showing their appreciation of my site.

<TR><TD>A flourish woman who calls herself &quot;The Orchid Lady&quot; gave
        me her Hummer Award. Although there aren't many flowers on my page 
        yet - I thought the pink colour was enough (!) she granted this to
        me and I was quite surprised but very happy.
