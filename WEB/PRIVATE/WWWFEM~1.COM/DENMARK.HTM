Denmark is a small but lovely country in the northwestern Europe. It's a constitutional monarchy but officially ruled by our queen Margrethe II. You can click on the picture to go to the royal family's website but unfortunately it on exists in a Danish version. In 1993 we were 5.180.614 people living here but the number is slightly increasing like everywhere else. We speak Danish, which is a language closely related to the other Scandinavian languages but also English and German. It isn't the most pretty language in the world and doesn't sound romantic like French. Foreigners think it reminds them of Dutch. Our capital is Copenhagen with a population of 1.342.679 people. <BR>

Denmark hasn't always been a small country. In the (good) old days Danes were rather possessive. The Vikings (some of my great grandparents...) owned large parts of England, Sweden and Norway but unfortunately we lost a war or something... Greenland and the Faroe Islands have also been a part of Denmark but they are self-governing now. We gave up The West Indies in the beginning of the century. From 1940-45 Hitler had occupied Denmark but we all know how that ended... right? For those of you who don't know: Hitler died... Enough history for today!<BR>

We have lots of stuff for visitors to check out like the ultimate tourist attraction: The Little Mermaid. Personally, I'm not sure I've ever seen it. But all the tourists have! Then we have Tivoli Gardens which is a very old funfair that has rides for the kids and plenty of things to look at for the adults so it's a place for the whole family. Other than that we have a lot of old, beautiful houses - especially in a city named Elsinore which is only 6 km from where I live. I took some pictures of it last spring:<BR>
