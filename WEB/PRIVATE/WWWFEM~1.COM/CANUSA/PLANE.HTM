I don't like alcoholic or carbonated beverages so I had tomato juice, orange juice, water or tea during the whole flight. For dinner I had the chicken. It was actually pretty good! KLM has some very nice airplane food. When I went to Canada I watched Jumanji with Robin Williams and on my way back I watched The Birdcage with... Robin Williams! Jumanji was far better than The Birdcage, though. So much stuff had been censored from The Birdcage that it was actually hilarious just noticing that. Well, let's get back to "<A HREF="CANUSA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/canusa/canusa.htm">My vacation in Canada and USA</A>".
