<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+4>My weekend with UNF</FONT></CENTER>
<BR>I am a member of something called <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#725" tppabs="http://www.unf.dk/unf/info/english.html">UNF</A>; Youth Association of Science and I'm also involved in their Web group which means I am now part of the people who design UNF's homepage. Everyone who works for UNF (we don't get payed) have a couple of special benefits like the weekend party we had on the weekend from Friday the 27th - Sunday the 29th. <BR>
<BR>
Saturday morning I packed a couple of bags with some clothes, my duvet and my pillow, a lunchbox and some homework. I left the house around 11:30 a.m. and the train ride to Copenhagen (our capital) took about an hour so I had a lot of
time to do some homework. I called up one of my friends, Thorbj&oslash;rn (a guy from UNF I know
pretty well... mostly over e-mail, but I have met him twice before) and
told him what time I would arrive at Sor&oslash; (the place we were going).
From Copenhagen I took a train further south west and that was a little
over an hour but I hadn't taken that train before so I was a bit
uncertain how long it would take so I didn't get much homework done
there because I was busy looking out the window. <BR>
<BR>
They picked me up at the station and we drove back to the place we
were staying. The others came Friday
but I didn't want to miss the school's birthday so I decided to come a
day later. These people were really fun to be around! I had met some of
them before... let me see... Thorbj&oslash;rn and Grusjenka and Line... hm... Yeah, I guess I only knew three people but they were all nice so
I was looking forward to meeting some more people from UNF!! And I sure
wasn't disappointed! *grin*<BR>
<BR>
The place we stayed at was some re-built farm and
there wasn't very much room but it was really nice and cosy. There was
one room with a couple of bunk beds, then a room with a table and some
shelves where people also hung their wet towels, two bathrooms, a really
small kitchen in the middle of the house that you had to go through to
get to the living-room. So when four or five people were cooking it was
a bit hard to get past and a few of us had to stand in the room with the
towels. The living-room wasn't very big and it was almost filled by a
couple of tables. From the living-room there was a door to another
bedroom with three bunk beds and there was a door leading to a tiny
bedroom with only one bunk bed. <BR>
<BR>
At night, we put on some fancy
clothes (I wore the purple dress and my boa) and had dinner. Then eight
of us danced lanciers (which was pretty hard because there wasn't much
room) while the rest of them were out getting ready for a little fun
thing that was planned. Around 11:30 p.m. we were split in three teams
and we had a mission to accomplish... To get points solving some
problems and using as many of the requisites we had: A ruler, an
envelope, some green stickers, a nail file, a computer chip, two tiny
silver star-things, an unsharpened pencil, a soft ball (the type cats
play with), a ball pen, some various types of paper and other important
things. And most interesting: "The F****** Manual" (from the wonderful
abbrevation used among nerds: "RTFM" = Read The F****** Manual... It was
so fun! And our group actually won...!! <BR>
<BR>
We were really creative a few places... like "prove all numbers are interesting". Then we cut out something from the manual that said "RANDOM NUMBERS" and put it in the envelope and closed it with stickers. Later, when we got back to the house and presented our results we argued that people were curious about what was in the envelope based on the fact that two people had already
tried to open it... And when we finally let them open it, it had the
note saying "RANDOM NUMBERS" inside. So we had proved that any number is interesting!! (Well, that's what you get for playing games with people in something called Youth Association of Science!) *lol*<BR>
<BR>
We were done with the game around 1 - 1:30 a.m. and then we just talked. The prize we got for winning the game was a stupid little game that was a red plastic french fry box with plastic fries in it. Two of the fries were attached to the bottom of the box with a
string so when you pulled one of those all the fries would fly out all
over the floor/table. Some people started playing with it and taking
turns in pulling out one fry and when all the fries suddenly jumped up
everyone yelled "<I>French Fryyyyyy</I>"... well... "<I>Pomfriiiiit</I>" (slang for
Pommes Frites) in Danish... touched glasses and drank some of their
beer. <BR>
<BR>
They were only about five people playing in the end and I talked to Thorbj&oslash;rn until 5 in the morning and we decided to go to bed. Some of the others were stilll playing that french fry-game! But the problem was, my bunk bed was pushed right next to Thorbj&oslash;rn's so we ended up talking a couple of hours after we went to bed anyway. When the sun had started rising and I could actually see my watch (and 7 a.m. is a pretty scary sight when you
still haven't gone to sleep) so we finally went to sleep. We could still
hear people in the living-room yelling "<I>French Fryyyyy</I>"... <BR>
<BR>
I woke up at
9:30 and stayed in bed for half an hour trying to fall asleep again but
failed so I got up and had a shower. Then I talked to someone who was up for about 10 minutes until I realized I was much too tired to be sitting
down so I went back to bed. Thorbj&oslash;rn woke up when I came and he took
my pillow! He had forgotten to bring his so now he wanted to use mine.
How rude!!! *grin* Unfortunately, he's stronger than me so he ended up
with most of it. We talked until 11:30 a.m. where someone came in and yelled "<I>Breakfast</I>"! It wasn't easy getting up
after a little over two hours of sleep when my bed and my duvet was so
nice and warm and comfortable... zzzz... <BR>
<BR>
After brunch we cleaned the
house and did a bit of statistics over some forms we had the members
fill out a while ago. We managed to squeeze into the four cars available
and drove to Copenhagen (that took a little over an hour) where half of
us went out for pizza. Then I had a 'nice' train-ride home where I read
some short-story for tomorrow and studied for a Chemistry test today.
But it was beginning to get a bit hard for me to concentrate... *yawn*<BR>
