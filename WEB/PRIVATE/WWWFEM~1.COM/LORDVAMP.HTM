The story of how I met Lord Vampire: On Thursday the 8th of August I went to &quot;The Wave&quot; and I had booked the computer from 7-8 p.m. I arrived kind of early (maybe 6:40 or so) because I wanted to scan some pictures for my page. The person using the computer was someone I didn't know so I was a bit curious who the heck was using &quot;my&quot; computer and I thought he was staring a bit strangely so I was wondering if he needed help or something. Then as I passed by I noticed his typing speed while he was on Cygnus WebChat Live and decided that he did <I>not</I> need any help! I went into a different room (the one with the scanner) and used it for about 15 minutes. <BR>
<BR>
I came out and he just got up and gave me the computer. I was a bit surprised as I usually have to fight a bit with people to get the computer - even when I have booked it! - but I sat down and went from the main page to the page where you choose &quot;Adult Chat Rooms&quot; or &quot;All Ages Chat Rooms&quot; and he asked if he could hang around for a bit and see what I was doing. Even though I'm not usually very fond of people looking over my shoulder I didn't feel like I could say no as he was very polite (yet another novelty compared to the people who are usually there!). <BR>
<BR>
Then he asked &quot;Do you call yourself Female Nerd on the net?&quot; even before I got to the page to type it in. I said &quot;Yes...?&quot; and he said &quot;Pleased to meet you, I'm Lord Vampire.&quot; One of my good friends on the net. I was so surprised I didn't know what to do! But I said to myself "Well, the net will still be here tomorrow, this is <I>much</I> more interesting!!" And we had a very nice time talking and drinking tea at &quot;The Wave&quot; until it closed at 10 p.m. Then I met him again on... uh... 3 occasions within the first 1½ weeks! And I still love him very much... <B>God bless the net!</B> *grin*<BR>
