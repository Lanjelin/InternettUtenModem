Your browser does not support frames and I unfortunately haven't had time to 
make a noframes version of my pages. If you want a taste of what it's like, 
you can browse through my <A HREF="INDEX-1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/index.htm">index</A> but I certainly do
not recommend viewing my pages this way!!<BR>
<BR>
If you want, you can write me an <A HREF="mailto:sofie@femalenerd.com">email
and complain about this but it most likely won't help. In stead, I suggest
you download <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#3" tppabs="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> 3.0 or higher.
