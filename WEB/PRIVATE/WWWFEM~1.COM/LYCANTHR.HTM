<BR>
Didn't mean to wake you up<BR>
in the middle of the day<BR>
taking a moonlight nap<BR>
on a bright and sunny day<BR>
strolling though the streets<BR>
of loneliness<BR>
haven't ever seen a face<BR>
that carries a smile<BR>
they are dark blue faces<BR>
of long lost hope and miseries<BR>
a baby tries to smile<BR>
unaware of life as it is<BR>
his parents tell him no<BR>
there is no reason to smile<BR>
no need to strain you muscles<BR>
your smile is much too bright<BR>
bringing joy to everyone<BR>
forgetting the past<BR>
the sins and all the sorrow<BR>
your time will come my boy<BR>
where you will know it too<BR>
don't ask me to explain you why<BR>
it's much to late now<BR>
you shouldn't be out now<BR>
go back inside<BR>
before the sunshine hits you<BR>
hide behind a curtain<BR>
black as the clouds of my mind<BR>
peek through to see<BR>
if that horrible light is gone<BR>
we live our lives as lycanthropes<BR>
unaware of good and happiness<BR>
sneak out at night<BR>
making sure<BR>
that only the moon<BR>
will shine down on us<BR>
his sad green cheese<BR>
can light up our faces<BR>
and our teeth<BR>
