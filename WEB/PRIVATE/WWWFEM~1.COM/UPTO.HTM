I was in <A HREF="FRANCE/GERLUXFR.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/france/gerluxfr.htm">France</A> with my parents between the 25th of June and the 10th of July and I have made a homepage about it a while ago. Then I went to <A HREF="CANUSA/CANUSA.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/canusa/canusa.htm">Canada and USA</A> from the 13th of July till the 2nd of August. That was the most wonderful vacation ever. I just got done with the homepage about it and I hope a lot of you want to see it because I put quite some work in it. <BR>
<BR>
On the 8th of August I met one of my net.friends, the dear <A HREF="LORDVAMP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/lordvamp.htm">Lord Vampire in real life</A>! I used to have the whole description written on my main page but now I have given him his own special page. But if you've already read the things I used to have on my main page don't bother reading this... but for everyone else: Meet my wonderful Lord Vampire!<BR>
<BR>
I have recently joined something called <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#725" tppabs="http://www.unf.dk/unf/info/english.html">UNF</A>, Youth Association of Science. They have a lot of good lectures about things that interest me and it has started to take up much of my time already. So that means even less time on the net for me. Can you imagine, this month I have barely been to Cygnus WebChat Live at all! Something must be very wrong... *lol*<BR>
<BR>
The weekend between the 27th and the 29th of September was pretty fun! You can read about the things I did on <A HREF="PARTY.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/party.htm">Friday the 27th</A> where there was a big dance at my school and <A HREF="UNFWEEK.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/unfweek.htm">Saturday and Sunday</A> where I went on a weekend trip with <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#725" tppabs="http://www.unf.dk/unf/info/english.html">UNF</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Now I have added an <A HREF="ICONS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/icons.htm">official icon page</A>! That means that if you want to make a link for me on your page you can just grab one of the icons and use it as a link.
