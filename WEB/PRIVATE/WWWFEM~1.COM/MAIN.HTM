Hi! Welcome to my page. If you have any suggestions of what I should put on 
my page, links to other pages, anything, just 
<A HREF="mailto:sofie@femalenerd.com">e-mail me</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Well, I'm 16 years old and I live in <A HREF="DENMARK.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/denmark.htm">Denmark</A> in a 
little snotty (whoops...) town called Ålsgårde. I love being on the net 
although I don't consider myself addicted. My favourite place to hang out is 
<A HREF="../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#65" tppabs="http://www.ffly.com/">FireFly</A> chat! You can sometimes find me on 
IRC on channel #cygnus or #denmark. Or, if you have 
<A HREF="../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#66" tppabs="http://www.tribal.com/powwow">PowWow</A> running, you can 
<A HREF="powwow:sofie@femalenerd.com">page me</A> to chat. 
<BR>
<BR>
I wish to thank my dear friends; both those I know on the net and in real 
life.. although those two groups have mixed a bit.. What would I do without 
you guys?? *smile*

Before I forget I better show you a picture of my beloved cat Lillemis. He's 
about 7 years old now but I've only had him for 5 years. I found him sitting 
on a roof where he couldn't get down so I helped him and he has been with me 
ever since. I put an ad in the paper but nobody seemed to be missing him so 
of course I kept the little darling. <BR>
