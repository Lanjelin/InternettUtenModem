Also, I don't believe that you should just put something on for the sake of &quot;putting it on&quot; (e.g. that you put frames on your page <I>just</I> because you have recently learned frames). But Java is a very interesting programming language because it gives us some new possibilities to make easy scripts for webpages and do other cool stuff that doesn't take long to learn. <BR>

<A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs8.htm#800" tppabs="http://www.javasoft.com/hooked/"><IMG SRC="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/hooked.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 BORDER=0></A>I have read a book about it, <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs8.htm#800" tppabs="http://www.javasoft.com/hooked/">Hooked on Java</A> and so far I've also read the first 50 pages of Java Programming for Dummies <SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>. If this is the first time you want to try playing with Java I would recommend that you buy Java Programming for Dummies ($29.99) because it teaches you how to actually <I>program</I> your own java scripts and not just customize ready-made applets. But then again, that's just my opinion... <BR>

You can use java to make a bunch of different things. I wish I could show you how to make your own, small java applets but unfortunately, it wouldn't be much good to you when you don't have a java compiler. It turns the .java files (which are just plain text files) into .class files that the applet needs. You get a free java compiler when you buy either &quot;Hooked on Java&quot; or &quot;Java for Dummies&quot;. Good luck on your java!<BR>
