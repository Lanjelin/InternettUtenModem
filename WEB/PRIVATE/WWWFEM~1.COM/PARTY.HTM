<BR>
Friday was my school's
birthday. I got home at 3:15, did some homework, called one of my friends to
tell him I would be gone all weekend, had a little something to eat,
showered and got dressed. I had bought this long, purple satin dress
with thin straps and then a big, white boa. A picture might be on its way soon. My dad drove me to the school and we picked up two girls from my class on the way. It would be stupid if
three cars had to drive to the same place just to drop off three people!<BR>
<BR>
Other people's classrooms were decorated and they had candles and all but we were
just sitting there in our boring classroom but hey, it's the people who
are important! We had dinner (buffet from a Mexican restaurant) and then people kind of wandered around between the different classrooms checking out what everyone was
wearing. A lot of the people from 12th grade arrived in rented,
white limos!! We decided to take a red Ford in stead.. *grin* It was
free! It seems kind of stupid to pay a lot of money just to ride in a
limo for 10 minutes if you ask me... but it does add something extra to
the party. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone was in a good mood and ready to party. We had
practiced lanciers for 4x45 minutes earlier in the day so we were pretty
good.. *proud* Most of the other classes had arranged who to dance
lanciers with (we had to plan that ahead) but as usual our class was
slow so almost no one had any plans. Well, as some of you might know I like to have
everything planned out so I decided to ask a guy in stead of just
hanging around waiting for someone to ask me. <BR>
<BR>
So Wednesday (or Thursday; I'm not sure) there were three guys from my class sitting in a corner just staring into the air. I asked if any of them didn't have anyone to
dance with on Friday and if they would consider dancing with me. No
reply. They just kept on staring at the wall! How humiliating! According
to one of my Danish net.friends, <A HREF="../TPPMSGS/MSGS8.HTM#844" tppabs="http://www.cybernet.dk/dreamland/">Henrik Keller</A>, they "must have been
sniffing glue or something" if they didn't want to dance with me but I'm
not one to care about things like that so I just attacked the next guy;
Jakob, who walked in the door and fortunately, he said yes. What a
relief! *lol* <BR>
<BR>
I later found out he wasn't too good at lanciers but hey,
at least it's better to have <I>someone</I> to dance with rather than dancing
with a girl or something. Last time the school had a dance I didn't dance at all because I was so bored and I was talking to one of my friends who was bored, too, but this time I actually danced quite a lot for some reason. I couldn't stand talking to the people from
my class for that long without a break... <BR>
<BR>
I danced a couple of dances with some guy I met a few weeks ago when I visited a power station with <A HREF="../TPPMSGS/MSGS7.HTM#725" tppabs="http://www.unf.dk/unf/info/english.html">UNF</A> (Youth Association of Science). We kind of started talking when some girl (from my sports class) next to us was so drunk she bumped into everyone and I had to help her sit down. Some people
just don't know when to stop! *sigh* Speaking of people who don't know
when to stop drinking... One girl from my class got really sick around 11:30 p.m. and we
had to get a taxi for her because she had thrown up on her dress and her
purse and she was lying on a sofa throwing up in a waste basket saying
"don't touch me" and "I want to sleep"... <BR>
<BR>
The party ended at midnight and my dad picked me up. A lot of people went to downtown Elsinore (a big city 5km from where I live) to continue the party because the 27th of October is the annual Cultural Evening in Elsinore so the discos were free and there were a lot of
other interesting things going on. My dad wanted to see the fireworks at
midnight but we were a bit late so we missed it. Not like I cared.. <BR>
<BR>
I went to bed somewhere between 12:30 and 12:45 and I got up at half past
eight. Click here to read <A HREF="UNFWEEK.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/unfweek.htm">what I did on Saturday</A>.
