This is how Elsinore sometimes looks to me when I arrive in the morning on my way to school. I guess I was lucky it wasn't raining that day as usual! When the sun is shining, there is no place in this world more beautiful than Elsinore. You can see the top of the <A HREF="SCT-OLAI.HTM" tppabs="http://www.femalenerd.com/elsinore/sct-olai.htm">Church of Sct. Olai</A> in the background.
