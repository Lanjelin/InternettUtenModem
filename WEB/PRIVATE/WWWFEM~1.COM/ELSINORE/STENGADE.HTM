Stengade is the main shopping street in Elsinore. Here, you can find everything from Danish pastry to computer stores, CDs and clothes. The stores are not allowed to have big signs up here in Elsinore because there has been made a law against it to preserve the old spirit. Even McDonald's had to look a bit subtile...!
