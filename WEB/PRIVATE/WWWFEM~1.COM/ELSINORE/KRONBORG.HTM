This is Kronborg castle, which is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the country. The castle was built by one of our former kings, Christian IV, in the 16th century. It is especially known for the performance of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Now, it serves as a museum and you can also enjoy the wonderful view.
