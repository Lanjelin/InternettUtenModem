Starting Point brings together the best search resources and directories on the Internet to make your searches more efficient.  Many of these have specific search features that can be utilized from Starting Point.  Many of the <a href="#standard">standard

 search features</a> are described below.  For more detailed instructions we recommend that you utilize the provided link to each resource to learn how to use each most effectively.  Then return to use Starting Point's PowerSearch for your online research

.  For quick reference, we recommend that you print this help page.<p>
A search query may be entered in several locations.  After a search query is entered from the front page and "Find" is pressed, your query will be transferred to the PowerSearch page.  At this point you may utilize one of twelve popular general search engines and directories by selecting the appropriate hypertext link.  To return to the PowerSearch page after utilizing one of these resources, press the "Back" button on your browser.  You may then select another resource or refine your search by entering another search query in the provided box.<p>

Alternatively, if you have a JavaScript-enabled browser, you may use the
PowerSearch Assistant (PSA) to utilize Starting Point’s PowerSearch quickly
and easily from anywhere on the Web.  To activate the PSA, mark the "Use
PowerSearch Assistant" box on the PowerSearch page before you select a
search engine.  The PSA will then be displayed as a separate window that
can be placed anywhere on your screen and utilized until you close the window.<p>

The PSA allows you to use the metasearch capabilities of the PowerSearch
without returning to the Starting Point page.  Simply enter your search
query in the search box and select a search engine (because this is JavaScript
you do not need to press "Enter" on your keyboard).  You can change your
search query or select a different search engine directly from the PSA.
"HOME|HELP|OFF" is displayed on the bottom of the PSA.  Selecting "HOME"
will return you to the Starting Point main page.  Selecting "HELP" will
repeat these instructions.  Selecting "OFF" will close the window.
Clicking on the "PSA" graphic will return you to the Starting Point
PowerSearch page.<p>

In addition to the twelve general search resources, there are over 150 categorical search resources available in Starting Point PowerSearch.  These can be accessed either by selecting the appropriate category in the left column while in PowerSearch or by 

entering in a search query from the top of any category directory page.  Your search query will be transferred to the appropriate input fields in all of the search forms in that category.  Often it will be necessary to include additional search criteria i

nto these forms before submitting your query.<p>  

Your PowerSearch page can be personalized with the addition of up to eight categorical search resources.  The personal search boxes will be displayed directly below the general search resources.  A search query entered from the front page will fill in the

 appropriate fields in these forms.  These may then be utilized directly from the PowerSearch page.  <a href="#person">PowerSearch personalization instructions</a> are located below.<p>

<blockquote>
<a name="standard"></a><b>Standard search features:</b><br>

Use + to Require Words<br>
Place a plus sign (+) in front of a search term to make sure that ALL of the documents returned contain the word.  For example: recipes&nbsp;+garlic (searching only for recipes containing garlic)<p>

Use - to Exclude Words<br>
Put a minus sign (-) in front of a search word to make sure that NONE of the documents returned contain the word. For example: 
cougar&nbsp;-automobiles&nbsp;-car  (searching for the animal "Cougar" not the car)<p>

Use AND, OR, AND NOT, and ( ) <br>
Most search engines and some directories support Boolean operators and syntax. These include AND, OR, and AND NOT operators, and parentheses ( ) for grouping. It is best to place Boolean operators in ALL CAPITALS to be recognized although this isn't neces

sary for all search engines.<p>

<b>Examples:</b><br>

<b>salt AND water</b> - Each returned document will contain the words "salt" and "water".  Equivalent to:  salt&nbsp; +water<p>

<b>cats OR dogs</b> - Each returned document will contain either "cats" or  "dogs" or both.<p>

<b>food AND NOT onions</b> - Each returned document will contain the word "food" but not "onions".  Equivalent to: food&nbsp;-onions<p>

<b>shoes AND (tennis OR casual)</b> - Each returned document will contain the words "tennis shoes" or "casual shoes" or "tennis, casual, and shoes".<p>

Use Lower Case<br>
 In most instances using lower case is the safest way to search. However, if you are looking for a proper name (i.e., Steven King, or Ford Motor Company), you should capitalize the first letter of a pair of words as shown.  Only documents where these word

s are located next to each other as a proper name will be returned as opposed to documents containing "motor cars" or "the king". <p>
</blockquote>

<a name="person"></a><b>PowerSearch Personalization</b><br>

To personalize your PowerSearch page, select "Personalize" from the left column of the main PowerSearch page.  If this is your first time personalizing PowerSearch, an additional link to the personalization section will appear below the general search res

ources.  After selecting this link, you will be shown a list of the Starting Point categories.  Mark your favorite three with an "X" and press "Continue".  Next, all of the PowerSearch resources for each of these categories will be displayed.  Mark up to 

eight with an "X" that you wish to be displayed on your personal PowerSearch page and press "Continue".  Next, rank your selections (1-8) in the order that you wish them to be displayed on your page.  If you make a mistake or wish to re-personalize your p

age, simply select the "Personalize" link again from the PowerSearch page.<p>

<a name="main"></a><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#FF0000"><b>Help: Main Directory</b></font><br>

The directory is comprised of twelve categories:  Business, Computing, Education, Entertainment, Magazines, News, Reference, Shopping, Sports, Travel, and Weather.  Each contains the most useful resources on the Internet in one location to make your time 

more productive.  If there is an additional Web site that you believe should be in a category, simply add it!  Each Starting Point category allows you to enter five of your favorite links.  To add your links select "CHANGE LINKS" from the menu.  From here

 you can enter up to five links per category.  When you are finished, click "DONE" and follow the prompts to display your new links in the selected Starting Point category.  You may go back and edit your links at any time.<p>

Each category also has PowerSearch.  High-quality, category-specific search resources and directories are included in each section.  To access these, enter in a search query and press "FIND".  Your query is entered in the appropriate search boxes.  Fill o

ut the boxes beneath the search resource you wish to utilize and press "FIND" to initiate the search.  You may return to the Starting Point page by pressing "Back" on your browser.<p>

<br>

<a name="411"></a><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#FF0000"><b>Help: Business 411</b></font><br>

Business 411 is a central source to find businesses on the Web and off, phones numbers, government offices, city highlights, and maps to show you how to get there.<p>

<br>

<a name="people"></a><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#FF0000"><b>Help: People Find</b></font><br>

People Find lets you find people across the U.S. and Canada.  You can find home addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and detailed maps.  Also you can use Net Phones to talk over the Internet.<p>

<br>

<a name="new"></a><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#FF0000"><b>Help: New Sites</b></font><br>

Starting Point displays its most recent submissions in each category.  This is a great resource to see the latest sites on the Web.  To view these new sites select "New Sites" from the menu bar on the front page or within each category.  These are continu

ously updated.  Reload the page to see the ever-changing list of new sites.  We also would like your <a href="#vote">vote</a> to select the highest-quality new submissions to Starting Point in each category for selection as a Hot Site and possible directo

ry listing.<p>
<br>

<a name="vote"></a><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="#FF0000"><b>Help: Vote</b></font><br>

Your Hot Site vote is cast by selecting the appropriate "Vote" box next to the new site of your choice.  Only one vote can be cast per section per week.  Hot Site winners will be notified via. e-mail of the award and the date and category that their site 

will be showcased.<p><br><br><br>
