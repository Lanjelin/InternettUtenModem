<P><CENTER><B><H2>The Famous Bob & Tom Draino Test</B></CENTER></H2>

<P><CENTER><B><H3>FIRST THIS MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT</CENTER></B></H3>

<P>Neither Bob & Tom, nor anyone else you may be able to think of will guarantee the results of this test so deal with that reality before you even think about peeing in a cup.

<P>As is always the case when you are working with toxic chemicals around the home or office, <B>WEAR EYE PROTECTION and BE SURE YOU PERFORM THE DRAINO TEST OUTDOORS - YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY LATER...TRUST US.</B>

<P>The Bob & Tom Draino Test is designed to determine, with reasonable accuracy, the gender (not species, sorry) of an unborn child.  Don't ask us how or why it works, it just does.

<DL>
<P><B><DT>ITEMS YOU WILL NEED FOR THE DRAINO TEST:</B>

<P><DD>- Approximately 2 tablespoons of CRYSTAL DRAINO

<BR><DD>- Medium glass or glass jar (preferably one you don't intend to use again)</DL>

<DL>
<P><DT><B>STEP 1</B>

<P><DD>You will need a urine sample of about two to three ounces.  How this urine sample is procurred is up to the participants.  Have fun with it, be creative, we don't care, just don't injure anybody.  The urine sample must be fresh.</DL>

<DL>
<P><DT><B>STEP 2</B>

<P><DD>Take the test materials outside.  With the Draino in the glass or jar, carefully pour the urine sample on top of the Draino.  You will want to have about equal amounts of urine and Draino.</DL>

<DL>
<P><DT><B>STEP 3</B>	

<P><DD>Observe. If the really nasty-smelling concoction you now posess darkens to a brownish color within the first 10-15 seconds, <B>IT'S A BOY!</B> If it just sits there for more than 10-15 seconds, <B>IT'S A GIRL.</B>  In either case, <B>IT'S GOING TO SMELL REALLY BAD, AND YOU'LL WANT TO HOSE IT DOWN FAIRLY QUICKLY</B>!</DL>

<P>We hope the Draino test has been a pleasant experience for both parents-to-be.  Again, be careful when mixing the Draino and urine.  Draino is a dangerous chemical, and if you don't know what fresh urine can do to you, call Chuck Berry.

<P>Thanks for stopping by and thanks for listening to Bob & Tom and Q95.
