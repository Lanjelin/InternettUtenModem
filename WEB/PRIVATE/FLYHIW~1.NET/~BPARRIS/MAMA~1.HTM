<H3>Walking through the house
<BR>
that doesn't feel like home;
<BR>
You've forgotten it,
<BR>
as well as all your children.
<BR>
One day you woke up, and
<BR>
those memories were gone.
<BR>
You walk the floors and worry,
<BR>
wishing for cattle and land,
<BR>
for food, for cash crops.
<BR>
You just can't understand how
<BR>
it is today--why we don't need all that.
<BR>
Your mind is still in the years
<BR>
of the Great Depression.
<BR>
So you walk and worry.
<BR>
I try to explain, tell you
<BR>
there's nothing to worry about.
<BR>
I cook, and I tell you when it's
<BR>
time to eat, and I give you your pills.
<BR>
I clean the house.
<BR>
I'm here for you, Mama.
<BR>
We've got all we need;
<BR>
We've got each other.
<BR>
Please don't die, Mama;
<BR>
You're all I've got.</H3>
