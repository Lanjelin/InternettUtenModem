<H3><I>I dreamed about her last night.<BR>
We were walking, like we used to,<BR>
through the garden.<BR>
She reached out to a peach tree,<BR>
and touched a tiny green peach.<BR>
"Yes" I said, "a peach.<BR>
We can eat that one when it's ripe."<BR>
<P>
Then we were in the house,<BR>
and my brother Bob was<BR>
sitting by her, talking to her.<BR>
Suddenly she said "Bob!"<BR>
She recognized him!<BR>
They hugged, and we were so happy!<BR>
<P>
There were bad times,<BR>
but there were also many good times.<BR>
How nice it was to be reminded by a dream!<BR></H3>
