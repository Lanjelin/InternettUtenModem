<P>
<H3>I sit awake with you
<BR>
in the scary midnight darkness,
<BR>
telling you everything is okay,
<BR>
calming you down after a dream,
<BR>
holding  your hand as you wander,
<BR>
searching through the house
<BR>
for remains of your former life.
<BR>
I sit as you sleep in your chair,
<BR>
when you won't go back to bed,
<BR>
knowing you will wake in terror,
<BR>
afraid of a dream, afraid of not knowing,
<BR>
afraid of everything.
<BR>
And sometimes you won't hear,
<BR>
my words will be as meaningless
<BR>
as the ones you sometimes say.
<BR>
And perhaps you will reach out,
<BR>
sometimes searching, sometimes striking;
<BR>
I'm here for you, whatever you need;
<BR>
I'll even be your punching bag.
<BR>
But I can't fix things for you;
<BR>
I can't bring your memories back.
<BR>
They are gone, just like the house
<BR>
and people you search for.
<BR>
All I can do is sit and wait
<BR>
with you for the approaching dawn
<BR>
when things will look a little better
<BR>
illuminated by the light of day.
<P>
