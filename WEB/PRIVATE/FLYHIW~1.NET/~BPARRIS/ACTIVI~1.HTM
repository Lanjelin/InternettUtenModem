<P>
<H3>There wasn't a lot my mother could still do at the time when
I came to take care of her.  She could still walk, and on nice days
we tried to take at least one good walk outside.  She could no longer
fold clothes or make beds, though she still tried, she just wadded them
up, and pulled the sheets back instead of up.  She did enjoy helping
with the dishes.  She had to ask where each piece went, but she loved
to dry and put away the dishes.  She called this "washing dishes", and
she thought they weren't washed unless they were dried and put away.
Once when she didn't help and I left them in the drain rack, she 
complained later "That girl didn't wash the dishes!"
<P>
She loved to listen to soft music, and she would usually fall asleep in her
chair while she was listening.  Though TV became too disturbing to her,
there were videos we could watch, old family-type TV series, like "The
Waltons" and "Little House" were favorites.  She usually enjoyed it
when I read to her from magazines or books, though I had to pick just
the right kinds of stories.
<P>
I tried to provide an atmosphere that was cheerful and neat.  The old house needed
some new floor tiles, wallpaper, and paint, so I did some of that early in
my stay there.  Not too much, though, because it began to be disturbing to
her.  I placed plants everywhere inside and on the front porch, and I planted
flowers everywhere outside so that we could see them when we took our walks.
I hung birdfeeders on the old clothesline pole and attached some to windows
with suction cups, and she enjoyed watching the birds.
<P>
<H1>Our Walks, and My Mother's Favorite Places</H1>
<P>
<IMG SRC="FLOWERS2.JPG" tppabs="http://fly.hiwaay.net/~bparris/Flowers2.jpg">
<P>
<H3>My mother loved to walk outside.  When she was feeling well and the weather was
nice, sometimes she would want to go walking several times during the day.  I thought 
it would be nice to have some flowers to enjoy all along our walking path.  I planted
flowers around the back of the house so that she would see them as soon as
we walked out of the back door.  She usually wanted to walk over to the clothes
line where the bird feeders were and see the birds, which flew away as we approached.
Then she would want to go check on the kittens down at the shed or my brothers animals
(horses, goats, pigs, or whatever he was keeping there at the time) in the pasture near
the old barn.  Then we would walk around the house, stopping to see the roses along the 
side of the house if they were blooming.  If it was time to go to the mail box, she would
walk about half-way down the drive-way with me and say "I'll wait here" because she was
afraid to get close to the road.  Then we would stop at the circular flower bed in the front
yard, where there were tulips and daffodils in the Spring, poppies and zinnas in the summer, and 
mums in the fall.  We would walk by an evergreen tree that she'd planted that was having
a hard time, never grew much and was drooping at the top, and she would reach out to it
and say "poor little tree."  Then we would walk across the yard and up a gradual slope on
the way to the garden, viewing a rectangular flower bed with more of the same kinds of
flowers, and she would usually reach out and touch the taller ones and say how pretty
they were.  The little hill up to the garden was the hardest part of the walk for her,
just a gradual incline, but often she would be out of breath when we reached the top.
That's one reason I wanted the bench in the garden.  
<P>
That was one of my mother's favorite places.  She loved to sit there and rest before
we walked back to the house.  The bench was under two old peach trees that were kind
of growing into each other at the top, and it made a perfect shade, a cool spot to
rest on hot days.  I planted impatients, coleus, and caladiums, and even if the hot
sun and dry weather got to the other flowers, these under the biggest peach tree
thrived.  My mother would reach out to the flowers, touch them, and talk to them.
And sometimes we would have a visit from a cat (sometime the cat would go on the
walk with us) that would seem to enjoy the rest in the shade just as much as we
did.
<P>
From the bench we could see the small garden, where I had tomatoes, peppers, squash,
okra, and beans growing.  We would sit on the bench and talk about the garden, which
I hoped would make Mama feel more at home because she had farmed and had big gardens
all of her life.  
<P>
When my mother had rested enough or was getting tired of sitting there, we would walk
on around, past the garden, and down the drive way that connected my sister's back yard
with ours.  We would walk past a fig bush that was producing wonderfully, and most of the
time we would stop and pick some, because Mama loved figs.
<P>
Before going back in the house, we would look at the flowers just outside the back door
again.  The pansies thrived there.  And there were a few minature rose bushes that were
doing really well, too.   Other than roses, I think my mother liked the big yellow
pansies with the black faces best.  
<P>
Most of the time when we got back in the house, my mother was ready to have a glass of
water and then sit in her chair to take a nap.  But sometimes, if she was feeling really
well and it was a nice day that wasn't too hot, she would want to go out to the front
porch for a while.
<P>  
<IMG SRC="PORCH.JPG" tppabs="http://fly.hiwaay.net/~bparris/Porch.jpg">
<P>
My mother loved to sit on the front porch, and most of the time she chose to sit in
the swing.  She would talk about the cars that passed on the highway, and things she
saw (or thought she saw) in the yard, or across the hay field, or up the hill at my
brother's house.  We would talk about the flowers I was growing all over the porch,
and sometimes she would say "so pretty."  The six hummingbird feeders gave her something
else to watch and talk about as our little visitors would fly in and out among the 
hanging baskets.
<P>
Even on days when it was a bit too hot for walking, or when it was raining a little,
the front porch was a nice cool place to sit, and a nice place for family to visit.
Somehow it never seemed to confuse my mother as much when people visited on the front
porch, and she was usually wearing a smile whenever she sat in that swing.</H3>
<P>
<H1>Reading to Mama</H1>
<P>
<H3>My mother had always enjoyed reading, when I would ask if I could read to her, she
would usually say "yes".  She would tell me how she used to love to read, but that
she "just couldn't see how to anymore".  My sister had subscribed to a large-print
<I>Guideposts</I> for her, thinking maybe she could still read, but once when I asked
her to try to read, all she could make out were the articles, A, an, or the, and only
when they were the extra large-print in titles.
<P>
I read to her from <I>Reader's Digest</I> and <I>Guideposts</I>, and sometimes the
stories would make both of us cry.  Sometimes she thought the people in the story
were actually there, or that I was reading a letter from someone to her, or even
that I was telling her a story about myself.  I also read to her from <I>Country,
Country Extra, Reminisce,</I> and <I>Birds and Blooms</I> all published by Reiman
Publications (P.O. Box 991, Greendale, WI 53129-0991).  Even after she could no
longer follow a story, she enjoyed the beautiful pictures in these magazines.  
<I>Birds and Blooms</I> even has a "Ready for a Walk?" section, so we could pretend
we were walking outside and seeing flowers, birds, and butterflies even when the
weather wouldn't permit our real walk.  
<P>
I read several children's books to my mother, too.  <I>All the Places to Love</I> by
Patricia MacLachlan (HarperCollins, 1994) was a picture book about living in the
country and the love of family, and she enjoyed this, as she did <I>Home Place</I> by
Crescent Dragonwagon (Macmillan, 1993).  I read some from a book about Laura Ingalls
Wilder, too, and she enjoyed it for a while.  I think she might have enjoyed me reading
from the actual <I>Little House</I> books, because she always enjoyed the series so.</H3>
<P>
<H1>Watching Movies Together</H1>
<P>
<H3>It didn't take me long to learn that we could no longer watch the evening news or
any of the murder mysteries my mother used to enjoy.  My sister taped all of <I>Little
House on the Prairie</I> for us and she kept an eye out for every movie that might be
suitable.  My niece taped all of <I>The Waltons</I> which my mother especially enjoyed,
because the Depression years were the ones she could remember.  Every time I went shopping,
I'd buy more movies, and I ordered everything I could find that I thought she would like.
I collected practically all of the Shirley Temple movies, and my mother said she enjoyed
seeing "that little girl who likes to sing and dance."  Shirley Temple was her favorite
child star, and Jessica Tandy was her favorite older star; She enjoyed <I>Driving Miss
Daisy</I> and <I>Fried Green Tomatoes</I>.  Perhaps being from the South had something
to do with that.  
<P>
Another favorite was <I>Anne of Green Gables</I>.  A Home Health Aide even got in on
bringing us some of those movies to borrow, and I ending up collecting most of them
on my shopping trips.  I also found an old <I>Lassie</I> movie that my mother enjoyed.
<P>
Sometimes it would take us a week to watch one movie.  We watched movies only after supper
each evening and until bedtime, while we sipped on a cup of chamomile tea (which would
sometimes help her sleep better).  The only time we would watch movies much in the
daytime was around Christmas, when we watched holiday movies.  My mother's attention
span was short, and she would get sleepy and seemed to need frequent naps.  After a half
hour to an hour of a movie, she was ready for bedtime, and calmly went to bed, unless there
happened to be something in the movie that upset her--and that happened at times when I least
suspected it.
<P>
Our movie times were special. Often she held my hand as when we were watching a movie.  Once
she told me it was so she wouldn't be scared.  She couldn't understand that it was all make
believe, and often as I got her ready for bed, she would be so concerned about those people we
left in the living room.</H3>
<P>
<H1>Magical Music</H1>
<P>
<H3>When nothing else would work, music would usually calm my mother.  I had a cassette player
(and then later a CD player) just on the other side of the wall in the next room from where she
sat.  Some favorites were <I>Guitar by the Sea, Late Night Sax for Lovers, and Hymns by the Sea.</I>
Only instrumental would work; She became disturbed by any vocal music, thinking that someone was
actually in the house, singing.  And even the instrumental music had to be very calm, with no 
loud surprises.  I think that she would have liked most of the music on my pages.
