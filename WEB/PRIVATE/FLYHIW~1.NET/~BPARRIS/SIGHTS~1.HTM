<H3>Sometimes it's a sound,
<BR>
birds like we listened to,
<BR>
or the music she liked to hear;
<BR>
Sometimes a smell,
<BR>
like flowers, or even the
<BR>
shampoo she used;
<BR>
Sometimes bacon frying,
<BR>
or the pudding she liked.
<BR>
Over and over, every day,
<BR>
I think of my mother,
<BR>
and tears flow.
<BR>
I was so tired, but why
<BR>
did I give up?
<BR>
Those were the best times,
<BR>
the only really important times
<BR>
in all of my life.</H3>

<IMG SRC="MUSIC.GIF" tppabs="http://fly.hiwaay.net/~bparris/music.gif" BORDER="0">"I Will Remember You"</A>"I will be walking one day,
Down a street far away, And see a face in the crowd and smile. Knowing how you made me laugh
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past. I will remember you...<BR>
 So many years come and gone, And yet the memory is strong.
One word we never could learn--Good-bye. True love is frozen in time;
I'll be your champion and you'll be mine. I will remember you."--&#169 Amy Grant<BR>
