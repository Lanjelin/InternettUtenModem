<H3><I>It's snowing now--even here in Alabama!  How it reminds me of the winters
with my mother.  We would stand at the window and watch the snow falling.
We wrapped up in blankets to watch TV--a Shirley Temple movie, or the old 
series that she loved--The Waltons, or Little House on the Prairie.  I
remember it was funny that she got cold watching the winter scenes on TV 
even when it wasn't cold.  But when it really was, and when it was snowing
outside, it was fun to watch the snowy scenes while talking about it snowing
outside--though of course, in Alabama, it was never as much as on TV.  We
shivered, and giggled like two kids, and drank hot chocolate with marshmallows
in it.</H3></I>
