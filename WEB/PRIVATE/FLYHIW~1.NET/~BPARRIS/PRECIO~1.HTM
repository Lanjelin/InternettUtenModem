<P>
<H3>I cry a river
<BR>
over times that are past,
<BR>
when I held my mother's hand,
<BR>
and when I made her laugh.
<BR>
We walked and saw flowers
<BR>
and listed to the birds;
<BR>
She couldn't always understand,
<BR>
but love didn't need words.
<BR>
Even in the dark times,
<BR>
when we were up through the night,
<BR>
why didn't I see it?
<BR>
Everything was right.
<BR>
Why did I give up
<BR>
and send her to a home?
<BR>
She sat alone for a while,
<BR>
and now she is gone.</H3>
