<H3>Some people may wonder how I can tell this story--how can I tell all of these personal things?
If I really loved my mother, how can I tell bad things about her?
<P>
It wasn't my mother when bad things happened.  It was the disease--Alzheimer's.  In the good times
I saw glimpses of my mother, as she really was before Alzheimer's started taking her from us,
and I cherish those moments.  While I was taking care of her, it was so helpful to me to read biographies 
and personal stories, some even in the form of journals, by Alzheimer's caregivers.  I want to 
help others the way those authors helped me.  So then, how can I not tell this story?
<P>
It may be slow coming, as I read through the three notebooks full of my scribbled writing.  There
are times when I just can't get myself to do it--when the memories are too painful. But as I can,
I will tell more of our story here.</H3>
