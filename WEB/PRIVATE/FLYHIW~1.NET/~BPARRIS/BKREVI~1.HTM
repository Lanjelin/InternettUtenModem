<H3><I>The 36-Hour Day</I>, by Nancy L. Mace and Peter V. Rabins. Baltimore:
Johns Hopkins University, 1991.
<P>
This is the most recommended book about Alzheimer's Disease.  It is required
reading for every caregiver.  The first Alzheimer's Association chapter I contacted
sent me a copy of it the first time I called them, and for that I will always be
grateful.  Not until I had read this book did I better understand Alzheimer's and 
what it was doing to my mother.  Read every book you can find on Alzheimer's, but
you'll probably want to read this one first.

Therapeutic Caregiving: a Practical Guide for Caregivers of Persons

This book is indeed "a practical guide" for not only getting through
each day, but also making each one better than it might have been otherwise.  The
chapters on communication and cueing will help in developing skills that will
help make each day more pleasant, as will the chapters on preventing stress and
managing problem behaviors.  I was especially impressed with the "What If"
questions in chapter seven, for example "What if you went to bed and didn't know
whether it was nighttime or daytime?  What if you woke up from a nap in the
afternoon and thought it was time for breakfast?  What if you became frightened or
lost in a darkened room?" (p. 62)--these questions help us to imagine what it's
like for an Alzheimer's patient.  All of this, plus the day-to-day, eating,
sleeping, hygiene, and even exercise, is covered in this book by Barbara J.
Bridges, an RN who spent fourteen years caring for both her parents. 
I highly recommend this book for all caregivers.  Also, Barbara has a

<I>The Alzheimer's Sourcebook for Caregivers: a Practical Guide for Getting Through
the Day</I>, by <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS32.HTM#3238" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/1159/">Frena Gray-Davidson</A>.

This is a book I was fortunate enough to have when I was taking care of my mother.
It deals with the emotional issues involved in caregiving as well as giving practical
suggestions for communication and loving caregiving.  I was so impressed with this
book that I quoted parts of it in my journal, like this one "When you can really love your mother exactly as she is, 
she can reemerge and be who she used to be for a while." and I even wrote to Frena asking questions.
 After I got my homepage up, Frena surprised me with an email saying she saw my home page
 and that she remembered me! Frena has a home page, too, at

<I>Gone Without A Trace</I>, by Marianne Dickerman Caldwell. Forest Knolls, California:
Elder Books, 1995.
<P>
Imagine your mother wandering off from a school softball game.  Imagine
 searching frantically for her for three years.  Imagine her remains being
 found in the woods where she had died. This happened to Marianne Dickerman
 Caldwell's mother.  Stella Mallory Dickerman was an educated woman who had
 gone back to get her Master's degree after having her children. She was a
 teacher, an artist, and a world-traveller.  She also had Alzheimer's
 Disease.  At age 83, on a September day in 1991, Stella went for a walk, and
she
 was never seen again.  Marianne Caldwell's book about this experience is
 not only is it a very poignant and personal story, but it also
offers comfort and guidance to families who have experienced loss; and
assistance for families who are searching for a missing loved one.  With
those she used for her mother, Marianne gives a sample query letter,
missing persons profile, and letter to a medical examiner. She also lists
the addresses and phone numbers for the Alzheimer's Association's Safe
Return Program and for State Agencies on Aging, as well as other helpful
organizations. Marianne is also the director of the,

 system for the dementia patient.  Marianne's book, Gone Without a Trace, is
