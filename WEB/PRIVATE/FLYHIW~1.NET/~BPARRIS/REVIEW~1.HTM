"This site is one of those that truly defies a standardized
rating system, as it is, primarily, a heartfelt and touching
memorial to a woman who had Alzheimer's disease.  Brenda Parris
has offered to the world the story of her mother's final year
of life, accompanied by numerous poems, journal excerpts,
and photos.  Also included is a vast array of links to other
Alzheimer's resources and related pages on the Web.  Ms. Parris
has performed a coureous and valuable service in sharing 
her experiences here."--<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS17.HTM#1781" tppabs="http://www.thenet-usa.com/">The Net</A>,

"This is one of the most personal homepages I have ever seen.
Brenda's site focuses on one main thing - The year she spent 
taking care of her mother who was suffering from Alzheimer's 
Disease.  This site is very informative and includes a lot of
links to sites with support and knowledge about this disease. 
All that aside, though, I must say, it is the personal feelings
of the weblady herself that touched me.  I had to get out my box
of Kleenex for one thing.  And as I read through her journal
I couldn't help but feel for her.  The way she always looked 
out for her mother, when her mother had no idea who her daughter
was.  This site is something EVERYONE should see.  I have never
been so touched by a website in my life."
