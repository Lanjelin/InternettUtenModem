KNOWN compatibility issues

There is a suspected seal compatibility problem with Autofrost (R-406A)
and Autofrost-X4 with York (automotive) compressors using Butyl rubber
seals in some cases.  Seals may fail (usually 30 mins to one hour)
after the car is turned off, due to heat soak from the radiator bleeding 
into the condenser and raising pressures.  Leaky heater water valves
contribute to the problem since they allow heat to build up in the
evaporator area, furthur increasing pressures.  Dirt buildup in the radiator
and condenser area also contributes by preventing the release of trapped
heat after the engine is turned off.

Neoprene seals are available which appear to not have this problem.

Autofrost (R-406A) and Autofrost-X4 (GHG-X4) move more heat than does R-12.

Cars with poorly maintained cooling (radiator) systems, may encounter radiator
boilovers and overheating problems when changing to Autofrost, since more
heat is transferred to the condenser, which rejects the heat into the
radiator.  It is a good idea to have the engine cooling system checked over
when switching to Autofrost to prevent a dirty/clogged radiator or leaking
heater water valve from causing A/C problems.
