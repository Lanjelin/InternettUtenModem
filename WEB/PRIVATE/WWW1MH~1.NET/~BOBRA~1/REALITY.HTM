<p>Bob Rankin is actually a Shetland Sheepdog!
</h1>

<h2>
<p> I am kinda cute, though.  (Click on my pointy little nose and I'll
bark for you.)

<p> As the old saying goes, "On the Internet, you could be a dog
and nobody would ever know it."

<p> I figured it was pointless to try and keep it a secret, but most
people won't bother to click on that bogus picture of my face to get
to this page anyway.

<p> At least my kids turned out OK...
<p> Here's a picture of Sarah (age 9), and Anna (age 7).
