<h2>The AutoNet TourGuide Interview with "Dr. Bob" Rankin</h2>
by Ed McAdams (emcadams@omni.voicenet.com)

<p> Dr. Bob Rankin is without a doubt, the Internet's guru of
e-mail. His greatest claim to fame is his free "Accessing The
Internet By E-Mail" guide. It was released only in 1994 and it
has already been translated into 17 languages and has quickly
spread around the globe. Dr. Bob's latest gift to the Net is the
Internet TourBus, where he teams up with Patrick Crispen to give
a virtual tour of the most interesting and most useful resources
on the Internet.

<p> As far as I am concerned, Dr. Bob is the Grandfather of the
AutoNet. The popularity of his e-mail guide clearly has shown
that there are many people around the globe that want to be
able to do more with e-mail.

<p><b>The TourGuide:</b>

<p>Bob, can you tell us a little bit about your background,
including the origin of the medical moniker?


<p><b>Dr. Bob:</b>

<p>Ed, I've been computing in one form or another for about 20
years.  I'm a computer programmer by profession, but my passion
is writing about computers and the Internet in a way that makes
sense to both the novice and more experienced user.

<p>As for my nickname, I always say "I'm not a real doctor, but I
play one on the Internet."  Friends and colleagues started
calling me Doctor Bob because I always seemed to have the cure
for what ailed them - when it came to computers or networking.
:-) I get a kick out of it, and it helps to establish an
identity in the online world.

<p>My claim to fame (if that doesn't sound too pompous) is the free
"Accessing The Internet By E-Mail" guide I wrote to help folks
understand that you can access almost *anything* on the Net
using simple e-mail commands. Since the initial publication in
early 1994, I've heard from readers in every corner of the world
and volunteers have translated it into over 15 languages.


<p><b>The TourGuide:</b>

<p>How did you first become involved with computers and when where
you first introduced to the Internet?


<p><b>Dr. Bob:</b>

<p>My first computer was a TI-58 programmable calculator, which I
taught to bark, sit, and play yahtzee.  My high school had a
300-baud dial-up line to a nearby university computer which
helped me get into all sorts of mischief!  So I guess it was
only natural from that point that I would pursue computer
programming as a career.

<p>My first contact with the Internet was in 1993 through a
conferencing system internal to IBM, where I worked at the time.
I was used to networking with people around the world, but it
seemed that the Internet held much greater treasures in store.

<p>What I found "on the outside" was both a surprise and a shock.
There truly was a wealth of information available via the Net -
from online databases to government documents to cheesecake
recipes.  But the tone of discussion on Usenet was far from the
polite professional discourse I was familiar with.

<p>I am still dismayed at the lack of civility on Usenet.  People
seem to think it's OK to be rude and crude just because their
face is hidden from view.  I don't buy into that... when I
converse online I make every effort to be overly polite and
sensitive.  Won't that get us further in the long run?


<p><b>The TourGuide:</b>

<p>I would like to think that as electronic forums and electronic
mail become more of a central part of our lives, people will
begin to communicate with more respect. Do you feel that the
Internet of the future will be an improvement on what exists
today?


<p><b>Dr. Bob:</b>

<p>I think so.  Part of the problem is that most of the online
inhabitants today are young males.  As the Net becomes more
popular, a better cross-section of humanity will be
participating and anti-social behavior will tend to regulate
itself.


<p><b>The TourGuide:</b>

<p>You certainly are doing your part to make the Net more enjoyable
and accessible for everyone. You mentioned your free "Accessing
The Internet By E-Mail" guide earlier. Could you tell us about
the inspiration for this guide and also how you learned about
the tricks inside?


<p><b>Dr. Bob:</b>

<p>Hmmm, inspiration...  I guess it was a combination of my Scottish
heritage and information anxiety.  Rumor has it that the Scots
are always looking for ways to pinch pennies, so maybe that
explains my quest to find ways of doing as many Internet
activities offline as possible.

<p>When I first started online, I was using one service that charged
outrageous hourly fees so I looked hard for ways to do FTP and
gopher retrievals with e-mail servers.  I would compose my
requests offline, dial in, fire them off and then hang up.
After some time elapsed, I would dial in again and download the
goodies in my inbox.  I soon learned how to do searches with
Archie, Veronica, WAIS and even Lycos by e-mail.  This cut down
my online bill and satisfied my need to surf, albeit
vicariously.

<p>I did a lot of research to find ways to do things by e-mail, and
readers also sent in tips.  I didn't really invent anything new,
but I did develop some creative ways to access Usenet, WAIS and
Web search engines by e-mail.

<p>I saw tremendous potential in the Internet, and quickly noticed
that the Net "heroes" were those who provided useful information
at no cost.  I put together the "Accessing" guide and made it
available in FAQ form as a service to the millions worldwide who
are "access-impaired" and as a way to gain recognition as an
expert in one small niche of the online world.

<p>I've gotten tremendous feedback from readers in every corner of
the world, and so far volunteers have translated the guide into
17 languages! And it even helped me to get my foot in the door
to write a monthly column for Boardwatch Magazine.  I've also
got a couple of interesting irons in the online fire...


<p><b>The TourGuide:</b>

<p>Could you tell us a bit about the other Internet projects you've
been responsible for in the past and any others that you may be
working on now?


<p><b>Dr. Bob:</b>

<p>Most of my projects involve writing and the Internet.  I have a
friend who wanted help setting up a virtual publishing company
and electronic bookstore on the web.  You can check out the
fledgling E-Literate effort at http://csbh.mhv.net/~eliterate

<p>My latest and most exciting project is The Internet TourBus, a
twice-weekly mailing list which takes "riders" on a virtual tour
of the Internet.  Patrick Crispen (the ROADMAP guy) and I
collaborate on this, and it's been a lot of fun so far.  One of
our goals is to attract a large audience and sell net-friendly
advertising on the list - and hopefully make a living by
providing high quality Internet content.

<p>You can subscribe to TOURBUS by sending e-mail to
LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM with "SUBSCRIBE TOURBUS Firstname
Lastname" in the body of the note, or view back issues on the

<p><b>The TourGuide:</b>

<p>You certainly have done a great job with Patrick on The Internet
TourBus. It's definitely something that no one on the Internet
should miss. I'd like to thank you for your continued efforts in
making the Internet a bit friendlier and also for your time
given for this interview. Before we bring the interview to a
close, I'd like you to wrap things up by describing your vision
of what the Internet will be like in five years from now.


<p><b>Dr. Bob:</b>

<p>The Internet five years from now?  I was never very good at
predicting the future, but I'll take a shot at it.  What the
heck - if I'm right I'll be hailed as a visionary hero.  If I'm
wrong, nobody will remember my name.  :-)

<p>Let's look *back* five years and see how far we've come.  In
1990, there was no World-Wide Web.  A gopher was a furry animal
that dug under the ground.  Commercial use of the Internet was
strictly taboo, and the online world was primarily the playtoy
of academics.

<p>Today the Web is exploding exponentially.  Gopher has gone from
a nifty information retrieval tool to nearly extinct, and the
'Net is just brimming with commercial activity while the edu's
whine about their minority status.

<p>I think in five years we'll see a continuation of the rapidly
expanding online population.  Only 1 in 4 U.S. households have a
computer today, and of those only 10% are online - so there is a
huge segment of the population that will inexorably be drawn
into cyberspace as media coverage continues and more and more
companies begin to offer deals to their "wired" customers. Today
there are about 20 million Internet users - I'd look for that
number to grow tenfold (worldwide) by the turn of the century.

<p>TV will invade the Web.  As technology enables high-speed data
transfer by the masses, you'll be able to download the evening
news or Star Trek reruns and watch at your leisure.

<p>Usenet will grow, but it's value will diminish as millions of
teenage buttheads invade.  Private commercial mini-Usenets will
evolve to fill the void - people will pay to tap into higher
signal-to-noise conferencing.

<p>You will be able to make long distance phone calls anywhere via
the Internet, basically for free.  The telcos will go wild with
rage and try to recover by getting into the Internet provider
game in a big way.  Look for AT&T to start selling Internet
access for $7.95/month via aggressive telemarketing campaigns.
"And a free personal web page if you order now!"

<p>Mail order catalog houses will all be online, paper catalogs
will quickly become a thing of the past.  Look for 800-number
access to LL Bean's BBS where you can download the latest
interactive catalog at 112Kb.  (Nobody will settle for those
dusty old 56Kb modems in the year 2000!)

<p>Your bank, broker, and even the local supermarket will be
online, offering services you couldn't even imagine today.  They
used to say in computer circles "We don't know what the dominant
computer language will be in the year 2000, but it will be
called Fortran."  I guess in that vein, I could say "We don't
know what the Internet will look like at the turn of the
century, but it will still be called Cyberspace!"  And you'll
look back to the 90's and wonder how we ever managed with those
slow Pentiums and 28.8 modems....
