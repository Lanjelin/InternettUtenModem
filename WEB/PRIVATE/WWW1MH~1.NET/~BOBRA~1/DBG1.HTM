<h2>Chapter 1 - Getting Connected to the Internet</h2>
</center>

<h3>How Do I Get Connected?</h3>

<p>
There are many ways to gain access to the Internet. If you
are at a university, chances are your school has an Internet
connection. Contact the office of computer services or the
computer science department which should be able to point
you in the right direction.

<p>
Many large corporations and even some medium- and small-
sized businesses have Internet access these days. If you
work for a large company, contact your information systems
department or MIS (management information systems) person,
or call the computer help desk, if one exists. If you work
at a smaller company, ask the local computer guru.

<p>
If you don't have access through work or school and you're
just getting started, the easiest thing to do is tap into
one of the major commercial online services. Buy any
computer magazine and shake it until the America Online
(AOL) disk falls out. Take AOL up on its free trial offer,
then buy another magazine or two and look for a free Prodigy
or CompuServe disk. The online services make it very easy to
get started and also offer a trained staff to help when you
have questions.

<p>
You need not limit yourself to the big three commercial
services, however. Internet service providers in your area
(often called local service providers) can offer attractive
rates and good service, and are worth investigating. Chances
are you will save yourself a wad of money by going with a
smaller company, especially if you plan to spend more than
10 or 15 minutes a day online. Since many of these companies
can't afford to advertise in the big dailies, look for their
ads in the free local newspapers or computer magazines.

<p>
Another way to start exploring the Internet is paying a
visit to your public library, which may offer FreeNet (a
free connection to the Internet, only available in some
areas) access to your community. If you're still stumped,
check the back pages of free computer newspapers, like
Computer Currents or MicroTimes for listings of service
providers, or ask a software store salesperson for some
advice.

<h3>What Kind of Access Is Best?</h3>

<p>
Once you pick a place to hang your virtual hat, you might be
faced with the decision of whether to get a SLIP/PPP (Serial
Line Internet Protocol/Point-To-Point Protocol) connection
or a Shell account. (The major online services like AOL,
CompuServe, and Prodigy have their own special built-in
Internet access software, so this discussion doesn't apply.)
Here are some comparisons between the two types of accounts
to help you decide which one suits your needs.

<h4>SLIP/PPP Accounts</h4>

<p>
SLIP/PPP accounts give you access to all the
glitzy online graphics, but you pay the penalty of slower
access. They can be hard to set up too, since you need to
download, install, and configure a bunch of programs before
the fun starts. At the same time, since the SLIP/PPP
software runs on your local computer, rather than a remote
one, the Windows- or Macintosh-based software you'll use to
access the Internet through your account should be familiar
to you because it will look like your other Windows or
Macintosh applications. (See Appendix A for a list of
free SLIP/PPP software sources.)

<h4>Shell Accounts</h4>


<p>
Shell accounts (see Figure 1), on the other hand, give you
a text-only (no pictures) view of the online world, but they
let you get around much faster than SLIP/PPP accounts. Why?

<p>
Because when using a Shell account, you're directly
accessing the Internet via your provider's high-speed link,
instead of piping the data through your (slower) modem. And
you've also got less data to move, because the graphics
don't have to be transferred.

<p>
Shell accounts are also much simpler to set up than SLIP/PPP
accounts, because you don't need to install a bunch of
software.  When you use them you're dialing into a remote
computer where everything you need to access the Internet is
already installed, configured, and ready to run. Still,
although they're simpler to set up than SLIP/PPP accounts,
shell accounts require you to learn a few UNIX commands
before you can navigate the Internet. (See Appendix XX for a
list of Shell account providers.)

<h3>Which One Should I Get?</h3>

<p>
If you want full Internet accessthe ability to interact by
pointing and clicking and to view pretty picturesand aren't
overwhelmingly concerned with the speed of your connection,
SLIP/PPP is the way to go. It should be easy for you to get
SLIP/PPP software that runs pretty much right out of the box
from service providers like Netcom or The Well.

<p>
On the other hand, if you don't care to get any special
software, you don't mind the command line, text-only, DOS-
like approach, and you prefer speed to pretty pictures, a
Shell account is your best bet. And, if you've got a slower
modem (9600 baud or less), you should seriously consider a
Shell account because your access to the Internet will be
much faster than with a SLIP/PPP connection.
