<h1>Tiltology -- Opiate for the Jaded!</h1>

<P>So, just what the <EM>heck is <STRONG>Tiltology?</STRONG></EM>  I'm
glad you asked, my son.  Fortunately, I've taken the time to generate this
for your amusement and edification -- <EM>or perhaps for <STRONG>my</STRONG>
amusement and edification</EM> -- you can never tell. While you're at it, you
might check out the <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#62" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/cgh/">Church of Good HTML</A>, as well.

<P>The first question, of course, is <EM>what's contained in this
document?</EM>

<H2><A NAME="thestart">How It All Started</A></H2>

<P>Why, it all started with a winter day in 1992, when all my finals
were done, and nobody else was around.  Was I bored?  You bet your
booties.  So bored that I was started posting vociferously to
<CODE>willamette.news</CODE>, that paragon of Usenet reproducibility.
One of the posts in question answered Brian Brown's question as to why
I go by my middle name (and I <STRONG>do</STRONG> still have a copy
around of the <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#939" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/name.html">answer</A>, at least), and contains
the first reference ever to "willamette.religion.tiltology", a
fictional newsgroup off the top of my head (with a nod to <A
HREF="news:alt.religion.kibology">alt.religion.kibology</A>, a
newsgroup now only of historical significance, ever since Kibo wandered
off in a snit).

<P>After that, things started to snowball, seeing as how I have
<EM>way</EM> too much time on my hands <EM><A
HREF="PROJEC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/projects.html">(yeah, right)</A></EM>.  More and more postings
appeared which referred to this fictional group, and the ratio of
silly to serious postings increased to an almost ludicrous extent
<EM>(and not just postings from <STRONG>me,</STRONG> mind you!)</EM>.  It
was getting to the point where my <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#948" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/ego.html">ego</A> was about
to explode, and willamette.news, which had never been very useful
anyway, had degenerated to the point of uselessness for the majority
of readers.

<P>The cry went out: <A
HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#917" tppabs="ftp://history.cc.ukans.edu/pub/history/.html/Europe_Modern_Russia.html"><STRONG>what
is to be done?</STRONG></A>

<P>Fortunately, at this time, I was <A
HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#949" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/illumination.html">illuminated</A>, and
alt.willamette.religion.tiltology was born <EM>(not to be confused
with what has happened since, which is that
alt.willamette.religion.tiltology has been <A
HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#949" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/illumination.html">borne</A>)</EM>.  It was April 1st, and what a
glorious April Fool's Joke it was!

<DL>
<DT> Twinkies
<DD> The All Important Holy <EM>Twinkie</EM> is either a potent world-making
symbol, or a really yucky pastry-substitute.  Unfortunately, both
Joseph Campbell and Marshall McLuhan were unavailable for comment.
The Twinkie has been used as amulet, a ceiling decoration, a name for
a winning <A
HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS4.HTM#428" tppabs="gopher:">Internet
Hunt team</A>, and as the sobriquet for Willamette's first X terminal.
This symbol can be traced back to Nigel, that
meme-supplier to the stars.
<DT> <A NAME="vita-x">Vitamin X</A>
<DD> <EM>Vitamin X</EM> is the vim which gives us vigor, and the vigor
which gives us vim.  This world-renewal symbol is what flows from Tilt
into the (not-so) devoted Tiltologists around the world and around the
campus.  Vitamin X puts pep into your pep, recursively, and, as
Douglas Hofstadter might add, constitutes the first two words of this
sentence.  Without a good day's supply of Vitamin X, you might just
have a blase afternoon!
<DT> <A NAME="priestesses">Priestesses</A>
<DD> The world-centering <em>(by now, we all should have recognized
<CITE>Religions of Mesoamerica</CITE>, that wholly remarkable book by
David Carrasco, coming soon to a World-Views class near you)</em>
symbol of the <EM>Priestesses</EM> is perhaps the oldest and the
silliest of Tiltology.  Priestesses are the Tiltological cognoscenti
who provide balance against the unbalanced Tilt; the canonical
intelligentsia how give clarification the rants of "Eric"; and the
bearers of the <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#955" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/a.w.r.t138">highly prized</A> but easily
dispensed <A HREF="TILTTI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/tilttitles.html">titles</A> of the
fastest growing Tiltology in the world!  Priestesses are not
neccessarily of the traditionally expected gender -- males and females
serve equally and gleefully, because we're <STRONG>that</STRONG> kind
of forward-thinking religion for the coming millenium.  (Yeah,
whatever.)

<P>Because I was feeling frisky one day (right before the creation of
a.w.r.t.), I decided to start archiving willamette.news.  Actually, it
was because they were talking about me, and I felt like keeping the
articles around 'cuz they were great fun -- but that's another story
that won't be going into <A HREF="INDEX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/index.html">my hyplan</A>.
Recently, while I was feeling even more frisky, I started generating a
WWW index of the <CODE>willamette.news</CODE> archives. (And since I later
felt like I was keeping a ton of useless and mostly unfunny crap around
in my online disk archives, I'm not archiving it at all. But it is important
because it led to the next paragraph, and more directly, to what the
next paragraph describes.)

<P>However, the immediate effect of archiving willamette.news was that,
when a.w.r.t. was generated soon after, I was easily able to <A
HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#956" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/a.w.r.t">archive that, as well</A>.  (And, actually, the <A
HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#956" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/a.w.r.t">a.w.r.t. WWW index</A> has been around about three
weeks longer then the willamette.news archive, which provides a nice
nesting effect... &gt;=) )
