<P><EM>(This area isn't finished yet, mind you...)</EM>

<P>Metanoia House (1987-1992) was a grand experiment, a
congregation of like souls, a test of endurance, a spirit, a dream, an
ideal, and a family.  This portion of my <A
HREF="../INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/">personal hyperspace</A> is devoted
to a memory of Metanoia.

<P>I sit here, late at night, and I ponder what has come before.  And I
give requiem, finally, to the haven of the tender years of my college
experience.  Metanoia offered me much my freshman year at Willamette,
and now I offer these memories back to it.

<P>The word "metanoia" is Greek for "change in spirit" -- an experience
which suddenly opens your world, expands your heart, and illuminates
your mind.  It is perhaps fitting that I -- a student of both computer
science and history -- should be assembling this space, an homage to
my friends and to an ideal, and to a place that indeed wrought a
change in spirit in me and in all that it touched.

<P>When I arrived at Willamette, I was a scared and nervous freshman.  I
had survived four years of high school and a few years more then that in
adolescence, and I was a little bit worried about having to start from
scratch all over again.  Living with a roommate, getting away from
home . . . it was all very exciting, but it was also all a little
scary.

<P>Willamette had sent me some residence hall information, and had asked
me to fill out a form so they could place me in "the Right Place" on
campus.  But how is someone to choose a residence hall based solely on
a <A HREF="BLURB~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/metanoia/blurb.html">one-paragraph blurb in a campus guidebook</A>?
I picked two big halls, and checked Metanoia House as almost an
afterthought -- I liked the fact that it was only about 30 people
strong, and that it emphasized things like awareness and community.
Ironically, those same reasons also had me leaning somewhat against
leaning there, because I suspected that it would be full of
those who wouldn't think (you can be dogmatic <EM>and</EM> liberal
just as easily as you can be dogmatic and conservative,
unfortunately), or those who didn't think and were just posing as
people who cared.

<P>But while I suspected that things like "awareness and community" were
nothing but cliches for the liberal-minded young college student, I
was fortunately served by my afterthought.  I did, indeed, end up in
Metanoia house, and I found it to be populated by people who cared,
people who were passionate . . . people who I could be happy to call
my friends.

<P>Since my freshman year, Metanoia has seen it's hey-day, and finally
faded away.  But it lives on in the hearts of those who lived there,
loved it, fought for it, and eventually let it go.  And it lives on in
this little pocket of virtual reality, perhaps to inspire kindred
souls whose wandering brings them this way.
