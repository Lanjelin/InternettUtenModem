<H1>Flyer to Shepard House Freshmen, Fall 1993</H1>

	Welcome to college!  You are about to embark upon the final phase of your youth -- a metamorphosis from adolescence to maturity which will leave you an independent, thinking adult--and we at the Metanoia Community are proud to have a chance to be a part of that.<P>

	Metanoia (the name, by the way, derives from the Greek term for <I>change of spirit</I>) is an organization the emphasizes change and growth, both personally and socially.  We believe that the world can be a better place, but that we must accept our own responsibility to help make it so.  Rather than complain, we must do.<P>

		Metanoia has a strong commitment to diversity and tolerance:  while many members often hold strong (and opposing) views, the spirit of Metanoia is to understand the "other side."  Understanding and compromise are the keys to success, in the big issues as well as in one's personal life.  While Right and Wrong may paint the issues in black and white, Metanoia understands the sliding grey scale in between that takes judgment to discern, not dogma.<P>

Metanoia is more than just a belief, however.  Metanoia is truly a community--one which is supportive and nurturing.  The dual benefits of a small dorm and energetic, dedicated individuals combine to create an atmosphere of closeness that truly resembles a family; a family which you will appreciate the support of in your first year away from home.<P>

	This year, however, presents a new challenge: Metanoia has undergone a "change in spirit" as well . . . it has metamorphosed from Metanoia House to Shepard House, Home of the Metanoia Community.  We have changed our location, and we have changed our size (from 30 to 45 residents), and we have changed, in a subtle way, our nature.  Our community has become a subset of Shepard House, and we now face a pivotal year.  Because of this expansion, we can no longer expect that all those who have chosen this house have chosen because of Metanoia -- but for those of you who did not, we can hope that you will become a part of our tradition as well.  It is you who will be the new life-blood of Metanoia; it is you who will carry on our traditions to the following years.  This year we forge a new tradition of service, love, and excellence.<P>

	It is an exciting time to be at Metanoia; like last year, it promises to be a time of rebirth and reawakening, a harkening back to noble ideals and purposes for which Metanoia was founded, five years ago.  Opportunities are unlimited to become involved -- for those of you who abound with ideas, you will find willing assistants and advisors; for those of you who want to help, you will find grateful acceptance of your time and energy.  Together, as we enter the 151st year of Willamette's history, we will redefine and revitalize the tradition of Metanoia so that it will last for the next 150 years.<P>

The above is the text of a flyer -- <A HREF="../INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/">written by yours
truly</A> -- which was distributed to the new freshmen in Shepard
House, at the very beginning of fall semester of 1993.  Metanoia --
just the year before a house of its own -- had become a subset of
Shepard House, and this document was an attempt to explain what it was
that Metanoia <EM>was</EM>.  Perhaps now it can serve that same
purpose to the Web.<P>
