described above in Article I.  Voting in Metanoia House takes place
within one of two frameworks: simple majority vote, or the Consensus
Circle.

<A NAME="a4s1"><H3>Section 1</H3></A>

<P> The Consensus Circle shall be made up of all Members present at
Hall Council meetings, and shall only reach decisions by unanimous
consent.  Votes of consent, dissent, or abstention may be cast,
consensus only being reached when all votes (except abstentions) are
either consenting or dissenting.  Should there be a division of
opinions, Members of the Consensus Circle will be recognized by the
HeDaShe and allowed to speak on behalf of their viewpoint.  It shall
be the HeDaShe's responsibility to limit speaking times and facilitate
discussion.  If an issue is divided more than three successive times
in a single meeting, the HeDaShe may move the vote to a later meeting.
An issue may be moved to a later meeting by consent of the circle.

<A NAME="a4s2"><H3>Section 2</H3></A>

<P> An issue may be decided by simple majority vote if it is of a minor
nature.  The HeDaShe shall be responsible for determining an issue's
nature, but this decision may be changed if any member of the
Consensus Circle feels it should be decided by Consensus.  Conversely,
an issue considered by the HeDaShe as being of a major nature can be
instead decided by majority vote if Consented to by the Circle.

<A NAME="a4s3"><H3>Section 3</H3></A>

<P> In order for any decisions to be made by the Hall , at least 30%
of all Full Members must be present.

<A NAME="a5"><H2>Article V - Elections</H2></A>

<A NAME="a5s1"><H3>Section 1</H3></A>

<P> Hall Council elections will be completed, not including any
run-off elections, by the third week of each semester.  Run-off
elections shall be completed in a timely manner, not taking longer
than a week between the time a run-of election is announced and the
time at which results are announced.

<A NAME="a5s2"><H3>Section 2</H3></A>

<P> Those candidates will be declared elected who receive a majority
of votes cast.  If no candidate for a certain position receives a
majority, there will be a run-of election between the top two
candidates.

<A NAME="a6"><H2>Article VI - Standing Committees</H2></A>

<A NAME="a6s1"><H3>Section 1 - Orientation Committee</H3></A>

incoming RD's and RA's, if possible, and up to 3 more interested hall

<ol>

<li> <A NAME="hallfunds">Appropriations of Hall Funds</A>

<ol>

<li> Monies may be appropriated by agreement of the hall, as outlined
in article IV.

</ol>

<li><A NAME="amendment">Amendment Process</A>

<ol>

<li> Amendments to the constitution may be proposed to Executive
Council by any member of the hall.

<li> To be brought to a hall vote, the amendment must by approved by a
consensus of the Executive Council, or by the agreement of a majority
of Members.

<li> The constitution shall be amended if it gains a three-fourths
majority of an all-House vote.

</ol>

<li><A NAME="recall">Recall</A>

<ol>

<li> Recall of an elected officer is a matter that should not be taken
lightly.  For this reason, the recall process outlined below is
designed to be arduous, similar to the amendment process.  Recall
should only be undertaken in cases of extreme neglect or incompetence
in the performance of that official's duties.

<li> The recall process will consist of the following: an initial vote
by Hall meeting to start the recall process; the recall hearing; and
finally a vote to recall.  The Coordinator shall conduct the recall
process, unless the Coordinator is the officer being recalled, in
which case the Liaison shall conduct the recall process.

<li> The motion to recall will be made like any other motion before
the hall.  This motion will be voted on by all Members of the Hall,
except the advisor(s) and RA, and must pass by a three-quarters
majority of votes cast.

<li> The recall hearing will be held at the following Executive
Council meeting.  The entire Executive Council, the advisor and the
individual whose performance is being reviewed must all be present at
the hearing.  At this hearing, the individual in question must have a
fair opportunity to defend his/her behavior.

<li> The testimony given at the recall hearing will be posted by the
Secretary before the final vote.

<li> After the recall hearing, the Executive Council, with the
exception of the individual in question, will decide by consensus if
the recall process will be continued. Its decision will be announced
at the hall meeting.  The decision of the Executive Council may be
overridden if all present at the hall meeting (excluding the Executive
Council) consent, so long as they form a valid Consensus Circle as
outlined in Section IV (with specific regard to the requirement of 30%
of Members being in this Consensus Circle).

<li> Should it be decided that the recall will proceed, a vote to
recall will be held.  The quorum for this vote is three-quarters of
the Hall residents.  The motion will be voted on by all voting and
non-voting members of the Hall , and will pass with a three-fourths
majority of votes cast.
