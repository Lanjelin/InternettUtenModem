	"Built in 1963, the house is named for Cyrus Shepard, a missionary and companion of Jason Lee.  Shepard provides a small-group living option for students.  Shepard has several lounge and living areas including a large finished basement study area.  Double-occupancy study rooms are located primarily on the second floor.  Residents sleep in sleeping porches where 24-hour quiet is enforced.  This unique feature is popular because it allows a student to sleep at any time without being disturbed by others.<P>

	"Shepard also houses the Metanoia Community.  Metanoia is a Greek word for change.  Metanoia emphasizes forming a diverse, caring and responsible community that will heighten political, social and environmental awareness among its members and the Willamette campus as a whole.  Shepard House operates on a consensus style of government.  This provides a forum in which each resident's opinion counts, making each person an integral part of the house's functioning."
