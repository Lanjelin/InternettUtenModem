<H1>Some Information:</H1>

<p>I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. I'm
part of the <a
href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#405" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/coda/Web/coda.html">Odyssey</a>
project, doing work on function shipping under adverse network
conditions.  I recently finished writing a book (with Carl Steadman
and Tyler Jones) about designing and maintaining Web servers -- <i>Web
Weaving</i>. It appeared on bookshelves in December 1995 from Addison
Wesley. You should check out <a
href="../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#62" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/cgh/">Composing Good HTML</a> if you
want a sneak peek.</p>

<p>My <a
href="INTERE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/interests.html">interests</a> are
diverse, and sometimes match up with whatever <a
href="PROJEC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/projects.html">projects</a> I happen
to be working on at the present. Briefly, though, I'm fascinated by
the convergence of high technology and the humanities -- which is
partially to blame for my double major in History and Computer
Science. Things like the Web really blow my mind.</p>

<P>I'm married (as of January 3rd, 1997) to the lovely and talented
<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#423" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/jeliza/www/index.html">Jeliza Patterson</A>,
which, needless to say, makes me a very, very happy camper. (And
that's about as much personal information about me as you'll get.)</P>

<H2>Contact Information</H2>

 <P> Here's some information on how to get ahold of me during my stay
at <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#424" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</A>:

<H2>Home address</H2>

 <P> My current place of residence is 2225 Murray Ave., Apt C,
Pittsburgh, PA 15217.  I can be reached by phone at (412) 521-6008.
See also the section on <A HREF="#email">e-mail</A>, below.

<H2>"Work" address</H2>

<P> By day (and sometimes by night), I'm a graduate fellow in
Computer Science, lusting after my PhD (1999... 1999... 1999... it
<EM>will</EM> happen...). When I'm at school, my office is Wean Hall
8122, and my phone number is (412) 268-3070. I can be reached postally
via the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000
Forbes Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15213. <A NAME="email">E-mail</A> also
will work.

<H2><A NAME="email">E-mail</A></H2>

<P> The best way to reach me is via e-mail, at <A
HREF="mailto:tilt+mailto@cs.cmu.edu"><i>tilt+@cs.cmu.edu</i></A>.
Your mileage my vary, though. I tend two group e-mail into one of two
categories: urgent, and non-urgent. Anything that I consider urgent
gets answered within a few days, while anything I don't consider
urgent tends to get answered the next time I have time to root through
my e-mail. Recently, this has been every one to three months.

<p>My &quot;real&quot; <a

and usually has up-to-date information about my travel plans. If
you're not too multimedia and post-literate, it might be of interest.
