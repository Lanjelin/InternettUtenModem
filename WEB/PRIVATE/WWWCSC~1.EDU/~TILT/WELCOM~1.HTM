<div align=right><p>hello.</p>

<p>this is an experiment.</p>

<p> for a while now, i've stood about, <a
    href="../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#62" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/cgh/">composing good <font
    SIZE="-1">little</font> html</a> that
<br>did what it was supposed to while -- on the sidelines -- i've been
<br>indulging in a growing fascination with <tt>graphic design</tt>
<BR>and <tt>typography</tt>.</p></div>

<p>What to make of this?</p>

<div align=right>
<p> unclear. i continue to beleive in the merits of explicit semantic 
<br>rendering, and to be less than convinced that html, in any form, 
<br>is a suitable platform for even approaching the richness of 
<br>the implicit semantic renderings a skilled designer can acheive 
<br>in &quot;old media,&quot; back in that crazy <font SIZE="+2">gutenberg
    galaxy 
<br></font>we're all so ready to flee.</p></div>

<p>So what's all <font SIZE="+2">this</font> then?</p>

<div align=right><p>it's a test.</p>

<p> this is where i mess around with all these crazy netscapisms
<br>that for years i've been telling everyone to not use. this is where
<br>i play around and see what kinds of fun i can get. this is where 
<br>i catch up with the seven billion years of net time 
<br>i just missed by walking into the other room to look at 
<br>what <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#63" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jeliza/">jeliza</a>'s got on
    the hopper.</p></div>

<p><i>Hypocrite.</i> You've been slapping us on the wrist for 
<br>years for <b>just this kind of crap</b>.</p>

<div align=right>
<p><i><font SIZE="+2">so?</font></i>&nbsp;go eat a hot dog bun.
<a href="PRINCI~1/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/principia/">eris</a> loves you.</p>

<p>seriously, how am i supposed to tell you how to use all this 
<br>crazy stuff intelligently if i don't try it out? and it's about bloody
<BR>time. i've finally snapped far enough out of my crustacean ways to
<BR>acknowledge this stuff can do some good; now it's time to figure
<BR>out how to wield it for the side of goodness. or at least see
<BR>if it can get me a pizza.</p></div>

<p>OK. What the <b><font COLOR="#FF0000">Hell</font></b>. I'll give it
a go.</p>

<div align=right><p>good. <a href="INDEX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/index.html">get out of here</a> before
i slap you upside the head with a zen master.</p></div>
