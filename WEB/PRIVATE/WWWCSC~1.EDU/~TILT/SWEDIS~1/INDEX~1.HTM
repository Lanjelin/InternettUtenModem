<H1>Welcome to the Swedish FishCam!</H1>

<P>The Swedish FishCam is dedicated to bringing nature closer to <I>you</I>,
the home viewer. As you sit at your terminal, feverishly clicking away,
we rest easy knowing that we've brought a glimpse of something external
into your increasingly internalized life.</P>

<P>The Swedish FishCam is updated every ten seconds; re-load this page to
see the latest antics of those crazy fish!</P>

<H2>About the SFC</H2>

<P>The Swedish FishCam is mounted somewhere near Atlantis, where the last
known free-roaming school of Swedish Fish (<I>Edishway Ishfay</I>) roam
freely. Watch carefully! The Swedish Fish do have a few natural predators
-- if you are lucky, you may catch a glimpse!</P>

<P>The technology behind the SFC consists of a Sony HandyCam, a <A
HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#732" tppabs="http://www.play.com/pages/snappy/">Snappy video frame
grabber</A>, and a Pentium 90. (Some early versions of the image
retrieval software seemed to have bugs resulting in corrupted images,
but that problem appears to be fixed now.)</P>

<H6>Disclaimers</H6>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2>No Swedish Fish have been harmed in bringing the Swedish
FishCam (SFC) to the Internet community at large. This is largely because
we used &quot;Darlin' Marlin&quot; instead, a knockoff from the Northwest
(of the USA). This is because we like the Northwest better than Sweden,
having grown up there. Nyeh. (However, we do prefer Ikea to the furniture
made in the Northwest.)</FONT></P>
