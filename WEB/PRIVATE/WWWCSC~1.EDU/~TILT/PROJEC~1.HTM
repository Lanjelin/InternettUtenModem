<p>Here you will find a listing of what is currently whetting my whistle,
as well as pointers to finished projects of interest (mostly of the online
variety).</p>

<h1><a name="stable">Stable:</a></h1>

<p>These are the things which are still subject to change, but probably
aren't going to wiggle out from under you while you're looking at them.
Screw the &quot;under construction&quot; aesthetic.</p>

<li>Graduate School

<ul>

<li>I entered the PhD program in computer science here at
    <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#424" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a> in the fall of 1995.
    I hope to be out of here within 4-6 years of then :).
</ul>

<li><a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#405" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/coda/Web/coda.html">Odyssey</a>

<ul>

<li>I'm currently working on a bandwidth aware web-proxy; and,
<li>in general, I'm interested in the topic of function shipping as a method
    for adapting to mobility.

<li>(See my <a href="RESEAR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/research.html">research</a> page for more information.)

<li> <a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#62" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/cgh/">Composing Good HTML</a>

<ul>

<li>This style guide is all about how to create HTML which is portable
across many server platforms. It's pretty stable right now, but it changes
ocassionally to reflect changes in my thinking and constructive criticism
I receive from <i>you</i>, the home reader :). A stable release appeared
in print form of December of 1995, in the form of a book from Addison-Wesley
called <cite><a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#425" tppabs="http://www.aw.com/devpress/titles/48959.html">Web
Weaving</a></cite> (see the <cite><a href="#finished">Finished</a></cite>
section below for more details).
</ul>

<li>A hypertext rantscription of the counterculture classic,

<li>Hail Eris. Fnord. Slack. &quot;Bob.&quot; Oh, just go read the damn
thing and wallow in your techno-geekiness. I know I did.

<li>When I was eleven, I made a raspberry through a tube of metal. I've
never looked back.

<ul>

<li>I'm the student member of the current web troika, and help out with
content creation and maintenance. Don't send e-mail to me about SCS web
problems, though -- send it to
<a href="mailto:wwwsrv+@cs.cmu.edu">wwwsrv@cs.cmu.edu</a>.
(You'll probably get a response more quickly this way.)

<p>These are the things that I've pretty much wrapped up and shipped. Enjoy
'em while they're hot!</p>

<h2>Publications:</h2>

<ul>
<li><cite><a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#425" tppabs="http://www.aw.com/devpress/titles/48959.html">Web
    Weaving</a></cite>

<ul>

<li>In January of 1995, Carl Steadman, Tyler Jones, and I got together
with the idea of writing a book all about how to create and maintain
large and scalable web sites. In December of 1995, <cite>Web
Weaving</cite> hit shelves.  It's published by Addison-Wesley, and is
available at fine bookstores everywhere.

</ul>

<li>Every Student's Guide to the Internet

<ul>

<li>I co-authored this with four other folks from <a
href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#427" tppabs="http://www.willamette.edu/">Willamette University</a> in
1995. It's a textbook on how to use popular Internet tools, and is
published by McGraw-Hill. There are Unix, Mac, and Windows editions of
the book.

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Programming:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Prospero

<ul>
<li>Prospero is a microkernel (really! despite the amount of sweat I poured
into it, it's only about 4K of executable code for the kernel proper) for
building Object-Oriented Operating Systems. It was my senior project for
my CS major at Willamette. It consists of a fair piece of ix86 assembly
code providing object creating and messaging services, as well as a rudimentary
set of OS services (Caliban). If you're interested in source or other
information, feel free to send me e-mail.
</ul>

<li><a href="FOCUS/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/focus/">FOCUS</a>

<ul>
<li>This &quot;FOrm-based Customizable User Shell&quot; was something I
wrote in the summer of 1993, while I&nbsp;was cutting my teeth on the curses
library and on Unix hacking in general. I didn't know about Lynx or Mosaic
at the time, and ended up building a terminal-based HyperCard-esque tool
for Unix. It's kinda cute, and should be fairly portable. Feel free.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Online projects:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs4.htm#428" tppabs="gopher:">Oregon Online</a>

<ul>
<li>In the spring and summer of 1995, I did some work for the Oregon State
Library for the Oregon Online gopher. I ported and re-wrote the scripts
which maintain the database of information, including bits which track
who's maintaining what data on the server, and automatically cleaning out
stale information (after alerting the maintainers that the data is about
to expire). It was a fun project, and gave me further ideas about how better
to automate the cleaning of an infostructure.
</ul>
</ul>

<h1><a name="squirrely">Squirrely:</a></h1>

<p>This is stuff in various stages of development, from just a thought
to a detailed mockup. Remember, you get what you pay for.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="PINEAL~1/INDEX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/pinealweb/index.html">PinealWeb</a>

<ul>
<li>Why optimize for Netscape or Internet Explorer? PinealWeb dumps global
knowledge <i>right into your third eye!</i> (This is handy for developing
distributed systems.)
</ul>

<li>The <a href="METANOIA/INDEX~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/metanoia/index.html">Metanoia</a> archive

<ul>
<li>This is an archive of documents related to Metanoia, the
    consciouness-raising and consensus-reaching dorm of fun from my
    undergraduate days. If you're interested in
    <a href="METANOIA/CONSEN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/metanoia/consensus.html">background
    information on consensus-style government</a>, this might be of interest.
    Or if you just want to read (for fun) the
    <a href="METANOIA/CONSTI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/metanoia/constitution.html">constitution</a>
    and <a href="METANOIA/MISSIO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/metanoia/mission.html">mission
    statement</a> I helped write.
</ul>
