<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The distribution, <CITE><A
HREF="FOCUST~1.Z" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/focus/focus.tar.Z">focus.tar.Z</A></CITE> v1.0, is available, as some
may find the code useful.  The code is only known to work on a sun4
system, however -- caveat emptor! I don't currently have it available
via FTP, so if you're interested send me e-mail. Feel free to attempt
to modify it to work on other systems.  The <A

format.<P>

FOCUS is a curses based form processor, which provides

<ul>
<li>The ability to fill out forms and send via e-mail
<li>Functionality as a nice "front end" for other unix programs
<li>Ability to provide a "hypertext-like" menuing interface for unix
</ul>

FOCUS began life as an Inter-Library Loan form processor.<p>

It originally provided simply for text fields which could be
filled out, and the ability to mail a form to a particular person.  It has
since gained the following "features":

<ul>
<li>Editable Text Fields
<li>Toggle Fields with Multiple Preset Values
<li>Buttons which can perform actions (such as calling another program, or
calling another form)
</ul><p>
