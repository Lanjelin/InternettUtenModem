<H1>Introduction</H1>

Focus is an interactive interpreter and displayer of forms written in
"Focal", the FOrm Composition Almost-Language.  Originally
designed as an interactive form-processor, it has evolved into a
general purpose front-end that can be adapted for use with nearly any
unix application.  It also provides a "hypertext"-like method of
navigation between different forms.<P>

Focus is perhaps unique, in that it provides a unified screen-based
environment for users in a unix environment, using the curses library.
This means that friendly interfaces and "infostructures" can be
provided for users who only have access to VT100 terminal emulation,
or other similar kinds of text-based displays.  While it certainly
doesn't provide a fully-functional windowing environment, it does
provide a consistent environment to run other applications from -- as
well as allowing many unix commands to be executed without ever having
to leave the Focus environment.<P>

What is a form?  A form is, essentially, a description of a screen.  A
form can contain four kinds of information:

<UL>

<LI> straight text
<LI> editable text fields
<LI> text fields with a finite number of preset values
<LI> "buttons" which can perform some sort of action

</UL>

Forms are also dynamic -- depending on the environment, the user's
preferences, or the results of external commands, the appearance of a
form might be modified "on the fly".  A number of different options
are available in the creations of forms, including:<P>

<UL>

<LI> non-editable text fields
<LI> fields which require a value
<LI> fields for which the entered value must fulfill a specific requirement
<LI> default values
<LI> variables
<LI> dialog boxes, selection boxes, and display boxes
<LI> conditionally invisible lines

</UL>

How to create forms will be covered in the section on Focal.  However,
rest assured that it is very easy to create simple forms consisting of
text, and editable fields.<P>

<HR>

<A NAME="reference"><H1>Creating Forms -- The Focal Description
Language</H1></A>

All forms are simply text files, with special syntax indicating where
special items such as buttons and fields are desired.  Focus provides
formatting, centering, and screen-sizing automatically -- all that is
neccessary is to indicate what type of information is wanted on the
form.<P>

Forms can be in one of two places -- either in the user's personal
directory (~/forms, unless otherwise specified in the environment
variable FORMDIR), or in the system-wide form directory.  The FOCAL
interpreter engine (Focus) will look first in the user's form
directory, and then in the system-wide form directory.  Every form is
specified by a unique file name (and so, a user can replace a system
form with a personalized form by placing a form of the same name in
her own form directory).<P>

A form consists of lines -- each line will contain either a directive,
a variable assignment, a comment, text, or a button or field
description of some sort, as described below.  Lines are terminated by
carriage returns.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Directives</H2>

In order to specify certain information about the entire form, Focal
employs "directives".  A directive is a single line of text, which
begins with the character "#" and has a keyword immediately following.
Directives which are available are:<P>

<H3>Form Title</H3>

<CODE>#form: &lt;form title></CODE><P>

This directive allows a title to be specified for the form.
This title will be displayed centered, and in reverse video, on the
top of the screen.  It will not appear in any output to actions.<P>

If no title is specified, the title "(Untitled)" will be displayed.<P>

Variable substitution in this directive is not supported.<P>

Example:<BR>
<CODE>#form: File Utilities</CODE><P>

<H3>RFC822 Headers</H3>

<CODE>#to: &lt;email address></CODE><BR>
<CODE>#subject: &lt;mail subject></CODE><P>

This pair of directives provide for the automatic mailing of a form,
without having to specify an explicit action.  When the "#to:"
directive is supplied, than the ^X command will mail the form to the
address given.  If a "#subject:" line is provided, then it will be
used as the subject for the mailing list.<P>

No variable substitution is currently possible with these directives,
though support for this may eventually be added.<P>

<H3>Action of the Form</H3>

<CODE>#result: &lt;an action></CODE><P>

This directive allows an action to be associated with the form (for a
description of actions, see below).<P>

<H3>Form to Replace With</H3>

<CODE>#replace: &lt;form name></CODE><P>

This directive takes the file name of another form.  Upon closing this
form, the new form is to be opened, before returning to the original
form.  Essentially, the current form is popped off of the stack of
forms, and the new form is pushed onto the top of the stack.  In this
way, a directed sequence can be created.<P>

This directive is not recommended for habitual use -- it disrupts the
normal flow of navigation, and can be confusing unless used with care.
One possible use might be to have a series of pages of nothing but
text, linked together by a trail of "#replace" directives.  Since
pressing the space bar will normally cause you to return from a form
that has no fields or buttons, you can use this as a pseudo-paging
mechanism.<P>

Once again, there is no variable substitution support.<P>

<H3>New Group of Fields</H3>

<CODE>#newgroup</CODE><P>

This directive is for the formatting of editable text fields.
Normally, all text fields in a group will share the same left margin,
like so:<P>

<PRE>
Name:         [                                            ]
Phone Number: [                                            ]
Address:      [                                            ]
Age:          [                                            ]
</PRE>

If a #newgroup directive were placed between "Phone Number:" and
"Address:", then two groups would be created, and the formatting would
look like this:<P>

<PRE>
Name:         [                                            ]
Phone Number: [                                            ]
Address: [                                                 ]
Age:     [                                                 ]
</PRE>

This is directive is usually placed before any new logical grouping of
text fields is begun.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Variable Assignment</H2>

If the first character of a line is "$", then the line contains a
variable assignment.  This sets internal variables upon the opening of
the form.  The syntax is<P>

<CODE>$variablename = new variable value</CODE><P>

For example,<P>

<CODE>$phonenumber = 555-4BOB</CODE><P>

If the new value given begins with a '$', then the variable is
assigned the value of whichever internal variable is specified.  If
the new value begins with a '%', then the appropriate environment
variable is used.<P>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> If the variable "$debug" is set to "true", then
Focus will run in debugging mode.  (For now, this simply means that
the ^G help screen will display a list of currently assigned
variables).<P>

Also, Focus uses the value of the $shell variable to determine which
shell to invoke upon a ^N or '!'.  It may be desirable to include the
line<P>

<CODE>$shell = %shell</CODE><P>

in your home form.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Straight Text</H2>

A line is "straight text" if it does not contain the pair of
characters [], and doesn't begin with #, $, *, !.  Straight text is
simply text that is printed to the screen or output to actions,
without being modifiable or interactive in any way.  For instance, the
first few lines of the home form are straight text.<P>

Straight text is used for descriptions and explanations for the user,
or for providing formatting information for actions.<P>

Straight text can come in three flavors, providing the form designer
with a way of having text which might only appear in the form, or only
appear in the mailed version:<P>

<UL>
<LI> If there is no special character in the first position, then it is
both printed to the screen, and considered part of the standard output
to actions.

<LI> If there is a "&lt;" as the first character, the text will only be used
as standard output, and never be displayed on the screen.  (For
example, "For Office Use Only:" kinds of text could be placed here.)

<LI> If there is a ">" as the first character, the text is only displayed
on the screen, and never sent to the standard output.  Help for the
user can be placed on such a line (so that, if you were to mail the
form, the "unimportant" help information won't be mailed as well).
</UL>

A line of straight text can also have a conditional visibility
expression associated with it (see Conditional Visibility Expressions).

<HR>

<H2>Editable Text Field</H2>

An editable text field is described in the format:<P>

<CODE>{conditional visibility expression} Field Title [Default Value] :
width > $storage {verification expression} (action) ;comment</CODE><P>

(all on one, unbroken line.)  However, the simple version is:<P>

<CODE>Field Title [Default Value]</CODE><P>

Note that everything is optional -- the only essential requirement for
a field is that the "[" and "]" characters are contained within it.  A
simple description of a field might be:<P>

<CODE>Name: []</CODE><P>

Which would show up on the screen as<P>

<PRE>
Name: [                                                     ]
</PRE>

after Focus automatically formats it.  If you wanted to specify a
default width, you could use<P>

<CODE>Name:[] : 5</CODE><P>

which would give you:<P>

<PRE>
Name: [     ]
</PRE>

and so forth.<P>

You can also specify a default value, which can consist of both text
and variables.  To delimit blocks of text from variables, use the
comma.  So:<P>

<CODE>Name: [John Smith]</CODE>

would become<P>

<PRE>
Name: [John Smith                                           ]
</PRE>

and,<P>

<CODE>Name: [$middlename]</CODE><P>

would, if $middlename was equal to "Bob", become<P>

<PRE>
Name: [Bob                                                  ]
</PRE>

Likewise,<P>

<CODE>Name: [John , $middlename, Smith]</CODE><P>

would become<P>

<PRE>
Name: [John Bob Smith                                       ]
</PRE>

If a variable name is specified with a % (such as %USER), then an
environment variable is substituted.<P>

Also, if you want to store the contents of the field into an internal
variable, you would use the syntax<P>

<CODE>Name: [] > $name</CODE><P>

Whenever a FOCAL interpreter engine, such as Focus, executes an
action, it will first store whatever value is in the "Name:" field
into the internal variable $name.  This ensures that any internal
variable substitutions in actions associated with the form will
reflect the current state of the form.<P>

Verification expressions, conditional visibility expressions, and
actions are covered below.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Toggle Fields</H2>

A toggle field is of the format:<P>

<CODE>{conditional visibility expression} Field Title [#toggle:Default
Value1, Default Value2, ...] : width > $storage {verification
expression} (action) ;comment</CODE><P>

(all on one, unbroken line.)  Note that the only difference in format
between this and an editable text field is that the default values
must be specified, and that a field directive of #toggle: is provided.<P>

Toggle field default values are delimited by the comma.  White space
after the comma (or the #toggle:) is ignored.<P>

An example text field is:<P>

<CODE>T-Shirt Size: [#toggle: small, medium, large]</CODE><P>

This will display on the screen identically to an editable text field
with the default value "small".  However, when the field is selected
by the user, it will change it to a horizontally scrollable field,
presenting the three options.<P>

Note that there is no variable substitution allowed in the default
values of a toggle field.  However, if a toggle field specifies a
storage variable, then the FOCAL interpreter engine should check the
value of that storage variable and attempt to find a matching value
among the choices.  It should then present that choice as the
currently selected value.  So, for instance,<P>

<CODE>Default Shell: [#toggle: csh, sh, bash] > $shell</CODE><P>

Will present "sh" as it's current value if $shell is set to equal
"sh".  (Note: if $shell is set to a value that is not equal to any of
the values of the toggle field, then the field will display the
current value of $shell upon opening of the form.  However, once the
field is selected, the first default value will be selected, and then
subsequently stored in the internal variable.)<P>

<HR>

<H2>Buttons</H2>

Buttons are simply a modification to toggle fields.  Unlike toggle
fields, buttons are always displayed expanded, and do not scroll,
should the number of buttons exceed the width of the screen.  Buttons
also have actions associated with each default value (or, in this
case, button name).<P>

The format of a button field is<P>

<CODE>{conditional visibility expression} [#button: Button Name 1 (button
action 1), Button Name 2 (button action 2), ...]</CODE><P>

(all on one, unbroken line.)  Note that the major difference in format
between this and the other types of fields: first, the #button: field
directive, and the mandatory actions associated with each button.
Also, there is no field title specified (one can be specified, but the
FOCAL interpreter engine is not required to provide for its display).
Similarly, the width and storage specifications are not supported.<P>

Finally, there is no verification expression, as there is no value to
verify, and there is no field action, as they are associated with the
buttons themselves (and not with the line).  Buttons are intended as
the most obvious method of performing actions -- while they can be
performed from other types of fields (and the field itself), they can
be most intuitively presented with an on-screen control such as the
button.  Actions are mainly provided in fields and forms in order to
provide short-cuts, as well as to enable intelligent selection of
appropriate values for the field (more on this in the section on
verification expressions).<P>

Actions will be explained in the next section, but a simple example of
buttons is:<P>

<CODE>[#button: Pine (pine -z), News (trn -a -x -X)]</CODE><P>

Which will provide a line something like:<P>

<PRE>
                 (Pine)                       (News)
</PRE>

Buttons are dynamically formatted, spaced evenly across the width of
the screen, based on the number of buttons on the line.  If only one
button is provided, it will be centered, two will be centered as
above, and etc.  It is up to the FOCAL interpreter engine to provide
an aesthetic placement of buttons.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Actions</H2>

Verification and conditional visibility expressions will be explained
last, as they are perhaps the most baroque of all the features of
FOCAL, and are possibly due to featuritis ( >=) -et).  Actions, on the
other hand are central to the concept of Focus, and can occur in a
variety of places -- specifically, in the #result: directive, in both
kinds of fields, and in individual buttons.<P>

The normal syntax of an action is:<P>

<CODE>(#name# infilter  | command  | outfilter )</CODE><P>

where name, infilter, and outfilter are optional.<P>

Note: although in field and button descriptions, an action is
delimited by (), there is no such delimiting in the #result:
directive.  For the #result: directive, the syntax is<P>

<CODE>#result: #name# infilter  | command  | outfilter</CODE><P>

We will cover, in turn, what is a valid value for name, infilter, outfilter,
and command.<P>

<H3>Name</H3>

This allows you to specify a descriptive name for the command which
will appear at the bottom of the screen.  This provides you a way of
letting the user a) that an action exists at this location, b) what
that action will do.<P>

For example, an action might be associated with a text field --
perhaps by invoking the action with ^D, the user can spell check the
word in the field.  In that case, it would be nice to be able to alert
the user to this possibility.  To do that, you might use a line like:<P>

<CODE>Enter a word: [] (#Spellcheck# spellcheck $checkword | select)</CODE><P>

(where 'spellcheck' would be a program which would return a 1 or 0
based on whether the word provided was spelled correctly)<P>

In this example, when the cursor was in this field a line would be
displayed at the bottom of the screen something like: "^D Spellcheck".<P>

(Warning -- the parser may choke if you have weird names in between
the ##'s.  So check there if you have problems.)<P>

<H3>Infilters</H3>

The infilter specifies what parts of the information on the form
should be fed as standard input to the command.<P>

An infilter can be any of the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>nothing</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>this</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>filter filter1, filter2, ...</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>all</CODE>
</UL>

The "nothing" infilter is the default if no infilter is specified.  It
simply does not supply a standard input to the specified command.<P>

The "this" infilter supplies, as standard input to the command, the
value of the field which this infilter is associated with.  The value
includes the field name, as well as the field value that has been
entered (formatted as it would appear on the screen, except without
the surrounding square brackets -- "[]").<P>

The "filter" infilter supplies the values of the fields which match
the given filters.  Matching is similar to a "egrep -i ^filter1
|^filter2 |...", in that it is case insensitive, and attempts to match
from the beginning of the value.  Effectively, this means that you can
match by field title (since this is the beginning of the value).  So,
"filter name address" would feed the name and address fields through
the standard input to the command (as well as the "addressing" field,
should it existÉ).  Note: this also supplies straight lines, should
they match.  This includes all straight lines that do not begin with
the character '>'.<P>

The "all" outfilter simply supplies all lines which would normally be
sent to the standard input.  It is similar in output to the output of
the "mailform" special command.  Once again, the output of a line
described with "Name: []" will be "Name: Value entered in Field by
User ", and the output of a straight text line will be itself.  Lines
containing buttons and lines preceded by the character ">" will never
be part of the standard input.<P>

Example:<P>

Given the following form description:<P>

<PRE>
#form: Test From
This is a test form.
>This line only goes to the screen.
&lt;This line only goes to the standard input of an action.
Name: []
Phone: []
Platform: []
</PRE>

and assuming that the user enters "John Smith" in the "Name:" field,
"555-QZQZ" in the "Phone:" field, and "Unix" in the "Platform:" field,
we will then expect the following standard inputs to the command:<P>

For this, if the cursor is in the "Name:" field:<BR>
<PRE>
Name:     John Smith
</PRE>

For all, regardless of which line the cursor is in:<BR>
<PRE>
This line only goes to the standard input of an action.
Name:     John Smith
Phone:    555-QZQZ
Platform: Unix
</PRE>

For filter name, this, regardless of which line the cursor is in:
This line only goes to the standard input of an action.<BR>
<PRE>
Name:     John Smith
</PRE>

(note that this is the same as for all, except only the lines which
started with either "name" or "this" were fed to the standard input.)<P>

<H3>Outfilters</H3>

The outfilter specifies what is to be done with the output of the command.<P>

An outfilter can be any of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI> <CODE>discard</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>display</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>select</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>update [$internalvar1, $internalvar2, ...]</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>interactive</CODE>
</UL>

The "discard" outfilter is the default if no outfilter is specified.
It simply discards the output of the command.<P>

The "display" outfilter reads in the standard output of the command,
and displays it in a window on the screen.  The user will be able to
scroll through the window, if its contents are larger than the screen.
The output will also be formatted into multiple columns, if possible.<P>

The "select" outfilter is like the "display" outfilter, except the
user has the opportunity to select one of the lines of the standard
output.  If this is an outfilter for an action in an editable text
field, then whatever line is selected replaces the contents of that
text field.  (One use for this would be to select a valid value for a
field, from a list of possible values, such as a list of usernames).<P>

The "update" outfilter has two incarnations.  If no internal variable
names are specified, then it expects a standard output of the form:<P>

<PRE>
$variable1 = value1
$variable2 = value2
....
$variableX = valueX
</PRE>

It then proceeds to assign value1 to internal variable $variable1, and
so forth.<P>

However, if the outfilter specifies internal variables (for
ex. "update $name $phone"), then it will assign each of those
variables a value for the standard output of the command.  If
possible, the first line of the standard output will be placed in the
first variable specified, the second into the second, and so forth.
(If there are more variables specified then lines of output, or vice
versa, then the excess will be ignored.)<P>

The "interactive" outfilter will turn control of the terminal over to
the specified command.  Infilters are ignored, and the output of the
program does not modify the form in any way.  You can use this to,
say, launch a gopher session by placing a button labeled "(Gopher)" on
your form, and associating the action (gopher | interactive) with it.
The syntax for this example would be:<P>

<CODE>[#button: Gopher (gopher | interactive)]</CODE><P>

<H3>Commands</H3>

Commands can be any valid unix command in the user's path.  Their
standard input will be as specified by the infilter, and their
standard output will be displayed as dictated by the outfilter.  In
addition to unix commands, the following "internal" commands are also
supported:<P>

<UL>
<LI> <CODE>cd</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>invoke formname</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>replace formname</CODE>
<LI> <CODE>mailform</CODE>
</UL>

"cd" works identically to the unix "cd" command.  It returns as
standard output the name of the current working directory, which all
subsequent actions will execute upon.<P>

"invoke" opens another form onto the form stack.  When the form
formname is closed, control returns to the current form.<P>

"replace" closes the current form, and opens the form formname.<P>

"mailform" mails the current form, identically to the result of the
"#to:" directive (described above).  (This is useful if you want to
provide a "(Mail this Form)" button)<P>

A command can contain internal variables.  If it does, then the values
of the internal variables are substituted as arguments.  For example,
the command "ls $directory" will evaluate to:<P>

<CODE>ls foobar</CODE> (if $directory = "foobar") or<P>

<CODE>ls "Grand Canal"</CODE> (if $directory = "Grand Canal").<P>

Note that the quotes merely represent the fact that "Grand Canal" is
all one argument to "ls".  Focus does not yet actually support
quoting, and spaces will normally delimit arguments.  However,
argument delimiting takes place before variable substitution, so any
spaces in variable value will not break that value up into separate
arguments.<P>

Also, note any field values that are to be stored in internal
variables are stored before the command is invoked.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Verification Expression</H2>

Verification expressions invoke a unix command (these do not include
any of the internal commands described above).  The standard input for
the command is the value of the current field.  Any field values which
should be stored in internal variables are stored before the command
is invoked.<P>

If a verification expression is supplied for a field, then that
verification expression is evaluated everytime the user attempts to
leave the field.  If the command returns a value of 0 (not on the
standard output, mind you, but actually returns it), then the
condition evaluates as true.  Anything other than 0 evaluates as
false.<P>

If a verification expression evaluates as false, then the action for
that field is invoked.  The user is not allowed to leave the field
until the verification expression evaluates as true.<P>

One example use of a verification expression might be:<P>

<CODE>Name: [$name] > $name {finduser} (validusers $name | select)</CODE><P>

When the user attempts to leave the field "Name:", the program
"finduser" is invoked.  This hypothetical program reads the first line
of its standard input and finds "John Smith" there.  It checks its
list of valid users, and see that John Smith is not on that list.  It
then returns a 1.<P>

The FOCAL interpreter engine sees that the result of this operation
was not 0, and invokes the command for the field.  The command
"validusers "John Smith"" is invoked.  This hypothetical program takes
the single argument "John Smith", and produces a list of close matches
on its standard output.<P>

The FOCAL interpreter engine then allows the user to select one of the
values returned by "validusers".  It then places this value into the
"Name:" field.  Control returns to the user, with the cursor still
placed in the "Name:" field.<P>

Note that a verification expression, like a command, supports internal
variable substitution.  Passing the value on the command line (for
example, finduser $name) is also a desirable way of implementing the
above example.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Conditional Visibility Expression</H2>

A conditional visibility expression works exactly as a verification
expression does, returning either true or false based on the return
value of the command.<P>

A conditional visibility expression is evaluated only upon opening a
form -- should it evaluate to true, then that particular line is
displayed on the screen.  Should it evaluate to false, that line is
not displayed on the screen.<P>

CVE's might be used in order to provide certain options only to
qualified users, or to otherwise customize the appearance forms based
on the needs, abilities, or priveleges of users.<P>

<DT> Action

<DD> An interface for calling external unix functions.  An action
usually takes the form (infilter | command | outfilter), where the
infilter specifies what standard input is fed to the command, and the
outfilter specifies how the standard output should be handled.<P>

The command is usually a unix command, although it can be one of
several built-in commands as well (for these, the in and outfilters
are usually ignored).  The command can also contain (recursive!)
descriptions of the various kinds of dialog boxes, and variables which
will be substituted.

<DT> Focal
<DD> a FOrm Composition Almost-Language.  Focal is the language in
which forms are described.  Somewhat classically baroque, Focal is
extremely easy to use to create simple forms, but also can be
excessively complex when trying to utilize the more advanced features.
Some tricks to power-using Focal are described within this document.

<DT> Focus
<DD> The FOrm Customizable User Shell, or, alternately, a Friendly
Online Computer User Shell, whatever.  Focus interprets forms created
in Focal, and presents them on the screen in an interactive manner.
Details on using Focus are contained within this document.  Note that,
while Focus was originally designed as form-processing program, it
can, with it's current extensions, be used as a generic screen
interface to just about any unix program.

<DT> Form
<DD> a "smart" screen description.  A form provides an interactive
interface for the user to enter information, and perform various
actions.  Forms are the building blocks of Focus hyperspaces.

<DT> Hyperspace <DD> Inspired by Vannevar Bush's 1945 vision of the
Memex in his article, <A
HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS8.HTM#881" tppabs="http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~dduchier/misc/vbush/as-we-may-think.html">"As
We May Think"</A>, and etymologically and conceptually descended from
Ted Nelson's visions of "hypertext" and "hypermedia", a hyperspace is
a space connected in a non-linear fashion by references and pointers.
It is the opinion of the author that any good infostructure will also
be a hyperspace, because it encourages the explorer to search after
the information that is immediately interesting, but be able to find
their way back to the original task.

<DT> Infostructure
<DD> A word coined by the author to describe any navigable
arrangement of pointers to other references.  While an infrastructure
provides the low-level support which is often invisible to users, an
"infostructure" provides the basic navigation aids to help the user
find the information she or he is looking for, or to help sort through
the deluge of the information which the user is often subjected to.
Gopher-space is an infostructure, as is the World-Wide-Web.  In the
non-high-tech milieu, bibliographies and library catalogs are also
examples of infostructures.
