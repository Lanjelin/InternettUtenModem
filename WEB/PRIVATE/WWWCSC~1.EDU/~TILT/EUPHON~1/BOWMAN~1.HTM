The most frequently asked question of a musician is "What instrument do
you play?" When I explain that I play the euphonium, the incredulous reply
is "You play a what?" While the name "euphonium" is not familiar to many,
this instrument with its beautiful rich tone is the chief tenor soloist in
the military and concert band.<p>

The history of the euphonium begins in the early 18th century when many
string instruments had reached some state of perfection but most wind
instruments were still in their infancy. A fore-runner of the euphonium
family, the serpent, was used in military bands as a marching bass during
this period. The serpent derived its name from its snake-like appearance
and was originally used to support the bass part in church choirs. This
ungainly instrument was constructed of wood, brass, or silver. It was
played with a deep-cup mouthpiece made of bone or ivory and had six finger
holes.  Later models were more elaborate and had several keys. 
Qualifications for playing the serpent were good musicianship and an
excellent sense of pitch as intonation was a serious problem. The addition
of extra keys in the 19th century probably led to a deterioration of
playing because performers falsely assumed that these keys cured
intonation problems. As a result of this deterioration in performance the
serpent began receiving much criticism from musicians and composers.
Notably the musicologist Burney compared the serpent's tone quality in
incompetent hands to that of a "great hungry or rather angry Essex calf."<p>

In 1821 Halary, a French instrument maker patented a group of keyed bugles
including a bass member called the ophicleide.  It appeared much as a
combination of the modern bassoon and baritone saxophone, and was played
with a deep cup mouthpieces. The use of keys to cover tone holes allowed
instrument makers to design instruments with better intonation and more
power than the serpent.  As with the serpent, the performer had to have an
excellent ear and flexible lips to play in tune. The ophicleide was made
in several keys and sizes and was used in the l9th century orchestra as
well as in military bands of the time. Although the instrument had
virtually disappeared from the military bands by the turn of the century,
the instrument was still sold in France in 1922.<p>

During the second and third decades of the 19th century valve mechanisms
were developed which revolutionized instrument design and manufacture.  In
1842, Adolph Sax established a wind instrument factory in Paris where he
gained high regard as an inventor and designer of wind instruments. He
developed a complete family of valved brass instruments from soprano to
bass which are direct antecedents of many brass instruments used today.
These instruments were developed mainly for use in the military band and
revolutionized these units by their use developing into the famous brass
bands of the United Kingdom today.<p>

As these new instruments became available, composers began writing for
them. In Germany Wagner established the tuba group by scoring the "Ring"
for two tenor tubas, two bass tubas, and one contrabass tuba. The tenor
tuba became popular with other composers (Strauss, Holst, and Ravel). This
tenor tuba was essentially the same tenor voiced instrument as the tenor
saxhorn developed in the military band.<p>

A problem in nomenclature appeared as different variations of tenor voiced
instruments were developed. The tenor horn in England was the same
instrument as the althorn in Germany and the alto (mi flat) of France. The
tenor horn in Germany became the baritone in England and the baryton in
France. The Baryton in Germany became the euphonium in England and the
basse (si flat) in France. Although slight variations in construction were
present all these instruments had approximately the same pitch and range. 
Because of our military tradition (English) we use the terms baritone and
euphonium to describe the instruments of today.<p>

Meredith Wilson brought the euphonium second-hand fame in the title song
from his "Music Man." The double-belled instrument mentioned here does
exist. Early in the 20th century this novelty was obtained by the addition
of a small bell section to the main euphonium.  This small bell section
was used for trombone like effects and was triggered by the use of an
extra valve.<p>

<A NAME="euph-p">One of the most frequent questions among students and
band directors is "What is the difference between the baritone horn
and the euphonium?"</A> In England, brass bands and military bands
have used two different instruments.  The baritone horn is the smaller
of the two and is pitched in Bb. Although similar in appearance to the
euphonium, the baritone has a smaller bore and a brighter lighter tone
quality. The euphonium is a larger bore instrument possessing a more
powerful and richer tone quality.  American instrument manufacturers
have endeavored to combine the best qualities of the two instruments
and the result is the baritone horn in general use in school bands
today. These instruments are satisfactory for many occasions but lack
the fullness and richness of the larger bore euphonium.<p>

Many times audiences have been misled by the program listing of "baritone
soloist," confusing the instrument with the baritone voice.  To avoid this
confusion, the soloist should be listed as "euphonium soloist." Today in
America the terms baritone horn and euphonium have become interchangeable
regardless of the instrument used.<p>

The addition of a 4th valve to the euphonium is very desirable as it not
only expands the range of the instrument, but can be used to improve
intonation and facilitate certain technical passages. This 4th valve, when
depressed, lowers the fundamental pitch from Bb to F.  By using the 4th
valve in conjunction with the other 3 valves, low notes below the bass
clef can be played with ease and intonation in both the lower and upper
registers may be corrected.<p>

The word euphonium Is derived from the Greek "euphonia" meaning
"well-sounding," and true to its name, the outstanding quality of the
euphonium is its deep, rich tone quality. Too often the younger player
will overlook the tone aspect of playing while striving for a flashy
technical performance. Care should be taken to develop the proper
embouchure and breath support to sustain a deep, rich, lush, smooth tone
quality. Hand in hand with the development of a beautiful sound is the
training of the ear and lips to overcome natural intonation deficiencies.
The technical aspects of performance should be diligently worked out along
with the tonal aspects so that the soloist may perform with ease the most
demanding technical solo or passage while maintaining the rich quality of
the more melodic parts. Far too many players devote themselves to one
phase or the other while what is really needed is the well-rounded
musician who is capable of performing all styles of music.<p>

In order to enhance the tone quality, vibrato is used in most euphonium
playing. Several methods of producing the vibrato are used, including
diaphramic, throat and jaw vibrato, each named for the portion of anatomy
used to produce it. The author prefers the jaw vibrato as it is usually a
smoother, more controlled vibrato and also helps keep the embouchure from
being too tight in younger players. Speed and depth of vibrato, subject to
certain general guidelines, must be observed. Fine recordings are
available not only of euphonium soloists, but of fine string soloists as
well as vocalists. These recordings will help the student hear the
different speeds and styles of vibrato. Different periods and styles of
music dictate different types or speeds and depths of vibrato. A dramatic,
fiery declamation would indicate a faster, narrower vibrato than a slow
lyrical passage or a blues section. In some types of music, no vibrato is
desirable. An average speed would be between 5 and 7 beats per second for
a normal vibrato. Care should be taken to avoid the overdone, wide vibrato
that distorts the tone. The vibrato should at all times enhance the
musical effect and beautify the tone quality.<p>

The euphonium in band literature has long been compared to its counterpart
In the orchestra, the cello. As most early band literature consisted of
orchestral transcriptions, the comparison was quite appropriate. As the
concert band gained popularity, the euphonium soon became recognized as a
solo instrument of great expression and a full rich tone.  Simone Mantia,
the euphonium soloist with Sousa's band, became well known as did other
soloists, including Arthur Pryor, trombone and Herbert L. Clarke, cornet.
These men not only performed on their instruments, thrilling audiences all
over the world, but composed and arranged solos for themselves. These
solos usually contained a theme or popular song of the day with technical
and melodic variations.<p>

For the first part of this century, these audience-pleaser type solos were
the only original euphonium literature available. The serious euphonium
student was forced to borrow literature from other wind and string
instruments and even vocal literature. This transcribed literature offered
a full range and variety of musical style to help develop the euphonium
player in various styles and periods of music.<p>

In the past few decades several composers have been writing original
literature for the euphonium. French publications have been imported
written for the French counterpart of the euphonium, the saxhorn.
Composers in colleges and universities have taken an interest in composing
new music for this medium. It is the author's hope that this spark of
interest will continue and grow. With this new interest, a new field of
performance may be opening up to the accomplished and well-schooled
euphonium player . . . that of a concert recitalist.<p>

So when people ask ''What do you play?" perhaps the best answer is "I play
a brass instrument which has a rich, deep tone quality, one which has an
important role in band music, and has an uncharted potential as a recital
and concert instrument.  <em>I play the euphonium.</em>"<p>
