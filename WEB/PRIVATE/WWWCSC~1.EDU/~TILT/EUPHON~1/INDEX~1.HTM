<P>Or, musings on that fine -- but under-rated -- brass instrument which
I happen to play.</P>

<P>In fourth grade, when I was about nine years old (I reckon . . .), I
had my last year of &quot;general music&quot;. As the year drew to a close,
we fourth graders were asked to make a choice that would shape the course
of our lives for years to come -- we were asked to pick which instrument
we would like to play in band next year.</P>

<P>Mrs. Kroska passed around the various and diverse mouthpieces of instruments
out among us, and asked us to try blowing through them. Trumpet, clarinet,
flute, saxaphone, horn -- all these passed through my fingers, and on none
could I produce a sound. Then, I was handed a &quot;baritone&quot; mouthpiece
-- and <I>lo,</I> a sound yea like unto a hallucinogenic raspberry did
emerge.</P>

<P>Pleased with my budding musical prowess, I decided to pursue this &quot;baritone&quot;
as my instrument of choice. I've been playing it for quite some time now,
and am completely pleased with my choice. Hiding somewhere between a (french)
horn and a trombone, the euphonium is capable of producing a gorgeous sound
(although not neccessarily in my hands :) that is too rarely heard in the
musical literature.</P>

<P>In fact, my only complaint is that too few people know about this fine
instrument. With that in mind, I've put together this page of euphonium
information.</P>

<P>(When I first put this page together, in 1993, a Web search turned up
only the one page -- now, I can find some 900 pages with a search on the
word &quot;euphonium&quot; at <A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#10" tppabs="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta
Vista</A>, or one of the other search engines. Someday, I hope to have
a weekend to devote to exploring these new sites, with an eye towards improving
this rather ragged and aged page. --jet, feb 5 1996)</P>

<H1>Online Euphonium Resources</H1>

<P>Currently this is more of a wish list -- I'm about to make a call for
suggestions, however. So, if we're lucky, this'll get fleshed out a lot,
soon!</P>

<H2>History of the Euphonium</H2>

&lt;bowman@duq2.duq.edu&gt;</DT>

<DD>This article provides an excellent overview of the history of the
euphonium.  It also happens to answer the age-old question, <A
HREF="BOWMAN~1.HTM#euph-p" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/euphonium/bowman.html#euph-p">&quot;What is the difference between a
euphonium and a baritone horn?&quot;</A></DD>

<H2>Euphonium Literature and Available Recordings</H2>

<P>Thanks to several of you out there in Internet-land, I have accumulated
a fair amount of information on this topic, which I've summarized on a
page of <A HREF="EUPH-D~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/euphonium/euph-disco.html">euphonium literature and recording information</A>.</P>

<H2>The Brass Family, or Where the Euphonium Fits In</H2>

<P>Nothing, as yet.</P>

<H2>Online Discussion Groups</H2>

<P>There is a mailing list for the discussion of the tuba and the euphonium called TUBAEUPH. There is a <A HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS7.HTM#749" tppabs="http://www.neosoft.com/~concerto/tubaeuph.html">web page for allowing people to subscribe to the mailing list.</A>

<H2>Finding a new or used instrument</H2>

<P>Another subject about which, unfortunately, I know nothing. If you have
any tips, I'd appreciate them -- several people have been asking me about
this very topic.</P>
