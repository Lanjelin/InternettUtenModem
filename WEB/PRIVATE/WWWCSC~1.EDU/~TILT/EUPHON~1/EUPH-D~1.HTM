<H1>Discographies</H1>

<P> Brian Bowman (who also wrote <a href="BOWMAN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/euphonium/bowman.html">"You Play a
What?"</a>, which is also available here) has put together this nifty
<A HREF="BOWMAN~1.TXT" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/euphonium/bowman-disco.txt">euphonium discography</A>.

<H1>Recording Suggestions</H1>

<P> The following suggestions have come from various people on the 'net:

<P> Several people have recommended "The Cool Sound of Pepper Adams"
(Savoy Jazz label), although I have not heard it myself.

<P> Another person suggested The New Columbia Brass Band, "Music from
America's Golden Age" on Walking Frog Records, P.O. Box 680,
Oskaloosa, Iowa 52577 CD, Cut #9 "All Those Endearing Young Charms"
Simone Mantia 6:10, a euphonium solo by virtuoso Earl L. Louder.

<P> One professional euphonium player told me: "As for euphonium
recordings, the most amazing one I ever heard was Brian Bowman playing
'Fantasia Di Concerto' with the AF Band in Washington DC.  I think the
lp is named Solos. If you haven't heard it, you should."

<P> Podium music supplies fully-published sheet music for all kinds of
brass and woodwind ensembles.  They specialize in sheet music for
"non-traditional" groups, or any group for which an abundance of
published sheet music is not easily found (low brass groups). They're
on the web at <A
