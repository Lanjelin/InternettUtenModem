<H1>PinealWeb, Browser for the Illuminated Generation!</H1>

<IMG SRC="PINEAL~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/pinealweb/pineal-large.gif" ALIGN="right">

<P> Welcome to PinealWeb, the browser that lets you surf the Internet
directly from your third eye! <BELEIVE>Using patented GneoGnostic
technology, PinealWeb is able to provide an immersive Web browsing
experience by pumping data directly through your pineal
gland.</BELEIVE>

<P> PinealWeb uses revolutionary hypotext techniques developed by
computer scientists for inserting text <EM>directly into</EM> the
nervous system. By allowing data to flow <STRONG>beneath</STRONG>
layers of baked-in, caked-on mental grime, you can grasp exactly what
the essence of the document is without <APPRECIATE>having to muck about with
several decades of <A
HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#726" tppabs="http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/postmodern">post-modernist
bullshit</A>.</APPRECIATE>

<H2>Better than Virtual Reality!</H2>

<P> <RANT>For years now, we have been promised the benefits of virtual
reality (including better moral hygeine and greater social placidity),
but these promises have come to <STRONG>naught</STRONG>. Millions of
young schoolchildren have been forced to eat government-subsidized
school lunches when they could instead have been frolicing in the
fields of virtual reality with their government-subsidized laptop
computers. No more! <FNORD>PinealWeb</FNORD> brings you something
<EM>better</EM> than <TAUNT>virtual reality</TAUNT>, and it brings it
to you <EM>TODAY!</EM></RANT>

<P> <SALESPITCH>That's right; by using <FNORD>PinealWeb</FNORD>, you
will actually feel as if you are <EM>in the text</EM>, romping about
at play in the fields of multimedia. Verbs will have more verve, nouns
will have more heft (and dangling participles may be truly
dangerous). With <FNORD>Hypotext Technology</FNORD>, your subconscious
will actually conspire against you to launch you into a Chapel
Perilous of reason and symbolism.</SALESPITCH>

<H2>Instant Comprehension and Retention</H2>

<P> <MAINPOINT>Because <FNORD>PinealWeb's</FNORD> use of SubliminalSideband,
Authors can specify important points that Readers should take away
with them.</MAINPOINT> This revolutionary new idea enables Authors to
longer have to muck about with outlines, argumentation, and structure.
<MAINPOINT>Norway has fjords.</MAINPOINT>

<H2>Precognitive Browsing Tools</H2>

<P> Since <FNORD>PinealWeb</FNORD> establishes a direct 50 MB/s
connection to your pineal gland, it can use <MAINPOINT>Temporal
Resonance Feedback</MAINPOINT> in order to predict exactly which pages
the Reader will want to fetch next, so that it can prefetch them in
massively parallel network operations. In this way, you can instantly
find out everything you need to know, without all that tedious messing
around with serendipity and exploration.

<H2>??? Markup Language</H2>

<P> If <STRONG>your</STRONG> page is ??ML-compliant, you may eligible to
participate in the PinealWeb logo program! To participate, include
the following markup in your STML document:

<PRE>
&lt;FNORD&gt;
&lt;A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/pinealweb/stml.html"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/pinealweb/pineal.gif"
     ALT="[Optimized for PinealWeb]" BORDER=0&gt;
&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;/FNORD&gt;

<H2>Obtaining PinealWeb</H2>

<P> To obtain <FNORD>PinealWeb</FNORD>, think very hard at this spot
<A
HREF="estp://pinealweb.biz/software/browsers/pineal-current.tar.gz">here</A>.
Unfortunately, because <FNORD>PinealWeb</FNORD> is written in trinary
(for performance reasons), it can only be transmitted using
ExtraSensory Transport Protocol. If your browser supports this,
you're in luck, and we'll download <FNORD>PinealWeb</FNORD> directly
to your brain. If not, please be patient, a Linux port is coming soon.

<P> <FNORD>PinealWeb</FNORD> is currently only available for
Ontology 1.2, part of the Emporer Norton Utilities. Remember, you must
first have the Enlightenment Tune-Up before you can install Ontology
on your wetware.
