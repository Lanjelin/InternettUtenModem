What lurks around the hyperspace before you is either the greatest work of
literature known to man, the biggest load of crap, or a large toaster
oven from Sirius.  And, as we all know, "or" is not the same as the
"exclusive or" (it can't get into the same sorts of clubs, for one
thing), so this could very well be all three.  Some might argue that
it doesn't really matter, and just point out that it's a magnificent
mindfuck, regardless.<P>

I have never met any of the authors of these works (unless you count
that mysterious man in black who took the money I buried in my
backyard and chintzed me on my membership card); nor have I ever
authored a famous work which incorporate discordian themes (unless
you count several of my research papers, and grant a broad definition
of the word generous); nor was I even alive when JFK was shot, Hagbard
Celine illuminated, or Jim Garrison got his mimeograph.  My
introduction to all of this was in 1991, that wonderful palindromic
year when I first encountered <CITE>The Earth Will Shake</CITE>, and
proceeded to power through the <CITE>Historical Illuminatus!
Trilogy</CITE> by Robert Anton Wilson.  This resulted in my glomming
onto more of his books, and the eventual poisoning of my mind into
discordant modes of thought.<P>

I've since moved on in my spiritual awareness from my early Discordian
days -- now I practice a form of Internet idol worship, while
diverting the masses with the intellectual vapidness of <A
HREF="../TILTOL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/tiltology.html">Tiltology</A>.  In my spare time, I
dabble in profane humanism, but try to get other people to think that
it's really profound humanism.  No one seems to buy it, yet, but I
still have faith.<P>

This project -- this transubstantiation of what was once a print media
barrage into the divine HTML -- is the brainchild of <A
HREF="../../../TPPMSGS/MSGS7.HTM#710" tppabs="http://www.tufts.edu/~jpatters/">Her High-and-Mightyness
Alabastrozenithenia, Pope Patterson</A> and Grand High Priestess of <A
HREF="../TILTOL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/tiltology.html">Tiltology</A>.  It's since become a group
effort, in an attempt to expand the confines of the document to
stretch throughout the erisian hyperspace that is the Internet.  Or
maybe we're just bored.  Still, we hope to eventually have a
<CITE>Principia</CITE> that Kerry, Bob and Greyface would all be proud
of, and that will earn us enough slack points to laugh at the X-ist
pleasure saucers when they arrive -- although we don't need
<EM>slack</EM>, we've got <a

The other day, a small gnome tunnelled up from closet.  His watch was
of Swiss make, and I assumed him to be from Zurich, but still, one
never knows.  He spoke flawless Antlantean, and told me through my
pineal gland that what we were doing here was a Good Thing.  "The
world tries to make itself out to be a very serious place,
grasshopper, but We know it to be not true.  Peoples is peoples.
Heirarchy, pecking orders, fame, fortune -- these make mere mortals
into myths in their own time.  Tear down these walls (but be sure to
put some different ones in their places, so as not to frighten the
rubes).  Add confusion to people's lives, so'n they might think from
time to time.  Knock those gurus offa their local maxima.  All Hail
Eris!"<P>

I may have dreamed it all -- after all, I don't speak Atlantean -- but
then again, there was that Yeti sidekick of his.  I mean, how do you
fake that?  Anyway, whether there's a Deeper Meaning to all of this or
not, we're young, we're hip, and we're urban (despite living in Salem,
Oregon), and we're bringing the Principia Discordia to you for your
mind-altering pleasure.  Don't have too much fun, now, kids!<P>

By the way, please don't ever suffer under the misconception that this
thing is <EM>done</EM>.  Around here, we don't beleive in every fully
completing something -- just freezing a release occasionally.  We've
pretty much wrapped up the HTML-ifying of things, but the links in and
out will probably continue to evolve in non-deterministic quantum
jumps.<P>
