<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
 
        You hold in your hands one the Great Books of our century fnord. <P>
 
        Some Great Books are recognized at once with a fusilade of critical
huzzahs and gonfolons, like Joyce's ULYSSES.  Others appear almost furtively
and are only discovered 50 years later, like MOBY DICK or Mendel's great
essay on genetics.  The PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA entered our space-time continuum
almost as unobtrusively as a cat-burglar creeping over a windowsill. <P>
 
        In 1968, virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book.  In
1970, hundreds of people coast to coast were talking about it and asking the
identity of the mysterious author, Malaclypse the Younger.  Rumors swept
across the continent, from New York to Los Angeles, from Seattle to St.
Joe.  Malaclypse was actually Alan Watts, one heard.  No, said another 
legend -- the PRINCIPIA was actually the work of the Sufi Order.  A third, 
very intriguing myth held that Malaclypse was a pen-name for Richard M. 
Nixon, who had allegedly composed the PRINCIPIA during a few moments of 
lucidity.  I enjoyed each of these yarns and did my part to help spread 
them. I was also careful never to contradict the occasional rumors that I 
had actually written the whole thing myself during an acid trip. <P>
 
        The legendry, the mystery, the cult grew slowly.  By the
mid-1970's, thousands of people, some as far off as <A
HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#795" tppabs="http://cnidr.org/welcome.html">Hong Kong</A> and <A
HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#796" tppabs="http://www.csu.edu.au/education/australia.html">Australia</A>,
were talking about the PRINCIPIA, and since the original was out of
print by then, xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and
there.<P>
 
        When the ILLUMINATUS trilogy appeared in 1975, my co-author,
Bob Shea, and I both received hundreds of letters from people
intrigued by the quotes from the PRINCIPIA with which we had decorated
the heads of several chapters.  Many, who had already heard of the
PRINCIPIA or seen copies, asked if Shea and I had written it, or if we
had copies available.  Others wrote to ask if it were real, or just
something we had invented the way H.P. Lovecraft invented the
NECRONOMICON.  We answered according to our moods, sometimes telling
the truth, sometimes spreading the most Godawful lies and myths we
could devise fnord. <P>
 
        Why not?  We felt that this book was a true <a
href="../../../tppmsgs/msgs7.htm#797" tppabs="http://rome.classics.lsa.umich.edu/welcome.html"> Classic </a> (literatus
immortalis) and, since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet discovered it, 
the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage the mythology and the 
controversy about it.  Increasingly, people wrote to ask me if Timothy Leary 
had written it, and I almost always told them he had, except on Fridays when 
I am more whimsical, in which case I told them it had been transmitted by a 
canine intelligence -- vast, cool, and unsympathic -- from the Dog Star, 
Sirius. <P>
        
        Now, at last, the truth can be told. <P>
        
        Actually, the PRINCIPIA is the work of a time-travelling 
anthropologist from the 23rd Century.  He is currently passing among us as a 
computer specialist, bon vivant and philosopher named Gregory Hill.  He has 
also translated several volumes of Etruscan erotic poetry, under another 
pen-name, and in the 18th Century was the mysterious Man in Black who gave 
Jefferson the design for the Great Seal of the United States. <P>
       
        I have it on good authority that he is one of the most
accomplished time-travelers in the galaxy and has visited Earth many
times in the past, using such cover-identities as Zeno of Elias,
Emperor Norton, Count Cagliostro, Guilliame of Aquaitaine, etc.
Whenever I question him about this, he grows very evasive and attempts
to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th Century Earthman
and that all my ideas about his extra- terrrestrial and extratemporal
origin and delusions.  Hah!  I am not that easily deceived.  After
all, a time-travelling anthropologist would say just that, so that he
could observe us without his presense causing cultureshock. <P>

        I understand that he has consented to write an Afterward to this 
edition.  He'll probably contradict everything I've told you, but don't 
believe a word he says fnord. He is a master of the deadpan put-on, the 
plausible satire, the philosophical leg-pull and all the branches of 
guerilla ontology. <P>
        
        For full benefit to the Head, this book should be read in 
conjunction with THE ILLUMINOIDS by Neal Wilgus (Sun Press, Albuquerque, NM) 
and ZEN WITHOUT ZEN MASTERS by Camden Benares (And/Or Press, Berkeley, 
California).  "We are operating on many levels here", as Ken Kesey used to 
say. <P>
        
        In conclusion, there is no conclusion.  Things go on as they always 
have, getting weirder all the time. <P>
        
        Hail Eris.  All hail Discordia.  Fnord? <P>
