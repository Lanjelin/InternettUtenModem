<TITLE> Fangs, washed and unwashed </TITLE>

<h1> Why <strong> YOU </strong> need a goofy title </h1>

<p>Of course, Fang the Unwashed would have never gotten to the august
position he is in today if he had not found himself such a spiffy
title.

<P> Titles can be given or created, but they should always be appropriate,
witty and free. After all, who would respect "Fang the Washed"?

<p>Several popular subspecies of titles are:
<ul>
<li> Discordian
<li> <a href="../TILTOL~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/tiltology.html">Tilt</a><a href="../TILTTI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/tilttitles.html">ologist</a>
<li> Fudge
<li> Completely wacko combinations of all of the above. 
</ul>
