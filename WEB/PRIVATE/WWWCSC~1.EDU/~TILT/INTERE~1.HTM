<h1>But first, a story...</h1>

<p>When I was applying for admission to undergraduate institutions, I chose
two engineering schools, and one liberal arts school. The two engineering
schools I chose because I was interested in computers, and wanted to go
to a top school in computer science. The third school was a small liberal
arts college in Oregon. </p>

<p>At the time, I would have preferred to have gone to either of the
two engineering schools. Despite this, I was only able to make the
waiting lists for both, while I was accepted at the third school, <a
href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS4.HTM#427" tppabs="http://www.willamette.edu/">Willamette University</a>. This
turned out to be fortunate for me, for it allowed a side of me that I
think is vital to flourish. I had chosen Willamette as my third choice
because it appealed to a different side of me -- the side that was
interested in the connections between things. The side that wanted to
know about how a humanist would engineer, and how a computer could
deal with realms slippier than computing. </p>

<p>In the end I have been well served by attending a liberal arts
college.  I have been able to pursue many orthogonal interests
simultaneously (as well as receive a strong computer science
education, which has prepared me well for graduate
school).</P>

<hr>

<p>One area into which a good subset of my interests tend to fall is,
unsurprisingly, computer science. There are three major aspects to
this fascination: communication, cognition, and systems. </p>

<p>Communication is the cornerstone. It is this which re-kindled my flagging
interest in the computer. As a member of the first generation to grow up
with personal computers, I have been around computers since the fourth
grade. By the time I was a senior in high school, I could program a computer
in several different languages, and just didn't care any more. The computer
was a neat toy, but an awfully self-contained one. By itself it was just
a box with nifty flashing lights. </p>

<p>As a freshman in college, I signed up for a computer course simply
because I did not know what else I would be good at. It was not a
freshman course, and most of my classmates were already familiar with
local computing facilities; so, when the professor began talking about
&quot;e-mail accounts,&quot; I was one of the few in the class who did
not know what he was talking about. By the end of the semester, I
finally got around to getting the account . . . right about the same
time the school got a whopping 57.6Kbit/sec connection to the Internet
(which now, four years later, is only twice as fast as my dial-in
modem at home can connect to the Internet at). </p>

<p>The Internet revolutionized my thinking about computers. Sure, by
themselves, they were still just boxes, but when you run a wire out
the back . . .  you get a whole new strange and wonderful
<i>world</i>. Since that point, networking resources and applications
have formed the focal point of my fascination with the machine. </p>

<p>A related topic to communication and computers is hypertext. The
World Wide Web is probably the most familiar example, these days, and
I have wasted no end of time playing with aspects of it. My copy of
<i>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</i> (Nelson) has rarely had the chance
to get dusty.  Two aspects of hypertext which especially fascinate me
have so far failed to be addressed significately on the Web:
collaborative authoring and authoritativeness.</p>

<p>I've also become recently fascinated with so-called &quot;old media&quot;:
printing, page design, and typography. Recently I bought a cheap laser
printer, which instantly turned me into that beast that all good subversives
want to be -- a press. Both online and offline. Yow! Between these, and
the fact that I've infiltrated the traditional printing establishment to
the extent that I've published two books, means that this lil' ol' twerp
is reaching millions of people a year, without having to shave or get out
of his bathrobe. Beat that, Ben Franklin.</p>

<p>The computer is also fascinating as a tool for exploring cognition.
At the one end of the spectrum are the questions of machine learning:
ways in which neural nets and genetic algorithms can produce complex
and interesting behaviour from simple algorithms, and how they can
learn and adapt to environments with overt prediction from the
programmer. At the other end is how the computer can act not just as a
word processor, but as an <i>information processor</i>, augmenting
human cognition and allowing us to think in new and different
ways. </p>

<p>Finally, my real love in computer science is in systems work. The details
of implementing operating systems and networks fascinate me. I've done
work with object-based microkernels and with distributed computation, and
it's fun stuff all the way around. This will be the focus of my graduate
work; my thesis will undoubtedly involve operating systems and networks
in some form or another. And this interest comes back again to communication
and cognition, because I plan to explore frameworks for shipping functions
so that you can intelligently filter data before pumping it across your
(never large enough) 'net connection. </p>

<p>The social sciences are another area which fascinate me. Naturally,
I'm fascinated with history (being a major), but I'm also intrigued by
sociology, political science, economics, and literature, and plan to take
advantage of my remaining two years here at Willamette to dabble in all
of these areas. As I progress, I become more and more convinced that everything
is, in fact, fundamentally and deeply intertwined. Plus, what good is it
to know how to use the technology, if you don't have a conception of the
broader societal context within which the technology will be used? And
vice versa? </p>

<p>Another important area of interest is music. I have played the <a
href="EUPHON~1/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/euphonium/">euphonium</a> since the
fifth grade, which means I've well over a decade of musical experience
and training. I enjoy listening as well as performing, from jazz, the
blues, classical, and rock (which makes Zeppelin a natural choice,
eh?). </p>

<p>Finally, there is a need for re-enchantment. What I am really after
was the ability to maintain my sense of wonder in a world where
concrete has become the superstructure of nature, and soulless
machines provide the infrastructure for our interactions. I hope I'm
on that path to this enlightenment -- but I'll continue to chop wood
and carry water, just the same.</P>
