<p><font size=5><strong>Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; The Last Voyage?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size=3><strong>Twin Cities Reader<br>

<p><font size=3><strong>Note: MST3K has been put &quot;on hiatus&quot; from KTMA-TV 23.</strong></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font size=3>&quot;WELL, WE COULD PUT A LITTLE LIGHTER fluid on it,&quot; says Joel Hodgson, staring <br>
intently at the scale model of a Kentucky Fried Chicken store in front of him. <br>
He's pondering how to make the thing go up into flames when the Godzilla toy <br>
rigged to spout butane comes crashing down on it.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>&quot;Hairspray'd work,&quot; suggests a buddy.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>&quot;Actually, nondairy creamer works,&quot; replies Hodgson.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>&quot;Yeahhh, right,&quot; answers the friend.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>&quot;It does,&quot; insists Hodgson. &quot;They use it in flash pots all the time.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>They settle for styling mousse, which looks a little like snow on the model's <br>
rooftop, but it doesn't light.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Such are the creative struggles on the set of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, <br>
the best cult show on local television. But if you haven't already seen it, <br>
you may never. The show aired its last broadcast last Sunday on KTMA-TV 23 <br>
and went &quot;on hiatus,&quot; a TV term meaning near-death but with a pulse.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>No one involved seems sure if it will be back, and if it's not, MST 3000 will <br>
enter the ranks of such honored but departed local classics as Dave Moore's <br>
&quot;Bedtime Newz&quot;. It will be gone before most people know enough to miss it. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The show is a triumph of low tech and local talent: MST 3000 mixes the wit of <br>
three Twin Cities comics (Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, and Josh Weinstein) with <br>
Hodgson's famous gizmos, which have been a staple on the Twin Cities comedy <br>
circut for years.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>MST 3000 is like a Salvation Army &quot;Pee Wee's Playhouse&quot;, a little less cheery <br>
but a lot more wickedly cynical. The show is set on an orbiting space station <br>
where Hodgson has been sent by two evil scientists (played by Beaulieu and <br>
Weinstein). The premise is that Hodgson is trapped and forced to watch the <br>
worst old movies in the world--usually Japanese monster films--by his captors. <br>
For company, Hodgson has built robot friends (operated by Beaulieu and <br>
Weinstein) from spare parts on the space station, and together they relieve <br>
the boredom by mocking the movies. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>The show's appeal, says Weinstein, &quot;is a little scarey. It's the ultimate <br>
couch potato show. People always sit and watch movies and hack on them. Now <br>
they can do it without doing anything.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Despite the production values--Hodgson says the robots came from &quot;found <br>
objects and cost no more than 10 bucks each&quot;--MST 3000 is easily the most <br>
creative show on local TV. Of course, that isn't hard when you consider that <br>
most other locally produced shows in the Twin Cities are gloppy, sappy talk <br>
shows or gloppy, sappy newscasts.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>But MST 3000 has struck a chord; at last count, the fan club had 1,131 <br>
members, and the show (airing opposite &quot;60 Minutes&quot;) has drawn as high as a <br>
&quot;four&quot; rating--this on a station whose top-rated show is &quot;The Andy Griffith <br>
Show&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>The fan club reflects the show's appeal: It's for smart, cynical kids of all <br>
ages. &quot;We've got a strong 7- to 10-year-old contingent who are attracted to <br>
the puppets,&quot; says producer Jim Mallon. &quot;But what's even more amazing is that <br>
their moms send in for memberships, too. And that's only about 30 percent of <br>
our membership: We've got a lot of college students and couples in their late <br>
'20s and early '30s.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Says Hodgson, &quot;It's a show that can be watched by the whole family, or as a <br>
cult thing. That's really amazing to me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Hodgson left comedy a few years back in a well-publicized retirement, but he <br>
has returned to the scene with a vengeance: He's a staple at the Comedy <br>
Gallery, has worked on Louie Anderson's upcoming NBC show, and will be off <br>
next month for a writing stint with HBO. Hodgson's income is in the <br>
thousands-per-week range, but he still takes time out for MST 3000, a show <br>
that requires, by his estimate, about 16 hours a week and earns him &quot;next to <br>
nothing.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size=3>But, adds Hodgson, &quot;I guess my dream is to be able to make TV in Minneapolis. <br>
It's really hard for me to make TV in L.A., and it's obvious people are more <br>
talented here, more so than on the East or West Coast.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Still, the MST 3000 crew wonders if the Twin Cities are ready. Says Beaulieu <br>
simply, &quot;This is one the viewers will have to decide. We all want to keep <br>
doing it, but the trouble is we don't have the resources.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>The trouble, says Mallon, is that local television is reluctant to do local <br>
entertainment programming. &quot;About all they do is news, which is a tremendous <br>
money-maker.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>At TV23, he says, it's even more of a stretch. The tiny independent station <br>
was formed out of the ashes of Spectrum Sports and produces very little local <br>
programming.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Adds Hodgson, &quot;What you lose is the &quot;Roundhouse Rodneys&quot;. That stuff was cool <br>
because it was something neat that came from right around you. I grew up in <br>
Green Bay with Cowboy Eddie, and you know, that show was *mine*.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Mallon adds, &quot;I mean, we had a message machine for fans, and the 45-minute <br>
tape was filled in an hour. We're hoping to have a local convention at a <br>
theater this summer so fans can see these guys perform. After all, they're <br>
used to being onstage and getting that feed-back right away.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Hodgson says he hopes the show will be back so he can get his ultimate MST <br>
3000 film, &quot;Mars Needs Women&quot;. &quot;I always wanted to host a monster movie <br>
show,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't want this to end.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Editor's Note: KTMA's address is 2505 N.E. Kennedy St., Minneapolis, MN <br>
55413.</font></p>
