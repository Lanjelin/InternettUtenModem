<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Navels<BR>
from Brad Lowry</FONT></B></P>

<P>Oh the WWWeb! I *was* right it is a second fruit emerging within the
first fruit (contrary to one caller). I was wrong...or it is unclear whether
I was right... that it was a genetically engineered or a natural mutation
that was seized upon. I kinda think both... the first was natural mutation
from Brazil in 1870, and then later when the process was refined, orange
botanists, I think, purposely engineered various of them to produe the
best attributes.</P>

<P>I heard a term that applies to my copious knowledge without references
for it &quot;psuedo-certainty&quot;.</P>

<P>Anyway, here is way more than you ever wanted to know about navel oranges</P>

<P>Cuttings Stem Cuttings A stem cutting relies on dedifferentiation of
cells in the stem cortex region (a layer beneath the surface tissues) which
respond to the wounding of the plant. A cutting no longer has roots, and
must be able to absorb water and nutrients to stay alive while is produces
a new root meristem to initiated replacement roots. Some plants are excellent
material for cuttings; others never survive. Both woody and herbaceous
plants may be used for cutting materials.</P>

<P>One crop plant, the navel orange, is the result of a mutation on one
orange tree, and propagation of our navel oranges has been by cuttings.</P>

<P>We also use cuttings in the forestry industry, using branch tips from
trees with more desirable qualities. Often, a young treelet (seedling)
can be prepared for field transplant faster from a cutting than from seed,
and its genetic qualities are known. All propagated individuals are genetically
identical to the parent from which the &quot;propagule&quot; is removed.
In contrast, seeds, the product of sexual reproduction, are genetically
different from their parents.</P>

=== Three citrus trees sit at the corner of one of the busiest intersections
in Riverside. One of them is the Parent Navel Orange Tree, which came to
Riverside from Brazil in 1870. Riverside in the late 19th century was built
upon its flourishing citrus industry. This tree was the start of it all,
and is said to be the &quot;parent&quot; of all Washington Navel Orange
trees on the West Coast. But the sign there doesn't say which one of the
three trees it is. </P>

=== Old Line &amp; Nucellar Navel Selections</P>

<P>Type and parentage: Sweet Orange Average diameter (inches): 3 - 3 1/2
Seeds per fruit: 0-6 Commercial harvest season: October - January</P>

<P>Selections available in Florida are usually marketed fresh and produce
relatively small crops of large fruit. The juice of navel oranges is not
desirable for processing due to the bitterness caused by limonin. As there
is a tendancy for the variety to mutate, there are many navel strains.
Choice of horticulturally well tested selections is therefore important.
The fruit peels relatively easily and sectionizes well. Fruit tends to
be lower in acid content than most orange varieties. The navel structure
seen at the blossom end of the fruit is actually a partially formed secondary
fruit. Premature yellowing and rot, a characteristic of its structure,
results in premature fruit drop. The two periods of fruit drop, early and
late summer, can account for 15-20 percent of the crop some years. 2,4-D
sprays may be used to reduce this. Fruit from trees on lemon-type rootstocks
tend to dry out prematurely. Rind blemish can occur early in the season
from mechanical damage during handling. Navels tend to require more precise
management, particularly relating to stress avoidance. Irrigation and nutrition
levels should be carefully monitored. Navels are quite susceptable to the
Colletotrichum fungus, the cause of postbloom fruit drop (PFD).</P>

=== Parthenocarpy Many fruits can be produced without seed development.
This process, called parthenocarpy, may or may not require pollination.
Certain hormones regulate the maturation of the ovary into the fruit portion
of the plant. Either mutation, such as with the navel orange, or the use
of hormone sprays on flowers, can result in the maturation of the ovary
without seeds. Parthenocarpic plants must be propagated asexually. Navel
oranges, for example, are propagated by grafting branches that produce
navel oranges onto other orange tree stock.</P>
