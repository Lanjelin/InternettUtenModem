<HR><h2>THE GRAND OLD GAME IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS</h2>
Sunday, August 18, 1991 
<br>Page: 1F 
<br><br>By David Brauer, Special to the Pioneer Press <p>
<br>   It's been 10 seasons since the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened, 
enclosing Twins baseball under a fabric sky; 10 summers since Julian Empson 
gave up the fight to smoke his awful, stinky cigars under the starry sky and 
root, root, root for the home team.<p>
   Once upon a time, when dinosaurs ruled the Earth and Willie Norwood 
patrolled center field, Empson led an intrepid group called Save the Met, an 
organization dedicated to the preservation of Metropolitan Stadium, tailgating
and all that was right about outdoor baseball. Empson got squashed flatter 
than home plate by guys with bigger cigars than his.<p>
   After getting angry, Empson got even. If outdoor baseball was being taken 
away from Minnesota fans, he reasoned, why not take the fans to see outdoor 
baseball? And that's how Ballpark Tours was born. The group took its first bus
trip to Milwaukee County Stadium and Wrigley Field in 1982, right after the 
Dome opened its vacuum-sealed doors. If indoor baseball had an anniversary to 
celebrate this season, so did Ballpark Tours.<p>
   So when word came last winter that Rod Carew had become the second Twin 
elected to the Hall of Fame, Empson decided to jettison his usual weekend 
jaunts and organize the grandest trip in Ballpark Tours' history: 10 days, 
nine games, eight cities, centered on a trip to Cooperstown to see Sir Rodney 
enshrined.<p>
   It was a road trip that would make any minor-leaguer shudder - more than 
2,500 miles, by bus - but the itinerary was a fan's delight. Included was a 
trip to the newest stadium in baseball, Chicago's 4-month-old Comiskey Park, 
and three warhorses fated to go the way of the old Met: Baltimore's Memorial 
Stadium (which will give way next year to the still-unnamed ballpark at Camden
Yards), Cleveland Stadium (scheduled to be replaced by a 
quarter-billion-dollar facility in 1994), and Detroit's Tiger Stadium (which 
the baseball team wants to demolish in a relentless quest for lucrative 
private boxes).<p>
   There'd also be two days in Cooperstown to celebrate Carew's elevation, and
stops at three minor-league towns along the way. And finally, a visit to an 
old favorite that seems destined to escape the wrecking ball: Chicago's 
Wrigley Field, which, along with Boston's Fenway Park, will be one of only two
parks built before the Korean War to survive into the 21st century.<p>
   All this lay before an excited group of 22 fans milling around St. Paul's 
Midway Shopping Center at 8:30 on a hot Wednesday morning in July. The only 
thing we had in common were our Twins caps; the lineup included a retired 
teacher, a traveling salesman, a janitor, a warehouse manager, a retired Iron 
Range steelworker and his wife, two government bureaucrats, a corporate 
executive, an unemployed guy and a free-lance journalist. We were not without 
a celebrity: WCCO-TV anchorman Dave Moore, a longtime outdoor-baseball 
agitator and Ballpark Tours participant, who went with his wife, Shirley.<p>
   We all climbed aboard the blessedly air-conditioned Lorenz Motor Coach, 
happy to get away. "No tequila before 11 a.m.!," Empson shouted playfully as 
the bus pulled onto Interstate 94.<p>
   It's eight hours to Chicago, plenty of time to exchange baseball stories - 
a Ballpark Tours tradition that helps break the ice among strangers. It's 
Empson who has the best tale.<p>
   "It's only fitting that I tell a story about Rodney Carew," Empson begins. 
"I used to vend beer at the Met, so I saw him play a lot. I remember the last 
game he ever played as a Twin. End of the 1978 season. After the game, we hung
around the players' entrance and waited for him to say goodbye.<p>
   "He's one of the last ones out, carrying a huge garbage bag with all his 
Twins stuff in it, probably the last time he'll ever need it. The team was 
pretty bad that year, and there weren't many fans waiting. Carew looked really
sad. He knew he was gone; we knew he was gone. He wasn't always the most 
approachable guy, so you had to be careful about going up to him.<p>
   "But an amazing thing happened. He propped himself against the back of his 
Mercedes and just started talking, telling stories about Calvin and his early 
days. It was like he didn't want to leave. We just stood there and soaked it 
all in."<p>
   Empson smiles. "He goes on for about 45 minutes, and we start looking at 
our watches; you know, `Hey, Rod, we gotta go.' But it was great. They say he 
was moody, but I'll always remember that day." <p>
<p>
Day 1: Chicago<p>
   As we pull in to 35th and Shields, we see the shattered hulk of the old 
Comiskey Park sitting across the street from the new Comiskey, as if the White
Sox want to rub in their move to shinier digs. The exploding scoreboard that 
Bill Veeck installed still stands on the old site, but all the seats down the 
first- and third-base lines have been demolished. Comiskey II looms over the 
old corpse, twice as tall, shiny and imposing.<p>
   There are a few traditional architectural details on the outside of the new
Comiskey - a concession to fans' demand for some tradition in their new 
ballyards. But the frills mask another basically unfriendly modern field. 
Inside, there are no seats obstructed by posts, but the upper deck is steeper 
than the Metrodome's heart-attack-inducing tilt, and what's more, it rests 
atop not one but three levels of private boxes and club seats ($16 a pop). 
Sneaking into the high-rent district, I hear something I've never heard inside
a ballpark: "Hello, my name is Michelle, and I'll be your server tonight."<p>
   That's right; fans in the good seats have their own personal attendants, 
who will gladly hand-deliver a $5.75 "gourmet kosher hot dog" or a $7.50 
chicken-breast sandwich. Meanwhile, fans in the cheap seats who tumble down 
toward their concession stands find a two-inning-long wait; at least the team 
has installed TVs so you can watch the action while you wait.<p>
   The list of abominations at the new Comiskey is distressingly long. The old
food court, where Cuban sandwiches simmered on open grills and Mexican 
families rolled burritos in front of your eyes, has been replaced by "ethnic" 
concession stands every bit as unique as the International Specialties windows
at the Dome. The left-field picnic area, where you used to be able to watch 
the game through a mesh fence while you chowed, is still there - except it has
been moved to right field, costs $25 to enter and is closed once the game 
starts.<p>
   The field is green, and the Sox' new black hats are fashionable, but 
everything else about the place seems disappointing. The cheapest seat is six 
bucks, and there are only a few thousand of those; some outfield seats go for 
$9. The tipsy factory workers who once bellowed for their South Side heroes 
have been replaced by a monied crowd that resembles the well-heeled Cubs 
faithful; we count more than 100 men attending the game wearing pink polo 
shirts - a sure sign of creeping yuppiedom. <p>
<p>
Day 2: Buffalo<p>
   It's 10 hours to Buffalo - the longest leg of the trip. But the adventure 
is still fresh, and even though we're pulling out at 8 a.m. for a 7 p.m. game,
no one is dragging. Perhaps that's because all the glazed doughnuts from the 
South Bend Days Inn's free continental breakfast have somehow found their way 
aboard the bus.<p>
   As we roll across Indiana, Julian's 11-year-old son, Jesse Clarkson-Empson,
is admiring his Rickey Henderson rookie card, which he got from Tim, the 
traveling salesman. Henderson is Jesse's favorite player; yesterday, Tim 
calmly reached into his briefcase and plopped the card - worth $180 - into 
Jesse's hands. Ever seen a kid's face when he can't decide between delight and
amazement? For Jesse, it's Christmas in July - and Tim is Santa in a Houston 
Astros cap.<p>
   Asked to explain this remarkable act of generosity, Tim says, "I paid 
pennies for Henderson's card when it first came out; I've got five of these 
cards sitting around my house. I figure the best thing about the prices going 
haywire is that it increases the smile value."<p>
   It's a good portent for the day; we regain some of our soul in the minors. 
Pilot Field, home of the Buffalo Bisons, is only a few years older than the 
new Comiskey, but it holds a cozier 20,000 spectators. Bison fans are a loyal 
lot who routinely pack the place, even after their hopes of getting a 
major-league expansion team were turned down earlier this summer. "There's not
much to do here; everybody comes out," one Buffalonian explains 
matter-of-factly.<p>
   Buffeted by hard economic times, this is a crowd that knows how to release 
tension at a ballgame. At one point, the public-address announcer introduces a
couple in the middle of a trip to all 178 professional ballparks in North 
America; management has rewarded them with gas for the car, a week's worth of 
groceries and a steak dinner delivered to their front-row seats. "Hey, I'm 
unemployed, too," bellows one nearby fan. "How 'bout giving me a steak 
dinner?!" <p>
<p>
Day 3: Utica<p>
   It's a three-hour drive to Utica, home of the Blue Sox. The team has a 
wonderful name, but they are near the bottom of professional baseball's food 
chain - a sub-.500 club in the short-season New York-Penn League, where recent
draft choices begin their pro careers in June and the season ends in early 
September. Utica's Donovan Stadium is barely a stadium: new metal bleachers 
and a few covered seats behind the plate. Just 1,000 fans turn out on 
half-price night, even though tickets are $1.50.<p>
   Utica is a depressed central New York town where the big industry is a 
Matt's Beer brewery; the suds are tasty, but the baseball is rank. This may be
the first game I've ever seen where a team smashes a grand slam in the first 
inning and loses by 15 runs; the visiting Pittsfield Mets give up 13 walks, 
commit six errors and drop the contest 21-6.<p>
   In the fifth inning, Utica scores seven runs on just two hits; two innings 
later, they get seven more on a four-hit outburst. Pittsfield's pitching coach
is former Twin Jerry Koosman; he declines an invitation to come say hello to a
couple of dozen of his old fans, probably out of embarrassment. <p>
<p>
Days 4 and 5: Cooperstown<p>
   Tucked in the foothills of the Adirondacks, Cooperstown (population 2,500) 
is often described as a gem of a town. If that were really true, someone would
have it appraised and slap a price tag on it during Hall of Fame week.<p>
   Cooperstown, alas, is testament to how much baseball has become a business 
- not just for owners and players, but for fans. The town quadruples in size 
on the weekend when inductions take place, but it seems as if most of the new 
arrivals are less interested in baseball history than in baseball merchandise.
The number of memorabilia stores has shot up from one in 1989 to 11 today. 
Rents have gotten so high on Main Street that parts of the town have been 
declared "baseball-free" zones, so that main-line merchants can still afford 
to be located there.<p>
   It's easy to get the feeling that the game's not the thing anymore. Two 
teams from the New York-Penn League play a free game at lovely Doubleday 
Field, a cozy brick structure laid out on the mythological spot where Abner 
Doubleday invented the game. Although thousands of fans are in town, barely 
400 people turn out on a perfect summer day to watch the youngsters, one of 
whom might return to the town to get a plaque someday. Throughout the game, 
the memorabilia merchants continue to do a brisk business.<p>
   Empson, though, gets a heartwarming surprise inside the Hall: Four Met 
Stadium seats he donated in 1984 are right there in the lobby, and so is the 
seat bearing the plaque that marked the spot where Harmon Killebrew's longest 
home run landed. "Imagine what a thrill it is for a fan to see something he's 
given to the Hall right here," Empson marvels to Jesse. Giving truly is better
than buying.<p>
   The induction ceremony is held in a tree-lined city park right next to the 
red-brick Hall; it was filled in 1989 when Carl Yastrzemski and Johnny Bench 
were inducted, but Carew, Gaylord Perry and Ferguson Jenkins don't have the 
same marquee appeal, so there's plenty of room to move around.<p>
   Though the turnout is lackluster, the hardy fans get a treat: More Hall of 
Famers have returned to Cooperstown today than ever before. Imagine these 
greats all on one stage: Warren Spahn, Willie Mays, Ernie Banks, Al Kaline, 
Willie McCovey, Monte Irvin, Brooks Robinson, Juan Marichal, Luis Aparicio, 
Bob Feller, Catfish Hunter, Yogi Berra, Ray Dandridge, Joe Morgan, Charley 
Gehringer, Pee Wee Reese and the boys of 1941, Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. 
It's awe-inspiring.<p>
   Dave Moore, befitting his nobility, has secured reserved seats. Later, he 
tells us that when he saw DiMaggio, he started to tell nearby friends about 
how Joltin' Joe's 56-game hitting streak was stopped by an adroit Cleveland 
Indians third baseman named Ken Keltner. "The guy next to me taps me on the 
shoulder," Moore recalls. "He points to the guy sitting in front of me, and 
says 'That's Ken Keltner.' I said, `It is?' And Keltner turns around and says,
`It sure is!' "<p>
   Various other baseball dignitaries are introduced, including Bo 
Schembechler, the former University of Michigan football coach who, as 
president of the Detroit Tigers, is leading the charge to destroy Tiger 
Stadium. The Ballpark Tours crew lustily boos Bo when he stands up, which we 
later learn is a breach of Hall of Fame decorum. Finding out that we've 
violated a taboo makes us feel great; in our own way, we feel we're trying to 
preserve baseball's heritage as much as the Hall is.<p>
   Carew, a native Panamanian, gets that country's national anthem played 
before his induction; it's at least 10 minutes and several endless stanza 
long. (The smaller the country, the more grandiose the anthem.) His speech is 
humble and modest, as are Jenkins' and Perry's. Carew ticks off the names of 
the game's greats as a way to acknowledge his appreciation of the place; as he
finishes, I sneak a peek out on Main Street, where the memorabilia business 
has slowed down not one whit, even as history turns another page behind the 
park's wrought-iron gates. <p>
<p>
Day 6: Scranton<p>
   Not that all souvenir-buying is bad; collectively, the bus crew contributed
several thousand dollars to the Cooperstown economy, mostly to purchase 
historic caps.<p>
   Tim, the traveling salesman/card collector, bought an early St. Louis 
Browns cap with a narrow brim that makes him look like an overgrown Cub Scout;
Jesse wears a 1908 gray Chicago Cubs road model; Dave, a 20-year Navy man who 
recently returned from active duty, sports a white 1915 Detroit Tigers cap 
with spiffy orange stripes at the seams.<p>
   Now there's more napping on the bus, less chatter and more quiet study of 
Baseball America. Everybody has staked out a pair of seats to stretch out on, 
and piles of newspapers, open to the box scores, litter the floor. We're 
conserving our energy for the swing through the best old ballparks of the 
trip.<p>
   But first, a stop at brand-new Lackawanna County Stadium, home of the 
Triple-A Scranton-Wilkes Barre Red Barons. Chiseled out of a hillside in 
anthracite country, just across the highway from a ski run, the ballpark looks
like the sort they'd have in Duluth if they still played minor-league ball on 
the North Shore. Craggy outcroppings loom over center field, but nature ends 
at the field itself. Lackawanna is the only artificial-turf park on our trip, 
in deference to the parent Philadelphia Phillies, who play on the fake stuff 
100 miles away.<p>
   Like Comiskey II and Pilot Field, this modern park is unremarkable, though 
it does feature the latest trend, spreading from Toronto's Skydome: the Hard 
Ball Cafe, down the first-base line. Everybody wants to be big-league. At 
least we see the best-played game of the trip, a one-hitter by Scranton 
pitcher Andy Ashby. <p>
<p>
Day 7: Baltimore<p>
   After a three-hour ride, we're in Baltimore, where we're greeted by 
sizzling 103-degree temperatures; everyone takes off for the pool during the 
few hours before game time - until storm clouds roll in. "Don't worry," Empson
says breezily. "We've only had one rainout in 10 years."<p>
   Memorial Stadium, built in 1954, is facing death at the age of 37. Like Met
Stadium and County Stadium, it is one of the great underappreciated parks of 
the '50s: functional but not plastic; graceful steel instead of cold concrete.
There's a connectedness to the place: The Met had its nearby cornfields; 
Memorial is built in the middle of a tidy neighborhood of rowhouses. In our 
seats just inside the left-field foul pole, we marvel at the Maryland Crab 
Cakes and the price of our tickets: $4.75, for a seat that would cost $11 at 
the Dome or $13 at Comiskey.<p>
   Baltimore's fans are the best of the trip, cheering and stomping even as 
the woebegone Orioles fall behind 5-0 to the California Angels. "Gee, they 
don't even need a sign on the scoreboard to get them to cheer," wisecracks 
Empson between puffs on his stogie. "And they don't need a Great Tire Race, 
either."<p>
   The fans are rewarded in the eighth when first baseman Randy Milligan 
cracks a grand slam to bring the O's within a run. But befitting a sixth-place
season, the home team can't pull ahead and still loses 5-4. It's the second 
time on the trip we've seen a team hit a grand slam and lose.<p>
   Before the bus leaves, we sneak a peak at the new stadium, which is going 
up near the tourist district known as the Inner Harbor. There's a lot to like:
only one row of private boxes to Comiskey's three, meaning the cheap seats 
won't be so high up; two decks of seats in left field, much like the old Met; 
and a row of historic warehouses looming over center and right field. (Word is
a 450-shot could break a warehouse window.)<p>
   Camden seems distinctive without being elitist, assuming tickets are priced
reasonably. It's nice to think that Baltimore will get the best of the new 
ballparks, because its fans are so passionate about the game. <p>
<p>
Day 8: Cleveland<p>
   It's a long seven hours to Cleveland, and we tumble off the bus famished. 
After a week of fast-food highways stops and ballpark hot dogs, we're overdue 
for some real food. And all you need to know about Cleveland's soul can be 
summed up in one word: Paninni.<p>
   Paninni's is a bar about half a mile from Cleveland Stadium, along the 
railroad tracks down the shore of Lake Erie. It's a typical shot-and-a-beer 
kind of place, except for its signature sandwich, the Paninni: two big slices 
of white bread, a heaping portion of red meat, lettuce, tomato, onion, sauce, 
fries. If you think that sounds unremarkable, consider that Paninni's puts the
fries inside the sandwich. You bite into the thing, and it looks like you've  
just chewed through a big coaxial cable with the fries sticking out the  
middle. It's weird but satisfying, much like the city itself.<p>
   Talk about weird: Cleveland Stadium features stands that curve around home 
plate and an open outfield section, yet everyone in town thinks the Indians 
should move because the place was built for football. The only explanation is 
that 40 years of losing baseball, combined with the Browns' successful 
history, have warped local perceptions of the place.<p>
   Cleveland Stadium (natives call it "The Mistake by the Lake") was a 
public-works project built during the Depression; like most public-works 
projects, they used way too much concrete: The place seats almost 80,000. 
Commentators often say that makes the stadium too big for baseball, but the 
park, while boasting a giant upper deck, feels surprisingly intimate. If you 
can mentally lop off the upper 20 rows of the cheap seats, Cleveland Stadium 
is as good as Wrigley or Tiger.<p>
   There's a terrific picnic area in the outfield where the old fences used to
extend; the old warning track now serves as a path. But all those empty seats,
and the Indians' losing ways, have made local baseball fans feel small. You 
get the idea they want to move only to escape the ghosts lurking in the 
rafters. <p>
<p>
Day 9: Detroit<p>
   The drive to Detroit is short, and we pull into town a bit early to meet 
with the Save Tiger Stadium Fan Club, a '90s version of Empson's Save the Met 
crew. Most people remember the area around Tiger Stadium from the 1984 World 
Series, when jubilant Detroiters nearly set the place on fire. But the area 
that locals call Corktown is still there, if a little worse for wear; vacant 
lots are the rule, and the fan club meets on the second floor of the aged 
Gaelic Hall, one of the remaining outposts of the neighborhood's Irish 
heritage.<p>
   We wind up in a bar down the street, owned by the guy who was driving Billy
Martin's car when he died last winter. It's a very creepy first impression; 
decay and death seem everywhere.<p>
   That said, tearing down venerable Tiger Stadium would be a great travesty. 
This is a fans' ballpark, built in 1912, just a year after Fenway. Home plate 
is located in the same place where Ty Cobb used to steal home; infield seats 
sit below the crown of the field, so fans actually watch the action take place
slightly above them, instead of looking down into a bowl as you do at the 
Dome.<p>
   There are nooks and crannies for fans to find their favorite cheap seats, 
and the second deck hangs right over the first, creating a surprisingly 
intimate view. Upper deck right field, where Pat Sheridan hit his homer off 
Jeff Reardon to give the Tigers their only win of the 1987 American League 
Championship Series, offers the closest view of the plate of any outfield seat
in baseball. Sitting in the upper deck down the first-base line, we're 
directly over the visitors' bullpen. Jesse mischievously kicks a sunflower 
seed shell off the deck, and it flutters past Twins pitcher Terry Leach's 
head. We're that close.<p>
   The park has a fresh coat of paint and comfortable blue and orange seats; 
its sturdiness and comfort aren't concerns. Problem is, the place wasn't built
for private boxes - which now sit at the top of the park instead of between 
the upper and lower decks, as they do in new stadiums. This is apparently too 
much for the big cigars of Detroit to bear, and the Tigers are leading a 
crusade to persuade the city to build another new Comiskey.<p>
   Who cares if the boxes at the top of Tiger are as close as the ones at 
Comiskey II? Who cares if Tigers fans have told pollsters again and again that
they want their old ballpark? Bo Schembechler wants to ram a new stadium down 
Detroit throats as if it were a Wolverine fullback plunge.<p>
   Politicians such as Detroit Mayor Coleman Young seem eager to cooperate; 
the day we're there, the city and Wayne County announce that they've settled 
their differences and have agreed to build a new park.<p>
   Get to Tiger Stadium while you still can. <p>
<p>
Day 10: Chicago<p>
   Four hours to Chicago and a complete change of scenery. Wrigley Field, of 
course, is the ultimate yuppie park. Scalpers are getting a whopping $30 per 
bleacher seat on this warm summer day; people seem willing to pay it to sit in
the seats made famous by the Bleacher Bums and, in the '80s, by WGN-TV's cable
empire. But thank God for publicity: The attention paid to lights and Harry 
Caray have saved this park from destruction. It's become a treasured cultural 
landmark.<p>
   We're sitting way up behind the plate, high enough to see sailboats sailing
