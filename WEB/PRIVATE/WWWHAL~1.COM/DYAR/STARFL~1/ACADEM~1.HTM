<A NAME ="SACOM"><b>STARFLEET ACADEMY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE (SACOM)</b></A><br>

Welcome to the Starfleet Academy College of Medicine. 
Our goal is to familiarize our students with the fundamental aspects of
medicine. Please remember that this course is not a substitute for
professional schooling or training. It's purpose is to serves an introduction
to medicine.  Please take the time to seek further medical education through
CPR and First Aid classes. For more information, contact your local Red Cross
or rescue squad.  Use of the World Book Encyclopedia and a medical dictionary
for these exams is hightly encouraged.  
We currently offer several Basic and Specialty courses for you to choose
from. The Basic Doctorate exam allows the student to graduate as a StarFleet
Medical Doctor. Then, as a SFMD, students can become a specialist in one or
more fields.  There is no limit as to how many fields a student may
specialize in, the only limit is the student's motivation.  We allow student
to take 2 specialties at any one time; after the Basic Doctorate has been
passed.
<p>

Inquire to the director,   
<A HREF = "mailto:sacom@sfi.org">Kevin L. West</a> for an application or more information.

<A NAME ="COSS"><b>COLLEGE OF SURVIVAL STUDIES (COSS)</b></A><br>

This Starfleet Academy College is designed for Starfleet 
members in their Teens and older. 
<p>

3 schools: BASIC SURVIVAL SCHOOL, (planning for human survival in hostile
environments, from the Alaska wilderness to a moon colony to life aboard a
multi-generational ship); MAPPING SURVIVAL SCHOOL, (reading, making, and
navigating 2-D and 3-D maps) and SURVIVAL STRATEGIES SCHOOL (Use of emergency
procedures by Enterprise, DS9 and Voyager crews.)
<p>
The Basic Survival School makes a student think how
humans fit in their environment. Courses send you on a
fishing trip to Alaska, on a 6-month archeological away
team, on a planning mission to the moon, and on a planning
team for a multi-generational ship. Most of the courses may
be taken in teams of up to 3 students, which may include
 students with physical or developmental disabilities.
<p>
The Mapping school introduces the student to different kinds
of maps: a floor plan, a city map, a planetary map, and a
galactic map. The student learns to navigate and draw simple
maps.

<A NAME ="VAS"><b>VULCAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE (VAS)</b></A><br>
The Vulcan Academy of Science is designed to answer those questions you
may have about a particular science which has piqued your interest enough
to learn more about it. VAS offers degrees in about a dozen major sciences
and at least 27 electives from many of the sciences that exist in our
world today.  To add that bit of thrilling science fiction, I've thrown in
Star Trek trivia that relates to the sciences VAS offers. A course in Logic
gives the VAS that Vulcan touch.  All students are required to complete the 
Logic course, and upon completion, will be assigned a Vulcan name. Students 
who score 100% are inducted into the Vulcan Legion of Honor and may "upgrade" their standing in the Legion with each VAS program they complete.<p> 

The Vulcan Academy of Science has officially become an operational online 
department of the Starfleet Academy.<p>

You can now receive V.A.S. course packets via e-mail.<p>

<h3><i>How does it work?</i></h3>

<ul>
<li>Obtain Starfleet vouchers from HQ or the Academy.<br>
<li>Send an application and two vouchers to me via snail mail.<br>
<li>Notify me that you want your packets sent via e-mail and supply the
    proper address.<br>
<li>I will send you a V.A.S. Curriculum List.<br>
<li>Choose the degree and electives from the Curriculum List, and send
    me (via e-mail) your choices.<br>
<li>I will send your course packet via e-mail within 24 hours of receiving
    your request. (24-hours is my goal, if there's a problem at my end...
    I will notify you that the packet may be delayed).<br>
<li>When you get the packet, you must acknowledge that it was received
    so I know if there's a hangup somewhere between my terminal and yours.<br>
<li>You will have 10 weeks to complete your V.A.S. course.  If you are
    getting near the deadline and see you cannot make it... notify me via
    e-mail.  Academy directors are permitted to extend deadlines by two
    weeks.  This extension may be repeated once, for a total extension of
    four weeks.<br> 
<li>If you request an extension, and do not hear from me within 24 hours,
    assume I did not get the request and resend it.  I will respond to
    your request as soon as I get online and see it in my mailbox. (I am
    online several times a day.)<br> 
<li>Your answers must be printed out, and sent to me via regular mail.<br>
<li>You are required to send a business sized (#10) Self Addressed, Stamped 
    Envelope with your answers. (One first class postage stamp is required). 
    This SASE will be used to return your letter of completion, letter for 
    your C.O., diploma, and any other certificates you may have earned.
    If you cannot send an SASE, I will accept 3 unused, first class U.S.
    postage stamps instead.<br>
<li>Persons living outside the United States should send 4 IRCs (Inter-
    national Reply Coupons) instead of stamps. IRCs can be purchased at
    your local post office.<br>
<li>Please bear with me.  Although I feel comfortable using e-mail for my
    personal, professional, and Academy dealings, putting V.A.S. online is
    new to me.  As you and I experiment with this medium, it's no doubt
    we'll both have suggestions on how to make it more efficient.<br>  
<li>That's all there's to it!  Come study at the Vulcan Academy of Science!<br>
</ul>
