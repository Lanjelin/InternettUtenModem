<FONT SIZE=2>
<EM>Carnegie Mellon University 15-211, 12.0 units, Dr. Blum</EM><BR>
Fundamental programming concepts are presented together with supporting theoretical
bases and practical applications. This course emphasizes the practical application
of techni ques for writing and analyzing programs: data abstraction, program
verification, and performance analysis. These techniques are applied in the design
and analysis of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

The course continues the presentation of fundamental programming concepts begun in
15-211, focusing on more sophisticated methods for describing and reasoning about
computer programs. High-level languages are introduced including language mechanisms
for us er-defined data types, and formal methods are presented for reasoning about

<A NAME="15-312"><STRONG>Programming Languages Design and Processing</STRONG><BR></A>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<EM>Carnegie Mellon University 15-312, 9.0 units, Dr. Steve Brookes</EM><BR>
This course discusses in depth many of the concepts underlying the design, definition,
implementation, and use of modern programming languages. Formal approaches to defining
the syntax and semantics are used to describe the fundamental concepts underlying
programming languages. A wide variety of paradigms are covered, including imperative,
functional, logic, and concurrent programming paradigms. In addition to the formal
studies, experience with programming in the languages is used to illustrate how different
design goals can lead to radically different languages and models of computation. An
emphasis is also placed on pragmatic issues related to how languages are implemented
on modern hardware.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<EM>Carnegie Mellon University 15-347, 12.0 units, Randal E. Bryant/David R. O'Hallaron</EM><BR>
The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of the structure and operation of
contemporary computer sys tems from the instruction set architecture level through the
register transfer implementation level. We explore: theory of computation, levels of
abstraction, instruction set design, assembly language programming, processor data paths,
data path control, p ipeline design, design of memory hierarchies, memory management,
input/output. Several of the principles presented in lecture are reinforced through
laboratory projects including assembly language programming, evaluation of instruction
set architectures by benchmarks, behavioral simulation of an instruction set architecture,
and design/simulation of a register transfer implementation of an instruction set
architecture. A contemporary behavioral/functional/logical simulator will be used for the
laboratory projects.

Intelligent computer programs can solve problems, process natural language, reason about
their actions, and learn from experience. The methods for achieving such behaviors involve
the manipulation of internal symbolic representations. The course will focus on the main
types of symbolic knowledge representation and the main techniques for search, planning
and problem solvin g. It will also cover the essentials of natural language processing

<FONT SIZE=2>
<EM>Carnegie Mellon University 79-300, 12.0 units, Dr. Eugene Levy</EM><BR>
This is a course in the historian s craft. Its main goal is not to master a
specific body of historical knowledge, but to acquire skill in the art of writing
history itself. Students will learn how to pose researchable questions, how to do
the detective wo rk necessary to gather evidence, and how to present their
findings clearly and persuasively. Above all, students will argue, that is,

<EM>Carnegie Mellon University 79-359, 9.0 units, Dr. Edward Constant II</EM><BR>
Two things, at least for now, dominate life on this planet: technology and organization.
The course begins with preindustrial modes of social organization (such as the Chinese
Imperial Bureaucracy), then moves to the creation of modern business organizations in
the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries and their relationship to changing
technology. Concluding segments of the course focus on the problems of managing
contemporary complex technologies, and of public regulation.
