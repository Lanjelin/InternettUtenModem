	<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2050" tppabs="http://sysdoc.pair.com/">Tom's Hardware Guide</A>
	</STRONG></FONT>
<DD>	This site is designed to help and explain all the important hardware aspects
	of a modern Pentium/Pentium Pro machine. It should be helpful to beginners as
	well as to experienced computer users to make you able to understand how your
	computer works and how you can increase its performance.<P>

	</STRONG></FONT>
<DD>	The term 'overclocking' describes the process of running your CPU at a clock
	and/or bus speed that the CPU hasn't been specified for - logically, that speed
	is usually higher. The tempting idea behind overclocking is to increase system
	performance at very little cost. In many cases you only need to change a few
	settings on your motherboard to make your system run faster. In other cases
	you only have to add a few components (usually for cooling) to achieve the
	performance increase.<P>

	<A HREF="../../../tppmsgs/msgs20.htm#2052" tppabs="http://www.lemig.umontreal.ca/bios/bios_sg.htm">BIOS Survival Guide</A>
	</STRONG></FONT>
<DD>	Did you ever experienced a system lock up or poor performance and erratic
	behavior due to improper BIOS settings? Have you ever been left in the dark
	by a cryptic 5 pages, badly written motherboard manual? The answer is probably
	yes. The BIOS Survival Guide provides a description of each BIOS function
	and tips for their settings.
