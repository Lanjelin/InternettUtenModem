am now a Senior at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a double major in Computer
Science and Social History therefore taking a variety of <A HREF="SPRING~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~rsai/Spring97.html">classes
this semester</A>.  No longer living on campus, I live a few blocks from campus in
Shadyside, one of the best residential areas within the 
<A HREF="BURGH/BURGH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~rsai/Burgh/Burgh.html">Pittsburgh</A> city limits.

Whenever free time can be found, I work downtown as an Intranet developer for PPG
Industries, a major manufacturer of chemicals, coatings and resins, glass and
fiberglass.  When I have time, I also maintain the
<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS4.HTM#431" tppabs="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/Snodgrass/">Snodgrass Homepage</A> for those interested in the history
of the name. <P>

My significant other is <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS4.HTM#432" tppabs="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~kp2z/">Kelly Ann Papuga</A>,

when she was still a freshman.
Kelly grew up in Munhall, a borough just southeast of Pittsburgh with her parents and
brother Joe.  She is a junior Information Decision Systems major and Psychology
minor.  Kelly currently works as an internet developer for
<A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS4.HTM#433" tppabs="http://www.healthguide.com/">Clinical Tools</A>, a company

<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#FF8040><STRONG>O</STRONG></FONT>ne of my most favorite outdoor activities is downhill skiing.  I am extremely fortunate
to be able to go skiing with my family once a year.  I have been on skies almost all my
life, except for a few years following a broken leg that happened at a small North
Carolina ski resort.  While still only a baby, my parents would carry me on their backs
while they cross country skied in northern Vermont.  Despite branches constantly hitting
me in the face, I would often tell them to "Go, Go!" when they weren't going fast enough
for my taste.<P>


<FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR=#FF8040><STRONG>I</STRONG></FONT> have skied some of the best slopes in North America, including Vail, Beaver Creek,
Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Arapaho Basin, Keystone, and Steamboat Springs in
Colorado; Big Sky, Montana; as well as Blackcomb/Whistler in beautiful British Columbia
Canada.  One day I hope to ski the Alps in Europe or, during the Summer, one of the
several mountains in South America.<P>
