Despite the almost unbearable heat, Pietro Casiglioni's annual gathering at the Reading
Pennsylvania Country Club brought out some unusual sights.  Everything from a historic
1953 375 MM Spyder to the technologically advanced F50 were present.  As always, the
Reading Ferrari Concours d'Elegance featured a different model, this year being the
246 Dino.  Following the annual dinner was the awards ceremy where wood mounted yellow
Dino models were presented as trophies.  All owners in attendance who brought their
Ferrari were also given a beautiful yellow 246 Dino print to remember the event. <P>

Three white tents surrounding the concours offered various Ferrari memorabilia, models,
books, posters and prints to enthusiasts attending the event.  Directly in front of the
three tents sat Leonard M. Rusiewicz's beautiful 1953 375MM Pininfarina Spyder,
s/n 0370AM, which he had just recently restored. <P>

Following the concours at 3:00pm, the customary dinner and awards ceremony was held inside
the country club, which we were unfortunately unable to attend since we had to head back
to Pittsburgh.  We hope you enjoy the following selection of photos from the event.  We
look forward to next years event which features the Daytona and hope to see you there!<BR>
