The Monterey Historic Automobile Races, one of the most well known events for vintage
racing enthusiasts, is held every fall at the Laguna Seca Raceway.

Located only a few miles outside of Monterey California, the 2.238 mile track provides
the perfect opportunity for owners and enthusiasts to experience the thrill and excitement
of racing as it used to be. This year, over 40,000 attended the three days of qualifying
and racing, a far cry from the 150 or so fans that were present during 1974, the first year
the event was held.<P>

Each year a different marque is featured and this year BMW took center stage.  Many
pre-war cars seldom seen elsewhere were on display including 315/1s, 327s, 328 Roadsters, 3.0CSs
and more.  Not only vintage cars were present, others included a 1995 BMW-powered
McLaren F1 Le Mans car and the famous Art Cars, a series of BMW race cars painted by
such famous artists as Andy Warhol, Frank Stella, Alexander Calder, and Roy Lichtenstein.
Next year, the 24th consecutive year the event has been held, the featured marque will
be Porsche. <BR CLEAR><P>

For me, the most interesting part of the races is wandering the paddock area where you
begin to get a real sense of the way racing used to be.  Now a tradition long lost, at
least in Formula 1, it was once possible to get an up-close look at the latest racing
machines.  It is at these type of events where enthusiasts once again get an opportunity
to become acquainted with the cars and drivers.  Watch the owners and mechanics prepare
their cars, listen to the racing stories of veteran drivers, and feel the rumble of the
engines.  After strolling around the paddocks, it's time to climb the hill to get a
great view of the infamous Corkscrew and a chance watch the actual races.  There are fourteen
different classes, everything from pre-war sports and Grand Prix racing cars to Can Am
cars. <P>

The following is a small collection of my photographs taken at Monterey in August 1996.  
I hope it brings back memories or instills a desire to attend next years event.  If you
ever get the opportunity to attend the Monterey Historic Automobile Races don't hesitate,
you won't be disappointed. <BR>
