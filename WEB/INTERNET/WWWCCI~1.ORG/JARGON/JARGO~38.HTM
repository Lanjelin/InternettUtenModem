<A NAME=TAG2054><B>&#60;bobbit&#62;</B></A> /n./ <P> [Usenet: <I><a href="news:alt.folklore.urban">alt.folklore.urban</a></I> and
   elsewhere] Commonly used as a placeholder for omitted text in a
   followup message (not copying the whole parent message is
   considered good form).  Refers, of course, to the celebrated
   mutilation of John Bobbitt. <P>
<A NAME=TAG2055><B>4.2</B></A> /for' poynt too'/ /n./ <P> Without a prefix, this almost
   invariably refers to  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG216">BSD</A> Unix release 4.2.  Note that it is an
   indication of cluelessness to say "version 4.2", and "release
   4.2" is rare; the number stands on its own, or is used in the more
   explicit forms 4.2BSD or (less commonly) BSD 4.2.  Similar remarks
   apply to "4.3", "4.4" and to earlier, less-widespread releases
   4.1 and 2.9. <P>
<A NAME=TAG2056><B>'Snooze</B></A> /snooz/ [FidoNet] /n./ <P> Fidonews, the weekly
   official on-line newsletter of FidoNet.  As the editorial policy of
   Fidonews is "anything that arrives, we print", there are often
   large articles completely unrelated to FidoNet, which in turn tend
   to elicit  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG641" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG641">flamage</A> in subsequent issues.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2057><B>(TM)</B></A> // <P> [Usenet] ASCII rendition of the
   trademark-superscript symbol
   appended to phrases that the author feels should be recorded for
   posterity, perhaps in future editions of this lexicon.  Sometimes
   used ironically as a form of protest against the recent spate of
   software and algorithm patents and `look and feel' lawsuits.  See
   also  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1864" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1864">UN*X</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2058><B>-oid</B></A> /suff./ <P> [from `android'] 1. Used as in mainstream
   English to indicate a poor imitation, a counterfeit, or some
   otherwise slightly bogus resemblance.  Hackers will happily use it
   with all sorts of non-Greco/Latin stem words that wouldn't keep
   company with it in mainstream English.  For example, "He's a
   nerdoid" means that he superficially resembles a nerd but can't
   make the grade; a `modemoid' might be a 300-baud box (Real Modems
   run at 9600 or up); a `computeroid' might be any  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG124" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG124">bitty box</A>.
   The word `keyboid' could be used to describe a  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG279" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG279">chiclet keyboard</A>, but would have to be written; spoken, it would confuse
   the listener as to the speaker's city of origin.  2. More
   specifically, an indicator for `resembling an android' which in
   the past has been confined to science-fiction fans and hackers.  It
   too has recently (in 1991) started to go mainstream (most notably
   in the term `trendoid' for victims of terminal hipness).  This is
   probably traceable to the popularization of the term  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG514" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG514">droid</A> in
   "Star Wars" and its sequels.  (See also  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1980" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1980">windoid</A>.) <P>
   Coinages in both forms have been common in science fiction for at
   least fifty years, and hackers (who are often SF fans) have
   probably been making `-oid' jargon for almost that long
   [though GLS and I can personally confirm only that they were
   already common in the mid-1970s --ESR].
<P>
<A NAME=TAG2059><B>-ware</B></A> /suff./ <P> [from `software'] Commonly used to form
   jargon terms for classes of software.  For examples, see
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG252" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG252">careware</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG384" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG384">crippleware</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG389" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG389">crudware</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG691" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG691">freeware</A>,

    <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1893" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1893">vaporware</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1960" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1960">wetware</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2060><B>/dev/null</B></A> /dev-nuhl/ /n./ <P> [from the Unix null device, used
   as a data sink] A notional `black hole' in any information space
   being discussed, used, or referred to.  A controversial posting,
   for example, might end "Kudos to rasputin@kremlin.org, flames to
   /dev/null".  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG116" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG116">bit bucket</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2061><B>0</B></A> <P> Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter `O' (the 15th
   letter of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they
   look a lot alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually
   distinct have compounded the confusion.  If your zero is
   center-dotted and letter-O is not, or if letter-O looks almost
   rectangular but zero looks more like an American football stood on
   end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at a modern character
   display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated as an
   option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your zero is slashed but
   letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII
   graphic set descended from the default typewheel on the venerable
   ASR-33 Teletype (Scandinavians, for whom @Oslash{} is a letter,
   curse this arrangement).  If letter-O has a slash across it and the
   zero does not, your display is tuned for a very old convention used
   at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers (Scandinavians curse
   <EM>this</EM> arrangement even more, because it means two of their
   letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero
   with a <EM>reversed</EM> slash.  And yet another convention common on
   early line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook
   to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive
   capital letter-O (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for
   how to draw ASCII characters, but the final standard changed the
   distinguisher to a tick-mark in the upper-left corner).  Are we
   sufficiently confused yet? <P>
<A NAME=TAG2062><B>1TBS</B></A> // /n./ <P> The "One True Brace Style"; see  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG934" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG934">indent style</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2063><B>120 reset</B></A> /wuhn-twen'tee ree'set/ /n./ <P> [from 120 volts,
   U.S. wall voltage] To cycle power on a machine in order to reset or
   unjam it.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG107" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG107">Big Red Switch</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1403" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1403">power cycle</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2064><B>2</B></A> /infix./ <P> In translation software written by hackers, infix
   2 often represents the syllable <EM>to</EM> with the connotation
   `translate to': as in dvi2ps (DVI to PostScript), int2string
   (integer to string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to [nt]roff).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2065><B>@-party</B></A> /at'par`tee/ /n./ <P> [from the @-sign in an Internet
   address] (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n par`tee/) A
   semi-closed party thrown for hackers at a science-fiction
   convention (esp. the annual World Science Fiction Convention or
   "Worldcon"); one must have a  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1240" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1240">network address</A> to get in, or
   at least be in company with someone who does.  One of the most
   reliable opportunities for hackers to meet face to face with people
   who might otherwise be represented by mere phosphor dots on their
   screens.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG175" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG175">boink</A>.  <P>
   The first recorded @-party was held at the Westercon (a California
   SF convention) over the July 4th weekend in 1980.  It is not clear
   exactly when the canonical @-party venue shifted to the Worldcon
   but it had certainly become established by Constellation in 1983. <P>

<A NAME=TAG2067><B>\begin</B></A> // <P> [from the LaTeX command] With \end, used
   humorously in writing to indicate a context or to remark on the

\begin{flame}
Predicate logic is the only good programming

tredecimal instead of binary.

<P>
   The Scribe users at CMU and elsewhere used to use @Begin/@End in
   an identical way (LaTeX was built to resemble Scribe).  On Usenet,
   this construct would more frequently be rendered as <CODE>&#60;FLAME
   ON&#62;</CODE> and <CODE>&#60;FLAME OFF&#62;</CODE>, or <CODE>#ifdef FLAME</CODE> and <CODE>#endif FLAME'</CODE>.  <P>
