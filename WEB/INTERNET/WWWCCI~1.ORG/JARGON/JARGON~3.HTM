From the late 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local, MS-DOS-based
bulletin boards has been developing separately from Internet hackerdom.  The
BBS culture has, as its seamy underside, a stratum of `pirate boards'
inhabited by  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG365" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG365">cracker</A>s, phone phreaks, and  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1940" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1940">warez d00dz</A>.  These
people (mostly teenagers running PC-clones from their bedrooms) have 
developed their own characteristic jargon, heavily influenced by skateboard
lingo and underground-rock slang.  <P>
Though crackers often call themselves `hackers', they aren't (they
typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet
expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems).
Their vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's.  Nevertheless,
this lexicon covers much of it so the reader will be able to
understand what goes by on bulletin-board systems.  <P>
Here is a brief guide to cracker and  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1940" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1940">warez d00dz</A> usage: <P>
<UL>
<LI>
Misspell frequently.  The substitutions
<P>
<PRE>
     phone => fone
     freak => phreak
</PRE>
<P>
are obligatory.
<LI>
Always substitute `z's for `s's.  (i.e. "codes" -&#62; "codez").
<LI>
Type random emphasis characters after a post line (i.e. "Hey Dudes!#!$#$!#!$").
<LI>
Use the emphatic `k' prefix ("k-kool", "k-rad", "k-awesome") frequently.
<LI>
Abbreviate compulsively ("I got lotsa warez w/ docs").
<LI>
Substitute `0' for `o' ("r0dent", "l0zer").
<LI>
TYPE ALL IN CAPS LOCK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING ALL THE TIME.
</UL>
<P>
These traits are similar to those of  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG103" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG103">B1FF</A>, who originated as a
parody of naive BBS users.  For further discussion of the pirate-board
subculture, see  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1008" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1008">lamer</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG545" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG545">elite</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1021" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1021">leech</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1396" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1396">poser</A>,
