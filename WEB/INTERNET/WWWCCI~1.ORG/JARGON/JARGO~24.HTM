The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from
technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab
(SAIL), and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities
including Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University
(CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).  <P>
The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as `jargon-1' or `the File')
was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975.  From this time until
the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the File was
named AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there.  Some terms in it date back
considerably earlier ( <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG697" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG697">frob</A> and some senses of  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1157" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1157">moby</A>, for
instance, go back to the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT and are
believed to date at least back to the early 1960s).  The revisions of
jargon-1 were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered
`Version 1'.  <P>
In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on
the SAIL computer,  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG709" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG709">FTP</A>ed a copy of the File to MIT.  He noticed that
it was hardly restricted to `AI words' and so stored the file on
his directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.  <P>
The file was quickly renamed JARGON &#62; (the `&#62;' caused versioning under
ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin and Guy L.
Steele Jr.  Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody thought of
correcting the term `jargon' to `slang' until the compendium had
already become widely known as the Jargon File.  <P>
Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was
subsequently kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic
resynchronizations).  <P>
The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard
Stallman was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and
ITS-related coinages.  <P>
In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of
the File published in Stewart Brand's "CoEvolution Quarterly"
(issue 29, pages 26--35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy
Steele (including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons).  This appears to
have been the File's first paper publication.  <P>
A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass
market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as
"The Hacker's Dictionary" (Harper &#38; Row CN 1082, ISBN
0-06-091082-8).  The other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don
Woods, and Mark Crispin) contributed to this revision, as did Richard
M. Stallman and Geoff Goodfellow.  This book (now out of print) is
hereafter referred to as `Steele-1983' and those six as the
Steele-1983 coauthors.  <P>
Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively
stopped growing and changing.  Originally, this was due to a desire to
freeze the file temporarily to facilitate the production of
Steele-1983, but external conditions caused the `temporary' freeze
to become permanent.  <P>
The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding
cuts and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported
hardware and software instead of homebrew whenever possible.  At MIT,
most AI work had turned to dedicated LISP Machines.  At the same time,
the commercialization of AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best
and brightest away to startups along the Route 128 strip in
Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley.  The startups built LISP
machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1854" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1854">TWENEX</A>
system rather than a host for the AI hackers' beloved  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG958" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG958">ITS</A>.  <P>
The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource
until 1991.  Stanford became a major  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1854" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1854">TWENEX</A> site, at one point
operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s
most of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging
BSD Unix standard.  <P>
In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the
File were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter
project at Digital Equipment Corporation.  The File's compilers,
already dispersed, moved on to other things.  Steele-1983 was partly a
monument to what its authors thought was a dying tradition; no one
involved realized at the time just how wide its influence was to
be.  <P>
By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had
grown up around it never quite died out.  The book, and softcopies
obtained off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from
MIT and Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing
influence on hacker language and humor.  Even as the advent of the
microcomputer and other trends fueled a tremendous expansion of
hackerdom, the File (and related materials such as the  <A HREF="JARGO~49.HTM#SEC54" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_47.html#SEC54">AI Koans</A> in
Appendix A) came to be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture
Matter of Britain chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of
the Lab.  The pace of change in hackerdom at large accelerated
tremendously -- but the Jargon File, having passed from living
document to icon, remained essentially untouched for seven years.  <P>
This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after
careful consultation with the editors of Steele-1983).  It merges in
about 80% of the Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and
a very few entries introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also
obsolete.  <P>
This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim
is to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical
computing cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested.  More
than half of the entries now derive from  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A> and represent jargon
now current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts have
been made to collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC
programmers, Amiga fans, Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe
world.  <P>

The maintainers are committed to updating the on-line version of the
Jargon File through and beyond paper publication, and will continue to
make it available to archives and public-access sites as a trust of
the hacker community.  <P>
Here is a chronology of the high points in the recent on-line revisions:
<P>
Version 2.1.1, Jun 12 1990: the Jargon File comes alive again after a

1922 entries.  <P>
Version 2.9.12, May 10 1993: a few new entries &#38; changes, marginal
MUD/IRC slang and some borderline techspeak removed, all in
preparation for 2nd Edition of TNHD.  This version had 22238 lines,
175114 words, 1152467 characters, and 1946 entries.  <P>

<P>
Version 3.3.0, Jan 20 1996: Winter 1996 update.  This version had
24055 lines, 187957 words, 1239604 characters, and 2045 entries.
<P>

This version had 24801 lines, 193697 words, 1281402 characters, and
2067 entries.
<P>
Version numbering: Version numbers should be read as
<I>major</I>.<I>minor</I>.<I>revision</I>.  Major version 1 is reserved for the
`old' (ITS) Jargon File, jargon-1.  Major version 2 encompasses
revisions by ESR (Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from GLS (Guy L.
Steele, Jr.) leading up to and including the second paper edition.
From now on, major version number N.00 will probably correspond to the
Nth paper edition.  Usually later versions will either completely
supersede or incorporate earlier versions, so there is generally no
point in keeping old versions around.  <P>
Our thanks to the coauthors of Steele-1983 for oversight and
assistance, and to the hundreds of Usenetters (too many to name here)
who contributed entries and encouragement.  More thanks go to several
of the old-timers on the Usenet group <I><a href="news:alt.folklore.computers">alt.folklore.computers</a></I>,
who contributed much useful commentary and many corrections and
valuable historical perspective: Joseph M. Newcomer

Joe Morris <I><a href="mailto:&#60;jcmorris@mwunix.mitre.org&#62;">&#60;jcmorris@mwunix.mitre.org&#62;</a></I>.  <P>
We were fortunate enough to have the aid of some accomplished
linguists.  David Stampe &#60;stampe@hawaii.edu&#62; and Charles
Hoequist &#60;hoequist@bnr.ca&#62; contributed valuable criticism; Joe Keane
&#60;jgk@osc.osc.com&#62; helped us improve the pronunciation guides.  <P>
A few bits of this text quote previous works.  We are indebted to
Brian A. LaMacchia <I><a href="mailto:&#60;bal@zurich.ai.mit.edu&#62;">&#60;bal@zurich.ai.mit.edu&#62;</a></I> for obtaining permission
for us to use material from the "TMRC Dictionary"; also, Don
Libes <I><a href="mailto:&#60;libes@cme.nist.gov&#62;">&#60;libes@cme.nist.gov&#62;</a></I> contributed some appropriate material from
his excellent book "Life With UNIX".  We thank Per Lindberg
<I><a href="mailto:&#60;per@front.se&#62;">&#60;per@front.se&#62;</a></I>, author of the remarkable Swedish-language 'zine
"Hackerbladet", for bringing "FOO!" comics to our attention
and smuggling one of the IBM hacker underground's own baby jargon
files out to us.  Thanks also to Maarten Litmaath for generously
allowing the inclusion of the ASCII pronunciation guide he formerly
maintained.  And our gratitude to Marc Weiser of XEROX PARC
<I><a href="mailto:&#60;Marc_Weiser.PARC@xerox.com&#62;">&#60;Marc_Weiser.PARC@xerox.com&#62;</a></I> for securing us permission to quote from
PARC's own jargon lexicon and shipping us a copy.  <P>
It is a particular pleasure to acknowledge the major contributions of
Mark Brader <I><a href="mailto:&#60;msb@sq.com&#62;">&#60;msb@sq.com&#62;</a></I> and Steve Summit
<I><a href="mailto:&#60;scs@eskimo.com&#62;">&#60;scs@eskimo.com&#62;</a></I> to the File and Dictionary; they have read
and reread many drafts, checked facts, caught typos, submitted an
amazing number of thoughtful comments, and done yeoman service in
catching typos and minor usage bobbles.  Their rare combination of
enthusiasm, persistence, wide-ranging technical knowledge, and
precisionism in matters of language has been of invaluable help.
Indeed, the sustained volume and quality of Mr. Brader's input over
several years and several different editions has only allowed him to
escape co-editor credit by the slimmest of margins.  <P>
Finally, George V. Reilly <I><a href="mailto:&#60;georgere@microsoft.com&#62;">&#60;georgere@microsoft.com&#62;</a></I> helped with
TeX arcana and painstakingly proofread some 2.7 and 2.8 versions,
and Eric Tiedemann <I><a href="mailto:&#60;est@thyrsus.com&#62;">&#60;est@thyrsus.com&#62;</a></I> contributed sage advice
throughout on rhetoric, amphigory, and philosophunculism.  <P>
