Linguists usually refer to informal language as `slang' and reserve
the term `jargon' for the technical vocabularies of various
occupations.  However, the ancestor of this collection was called the
`Jargon File', and hacker slang is traditionally `the jargon'.  When
talking about the jargon there is therefore no convenient way to
distinguish it from what a <EM>linguist</EM> would call hackers' jargon
--- the formal vocabulary they learn from textbooks, technical papers,
and manuals.  <P>
To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and
the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy,
and shifts over time.  Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider
technical culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do
not speak or recognize hackish slang.  <P>
Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of
usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:<P>
<UL>
<LI>
`slang': informal language from mainstream English or non-technical
subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc).  <P>
<LI>
`jargon': without qualifier, denotes informal `slangy' language
peculiar to or predominantly found among hackers -- the subject of
this lexicon.  <P>
<LI>
`techspeak': the formal technical vocabulary of programming, computer
science, electronics, and other fields connected to hacking.  </UL>
<P>
This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of
this lexicon.  <P>
The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one.  A lot of
techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing
uptake of jargon into techspeak.  On the other hand, a lot of jargon
arises from overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about
this in the  <A HREF="JARGON~4.HTM#SEC4" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_4.html#SEC4">How Jargon Works</A> section below).  <P>
In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicates
primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical
dictionaries, or standards documents.  <P>
A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems, languages,
or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker folklore that
isn't covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey critical
historical background necessary to understand other entries to which
they are cross-referenced.  Some other techspeak senses of jargon
words are listed in order to make the jargon senses clear; where
the text does not specify that a straight technical sense is under
discussion, these are marked with `[techspeak]' as an etymology.  Some
entries have a primary sense marked this way, with subsequent jargon
meanings explained in terms of it.  <P>
We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of
terms.  The results are probably the least reliable information in the
lexicon, for several reasons.  For one thing, it is well known that
many hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple
times, even among the more obscure and intricate neologisms.  It often
seems that the generative processes underlying hackish jargon
formation have an internal logic so powerful as to create substantial
parallelism across separate cultures and even in different languages!
For another, the networks tend to propagate innovations so quickly
that `first use' is often impossible to pin down.  And, finally,
compendia like this one alter what they observe by implicitly stamping
cultural approval on terms and widening their use.  <P>
Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related
oral history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest
quite a number of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due,
and illuminate the early history of many important hackerisms such as

We believe specialist
lexicographers will find many of the historical notes more than
casually instructive.  <P>
