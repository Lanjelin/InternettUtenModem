<H2><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC51" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC51">The Meaning of `Hack'</A></H2>

"The word  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A> doesn't really have 69 different meanings",
according to MIT hacker Phil Agre.  "In fact,  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A> has only one
meaning, an extremely subtle and profound one which defies
articulation.  Which connotation is implied by a given use of the word
depends in similarly profound ways on the context.  Similar remarks
apply to a couple of other hacker words, most notably  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1457" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1457">random</A>."<P>
Hacking might be characterized as `an appropriate application of
ingenuity'.  Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork job or
a carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness
that went into it.  <P>
An important secondary meaning of  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A> is `a creative practical
joke'.  This kind of hack is easier to explain to non-hackers than the
programming kind.  Of course, some hacks have both natures; see the
lexicon entries for  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1429" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1429">pseudo</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG985" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG985">kgbvax</A>.  But here are some
examples of pure practical jokes that illustrate the hacking spirit:<P>

In 1961, students from Caltech (California Institute of Technology, in
Pasadena) hacked the Rose Bowl football game.  One student posed as a
reporter and `interviewed' the director of the University of
Washington card stunts (such stunts involve people in the stands who
hold up colored cards to make pictures).  The reporter learned exactly
how the stunts were operated, and also that the director would be out
to dinner later.  <P>
While the director was eating, the students (who called themselves the
`Fiendish Fourteen') picked a lock and stole a blank direction sheet
for the card stunts.  They then had a printer run off 2300 copies of
the blank.  The next day they picked the lock again and stole the
master plans for the stunts -- large sheets of graph paper colored in
with the stunt pictures.  Using these as a guide, they made new
instructions for three of the stunts on the duplicated blanks.
Finally, they broke in once more, replacing the stolen master plans
and substituting the stack of diddled instruction sheets for the
original set.  <P>
The result was that three of the pictures were totally different.
Instead of `WASHINGTON', the word "CALTECH' was flashed.  Another
stunt showed the word `HUSKIES', the Washington nickname, but
spelled it backwards.  And what was supposed to have been a picture of
a husky instead showed a beaver.  (Both Caltech and MIT use the beaver
--- nature's engineer -- as a mascot.)<P>
After the game, the Washington faculty athletic representative said:
"Some thought it ingenious; others were indignant."  The Washington
student body president remarked: "No hard feelings, but at the time
it was unbelievable.  We were amazed."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is now considered a classic hack, particularly because revising
the direction sheets constituted a form of programming.  <P>
Here is another classic hack:

On November 20, 1982, MIT hacked the Harvard-Yale football game.  Just
after Harvard's second touchdown against Yale, in the first quarter, a
small black ball popped up out of the ground at the 40-yard line, and
grew bigger, and bigger, and bigger.  The letters `MIT' appeared all
over the ball.  As the players and officials stood around gawking, the
ball grew to six feet in diameter and then burst with a bang and a
cloud of white smoke.  <P>
The "Boston Globe" later reported: "If you want to know the truth,
MIT won The Game."<P>
The prank had taken weeks of careful planning by members of MIT's
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.  The device consisted of a weather
balloon, a hydraulic ram powered by Freon gas to lift it out of the
ground, and a vacuum-cleaner motor to inflate it.  They made eight
separate expeditions to Harvard Stadium between 1 and 5 A.M., 
locating an unused 110-volt circuit in the stadium and running buried
wires from the stadium circuit to the 40-yard line, where they buried
the balloon device.  When the time came to activate the device, two
fraternity members had merely to flip a circuit breaker and push a
plug into an outlet.  <P>
This stunt had all the earmarks of a perfect hack: surprise,
publicity, the ingenious use of technology, safety, and harmlessness.
The use of manual control allowed the prank to be timed so as not to
disrupt the game (it was set off between plays, so the outcome of the
game would not be unduly affected).  The perpetrators had even
thoughtfully attached a note to the balloon explaining that the device
was not dangerous and contained no explosives.  <P>
Harvard president Derek Bok commented: "They have an awful lot of
clever people down there at MIT, and they did it again."  President
Paul E. Gray of MIT said: "There is absolutely no truth to the rumor
that I had anything to do with it, but I wish there were."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The hacks above are verifiable history; they can be proved to have
happened.  Many other classic-hack stories from MIT and elsewhere,
though retold as history, have the characteristics of what Jan
Brunvand has called `urban folklore' (see  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG665" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG665">FOAF</A>).  Perhaps the
best known of these is the legend of the infamous trolley-car hack, an
alleged incident in which engineering students are said to have welded
a trolley car to its tracks with thermite.  Numerous versions of this
have been recorded from the 1940s to the present, most set at MIT but
at least one very detailed version set at CMU.  <P>
Brian Leibowitz has researched MIT hacks both real and mythical
extensively; the interested reader is referred to his delightful
pictorial compendium "The Journal of the Institute for Hacks,
Tomfoolery, and Pranks" (MIT Museum, 1990; ISBN 0-917027-03-5).  
The Institute has a World Wide Web page at

Finally, here is a story about one of the classic computer hacks.  <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
discovered a relatively simple way to crack system security on the
Xerox CP-V timesharing system.  Through a simple programming strategy,
it was possible for a user program to trick the system into running a
portion of the program in `master mode' (supervisor state), in which
memory protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large
value into its `privilege level' byte (normally write-protected) and
could then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the
file-management system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous
other interesting things.  In short, the barn door was wide open.  <P>
Motorola quite properly reported this problem to Xerox via an official
`level 1 SIDR' (a bug report with an intended urgency of `needs to be
fixed yesterday').  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola
followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
`Security SIDR', and attached all of the necessary documentation,
ways-to-reproduce, etc.  <P>
The CP-V people at Xerox sat on their thumbs; they either didn't
realize the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official
patch.  <P>
Months passed.  The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox field-support
rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take direct action, to
demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the system could be
cracked and just how thoroughly the security safeguards could be
subverted.  <P>
They dug around in the operating-system listings and devised a
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
incorporated into a pair of programs called `Robin Hood' and `Friar
Tuck'.  Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as `ghost jobs'
(daemons, in Unix terminology); they would use the existing loophole
to subvert system security, install the necessary patches, and then
keep an eye on one another's statuses in order to keep the system
operator (in effect, the superuser) from aborting them.  <P>
One fine day, the system operator on the main CP-V software
development system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual
phenomena.  These included the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
job.  <LI>
Disk drives would seek back and forth so rapidly that they would attempt
to walk across the floor (see  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1930" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1930">walking drives</A>).  <LI>
The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself and
punch a  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1007" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1007">lace card</A>.  These would usually jam in the punch.  <LI>
The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.  <LI>
The Xerox card reader had two output stackers; it could be instructed
to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A (unless a card was
unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into stacker B).  One
of the patches installed by the ghosts added some code to the
card-reader driver... after reading a card, it would flip over to
the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide themselves
in half when they were read, leaving the operator to recollate them
manually.  </UL>
<P>
Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.
They found the bandit ghost jobs running, and  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG816" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG816">gun</A>ned them...
and were once again surprised.  When Robin Hood was gunned, the
following sequence of events took place:<P>
<PRE>
!X id1

id1: Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!
id1: Off (aborted)

id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff
     of Nottingham's men!

id1: Thank you, my good fellow!
</PRE>
<P>
Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed,
and would start a new copy of the recently slain program within a few
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.  <P>
Finally, the system programmers did the latter -- only to find
that the bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It
turned out that these two programs had patched the boot-time OS image
(the kernel file, in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list
of programs that were to be started at boot time (this is similar to
the way MS-DOS viruses propagate).  <P>
The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and
reinstalled the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch
for this problem.  <P>
It is alleged that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management
about the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.
It is not recorded that any serious disciplinary action was taken
against either of them.
