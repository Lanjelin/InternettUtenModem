<A NAME=TAG242><B>C</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. The third letter of the English alphabet.  2. ASCII
   1000011.  3. The name of a programming language designed by Dennis
   Ritchie during the early 1970s and immediately used to reimplement
    <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A>; so called because many features derived from an earlier
   compiler named `B' in commemoration of <EM>its</EM> parent, BCPL.
   (BCPL was in turn descended from an earlier Algol-derived language,
   CPL.)  Before Bjarne Stroustrup settled the question by designing
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG244" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG244">C++</A>, there was a humorous debate over whether C's successor should
   be named `D' or `P'.  C became immensely popular outside Bell Labs
   after about 1980 and is now the dominant language in systems and
   microcomputer applications programming.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1010" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1010">languages of choice</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG934" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG934">indent style</A>.
<P>
   C is often described, with a mixture of fondness and disdain
   varying according to the speaker, as "a language that combines
   all the elegance and power of assembly language with all the
   readability and maintainability of assembly language".  <P>
<A NAME=TAG243><B>C Programmer's Disease</B></A> /n./ <P> The tendency of the undisciplined
   C programmer to set arbitrary but supposedly generous static limits
   on table sizes (defined, if you're lucky, by constants in header
   files) rather than taking the trouble to do proper dynamic storage
   allocation.  If an application user later needs to put 68 elements
   into a table of size 50, the afflicted programmer reasons that he
   or she can easily reset the table size to 68 (or even as much as
   70, to allow for future expansion) and recompile.  This gives the
   programmer the comfortable feeling of having made the effort to
   satisfy the user's (unreasonable) demands, and often affords the
   user multiple opportunities to explore the marvelous consequences
   of  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG585" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG585">fandango on core</A>.  In severe cases of the disease, the
   programmer cannot comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only
   to further disgruntle the user.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG244><B>C++</B></A> /C'-pluhs-pluhs/ /n./ <P> Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup
   of AT&#38;T Bell Labs as a successor to  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG242" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG242">C</A>.  Now one of the
    <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1010" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1010">languages of choice</A>, although many hackers still grumble that
   it is the successor to either Algol 68 or  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG8" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG8">Ada</A> (depending on
   generation), and a prime example of  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1571" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1571">second-system effect</A>.
   Almost anything that can be done in any language can be done in
   C++, but it requires a  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1009" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1009">language lawyer</A> to know what is and
   what is not legal-- the design is <EM>almost</EM> too large to hold
   in even hackers' heads.  Much of the  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG390" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG390">cruft</A> results from C++'s
   attempt to be backward compatible with C.  Stroustrup himself has
   said in his retrospective book "The Design and Evolution of
   C++" (p. 207), "Within C++, there is a much smaller and cleaner
   language struggling to get out."  [Many hackers would now add
   "Yes, and it's called Java" --ESR] <P>
<A NAME=TAG245><B>calculator</B></A> [Cambridge] /n./ <P> Syn. for  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG124" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG124">bitty box</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG246><B>Camel Book</B></A> /n./ <P> Universally recognized nickname for the book
   "Programming Perl", by Larry Wall and Randal L. Schwartz,
   O'Reilly Associates 1991, ISBN 0-937175-64-1.  The definitive
   reference on  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1353" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1353">Perl</A>. <P>
<A NAME=TAG247><B>can</B></A> /vt./ <P> To abort a job on a time-sharing system.  Used
   esp. when the person doing the deed is an operator, as in
   "canned from the  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG332" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG332">console</A>".  Frequently used in an imperative
   sense, as in "Can that print job, the LPT just popped a
   sprocket!"  Synonymous with  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG816" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG816">gun</A>.  It is said that the ASCII
   character with mnemonic CAN (0011000) was used as a kill-job
   character on some early OSes.  Alternatively, this term may derive
   from mainstream slang `canned' for being laid off or fired.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG248><B>can't happen</B></A> <P> The traditional program comment for code
   executed under a condition that should never be true, for example a
   file size computed as negative.  Often, such a condition being true
   indicates data corruption or a faulty algorithm; it is almost
   always handled by emitting a fatal error message and terminating or
   crashing, since there is little else that can be done.  Some case
   variant of "can't happen" is also often the text emitted if the
   `impossible' error actually happens!  Although "can't happen"
   events are genuinely infrequent in production code, programmers
   wise enough to check for them habitually are often surprised at how
   frequently they are triggered during development and how many
   headaches checking for them turns out to head off. See also
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG629" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG629">firewall code</A> (sense 2).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG249><B>candygrammar</B></A> /n./ <P> A programming-language grammar that is
   mostly  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1737" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1737">syntactic sugar</A>; the term is also a play on
   `candygram'.   <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG303" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG303">COBOL</A>, Apple's Hypertalk language, and a lot
   of the so-called `4GL' database languages share this property.
   The usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as
   possible, on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled
   people to program.  This intention comes to grief on the reality
   that syntax isn't what makes programming hard; it's the mental
   effort and organization required to specify an algorithm precisely
   that costs.  Thus the invariable result is that `candygrammar'
   languages are just as difficult to program in as terser ones, and
   far more painful for the experienced hacker.  <P>
   [The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
   should not be overlooked.  This was a "Jaws" parody.
   Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus
   ways to get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in
   the background.  The last attempt is a half-hearted "Candygram!"
   When the door is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor
   occupant.  There is a moral here for those attracted to
   candygrammars.  Note that, in many circles, pretty much the same
   ones who remember Monty Python sketches, all it takes is the word
   "Candygram!", suitably timed, to get people rolling on the
   floor. -- GLS]
<P>
<A NAME=TAG250><B>canonical</B></A> /adj./ <P> [historically, `according to religious law']
   The usual or standard state or manner of something.  This word has
   a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics.  Two formulas
   such as @Math{9 + x} and @Math{x + 9} are said to be equivalent
   because they mean the same thing, but the second one is in
   `canonical form' because it is written in the usual way, with the
   highest power of @Math{x} first.  Usually there are fixed rules you
   can use to decide whether something is in canonical form.  The
   jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its
   present loading in computer-science culture largely through its
   prominence in Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and
   mathematical logic (see  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG1003" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG1003">Knights of the Lambda Calculus</A>).
   Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1891" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1891">vanilla</A>.  <P>
   Non-technical academics do not use the adjective `canonical' in
   any of the senses defined above with any regularity; they do
   however use the nouns `canon' and `canonicity' (not
   **canonicalness or **canonicality). The `canon' of a given author
   is the complete body of authentic works by that author (this usage
   is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as to literary
   scholars).  `<EM>The</EM> canon' is the body of works in a given
   field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed
   worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate. <P>
   The word `canon' has an interesting history.  It derives
   ultimately from the Greek
   (akin to the English `cane') referring to a reed.  Reeds were used
   for measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word `canon'
   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of
   scriptures within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a
   rule for the religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages
   stem from this instance of a defined and accepted body of work.
   Alongside this usage was the promulgation of `canons' (`rules')
   for the government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages
   ("according to religious law") derive from this use of the Latin
   `canon'.  <P>
   Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob
   Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the
   incessant use of jargon.  Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS
   made a point of using as much of it as possible in his presence,
   and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally, in one conversation,
   he used the word `canonical' in jargon-like fashion without
   thinking.  Steele: "Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon
   too!"  Stallman: "What did he say?"  Steele: "Bob just used
   `canonical' in the canonical way."  <P>
   Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
   defined as the way <EM>hackers</EM> normally expect things to be.
   Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that `according to
   religious law' is <EM>not</EM> the canonical meaning of
   `canonical'.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG253><B>cargo cult programming</B></A> /n./ <P> A style of (incompetent)
   programming dominated by ritual inclusion of code or program
   structures that serve no real purpose.  A cargo cult programmer
   will usually explain the extra code as a way of working around some
   bug encountered in the past, but usually neither the bug nor the
   reason the code apparently avoided the bug was ever fully
   understood (compare  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1600" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1600">shotgun debugging</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1921" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1921">voodoo programming</A>).
<P>
   The term `cargo cult' is a reference to aboriginal religions that
   grew up in the South Pacific after World War II.  The practices of
   these cults center on building elaborate mockups of airplanes and
   military style landing strips in the hope of bringing the return of
   the god-like airplanes that brought such marvelous cargo during the
   war.  Hackish usage probably derives from Richard Feynman's
   characterization of certain practices as "cargo cult science" in
   his book "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" (W. W. Norton
   &#38; Co, New York 1985, ISBN 0-393-01921-7).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG254><B>cascade</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A huge volume of spurious error-message
   output produced by a compiler with poor error recovery.  Too
   frequently, one trivial syntax error (such as a missing `)' or
   `}') throws the parser out of synch so that much of the remaining
   program text is interpreted as garbaged or ill-formed.  2. A chain
   of Usenet followups, each adding some trivial variation or riposte
   to the text of the previous one, all of which is reproduced in the

   existing feature and pasting it in with minor changes.  Common in
   telephony circles because most operations in a telephone switch are
   selected using <CODE>case</CODE> statements.  Leads to  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1657" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1657">software bloat</A>.
<P>
   In some circles of EMACS users this is called `programming by
   Meta-W', because Meta-W is the EMACS command for copying a block of
   text to a kill buffer in preparation to pasting it in elsewhere.
   The term is condescending, implying that the programmer is acting
   mindlessly rather than thinking carefully about what is required to
   integrate the code for two similar cases.  <P>
   At DEC, this is sometimes called `clone-and-hack' coding.

   another synonym for `broken' or `down'.  Usually connotes a
   major failure.  A system (hardware or software) which is `down'
   may be already being restarted before the failure is noticed,
   whereas one which is `casters up' is usually a good excuse to
   take the rest of the day off (as long as you're not responsible for
   fixing it).  <P>

   A correspondent from England tells us that one of ICL's most
   talented systems designers used to be called out occasionally to
   service machines which the  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG611" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG611">field circus</A> had given up on.
   Since he knew the design inside out, he could often find faults
   simply by listening to a quick outline of the symptoms.  He used to
   play on this by going to some site where the field circus had just
   spent the last two weeks solid trying to find a fault, and
   spreading a diagram of the system out on a table top.  He'd then
   shake some chicken bones and cast them over the diagram, peer at
   the bones intently for a minute, and then tell them that a certain
   module needed replacing.  The system would start working again
   immediately upon the replacement. <P>

   but works with any sort of data.  <P>
   Among Unix haters, <CODE>cat(1)</CODE> is considered the  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG250" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG250">canonical</A>
   example of <EM>bad</EM> user-interface design, because of its

<A NAME=TAG261><B>CDA</B></A> /C-D-A/ <P>  The "Communications Decency Act" of 1996,

   telecommunications reform bill. The CDA made it a federal crime in
   the USA to send a communication which is "obscene,
   lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse,
   threaten, or harass another person." It also threatens with
   imprisonment anyone who "knowingly" makes accessible to minors
   any message that "describes, in terms patently offensive as
   measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
   activities or organs".   
   While the CDA was sold as a measure to protect minors from the
   putative evils of pornography, the repressive political aims of the
   bill were laid bare by the Hyde amendment, which intended to
   outlaw discussion of abortion on the Internet. <P>
   To say that this direct attack on First Amendment free-speech
   rights was not well received on the Internet would be putting it

    <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG900" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG900">home page</A>s black for 48 hours.  Several civil-rights groups
   and computing/telecommunications companies sought an immediate
   injunction to block enforcement of the CDA pending a constitutional
   challenge.  This injunction was granted on the likelihood that
   plaintiffs would prevail on the merits of the case.  At time of
   writing (Spring 1996), the fate of the CDA, and its effect on the
   Internet, is still unknown. See also  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG576" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG576">Exon</A>. <P>

<A NAME=TAG262><B>cdr</B></A> /ku'dr/ or /kuh'dr/ /vt./ <P> [from LISP] To skip past
   the first item from a list of things (generalized from the LISP
   operation on binary tree structures, which returns a list
   consisting of all but the first element of its argument).  In the
   form `cdr down', to trace down a list of elements: "Shall we cdr
   down the agenda?"  Usage: silly.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1063" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1063">loop through</A>.
<P>
   Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 704 that hosted
   the original LISP implementation featured two 15-bit fields called
   the `address' and `decrement' parts.  The term `cdr' was originally
   `Contents of Decrement part of Register'.  Similarly, `car' stood
   for `Contents of Address part of Register'.
<P>
   The cdr and car operations have since become bases for
   formation of compound metaphors in non-LISP contexts.  GLS recalls,
   for example, a programming project in which strings were
   represented as linked lists; the get-character and skip-character
   operations were of course called CHAR and CHDR.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG263><B>chad</B></A> /chad/ /n./ <P> 1. The perforated edge strips on printer

   Also called  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1581" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1581">selvage</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1351" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1351">perf</A>.  2. obs. The confetti-like
   paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape; this has also been
   called `chaff', `computer confetti', and `keypunch
   droppings'.  This use may now be mainstream; it has been reported
   seen (1993) in directions for a card-based voting machine in
   California. <P>
   Historical note: One correspondent believes `chad' (sense 2)
   derives from the Chadless keypunch (named for its inventor), which
   cut little u-shaped tabs in the card to make a hole when the tab
   folded back, rather than punching out a circle/rectangle; it was
   clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make them, then the
   stuff that other keypunches made had to be `chad'.  There is a
   legend that the word was originally acronymic, standing for
   "Card Hole Aggregate Debris", but this has all the earmarks of
   a bogus folk etymology.  <P>

   of the parent program is lost and there is no returning to it.
   Though this facility used to be common on memory-limited micros and
   is still widely supported for backward compatibility, the jargon
   usage is semi-obsolescent; in particular, most Unix programmers

   operating system or application.  `Chain rattling' is the process
   of repeatedly running through the linked data areas searching for
   one which is of interest to the executing program.  The implication
   is that there is a very large number of links on the chain.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG266><B>channel</B></A> /n./ <P> [IRC] The basic unit of discussion on  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG952" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG952">IRC</A>.
   Once one joins a channel, everything one types is read by others on
   that channel.  Channels are named with strings that begin with a
   `#' sign and can have topic descriptions (which are generally
   irrelevant to the actual subject of discussion).  Some notable
   channels are <CODE>#initgame</CODE>, <CODE>#hottub</CODE>, and <CODE>#report</CODE>.
   At times of international crisis, <CODE>#report</CODE> has hundreds of
   members, some of whom take turns listening to various news services
   and typing in summaries of the news, or in some cases, giving
   first-hand accounts of the action (e.g., Scud missile attacks in
   Tel Aviv during the Gulf War in 1991).

<A NAME=TAG273><B>chawmp</B></A> /n./ <P> [University of Florida] 16 or 18 bits (half of a
   machine word).  This term was used by FORTH hackers during the late
   1970s/early 1980s; it is said to have been archaic then, and may
   now be obsolete.  It was coined in revolt against the promiscuous
   use of `word' for anything between 16 and 32 bits; `word' has
   an additional special meaning for FORTH hacks that made the
   overloading intolerable.  For similar reasons, /gaw'bl/ (spelled
   `gawble' or possibly `gawbul') was in use as a term for 32 or
   48 bits (presumably a full machine word, but our sources are
   unclear on this).  These terms are more easily understood if one
   thinks of them as faithful phonetic spellings of `chomp' and
   `gobble' pronounced in a Florida or other Southern U.S. dialect.

<A NAME=TAG274><B>check</B></A> /n./ <P> A hardware-detected error condition, most commonly

   a hardware-detected parity error.  Recorded here because the word
   often humorously extended to non-technical problems. For example,
   the term `child check' has been used to refer to the problems
   caused by a small child who is curious to know what happens when
   s/he presses all the cute buttons on a computer's console (of

   a mutant with below-average intelligence.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG279><B>chiclet keyboard</B></A> /n./ <P> A keyboard with a small, flat
   rectangular or lozenge-shaped rubber or plastic keys that look like
   pieces of chewing gum.  (Chiclets is the brand name of a variety of
   chewing gum that does in fact resemble the keys of chiclet
   keyboards.)  Used esp. to describe the original IBM PCjr
   keyboard.  Vendors unanimously liked these because they were cheap,
   and a lot of early portable and laptop products got launched using
   them.  Customers rejected the idea with almost equal unanimity, and
   chiclets are not often seen on anything larger than a digital watch
   any more.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG280><B>chine nual</B></A> /sheen'yu-*l/ /n. obs./ <P> [MIT] The LISP Machine

   term is alleged to have been inherited through 1960s underground
   comics, and to have been recently sighted in the Beavis and
   Butthead cartoons.  Speakers of the Hindi, Bengali and Gujarati
   languages have confirmed that `choad' is in fact an Indian
   vernacular word equivalent to `fuck'; it is therefore likely to
   have entered English slang via the British Raj. <P>

   A hand gesture commonly accompanies this.  To perform it, hold the
   four fingers together and place the thumb against their tips.  Now
   open and close your hand rapidly to suggest a biting action (much
   like what Pac-Man does in the classic video game, though this
   pantomime seems to predate that).  The gesture alone means `chomp
   chomp' (see " <A HREF="JARGON~6.HTM#SEC6" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_5.html#SEC6">Verb Doubling</A>" in the " <A HREF="JARGON~4.HTM#SEC4" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_4.html#SEC4">How Jargon Works</A>" section of the Prependices).  The hand may be
   pointed at the object of complaint, and for real emphasis you can
   use both hands at once.  Doing this to a person is equivalent to
   saying "You chomper!"  If you point the gesture at yourself, it
   is a humble but humorous admission of some failure.  You might do
   this if someone told you that a program you had written had failed
   in some surprising way and you felt dumb for not having anticipated
   it.  <P>

   generally corresponds to one clock pulse in the processor's timing.
   The relative execution times of instructions on a machine are
   usually discussed in clocks rather than absolute fractions of a

   models of the machine may increase as technology improves, and it
   is usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing
   the instruction set.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG408" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG408">cycle</A>.  <P>

   documentation or by reverse-engineering.  Also connotes lower
   price.  2. A shoddy, spurious copy: "Their product is a clone of
   our product."  3. A blatant ripoff, most likely violating
   copyright, patent, or trade secret protections: "Your product is a
   clone of my product."  This use implies legal action is pending.
   4. `PC clone:' a PC-BUS/ISA or EISA-compatible 80x86-based
   microcomputer (this use is sometimes spelled `klone' or
   `PClone').  These invariably have much more bang for the buck
   than the IBM archetypes they resemble.  5. In the construction
   `Unix clone': An OS designed to deliver a Unix-lookalike
   environment without Unix license fees, or with additional
   `mission-critical' features such as support for real-time
   programming.  6. /v./ To make an exact copy of something.  "Let me

<A NAME=TAG309><B>codewalker</B></A> /n./ <P> A program component that traverses other

   ends; so do cross-reference generators and some database front
   ends.  Other utility programs that try to do too much with source
   code may turn into codewalkers.  As in "This new <CODE>vgrind</CODE>
   feature would require a codewalker to implement." <P>
<A NAME=TAG310><B>coefficient of X</B></A> /n./ <P> Hackish speech makes heavy use of
   pseudo-mathematical metaphors.  Four particularly important
   ones involve the terms `coefficient', `factor', `index', and
   `quotient'.  They are often loosely applied to things you cannot
   really be quantitative about, but there are subtle distinctions
   among them that convey information about the way the speaker
   mentally models whatever he or she is describing.  <P>
   `Foo factor' and `foo quotient' tend to describe something for
   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical
   example is  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG715" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG715">fudge factor</A>.  It's not important how much you're
   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.
   You might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.
   Quotient tends to imply that the property is a ratio of two
   opposing factors: "I would have won except for my luck quotient."
   This could also be "I would have won except for the luck factor",
   but using <EM>quotient</EM> emphasizes that it was bad luck
   overpowering good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering
   your own).  <P>
   `Foo index' and `coefficient of foo' both tend to imply
   that foo is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that
   can be larger or smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or
   person as having a `high bogosity index', whereas you would be less
   likely to speak of a `high bogosity factor'.  `Foo index' suggests
   that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane
   cost-of-living index; `coefficient of foo' suggests that foo is a
   fundamental quantity, as in a coefficient of friction.  The choice
   between these terms is often one of personal preference; e.g., some
   people might feel that bogosity is a fundamental attribute and thus
   say `coefficient of bogosity', whereas others might feel it is a
   combination of factors and thus say `bogosity index'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG311><B>cokebottle</B></A> /kohk'bot-l/ /n./ <P> Any very unusual character,
   particularly one you can't type because it it isn't on your
   keyboard.  MIT people used to complain about the
   `control-meta-cokebottle' commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
   complained right back about the ` <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG25" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG25">altmode</A>-altmode-cokebottle'
   commands at MIT.  After the demise of the  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1667" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1667">space-cadet keyboard</A>, `cokebottle' faded away as serious usage, but was
   often invoked humorously to describe an (unspecified) weird or
   non-intuitive keystroke command.  It may be due for a second
   inning, however.  The OSF/Motif window manager, <CODE>mwm(1)</CODE>, has
   a reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of
   keybindings and behavior.  This keystroke is (believe it or not)
   `control-meta-bang' (see  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG69" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG69">bang</A>).  Since the exclamation point
   looks a lot like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif hackers have
   begun referring to this keystroke as `cokebottle'.  See also

<A NAME=TAG313><B>COME FROM</B></A> /n./ <P> A semi-mythical language construct dual to the
   `go to'; <CODE>COME FROM</CODE> &#60;label&#62; would cause the referenced label
   to act as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever reached
   it control would quietly and  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG49" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG49">automagically</A> be transferred to
   the statement following the <CODE>COME FROM</CODE>.  <CODE>COME FROM</CODE>
   was first proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's "A Linguistic
   Contribution to GOTO-less programming", which appeared in a 1973
    <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG420" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG420">Datamation</A> issue (and was reprinted in the April 1984 issue of
   "Communications of the ACM").  This parodied the then-raging
   `structured programming'  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG897">holy wars</A> (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG331" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG331">considered harmful</A>).  Mythically, some variants are the `assigned COME
   FROM' and the `computed COME FROM' (parodying some nasty control
   constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,
   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having
   more than one <CODE>COME FROM</CODE> statement coming from the same
   label.  <P>
   In some ways the FORTRAN <CODE>DO</CODE> looks like a <CODE>COME FROM</CODE>
   statement.  After the terminating statement number/<CODE>CONTINUE</CODE>
   is reached, control continues at the statement following the DO.
   Some generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than
   <CODE>CONTINUE</CODE>) for the statement, leading to examples like:
<P>
<PRE>
      DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the
C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...
      WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)
 10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)
</PRE>
<P>
   in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.
   (This is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear
   to have anything to do with the flow of control at all!)
<P>
   While sufficiently astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this
   form of <CODE>COME FROM</CODE> statement isn't completely general.  After
   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN,
   ca. 1975 (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040
   ten years earlier).  The statement <CODE>AT 100</CODE> would perform a
   <CODE>COME FROM 100</CODE>.  It was intended strictly as a debugging aid,
   with dire consequences promised to anyone so deranged as to use it
   in production code.  More horrible things had already been
   perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
   contemplate the <CODE>ALTER</CODE> verb in  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG303" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG303">COBOL</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG324><B>computron</B></A> /kom'pyoo-tron`/ <P> /n./ 1. A notional unit of
   computing power combining instruction speed and storage capacity,
   dimensioned roughly in instructions-per-second times
   megabytes-of-main-store times megabytes-of-mass-storage.  "That
   machine can't run GNU Emacs, it doesn't have enough computrons!"
   This usage is usually found in metaphors that treat computing power
   as a fungible commodity good, like a crop yield or diesel
   horsepower.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG124" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG124">bitty box</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG747" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG747">Get a real computer!</A>,

   the unit quantity of computation or information, in much the same
   way that an electron bears one unit of electric charge (see also
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG167" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG167">bogon</A>).  An elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons
   has been developed based on the physical fact that the molecules in
   a solid object move more rapidly as it is heated.  It is argued
   that an object melts because the molecules have lost their
   information about where they are supposed to be (that is, they have
   emitted computrons).  This explains why computers get so hot and
   require air conditioning; they use up computrons.  Conversely, it
   should be possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path
   of a computron beam.  It is believed that this may also explain why
   machines that work at the factory fail in the computer room: the
   computrons there have been all used up by the other hardware.
   (This theory probably owes something to the "Warlock" stories
   by Larry Niven, the best known being "What Good is a Glass
   Dagger?", in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural
   resource called `mana'.) <P>

   manufacturers (or, by extension, programmers or purveyors of
   anything) to come up with new products that don't fit together with
   the old stuff, thereby making you buy either all new stuff or

   they are stuck with dying, obsolescent disk and tape drives with
   low capacity and high power requirements.  <P>
   (A closely related phenomenon, with a slightly different intent, is

   `dot-pair' or two-branched tree with one object hanging from each

<A NAME=TAG331><B>considered harmful</B></A> /adj./ <P> Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the

   Amusingly, the ACM considered the resulting acrimony sufficiently
   harmful that it will (by policy) no longer print an article taking
   so assertive a position against a coding practice.  In the ensuing
   decades, a large number of both serious papers and parodies have
   borne titles of the form "X considered Y".  The
   structured-programming wars eventually blew over with the
   realization that both sides were wrong, but use of such titles has
   remained as a persistent minor in-joke (the `considered silly'

   Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not

   was cosmic rays.  So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe,
   using 25 tons of the stuff, and used two identical boards for
   testing.  One was placed in the safe, one outside.  The hypothesis
   was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit drops, they should see
   a statistically significant difference between the error rates on
   the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.  Further
   investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser
   degree uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is
   impossible to eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly
   distributed through the earth's crust, with the statistically
   insignificant exception of uranium lodes) it became obvious that

   peaceful denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers).  This rather
   transparent allegory featured many references to  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG11">ADVENT</A> and
   the immortal line "Eat flaming death, minicomputer mongrels!"
   (uttered, of course, by an IPM stormtrooper).  It is alleged that
   the author subsequently received a letter of appreciation on IBM
   company stationery from the head of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
   Laboratories (then, as now, one of the few islands of true
   hackerdom in the IBM archipelago).  The lower loop of the B in the
   IBM logo, it is said, had been carefully whited out.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG536" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG536">eat flaming death</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG365><B>cracker</B></A> /n./ <P> One who breaks security on a system.  Coined
   ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of
    <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG833" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG833">hacker</A> (q.v., sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish
   `worm' in this sense around 1981--82 on Usenet was largely a
   failure.  <P>
   Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against
   the theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings.  While it is
   expected that any real hacker will have done some playful cracking
   and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1011" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1011">larval stage</A> is expected to have outgrown the desire to do so except for
   immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if it's
   necessary to get around some security in order to get some work
   done).  <P>
   Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom
   than the  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1196" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1196">mundane</A> reader misled by sensationalistic journalism
   might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit, very
   secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to
   describe <EM>themselves</EM> as hackers, most true hackers consider
   them a separate and lower form of life.  <P>
   Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than
   breaking into someone else's has to be pretty  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1069" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1069">losing</A>.  Some

   what a  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG365" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG365">cracker</A> does.  Contrary to widespread myth, this does
   not usually involve some mysterious leap of hackerly brilliance,
   but rather persistence and the dogged repetition of a handful of
   fairly well-known tricks that exploit common weaknesses in the
   security of target systems.  Accordingly, most crackers are only
   mediocre hackers.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG367><B>crank</B></A> /vt./ <P> [from automotive slang] Verb used to describe the

   of abuse used to describe TeX and LaTeX when they don't work (when
   used by TeXhackers), or all the time (by everyone else).  The
   non-TeX-enthusiasts generally dislike it because it is more verbose
   than other formatters (e.g.  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1837" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1837">troff</A>) and because (particularly

<A NAME=TAG369><B>crash</B></A> <P> 1. /n./ A sudden, usually drastic failure.  Most often

   read/write heads dropping onto the surface of the disks and
   scraping off the oxide may also be referred to as a `head crash',
   whereas the term `system crash' usually, though not always,
   implies that the operating system or other software was at fault.
   2. /v./ To fail suddenly.  "Has the system just crashed?"

   The term is actually the lowercased last name of Seymour Cray, a

<A NAME=TAG373><B>cray instability</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A shortcoming of a program or

   run on a powerful machine (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG372" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG372">cray</A>).  Generally more subtle
   than bugs that can be detected in smaller problems running on a
   workstation or mini.  2. More specifically, a shortcoming of
   algorithms which are well behaved when run on gentle floating point
   hardware (such as IEEE-standard or DEC) but which break down badly
   when exposed to a Cray's unique `rounding' rules. <P>
<A NAME=TAG374><B>crayola</B></A> /kray-oh'l*/ /n./ <P> A super-mini or -micro computer

<P>
<A NAME=TAG376><B>crayon</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. Someone who works on Cray supercomputers.
   More specifically, it implies a programmer, probably of the CDC
   ilk, probably male, and almost certainly wearing a tie
   (irrespective of gender).  Systems types who have a Unix background
   tend not to be described as crayons.  2. A  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG324" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG324">computron</A> (sense 2)

   computational power equal to that of a single Cray-1.  There is a
   standard joke about this usage that derives from an old Crayola
   crayon promotional gimmick: When you buy 64 crayons you get a free
   sharpener.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG377><B>creationism</B></A> /n./ <P> The (false) belief that large, innovative
   software designs can be completely specified in advance and then
   painlessly magicked out of the void by the normal efforts of a team
   of normally talented programmers.  In fact, experience has shown
   repeatedly that good designs arise only from evolutionary,
   exploratory interaction between one (or at most a small handful of)
   exceptionally able designer(s) and an active user population ---
   and that the first try at a big new idea is always wrong.
   Unfortunately, because these truths don't fit the planning models
   beloved of  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1101" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1101">management</A>, they are generally ignored.  <P>

   always been creeping featurism."  2. More generally, the tendency
   for anything complicated to become even more complicated because
   people keep saying "Gee, it would be even better if it had this
   feature too".  (See  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG597" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG597">feature</A>.)  The result is usually a
   patchwork because it grew one ad-hoc step at a time, rather than
   being planned.  Planning is a lot of work, but it's easy to add
   just one extra little feature to help someone ... and then
   another ... and another.... When creeping featurism gets
   out of hand, it's like a cancer.  Usually this term is used to
   describe computer programs, but it could also be said of the
   federal government, the IRS 1040 form, and new cars.  A similar
   phenomenon sometimes afflicts conscious redesigns; see

   An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX

   upgrade, you buy a complete 486DX chip with <EM>working</EM>
   co-processor (its identity thinly veiled by a different pinout) and
   plug it into the board's expansion socket.  It then disables the
   SX, which becomes a fancy power sink.  Don't you love Intel? <P>

<A NAME=TAG387><B>crock</B></A> /n./ <P> [from the American scatologism `crock of shit']
   1. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to be

   codes without the program interpreting them to the user (as in, for
   example, Unix <CODE>make(1)</CODE>, which returns code 139 for a process
   that dies due to  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1575" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1575">segfault</A>).  2. A technique that works
   acceptably, but which is quite prone to failure if disturbed in the
   least.  For example, a too-clever programmer might write an
   assembler which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric opcodes
   algorithmically, a trick which depends far too intimately on the
   particular bit patterns of the opcodes.  (For another example of

   All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete

   portions of the wax overlay on a silk screen.  More directly,

<A NAME=TAG406><B>cyberpunk</B></A> /si:'ber-puhnk/ /n.,adj./ <P> [orig. by SF writer
   Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A subgenre of SF
   launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
   "Neuromancer" (though its roots go back through Vernor Vinge's
   "True Names" (see the  <A HREF="JARGO~72.HTM#SEC77" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_70.html#SEC77">Bibliography</A> in Appendix C) to
   John Brunner's 1975 novel "The Shockwave Rider").  Gibson's
   near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker
   culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and
   hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both
   irritatingly na&iuml;ve and tremendously stimulating.  Gibson's work
   was widely imitated, in particular by the short-lived but
   innovative "Max Headroom" TV series.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG407" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG407">cyberspace</A>,

   Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or
   fashion trend that calls itself `cyberpunk', associated especially
   with the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about
   this.  On the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to
   be shallow trendoids in black leather who have substituted
   enthusiastic blathering about technology for actually learning and
   <EM>doing</EM> it.  Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the
   other hand, at least cyberpunks are excited about the right things
   and properly respectful of hacking talent in those who have it.
   The general consensus is to tolerate them politely in hopes that
   they'll attract people who grow into being true hackers.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG407><B>cyberspace</B></A> /si:'br-spays`/ /n./ <P> 1. Notional

   characteristic prop of  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG406" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG406">cyberpunk</A> SF.  Serious efforts to

   Gibsonian cyberspace are under way, using more conventional devices
   such as glove sensors and binocular TV headsets.  Few hackers are
   prepared to deny outright the possibility of a cyberspace someday
   evolving out of the network (see  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1242" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1242">network, the</A>).  2. The

   crude cyberspace (sense 1).  Although this usage became widely
   popular in the mainstream press during 1994 when the Internet
   exploded into public awareness, it is strongly deprecated among
   hackers because the Internet does not meet the high, SF-inspired
   standards they have for true cyberspace technology. Thus, this use
   of the term usually tags a  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1937" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1937">wannabee</A> or outsider.

   imagery when in hack mode; interestingly, independent reports from
   multiple sources suggest that there are common features to the
   experience.  In particular, the dominant colors of this subjective
   `cyberspace' are often gray and silver, and the imagery often
   involves constellations of marching dots, elaborate shifting
   patterns of lines and angles, or moire patterns.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG408><B>cycle</B></A> <P> 1. /n./ The basic unit of computation.  What every
   hacker wants more of (noted hacker Bill Gosper describes himself as
   a "cycle junkie"). One can describe an instruction as taking so
   many `clock cycles'.  Often the computer can access its memory
   once on every clock cycle, and so one speaks also of `memory
   cycles'.  These are technical meanings of  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG408" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG408">cycle</A>.  The jargon
   meaning comes from the observation that there are only so many
   cycles per second, and when you are sharing a computer the cycles
   get divided up among the users.  The more cycles the computer
   spends working on your program rather than someone else's, the
   faster your program will run.  That's why every hacker wants more
   cycles: so he can spend less time waiting for the computer to
   respond.  2. By extension, a notional unit of <EM>human</EM> thought
   power, emphasizing that lots of things compete for the typical
