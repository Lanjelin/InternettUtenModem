<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates at MIT
for many years.  One April, we both flew from Boston to California
for a week on research business, to consult face-to-face with some
people at Stanford, particularly our mutual friend Richard P.
Gabriel (RPG; see  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG725" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG725">gabriel</A>).  <P>
RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back to
Palo Alto (going  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1062" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1062">logical</A> south on route 101, parallel to
 <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG540" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG540">El Camino Bignum</A>).  Palo Alto is adjacent to Stanford
University and about 40 miles south of San Francisco.  We ate at
The Good Earth, a `health food' restaurant, very popular, the
sort whose milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder.  JONL
ordered such a shake -- the waitress claimed the flavor of the day
was "lalaberry".  I still have no idea what that might be, but it
became a running joke.  It was the color of raspberry, and JONL
said it tasted rather bitter.  I ate a better tostada there than I
have ever had in a Mexican restaurant.  <P>
After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice
Cream Parlor.  They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of
intriguing flavors.  It's a chain, and they have a slogan: "If you
don't live near an Uncle Gaylord's -- MOVE!"  Also, Uncle
Gaylord (a real person) wages a constant battle to force big-name
ice cream makers to print their ingredients on the package (like
air and plastic and other non-natural garbage).  JONL and I had
first discovered Uncle Gaylord's the previous August, when we had
flown to a computer-science conference in Berkeley, California, the
first time either of us had been on the West Coast.  When not in
the conference sessions, we had spent our time wandering the length
of Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in Cambridge) was
lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little shops.
On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store.  The
ice cream there was very good.  During that August visit JONL went
absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor, ginger
honey.  <P>
Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth -- indeed, after every
lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit -- a trip
to Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory.  We had
arrived on a Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there
at least four times.  Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice
cream, and proclaim to all bystanders that "Ginger was the spice
that drove the Europeans mad!  That's why they sought a route to
the East!  They used it to preserve their otherwise off-taste
meat."  After the third or fourth repetition RPG and I were
getting a little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase him:
"Wow!  Ginger!  The spice that makes rotten meat taste good!"
"Say!  Why don't we find some dog that's been run over and sat in
the sun for a week and put some <EM>ginger</EM> on it for dinner?!"
"Right!  With a lalaberry shake!"  And so on.  This failed to
faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as we kept returning
to Uncle Gaylord's.  He loves ginger honey ice cream.  <P>
Now RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up
(putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them
JONL and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their
choosing.  I unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had
<I>je ne sais quoi du jour</I>, but RPG and JONL had <I>lapin</I>
(rabbit).  (Waitress: "<I>Oui</I>, we have fresh rabbit, fresh
today."  RPG: "Well, JONL, I guess we won't need any
<EM>ginger</EM>!")<P>
We finished the meal late, about 11 P.M., which is 2 A.M
Boston time, so JONL and I were rather droopy.  But it wasn't yet
midnight.  Off to Uncle Gaylord's!<P>
Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto.
In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101 going north
instead of south.  JONL and I wouldn't have known the difference
had RPG not mentioned it.  We still knew very little of the local
geography.  I did figure out, however, that we were headed in the
direction of Berkeley, and half-jokingly suggested that we continue
north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in Berkeley.  <P>
RPG said "Fine!" and we drove on for a while and talked.  I was
drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes.  When
he awoke, RPG said, "Gee, JONL, you must have slept all the way
over the bridge!", referring to the one spanning San Francisco
Bay.  Just then we came to a sign that said "University Avenue".
I mumbled something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue;
RPG said "Right!" and maneuvered some more.  Eventually we pulled
up in front of an Uncle Gaylord's.  <P>
Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so sleepy,
and I didn't really understand what was happening until RPG let me
in on it a few moments later, but I was just alert enough to notice
that we had somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's after
all.  <P>
JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't
caught on.  (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night,
and looks much different from the way it does in daylight.)  He
said, "This isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley!  It
looked like a barn!  But this place looks <EM>just like</EM> the one
back in Palo Alto!"<P>
RPG deadpanned, "Well, this is the one <EM>I</EM> always come to
when I'm in Berkeley.  They've got two in San Francisco, too.
Remember, they're a chain."<P>
JONL accepted this bit of wisdom.  And he was not totally ignorant
--- he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley,
not far from Telegraph Avenue.  What he didn't know was that there
is a completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.  <P>
JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey.  The guy at
the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first,
evidently their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too
many people like it.  <P>
JONL said, "I'm sure I like it.  Just give me a cone."  The guy
behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first.
"Some people think it tastes like soap."  JONL insisted, "Look,
I <EM>love</EM> ginger.  I eat Chinese food.  I eat raw ginger roots.
I already went through this hassle with the guy back in Palo Alto.
I <EM>know</EM> I like that flavor!"<P>
At the words "back in Palo Alto" the guy behind the counter got a
very strange look on his face, but said nothing.  KBT caught his
eye and winked.  Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped
what was going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor
laughing and clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched
into his spiel ("makes rotten meat a dish for princes") for the
forty-third time.  At this point, RPG clued me in fully.  <P>
RPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our
chuckles.  JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream
with the guy b.t.c., comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream
shops and generally having a good old time.  <P>
At length the g.b.t.c. said, "How's the ginger honey?"  JONL
said, "Fine!  I wonder what exactly is in it?"  Now Uncle Gaylord
publishes all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make
his ice cream at home.  So the g.b.t.c. got out the recipe, and
he and JONL pored over it for a while.  But the g.b.t.c. could
contain his curiosity no longer, and asked again, "You really like
that stuff, huh?"  JONL said, "Yeah, I've been eating it
constantly back in Palo Alto for the past two days.  In fact, I
think this batch is about as good as the cones I got back in Palo
Alto!"<P>
G.b.t.c. looked him straight in the eye and said, "You're
<EM>in</EM> Palo Alto!"<P>
JONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a
fit of giggles.  He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed,
"I've been hacked!"</BLOCKQUOTE>

   parties with legitimate reasons to need an electronic locksmith.
   In 1991, mainstream media reported the existence of a loose-knit
   culture of samurai that meets electronically on BBS systems, mostly
   bright teenagers with personal micros; they have modeled themselves
   explicitly on the historical samurai of Japan and on the "net
   cowboys" of William Gibson's  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG406" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG406">cyberpunk</A> novels.  Those

   employers and to disdain the vandalism and theft practiced by
   criminal crackers as beneath them and contrary to the hacker ethic;
   some quote Miyamoto Musashi's "Book of Five Rings", a classic
   of historical samurai doctrine, in support of these principles.

   relied on a particular formula and was giving unexpected results,
   one might first look at the nesting of parentheses or the coding of
   the formula, as a `sanity check', before looking at the more

<A NAME=TAG1557><B>scratch</B></A> <P> 1. [from `scratchpad'] /adj./ Describes a data
   structure or recording medium attached to a machine for testing or

   caution when dealing with irreplaceable data or devices.  Used to
   refer to any scratch volume hooked to a computer during any risky
   operation as a replacement for some precious resource or data that
   might otherwise get trashed.  <P>
   This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder
   Monkey, star of a biological research program at the University of
   Toronto.  Mabel was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey;
   the university had spent years teaching her how to swim, breathing
   through a regulator, in order to study the effects of different gas
   mixtures on her physiology.  Mabel suffered an untimely demise one
   day when a DEC engineer troubleshooting a crash on the program's
   VAX inadvertently interfered with some custom hardware that was
   wired to Mabel.  <P>
   It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate
   customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC
   troubleshooter called up the  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG611" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG611">field circus</A> manager responsible
   and asked him sweetly, "Can you swim?"<P>
   Not all the consequences to humans were so amusing; the sysop of
   the machine in question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of
   certain clueless  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG514" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG514">droid</A>s at the local `humane' society.  The moral
   is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.  <P>
   [The actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of
   this story, complete with reported dialogue between one of the
   project people and DEC field service, that has been circulating on
   Internet since 1986.  It is hilarious and mythic, but gets some
   facts wrong.  For example, it reports the machine as a PDP-11 and
   alleges that Mabel's demise occurred when DEC  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1386" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1386">PM</A>ed the
   machine.  Earlier versions of this entry were based on that story;
   this one has been corrected from an interview with the hapless
   sysop. --ESR]

   happen if the terminal is either disconnected or connected to a
   powered-off terminal but still enabled for login; misconfiguration,
   misimplementation, or simple bad luck can start such a terminal
   screaming.  A screaming tty or two can seriously degrade the
   performance of a vanilla Unix system; the arriving "characters"
   are treated as userid/password pairs and tested as such.  The Unix
   password encryption algorithm is designed to be computationally
   intensive in order to foil brute-force crack attacks, so although
   none of the logins succeeds; the overhead of rejecting them all can

   used by Fred Brooks in his classic "The Mythical Man-Month:
   Essays on Software Engineering" (Addison-Wesley, 1975; ISBN
   0-201-00650-2).  It described the jump from a set of nice, simple
   operating systems on the IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360
   series.  A similar effect can also happen in an evolving system;

   trashed due to a previous  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG585" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG585">fandango on core</A>.  However, this
   fandango may have been due to an <EM>earlier</EM> fandango, so no
   amount of analysis will reveal (directly) how the damage occurred.
   "The data structure was clobbered, but it was secondary
   damage."<P>
   By extension, the corruption resulting from @Math{N} cascaded
   fandangoes on core is `@Math{N}th-level damage'.  There is at least
   one case on record in which 17 hours of  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG811" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG811">grovel</A>ling with

   near-superhuman feat was presented with an award by his fellows.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1573><B>security through obscurity</B></A> <P> (alt. `security by obscurity')
   A term applied by hackers to most OS vendors' favorite way of
   coping with security holes -- namely, ignoring them, documenting
   neither any known holes nor the underlying security algorithms,
   trusting that nobody will find out about them and that people who
   do find out about them won't exploit them.  This "strategy" never
   works for long and occasionally sets the world up for debacles like
   the  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1527" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1527">RTM</A> worm of 1988 (see  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG793" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG793">Great Worm, the</A>), but once the
   brief moments of panic created by such events subside most vendors
   are all too willing to turn over and go back to sleep.  After all,
   actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources needed to
   implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list
   -- and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers
   might begin to <EM>expect</EM> it and imagine that their warranties
   of merchantability gave them some sort of <EM>right</EM> to a system
   with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and
   <EM>then</EM> where would we be?<P>
   Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of
   this term.  It has been claimed that it was first used in the
   Usenet newsgroup in <I><a href="news:comp.sys.apollo">comp.sys.apollo</a></I> during a campaign to get
   HP/Apollo to fix security problems in its Unix- <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG299" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG299">clone</A>

   security was everything.  In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the
   fact that by the time a tourist figured out how to make
   trouble he'd generally gotten over the urge to make it, because he
   felt part of the community; and (2) (self-mockingly) the poor
   coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands.  One
   instance of <EM>deliberate</EM> security through obscurity is
   recorded; the command to allow patching the running ITS system

   often used for Sign EXtend, a machine instruction found in the
   PDP-11 and many other architectures.  The RCA 1802 chip used in the
   early Elf and SuperElf personal computers had a `SEt X register'
   SEX instruction, but this seems to have had little folkloric
   impact.  <P>
   DEC's engineers nearly got a PDP-11 assembler that used the
   <CODE>SEX</CODE> mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once)
   marketing wasn't asleep and forced a change.  That wasn't the last
   time this happened, either.  The author of "The Intel 8086
   Primer", who was one of the original designers of the 8086, noted
   that there was originally a <CODE>SEX</CODE> instruction on that
   processor, too.  He says that Intel management got cold feet and
   decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed
   <CODE>CBW</CODE> and <CODE>CWD</CODE> (depending on what was being extended).
   Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the microcontroller used in IBM PC
   keyboards) is also missing straight <CODE>SEX</CODE> but has logical-or
   and logical-and instructions <CODE>ORL</CODE> and <CODE>ANL</CODE>.  <P>
   The Motorola 6809, used in the U.K.'s `Dragon 32' personal
   computer, actually had an official <CODE>SEX</CODE> instruction; the 6502
   in the Apple II with which it competed did not.  British hackers
   thought this made perfect mythic sense; after all, it was commonly
   observed, you could (on some theoretical level) have sex with a
   dragon, but you can't have sex with an apple.  <P>

   and no special unpacking software is required.  Sharchives are also
   intriguing in that they are typically created by shell scripts; the

   The folklore interest of sitenames stems from the creativity and
   humor they often display.  Interpreting a sitename is not unlike
   interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack it,
   allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of
   whitespace.  Hacker tradition deprecates dull,
   institutional-sounding names in favor of punchy, humorous, and
   clever coinages (except that it is considered appropriate for the
   official public gateway machine of an organization to bear the
   organization's name or acronym).  Mythological references, cartoon
   characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature
   are probably the most popular sources for sitenames (in roughly
   descending order).  The obligatory comment when discussing these is
   Harris's Lament: "All the good ones are taken!"  See also

   allowance for error but in only one of two directions.  For
   example, if you need a piece of wire 10 feet long and have to guess
   when you cut it, you make very sure to cut it too long, by a large
   amount if necessary, rather than too short by even a little bit,
   because you can always cut off the slop but you can't paste it back
   on again.  When discrete quantities are involved, slop is often
   introduced to avoid the possibility of being on the losing side of
   a  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG608" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG608">fencepost error</A>.  2. The percentage of `extra' code

   produced by  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG850" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG850">hand-hacking</A>; i.e., the space (or maybe time) you
   lose because you didn't do it yourself.  This number is often used
   as a measure of the goodness of a compiler; slop below 5% is very
   good, and 10% is usually acceptable.  With modern compiler
   technology, esp. on RISC machines, the compiler's slop may
   actually be <EM>negative</EM>; that is, humans may be unable to
   generate code as good.  This is one of the reasons assembler
   programming is no longer common.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1626><B>slopsucker</B></A> /slop'suhk-r/ /n./ <P> A lowest-priority task that
   waits around until everything else has `had its fill' of machine

<A NAME=TAG1629><B>smart terminal</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A terminal that has enough computing
   capability to render graphics or to offload some kind of front-end
   processing from the computer it talks to.  The development of
   workstations and personal computers has made this term and the
   product it describes semi-obsolescent, but one may still hear
   variants of the phrase `act like a smart terminal' used to
   describe the behavior of workstations or PCs with respect to
   programs that execute almost entirely out of a remote  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1585" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1585">server</A>'s
   storage, using local devices as displays.  2. obs. Any terminal

   Today, a terminal with merely an addressable cursor, but with none
   of the more-powerful features mentioned in sense 1, is called a

   terminal): "A smart terminal is not a smart<EM>ass</EM> terminal,
   but rather a terminal you can educate."  This illustrates a common
   design problem: The attempt to make peripherals (or anything else)
   intelligent sometimes results in finicky, rigid `special
   features' that become just so much dead weight if you try to use
   the device in any way the designer didn't anticipate.  Flexibility
   and programmability, on the other hand, are <EM>really</EM> smart.

   derive from carnie slang for magic acts and `freak show' displays
   that depend on `trompe l'oeil' effects, but also calls to mind
   the fierce Aztec god Tezcatlipoca (lit. "Smoking Mirror") for

   incremented).  The lines all have one endpoint in the middle of the
   screen; the other endpoints are spaced one pixel apart around the
   perimeter of a large square.  The color map is then repeatedly
   rotated.  This results in a striking, rainbow-hued, shimmering

   length is significantly greater than its complexity.  Used to refer
   to a program that could obviously be written, but is not worth the
   trouble.  Also used ironically to imply that a difficult problem
   can be easily solved because a program can be written to do it; the
   irony is that it is very clear that writing such a program will be
   a great deal of work.  "It's easy to enhance a FORTRAN compiler to
   compile COBOL as well; it's just an SMOP."  2. Often used

   In this context one also speaks of `snapping links'.  For
   example, in a LISP implementation, a function interface trampoline
   might check to make sure that the caller is passing the correct
   number of arguments; if it is, and if the caller and the callee are
   both compiled, then snapping the link allows that particular path
   to use a direct procedure-call instruction with no further
   overhead.  <P>

   incidents of this kind.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1660><B>software rot</B></A> /n./ <P> Term used to describe the tendency of
   software that has not been used in a while to  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1066" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1066">lose</A>; such
   failure may be semi-humorously ascribed to  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG118" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG118">bit rot</A>.  More
   commonly, `software rot' strikes when a program's assumptions
   become out of date.  If the design was insufficiently  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1511" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1511">robust</A>,
   this may cause it to fail in mysterious ways.  <P>
   For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of
   COBOL programs, most will succumb to software rot when their
   2-digit year counters  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG2008" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG2008">wrap around</A> at the beginning of the
   year 2000.  Actually, related lossages often afflict centenarians
   who have to deal with computer software designed by unimaginative
   clods.  One such incident became the focus of a minor public flap
   in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's
   license renewal in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The new system
   refused to issue the card, probably because with 2-digit years the
   ages 101 and 1 cannot be distinguished.  <P>
   Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the
   mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g.,
   the R1; see  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG804" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG804">grind crank</A>).  If a program that depended on a
   peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user
   might discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they
   once did.  ("Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do
   such-and-such.  We can  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1643" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1643">snarf</A> this opcode, right?  No one uses
   it.") <P>
   Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker
   found a simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump
   instruction on a PDP-6, so he patched the hardware.  Unfortunately,
   this broke some fragile timing software in a music-playing program,
   throwing its output out of tune.  This was fixed by adding a
   defensive initialization routine to compare the speed of a timing
   loop with the real-time clock; in other words, it figured out how
   fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected appropriately.

   And of course each of these might also be typed with any
   combination of the control, meta, hyper, and super keys.  On this
   keyboard, you could type over 8000 different characters!  This
   allowed the user to type very complicated mathematical text, and
   also to have thousands of single-character commands at his
   disposal.  Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the
   command meanings of that many characters if it reduced typing time
   (this attitude obviously shaped the interface of EMACS).  Other
   hackers, however, thought having that many bucky bits was overkill,
   and objected that such a keyboard can require three or four hands
   to operate.

<A NAME=TAG1704><B>strided</B></A> /stri:'d*d/ /adj./ <P> [scientific computing] Said of
   a sequence of memory reads and writes to addresses, each of which
   is separated from the last by a constant interval called the
   `stride length'.  These can be a worst-case access pattern for
   the standard memory-caching schemes when the stride length is a
   multiple of the cache line size.  Strided references are often
   generated by loops through an array, and (if your data is large
   enough that access-time is significant) it can be worthwhile to
   tune for better locality by inverting double loops or by partially
   unrolling the outer loop of a loop nest.  This usage is borderline
   techspeak; the related term `memory stride' is definitely
   techspeak.  <P>

   originally published in 1952 but much anthologized since, Mark
   Clifton's "Star, Bright".  In it, a super-genius child
   classifies humans into a very few `Brights' like herself, a huge

   Sturgeon, who once said, "Sure, 90% of science fiction is crud.
   That's because 90% of everything is crud."  Oddly, when Sturgeon's
   Law is cited, the final word is almost invariably changed to

   often worn by non-hackers.  Invariably worn with a `tie', a

   <P> An expression used ironically to characterize unquantifiable

   example, suppose a newly created program came up with a correct
   full-screen display, and one publicly exclaimed: "It works!"
   Then, if the program dumped core on the first mouse click, one
   might add: "Well, for suitably small values of `works'."

   called Source Quench that asks a host to transmit more slowly on a
   particular connection to avoid congestion.  It also has a Redirect
   control message intended to instruct a host to send certain packets
   to a different local router.  A "super source quench" is actually
   a redirect control packet, forged to look like it came from a local
   router, that instructs a host to send all packets to its own local
   loopback address.  This will effectively tie many Internet hosts up

<A NAME=TAG1724><B>superprogrammer</B></A> /n./ <P> A prolific programmer; one who can code
   exceedingly well and quickly.  Not all hackers are
   superprogrammers, but many are.  (Productivity can vary from one
   programmer to another by three orders of magnitude.  For example,
   one programmer might be able to write an average of 3 lines of
   working code in one day, while another, with the proper tools,
   might be able to write 3,000.  This range is astonishing; it is
   matched in very few other areas of human endeavor.)  The term
   `superprogrammer' is more commonly used within such places as IBM
   than in the hacker community.  It tends to stress naive measures of
   productivity and to underweight creativity, ingenuity, and getting
   the job <EM>done</EM> -- and to sidestep the question of whether the

   she will usually know the software and the relevant manuals better
   than the support people (sadly, this is <EM>not</EM> a joke or

   excuse is that it was swapped out.  To `keep something swapped
   in' means to keep it fresh in your memory: "I reread the TECO
   manual every few months to keep it swapped in."  If someone
   interrupts you just as you got a good idea, you might say "Wait a
   moment while I swap this out", implying that a piece of paper is
   your extra-somatic memory and that if you don't swap the idea out
   by writing it down it will get overwritten and lost as you talk.

<A NAME=TAG1734><B>swizzle</B></A> /v./ <P> To convert external names, array indices, or
   references within a data structure into address pointers when the
   data structure is brought into main memory from external storage
   (also called `pointer swizzling'); this may be done for speed in
   chasing references or to simplify code (e.g., by turning lots of
   name lookups into pointer dereferences).  The converse operation is
   sometimes termed `unswizzling'.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1642" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1642">snap</A>.  <P>

   I/O to the disk; see  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG659" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG659">flush</A>, sense 2.  3. More generally, to
   force a number of competing processes or agents to a state that
   would be `safe' if the system were to crash; thus, to checkpoint
   (in the database-theory sense).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1736><B>syntactic salt</B></A> /n./ <P> The opposite of  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1737" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1737">syntactic sugar</A>, a
   feature designed to make it harder to write bad code.
   Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop the programmer must jump
   through just to prove that he knows what's going on, rather than to
   express a program action.  Some programmers consider required type
   declarations to be syntactic salt.  A requirement to write
   <CODE>end if</CODE>, <CODE>end while</CODE>, <CODE>end do</CODE>, etc. to terminate
   the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to
   just <CODE>end</CODE>) would definitely be syntactic salt.  Syntactic
   salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers'
   blood pressures in an unhealthy way.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG249" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG249">candygrammar</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1737><B>syntactic sugar</B></A> /n./ <P> [coined by Peter Landin] Features added
   to a language or other formalism to make it `sweeter' for
   humans, features which do not affect the expressiveness of the
   formalism (compare  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG289" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG289">chrome</A>).  Used esp. when there is an
   obvious and trivial translation of the `sugar' feature into
   other constructs already present in the notation.  C's <CODE>a[i]</CODE>
   notation is syntactic sugar for <CODE>*(a + i)</CODE>.  "Syntactic sugar
   causes cancer of the semicolon." -- Alan Perlis.  <P>
   The variants `syntactic saccharin' and `syntactic syrup' are
   also recorded.  These denote something even more gratuitous, in
   that syntactic sugar serves a purpose (making something more
   acceptable to humans), but syntactic saccharin or syrup serve no
   purpose at all.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG249" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG249">candygrammar</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1736" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1736">syntactic salt</A>.  <P>

<P>
<A NAME=TAG1740><B>sysape</B></A> /sys'ayp/ /n./ <P> A rather derogatory term for a

<A NAME=TAG1741><B>sysop</B></A> /sis'op/ /n./ <P> [esp. in the BBS world] The operator

   neophyte mistake on  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG610" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG610">FidoNet</A> is to address a message to

<A NAME=TAG1742><B>system</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. The supervisor program or OS on a computer.
   2. The entire computer system, including input/output devices, the
   supervisor program or OS, and possibly other software.  3. Any
   large-scale program.  4. Any method or algorithm.  5. `System
   hacker': one who hacks the system (in senses 1 and 2 only; for
   sense 3 one mentions the particular program: e.g., `LISP hacker')  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1744><B>system mangler</B></A> /n./ <P> Humorous synonym for `system manager',

   called SYSMANGR.  Refers specifically to a systems programmer in
   charge of administration, software maintenance, and updates at some
   site.  Unlike  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG10" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG10">admin</A>, this term emphasizes the technical end of
   the skills involved.
