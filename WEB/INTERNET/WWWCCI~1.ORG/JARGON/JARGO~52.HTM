Many (perhaps even most) hackers don't follow or do sports at all and
are determinedly anti-physical.  Among those who do, interest in
spectator sports is low to non-existent; sports are something one
<EM>does</EM>, not something one watches on TV.  <P>
Further, hackers avoid most team sports like the plague.  Volleyball was
long a notable exception, perhaps because it's non-contact and relatively
friendly; Ultimate Frisbee has become quite popular for similar
reasons.  Hacker sports are almost always primarily self-competitive
ones involving concentration, stamina, and micromotor skills: martial
arts, bicycling, auto racing, kite flying, hiking, rock climbing,
aviation, target-shooting, sailing, caving, juggling, skiing, skating
(ice and roller).  Hackers' delight in techno-toys also tends to draw
them towards hobbies with nifty complicated equipment that they can
tinker with.  <P>
