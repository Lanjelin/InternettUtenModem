   various arcane purposes mostly related to I/O.  Former
   Ivy-Leaguers and Oxford types are said to associate it with
   nostalgic memories of dear old University.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1442><B>quadruple bucky</B></A> /n. obs./ <P> 1. On an MIT  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1667" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1667">space-cadet keyboard</A>, use of all four of the shifting keys (control, meta,
   hyper, and super) while typing a character key.  2. On a Stanford
   or MIT keyboard in  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1469" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1469">raw mode</A>, use of four shift keys while
   typing a fifth character, where the four shift keys are the control
   and meta keys on <EM>both</EM> sides of the keyboard.  This was very
   difficult to do!  One accepted technique was to press the
   left-control and left-meta keys with your left hand, the
   right-control and right-meta keys with your right hand, and the
   fifth key with your nose.  <P>
   Quadruple-bucky combinations were very seldom used in practice,
   because when one invented a new command one usually assigned it to
   some character that was easier to type.  If you want to imply that
   a program has ridiculously many commands or features, you can say
   something like: "Oh, the command that makes it spin the tapes
   while whistling Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is
   quadruple-bucky-cokebottle."

<A NAME=TAG1443><B>quantifiers</B></A> <P> In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric
   prefixes used in the SI (Syst`eme International) conventions for
   scientific measurement have dual uses.  With units of time or
   things that come in powers of 10, such as money, they retain their
   usual meanings of multiplication by powers of @Math{1000 = 10^3}.
   But when used with bytes or other things that naturally come in
   powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by powers of
   @Math{1024 = 2^(10)}.  <P>
   Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the corresponding
   binary interpretations in common use: <P>
<PRE>

   Here are the SI fractional prefixes:

milli-  1000^-1     (seldom used in jargon)
micro-  1000^-2     small or human-scale (see  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1140" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1140">micro-</A>)

femto-  1000^-5     (not used in jargon--yet)
atto-   1000^-6     (not used in jargon--yet)
zepto-  1000^-7     (not used in jargon--yet)
yocto-  1000^-8     (not used in jargon--yet)
</PRE>
<P>
   The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included
   in these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were
   adopted in 1990 by the `19th Conference Generale des Poids et
   Mesures'.  The binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well
   established, are not in jargon use either -- yet.  The prefix
   milli-, denoting multiplication by @Math{1/1000}, has always
   been rare in jargon (there is, however, a standard joke about the
   `millihelen' -- notionally, the amount of beauty required to
   launch one ship).  See the entries on  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1140" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1140">micro-</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1365" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1365">pico-</A>, and
    <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1211" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1211">nano-</A> for more information on connotative jargon use of these
   terms.  `Femto' and `atto' (which, interestingly, derive not
   from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired jargon loadings,
   though it is easy to predict what those will be once computing
   technology enters the required realms of magnitude (however, see
    <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG47" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG47">attoparsec</A>).  <P>
   There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of
   10.  In the following table, the `prefix' column is the
   international standard suffix for the appropriate power of ten; the
   `binary' column lists jargon abbreviations and words for the
   corresponding power of 2.  The B-suffixed forms are commonly used
   for byte quantities; the words `meg' and `gig' are nouns that may
   (but do not always) pluralize with `s'.
<P>
   Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
   numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus "2K dollars", "2M
   of disk space".  This is also true (though less commonly) of G.
<P>
   Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is `k'; some use
   this strictly, reserving `K' for multiplication by 1024 (KB is
   thus `kilobytes').  <P>
   K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is
   64 gigabytes and `a K' is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of
   `a G' as short for `a grand', that is, $1000).  Whether one
   pronounces `gig' with hard or soft `g' depends on what one thinks
   the proper pronunciation of `giga-' is.  <P>
   Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
   magnitude) -- for example, describing a memory in units of
   500K or 524K instead of 512K -- is a sure sign of the
    <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1111" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1111">marketroid</A>.  One example of this: it is common to refer to the
   capacity of 3.5"  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1142" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1142">microfloppies</A> as `1.44 MB' In fact, this is a
   completely  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG173" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG173">bogus</A> number.  The correct size is 1440 KB, that
   is, 1440 * 1024 = 1474560 bytes.  So the `mega' in `1.44 MB' is
   compounded of two `kilos', one of which is 1024 and the other of
   which is 1000.  The correct number of megabytes would of course be
   1440 / 1024 = 1.40625.  Alas, this fine point is probably lost on
   the world forever.  <P>
   [1993 update: hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general
   approval on Usenet, the following additional prefixes: <P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>groucho
<DD>10^(-30)
<DT>harpo
<DD>10^(-27)
<DT>harpi
<DD>10^(27)
<DT>grouchi
<DD>10^(30)
</DL>
<P>
   We observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and
   chico- available for future expansion.  Sadly, there is little
   immediate prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal
   will be ratified.] <P>
<A NAME=TAG1444><B>quantum bogodynamics</B></A> /kwon'tm boh`goh-di:-nam'iks/ /n./ <P> A

   computers), and bogosity potential fields.  Bogon absorption, of
   course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines to
   fail (and may also cause both to emit secondary bogons); however,
   the precise mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not
   yet understood and remain to be elucidated.  Quantum bogodynamics
   is most often invoked to explain the sharp increase in hardware and
   software failures in the presence of suits; the latter emit bogons,
   which the former absorb.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG167" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG167">bogon</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG324" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG324">computron</A>,

   It is sometimes said that it was designed to slow down the typist,
   but this is wrong; it was designed to allow <EM>faster</EM> typing
   -- under a constraint now long obsolete.  In early typewriters,
   fast typing using nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism.  So Sholes
   fiddled the layout to separate the letters of many common digraphs
   (he did a far from perfect job, though; `th', `tr', `ed', and `er',
   for example, each use two nearby keys).  Also, putting the letters
   of `typewriter' on one line allowed it to be typed with particular
   speed and accuracy for  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG452" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG452">demo</A>s.  The jamming problem was
   essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs, but
   the keyboard layout lives on.
