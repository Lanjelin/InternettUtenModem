<P>Go to the <A HREF="JARGO~13.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_12.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="JARGO~15.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_14.html">next</A> section.<P>

Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than
the letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in
mainstream dictionaries), except that all entries beginning with
nonalphabetic characters are sorted after Z.  The case-blindness is a
feature, not a bug.  <P>
Jargon terms with entries in the file are <B>boldfaced</B>.
This isn't done all the time for every such word, but it is done
everywhere that a reminder seems useful that the term has a jargon
meaning and one might wish to refer to its entry.  <P>
Defining instances of terms and phrases appear in `slanted type'.  A
defining instance is one which occurs near to or as part of an
explanation of it.
<P>
Prefixed ** is used as linguists do; to mark examples of incorrect usage.
<P>
We follow the `logical' quoting convention described in the Writing
Style section above.  In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual
excerpts of text or (sometimes invented) speech.  Scare quotes (which
mark a word being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes
(which turn an utterance into the string of letters or words that name
it) are both rendered with single quotes.
<P>
References such as <CODE>malloc(3)</CODE> and <CODE>patch(1)</CODE> are to Unix
facilities (some of which, such as <CODE>patch(1)</CODE>, are actually
freeware distributed over Usenet).  The Unix manuals use
<CODE>foo(n)</CODE> to refer to item foo in section (@Math{n}) of the
manual, where @Math{n=1} is utilities, @Math{n=2} is system calls,
@Math{n=3} is C library routines, @Math{n=6} is games, and
@Math{n=8} (where present) is system administration utilities.
Sections 4, 5, and 7 of the manuals have changed roles frequently and
in any case are not referred to in any of the entries.  <P>
Various abbreviations used frequently in the lexicon are summarized here:

separates two possibilities with nearly equal distribution, while
<I>var.</I> prefixes one that is markedly less common than the primary.
<P>
Where a term can be attributed to a particular subculture or is known
to have originated there, we have tried to so indicate.  Here is a
list of abbreviations used in etymologies:

<P>
Some other etymology abbreviations such as  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1345" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1345">PDP-10</A>
refer to technical cultures surrounding specific operating systems,
processors, or other environments.  The fact that a term is labelled
with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use
is confined to that culture.  In particular, many terms labelled `MIT'
and `Stanford' are in quite general use.  We have tried to give some
indication of the distribution of speakers in the usage notes;
however, a number of factors mentioned in the introduction conspire to
make these indications less definite than might be desirable.
<P>
A few new definitions attached to entries are marked [proposed].
These are usually generalizations suggested by editors or Usenet
respondents in the process of commenting on previous definitions of
those entries.  These are <EM>not</EM> represented as established
jargon.
