<H1>Alternate Views of the Jargon File</H1>

Lots of people have used the Jargon File as a test case for different
kinds of search and retrieval engines.  Here are all the different
ways of viewing it that I have URLs for as of January 21 1996: <P>

<H2>Current Versions (3.0.0 or later)</H2>

Most of the recent conversions have search capability but only crude ASCII
highlighting (they were generated from the info or ASCII
versions). <P>

<DT> <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#655" tppabs="http://www.comedia.com/Hot/jargon_3.0">Hans DeWolf's WWW Jargon File</A>
<DD> This appears to be the best of the `rogue' conversions, except for the
lack of search capability.  Crossreference-to-URL translation was apparently
done with a filter, and the results extensively hand-hacked (even including
indexes to lists of entries deleted in various versions!)
<DT> <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#656" tppabs="http://www.cnam.fr/Jargon/">The CNAM View</A>
<DD> Searchable HTML, made from the info version, put together by two people
at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers in Paris.  Accepts Perl
regular expressions.  Version 3.2.0.
<DT> <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#657" tppabs="http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon">Arjan De Mes's View</A>
<DD> Arjan De Mes &lt;mes@fwi.uva.nl&gt; did this version at the University of
Amsterdam. It allows search on a conjunction of up to three keywords.  Version
3.3.1.
<DT> <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#658" tppabs="http://www.mathematik.uni-marburg.de/doc/jargon/">University of Marburg conversion</A>
<DD> Nice conversion of 3.0.0 on a German-language site (it's still English).
I wasn't able to discover who did this one, but they've got a conversion
script called jar2html that seems to do a pretty good job of generating
HTML from the flat-text version.

<H2>Old Versions</H2>

These versions are out of date. <P>

<DL>
<DT> <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#659" tppabs="http://www.tu-graz.ac.at/Cjargon">The Hyper-G Gateway</A>
<DD> The lexicon part of the File (without the front matter or appendices)
as captured by a search-and-indexing engine called "Hyper-G" at a university
in Austria. I don't know for sure what version they captured, but it dates
back to 1992 so it's probably 2.9.10.
<DT> <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#660" tppabs="http://www.instantweb.com/~foldoc/cgi-bin/foldoc.pl">
The Free On-Line Dictionary Of Computing</A> borrowed a lot of Jargon File
material, I'm not sure from which version.

<DT> <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#661" tppabs="http://beatles.cselt.stet.it/gergo">Il Gergo Telematico</A>
<DD> Maurizio Codogno's HTML translation into Italian of 3.0.0.
</DL>

I know there are WAIS and other databases built from the Jargon File, but don't
have those URLs. If you know of an interesting one, send me mail.
