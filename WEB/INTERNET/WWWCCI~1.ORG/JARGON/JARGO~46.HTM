There are some standard methods of jargonification that became
established quite early (i.e., before 1970), spreading from such
sources as the Tech Model Railroad Club, the PDP-1 SPACEWAR hackers,
and John McCarthy's original crew of LISPers.  These include verb
doubling, soundalike slang, the `-P' convention, overgeneralization,
spoken inarticulations, and anthropomorphization.  Each is discussed
below.  We also cover the standard comparatives for design quality.  <P>
Of these six, verb doubling, overgeneralization, anthropomorphization,
and (especially) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but
soundalike slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large
universities, and the `-P' convention is found only where LISPers
flourish.  <P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC6" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC6">Verb Doubling</A></H3>

A standard construction in English is to double a verb
and use it as an exclamation, such as "Bang, bang!" or "Quack,
quack!".  Most of these are names for noises.  Hackers also double
verbs as a concise, sometimes sarcastic comment on what the implied
subject does.  Also, a doubled verb is often used to terminate a
conversation, in the process remarking on the current state of affairs
or what the speaker intends to do next.  Typical examples involve
 <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1976" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1976">win</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1066" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1066">lose</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG642" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG642">flame</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG75" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG75">barf</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG284" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG284">chomp</A>:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The disk heads just crashed."  "Lose, lose."<BR>
"Mostly he talked about his latest crock.  Flame, flame."<BR>
"Boy, what a bagbiter!  Chomp, chomp!"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately
obvious from the verb.  These have their own listings in the lexicon.  <P>
The  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A> culture has one <EM>tripling</EM> convention unrelated to
this; the names of `joke' topic groups often have a tripled last
element.  The first and paradigmatic example was
<I><a href="news:alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork">alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</a></I> (a "Muppet Show" reference);
other infamous examples have included:

<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC7" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC7">Soundalike slang</A></H3>

Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to
convert an ordinary word or phrase into something more interesting.
It is considered particularly  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG654" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG654">flavorful</A> if the phrase is bent so
as to include some other jargon word; thus the computer hobbyist
magazine "Dr. Dobb's Journal" is almost always referred to among
hackers as `Dr. Frob's Journal' or simply `Dr. Frob's'.  Terms of
this kind that have been in fairly wide use include names for
newspapers:<P>
<PRE>
    Boston Herald => Horrid (or Harried)
    Boston Globe => Boston Glob
    Houston (or San Francisco) Chronicle
           => the Crocknicle (or the Comical)
    New York Times => New York Slime
</PRE>
<P>
However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment.
Standard examples include:
<P>
<PRE>
    Data General => Dirty Genitals
    IBM 360 => IBM Three-Sickly
    Government Property -- Do Not Duplicate (on keys)
            => Government Duplicity -- Do Not Propagate
    for historical reasons => for hysterical raisins
    Margaret Jacks Hall (the CS building at Stanford)
            => Marginal Hacks Hall
</PRE>
<P>
This is not really similar to the Cockney rhyming slang it has been
compared to in the past, because Cockney substitutions are opaque
whereas hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent.  <P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC8" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC8">The `-P' convention</A></H3>

Turning a word into a question by appending the
syllable `P'; from the LISP convention of appending the letter `P'
to denote a predicate (a boolean-valued function).  The question
should expect a yes/no answer, though it needn't.  (See  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1746" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1746">T</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1256" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1256">NIL</A>.)<P>
<PRE>

          A: "Yeah, I'm pretty hungry." or "T!"<BR>

    At any time:<BR>
          Q: "State-of-the-world-P?"<BR>
          A: (Straight) "I'm about to go home."<BR>
          A: (Humorous) "Yes, the world has a state."<BR>

<P>
[One of the best of these is a  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG785" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG785">Gosperism</A>.  Once, when we were at a
Chinese restaurant, Bill Gosper wanted to know whether someone would
like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup.  His inquiry
was: "Split-p soup?" -- GLS]<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC9" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC9">Overgeneralization</A></H3>

A very conspicuous feature of jargon is the frequency with which
techspeak items such as names of program tools, command language
primitives, and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside
of computing wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them.  Thus
(to cite one of the best-known examples) Unix hackers often  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG801" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG801">grep</A>
for things rather than searching for them.  Many of the lexicon
entries are generalizations of exactly this kind.  <P>
Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well.
Many hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to
them to make nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to
nonuniform cases (or vice versa).  For example, because<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
porous => porosity<BR>
generous => generosity
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
hackers happily generalize:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mysterious => mysteriosity<BR>
ferrous => ferrosity<BR>
obvious => obviosity<BR>
dubious => dubiosity
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Another class of common construction uses the suffix `-itude' to
abstract a quality from just about any adjective or noun.  This usage
arises especially in cases where mainstream English would perform the
same abstraction through `-iness' or `-ingness'.  Thus:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
win => winnitude (a common exclamation)<BR>
loss => lossitude<BR>
cruft => cruftitude<BR>
lame => lameitude
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Some hackers cheerfully reverse this transformation; they argue, for
example, that the horizontal degree lines on a globe ought to be
called `lats' -- after all, they're measuring latitude! <P>
Also, note that all nouns can be verbed.  E.g.: "All nouns can be
verbed", "I'll mouse it up", "Hang on while I clipboard it over",
"I'm grepping the files".  English as a whole is already heading in
this direction (towards pure-positional grammar like Chinese); hackers
are simply a bit ahead of the curve.  <P>
However, hackers avoid the unimaginative verb-making techniques
characteristic of marketroids, bean-counters, and the Pentagon; a
hacker would never, for example, `productize', `prioritize', or
`securitize' things.  Hackers have a strong aversion to bureaucratic
bafflegab and regard those who use it with contempt.  <P>
Similarly, all verbs can be nouned.  This is only a slight
overgeneralization in modern English; in hackish, however, it
is good form to mark them in some standard nonstandard way.  Thus:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
win => winnitude, winnage<BR>
disgust => disgustitude<BR>
hack => hackification
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Further, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural
forms.  Some of these go back quite a ways; the TMRC Dictionary
includes an entry which implies that the plural of `mouse' is
 <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1120" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1120">meeces</A>, and notes that the defined plural of `caboose' is
`cabeese'.  This latter has apparently been standard (or at least a
standard joke) among railfans (railroad enthusiasts) for many
years.  <P>
On a similarly Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in `x' may
form plurals in `-xen' (see  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1897">VAXen</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG188" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG188">boxen</A> in the main
text).  Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes
treated this way; e.g., `soxen' for a bunch of socks.  Other funny
plurals are `frobbotzim' for the plural of `frobbozz' (see
 <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG699" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG699">frobnitz</A>) and `Unices' and `Twenices' (rather than `Unixes' and
`Twenexes'; see  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1854" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1854">TWENEX</A> in main text).  But note that
`Unixen' and `Twenexen' are never used; it has been suggested that
this is because `-ix' and `-ex' are Latin singular endings that
attract a Latinate plural.  Finally, it has been suggested to general
approval that the plural of `mongoose' ought to be `polygoose'.  <P>
The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is
generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either
an import or a fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending `-im', or the
Anglo-Saxon plural suffix `-en') to cases where it isn't normally
considered to apply.  <P>
This is not `poor grammar', as hackers are generally quite well
aware of what they are doing when they distort the language.  It is
grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness.  It is done not to
impress but to amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.  <P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC10" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC10">Spoken inarticulations</A></H3>

Words such as `mumble', `sigh', and `groan' are spoken in places where
their referent might more naturally be used.  It has been suggested
that this usage derives from the impossibility of representing such
noises on a comm link or in electronic mail (interestingly, the same
sorts of constructions have been showing up with increasing frequency
in comic strips).  Another expression sometimes heard is
"Complain!", meaning "I have a complaint!"<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC11">Anthropomorphization</A></H3>

Semantically, one rich source of jargon constructions is the hackish
tendency to anthropomorphize hardware and software.  This isn't done
in a naive way; hackers don't personalize their stuff in the sense of
feeling empathy with it, nor do they mystically believe that the
things they work on every day are `alive'.  What <EM>is</EM> common is
to hear hardware or software talked about as though it has homunculi
talking to each other inside it, with intentions and desires.  Thus,
one hears "The protocol handler got confused", or that programs
"are trying" to do things, or one may say of a routine that "its
goal in life is to X".  One even hears explanations like "...
and its poor little brain couldn't understand X, and it died."
Sometimes modelling things this way actually seems to make them easier
to understand, perhaps because it's instinctively natural to think of
anything with a really complex behavioral repertoire as `like a
person' rather than `like a thing'.  <P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC12" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC12">Comparatives</A></H3>

Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be
understood as members of sets of comparatives.  This is especially
true of the adjectives and nouns used to describe the beauty and
functional quality of code.  Here is an approximately correct
spectrum:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
monstrosity  brain-damage  screw  bug  lose  misfeature<BR>
crock  kluge  hack  win  feature  elegance  perfection
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never
actually attained.  Another similar scale is used for describing the
reliability of software:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
broken  flaky  dodgy  fragile  brittle<BR>
solid  robust  bulletproof  armor-plated
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Note, however, that `dodgy' is primarily Commonwealth Hackish (it is
rare in the U.S.) and may change places with `flaky' for some
speakers.  <P>
Coinages for describing  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1071" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1071">lossage</A> seem to call forth the very finest
in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly said that
hackers have even more words for equipment failures than Yiddish has
for obnoxious people.  <P>
