Here are some other books you can read to help you understand the
hacker mindset.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2068>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</A><BR>
Douglas Hofstadter<BR>
Basic Books, 1979<BR>
ISBN 0-394-74502-7
<P>
This book reads like an intellectual Grand Tour of hacker
preoccupations.  Music, mathematical logic, programming, speculations
on the nature of intelligence, biology, and Zen are woven into a
brilliant tapestry themed on the concept of encoded self-reference.
The perfect left-brain companion to "Illuminatus".  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2069>Illuminatus!</A><BR>
    I.   "The Eye in the Pyramid"<BR>
    II.  "The Golden Apple"<BR>
    III. "Leviathan".<BR>
Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson<BR>
Dell, 1988<BR>
ISBN 0-440-53981-1
<P>
This work of alleged fiction is an incredible berserko-surrealist
rollercoaster of world-girdling conspiracies, intelligent dolphins,
the fall of Atlantis, who really killed JFK, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll,
and the Cosmic Giggle Factor.  First published in three volumes, but
there is now a one-volume trade paperback, carried by most chain
bookstores under SF.  The perfect right-brain companion to
Hofstadter's "G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach".  See  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG564" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG564">Eris</A>,
 <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG480" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG480">Discordianism</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1458" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1458">random numbers</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG291" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG291">Church of the SubGenius</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2070>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</A><BR>
Douglas Adams<BR>
Pocket Books, 1981<BR>
ISBN 0-671-46149-4
<P>
This `Monty Python in Space' spoof of SF genre traditions has been
popular among hackers ever since the original British radio show.
Read it if only to learn about Vogons (see  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG167" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG167">bogon</A>) and the
significance of the number 42 (see  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1458" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1458">random numbers</A>) -- and why the
winningest chess program of 1990 was called `Deep Thought'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2071>The Tao of Programming</A><BR>
James Geoffrey<BR>
Infobooks, 1987<BR>
ISBN 0-931137-07-1
<P>
This gentle, funny spoof of the "Tao Te Ching" contains much that is
illuminating about the hacker way of thought.  "When you have learned
to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you
to leave."<P>
<A NAME=TAG2072>Hackers</A><BR>
Steven Levy<BR>
Anchor/Doubleday 1984<BR>
ISBN 0-385-19195-2
<P>
Levy's book is at its best in describing the early MIT hackers at the
Model Railroad Club and the early days of the microcomputer
revolution.  He never understood Unix or the networks, though, and his
enshrinement of Richard Stallman as "the last true hacker" turns out
(thankfully) to have been quite misleading.  Numerous minor factual
errors also mar the text; for example, Levy's claim that the original
Jargon File derived from the TMRC Dictionary (the File originated at
Stanford and was brought to MIT in 1976; the co-authors of the first
edition had never seen the dictionary in question).  There are also
numerous misspellings in the book that inflame the passions of
old-timers; as Dan Murphy, the author of TECO, once said: "You would
have thought he'd take the trouble to spell the name of a winning
editor right."  Nevertheless, this remains a useful and stimulating
book that captures the feel of several important hackish
subcultures.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2073>The Computer Contradictionary</A><BR>
Stan Kelly-Bootle<BR>
MIT Press, 1995<BR>
ISBN 0-262-61112-0
<P>
This pastiche of Ambrose Bierce's famous work is similar in format to
the Jargon File (and quotes several entries from TNHD-2) but somewhat
different in tone and intent.  It is more satirical and less
anthropological, and is largely a product of the author's literate and
quirky imagination.  For example, it defines `computer science' as
"a study akin to numerology and astrology, but lacking the precision
of the former and the success of the latter" and `implementation'
as "The fruitless struggle by the talented and underpaid to fulfill
promises made by the rich and ignorant"; `flowchart' becomes "to
obfuscate a problem with esoteric cartoons".  Revised and expanded
from "The Devil's DP Dictionary", McGraw-Hill 1981, ISBN
0-07-034022-6.
<P>
<A NAME=TAG2074>The Devouring Fungus: Tales from the Computer Age</A><BR>
Karla Jennings<BR>
Norton, 1990<BR>
ISBN 0-393-30732-8
<P>
The author of this pioneering compendium knits together a great deal
of computer- and hacker-related folklore with good writing and a few
well-chosen cartoons.  She has a keen eye for the human aspects of the
lore and is very good at illuminating the psychology and evolution of
hackerdom.  Unfortunately, a number of small errors and awkwardnesses
suggest that she didn't have the final manuscript checked over by a
native speaker; the glossary in the back is particularly embarrassing,
and at least one classic tale (the Magic Switch story, retold here
under  <A HREF="JARGO~45.HTM#SEC53" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_46.html#SEC53">A Story About `Magic'</A> in Appendix A is given in
incomplete and badly mangled form.  Nevertheless, this book is a win
overall and can be enjoyed by hacker and non-hacker alike.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2075>The Soul of a New Machine</A><BR>
Tracy Kidder<BR>
Little, Brown, 1981<BR>
(paperback: Avon, 1982<BR>
ISBN 0-380-59931-7)
<P>
This book (a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner) documents the adventure of
the design of a new Data General computer, the MV-8000 Eagle.  It is
an amazingly well-done portrait of the hacker mindset -- although
largely the hardware hacker -- done by a complete outsider.  It is a
bit thin in spots, but with enough technical information to be
entertaining to the serious hacker while providing non-technical
people a view of what day-to-day life can be like -- the fun, the
excitement, the disasters.  During one period, when the microcode and
logic were glitching at the nanosecond level, one of the overworked
engineers departed the company, leaving behind a note on his terminal
as his letter of resignation: "I am going to a commune in Vermont and
will deal with no unit of time shorter than a season."<P>
<A NAME=TAG2076>Life with UNIX: a Guide for Everyone</A><BR>
Don Libes and Sandy Ressler<BR>
Prentice-Hall, 1989<BR>
ISBN 0-13-536657-7
<P>
The authors of this book set out to tell you all the things about Unix
that tutorials and technical books won't.  The result is gossipy,
funny, opinionated, downright weird in spots, and invaluable.  Along
the way they expose you to enough of Unix's history, folklore and
humor to qualify as a first-class source for these things.  Because so
much of today's hackerdom is involved with Unix, this in turn
illuminates many of its in-jokes and preoccupations.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2077>True Names ... and Other Dangers</A><BR>
Vernor Vinge<BR>
Baen Books, 1987<BR>
ISBN 0-671-65363-6
<P>
Hacker demigod Richard Stallman used to say that the title story of
this book "expresses the spirit of hacking best".  Until the subject
of the next entry came out, it was hard to even nominate another
contender.  The other stories in this collection are also fine work by
an author who has since won multiple Hugos and is one of today's very
best practitioners of hard SF.<P>
<A NAME=TAG2078>Snow Crash</A><BR>
Neal Stephenson<BR>
Bantam, 1992<BR>
ISBN 0-553-56261-4
<P>
Stephenson's epic, comic cyberpunk novel is deeply knowing about the
hacker psychology and its foibles in a way no other author of fiction
has ever even approached.  His imagination, his grasp of the relevant
technical details, and his ability to communicate the excitement of
hacking and its results are astonishing, delightful, and (so far)
unsurpassed.
<P>
<A NAME=TAG2079>Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier</A><BR>
Katie Hafner &#38; John Markoff<BR>
Simon &#38; Schuster 1991<BR>
ISBN 0-671-68322-5
<P>
This book gathers narratives about the careers of three notorious
crackers into a clear-eyed but sympathetic portrait of hackerdom's
dark side.  The principals are Kevin Mitnick, "Pengo" and
"Hagbard" of the Chaos Computer Club, and Robert T. Morris (see
 <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1527" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1527">RTM</A>, sense 2) .  Markoff and Hafner focus as much on their
psychologies and motivations as on the details of their exploits, but
don't slight the latter.  The result is a balanced and fascinating
account, particularly useful when read immediately before or after
Cliff Stoll's  <A HREF="JARGO~72.HTM#TAG2081" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_70.html#TAG2081">The Cuckoo's Egg</A>.  It is especially instructive to
compare RTM, a true hacker who blundered, with the sociopathic
phone-freak Mitnick and the alienated, drug-addled crackers who made
the Chaos Club notorious.  The gulf between  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1994" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1994">wizard</A> and
 <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1937" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1937">wannabee</A> has seldom been made more obvious.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2080>Technobabble</A><BR>
John Barry<BR>
MIT Press 1991<BR>
ISBN 0-262-02333-4
<P>
Barry's book takes a critical and humorous look at the `technobabble'
of acronyms, neologisms, hyperbole, and metaphor spawned by the
computer industry.  Though he discusses some of the same mechanisms of
jargon formation that occur in hackish, most of what he chronicles is
actually suit-speak -- the obfuscatory language of press releases,
marketroids, and Silicon Valley CEOs rather than the playful jargon of
hackers (most of whom wouldn't be caught dead uttering the kind of
pompous, passive-voiced word salad he deplores).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2081>The Cuckoo's Egg</A><BR>
Clifford Stoll<BR>
Doubleday 1989<BR>
ISBN 0-385-24946-2
<P>
Clifford Stoll's absorbing tale of how he tracked Markus Hess and the
Chaos Club cracking ring nicely illustrates the difference between
`hacker' and `cracker'.  Stoll's portrait of himself, his lady Martha,
and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously
vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live
and how they think.  <P>
