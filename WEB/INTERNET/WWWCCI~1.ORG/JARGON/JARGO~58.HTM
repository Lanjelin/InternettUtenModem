Hackerdom is still predominantly male.  However, the percentage of
women is clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for
technical professions, and female hackers are generally respected and
dealt with as equals.  <P>
In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong
minorities of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast).  The
Jewish contingent has exerted a particularly pervasive cultural
influence (see  <A HREF="JARGO~60.HTM#SEC65" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_58.html#SEC65">Food</A>, above, and note that several common jargon
terms are obviously mutated Yiddish).  <P>
The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a
function of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education.  Racial
and ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with
freezing contempt.  <P>
When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and
color-blindness to a positive effect of text-only network channels,
and this is doubtless a powerful influence.  Also, the ties many
hackers have to AI research and SF literature may have helped them to
develop an idea of personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive
--- after all, if one's imagination readily grants full human rights
to future AI programs, robots, dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens,
mere color and gender can't seem very important any more.
