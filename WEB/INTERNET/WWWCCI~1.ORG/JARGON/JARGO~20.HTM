   unwanted) patterns of subject, author, or other header lines.  Thus
   to add a person (or subject) to one's kill file is to arrange for

<A NAME=TAG991><B>killer app</B></A>  <P> The application that actually makes a mass

   in the mid-1980s to describe Lotus 1-2-3 once it became evident
   that demand for that product had been the major driver of the early
   business market for IBM PCs.  The term was then restrospectively
   applied to VisiCalc, which had played a similar role in the success
   of the Apple II.  After 1994 it became commonplace to describe the
   World Wide Web as the Internet's killer app.  One of the standard
   questions asked about each new personal-computer technology as it
   emerges has become "what's the killer app?" <P>
<A NAME=TAG992><B>killer micro</B></A> /n./ <P> [popularized by Eugene Brooks] A

   supercomputer performance turf.  Often heard in "No one will
   survive the attack of the killer micros!", the battle cry of the
   downsizers.  Used esp. of RISC architectures.  <P>
   The popularity of the phrase `attack of the killer micros' is
   doubtless reinforced by the title of the movie "Attack Of The
   Killer Tomatoes" (one of the  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG250" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG250">canonical</A> examples of
   so-bad-it's-wonderful among hackers).  This has even more
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG653" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG653">flavor</A> now that killer micros have gone on the offensive not
   just individually (in workstations) but in hordes (within massively
   parallel computers).  <P>
   [1996 update: Eugene Brooks was right.  Since this term first
   entered the Jargon File in 1990, the minicomputer has effectively
   vanished, the  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1100" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1100">mainframe</A> sector is in deep and apparently
   terminal decline (with IBM but a shadow of its former self), and
   even the supercomputer business has contracted into a smaller
   niche.  It's networked killer micros as far as the eye can see.

   kludged around it for now, but I'll fix it up properly later."  <P>
   This word appears to have derived from Scots `kludge' or
   `kludgie' for a common toilet, via British military slang.  It
   apparently became confused with U.S.  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG1000" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG1000">kluge</A> during or after
   World War II; some Britons from that era use both words in
   definably different ways, but  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG1000" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG1000">kluge</A> is now uncommon in Great
   Britain.  `Kludge' in Commonwealth hackish differs in meaning from
   `kluge' in that it lacks the positive senses; a kludge is something
   no Commonwealth hacker wants to be associated too closely with.
   Also, `kludge' is more widely known in British mainstream slang
   than `kluge' is in the U.S. <P>
<A NAME=TAG1000><B>kluge</B></A> /klooj/ <P> [from the German `klug', clever; poss.
   related to Polish `klucza', a trick or hook] 1. /n./ A Rube
   Goldberg (or Heath Robinson) device, whether in hardware or
   software.  2. /n./ A clever programming trick intended to solve a
   particular nasty case in an expedient, if not clear, manner.  Often
   used to repair bugs.  Often involves  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG7" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG7">ad-hockery</A> and verges on

   better way."  5. [WPI] /n./ A feature that is implemented in a
    <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1529" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1529">rude</A> manner.  <P>
   Nowadays this term is often encountered in the variant spelling
   `kludge'.  Reports from  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1290" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1290">old fart</A>s are consistent that
   `kluge' was the original spelling, reported around computers as
   far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of
   <EM>hardware</EM> kluges.  In 1947, the "New York Folklore
   Quarterly" reported a classic shaggy-dog story `Murgatroyd the
   Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a `kluge'
   was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function.  Other
   sources report that `kluge' was common Navy slang in the WWII era
   for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but
   consistently failed at sea.  <P>
   However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade
   older.  Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of
   a device called a "Kluge paper feeder", an adjunct to mechanical
   printing presses.  Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed
   before small, cheap electric motors and control electronics; it
   relied on a fiendishly complex assortment of cams, belts, and
   linkages to both power and synchronize all its operations from one
   motive driveshaft.  It was accordingly temperamental, subject to
   frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair -- but oh,
   so clever!  People who tell this story also aver that `Kluge' was
   the name of a design engineer. <P>
   There is in fact a Brandtjen &#38; Kluge Inc., an old family business
   that manufactures printing equipment -- interestingly, their name
   is pronounced /kloo'gee/!  Henry Brandtjen, president of the
   firm, told me (ESR, 1994) that his company was co-founded by his
   father and an engineer named Kluge /kloo'gee/, who built and
   co-designed the original Kluge automatic feeder in 1919.
   Mr. Brandtjen claims, however, that this was a <EM>simple</EM> device
   (with only four cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its
   complexity took hold. <P>
    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1806" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1806">TMRC</A> and the MIT hacker culture of the early '60s seems to
   have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII
   military slang (see also  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG671" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG671">foobar</A>).  It seems likely that
   `kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics
   projects that had been located in Cambridge (many in MIT's
   venerable Building 20, in which  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1806" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1806">TMRC</A> is also located) during
   the war.  <P>
   The variant `kludge' was apparently popularized by the
    <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG420" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG420">Datamation</A> article mentioned above; it was titled "How
   to Design a Kludge" (February 1962, pp. 30, 31).  This spelling was
   probably imported from Great Britain, where  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG999" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG999">kludge</A> has an
   independent history (though this fact was largely unknown to
   hackers on either side of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in
   the Usenet group <I><a href="news:alt.folklore.computers">alt.folklore.computers</a></I> over the First and
   Second Edition versions of this entry; everybody used to think
    <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG999" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG999">kludge</A> was just a mutation of  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG1000" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG1000">kluge</A>).  It now appears that
   the British, having forgotten the etymology of their own `kludge'
   when `kluge' crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the
   `kludge' orthography in the other direction and confusing their
   American cousins' spelling!  <P>
   The result of this history is a tangle.  Many younger U.S. hackers
   pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its
   meaning and pronunciation, as `kludge'. (Phonetically, consider
   huge, refuge, centrifuge, and deluge as opposed to sludge, judge,
   budge, and fudge.  Whatever its failings in other areas, English
   spelling is perfectly consistent about this distinction.)  British
   hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted
   negative sense and are at least consistent.  European hackers have
   mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to
   pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning!  <P>
   Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's
   meaning.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1005><B>kremvax</B></A> /krem-vaks/ /n./ <P> [from the then large number of
    <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A>  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1897">VAXen</A> with names of the form <I>foovax</I>]
   Originally, a fictitious Usenet site at the Kremlin, announced on
   April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly originated there by Soviet
   leader Konstantin Chernenko.  The posting was actually forged by
   Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke.  Other fictitious sites
   mentioned in the hoax were <I>moskvax</I> and  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG985" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG985">kgbvax</A>.  This was
   probably the funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries
   perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible security against them),
   because the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron
   Curtain seemed so totally absurd at the time.  <P>
   In fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in
   Moscow, <I>demos.su</I>, joined Usenet.  Some readers needed
   convincing that the postings from it weren't just another prank.
   Vadim Antonov, senior programmer at Demos and the major poster from
   there up to mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, referred to it
   frequently in his own postings, and at one point twitted some
   credulous readers by blandly asserting that he <EM>was</EM> a
   hoax!  <P>
   Eventually he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site
   named <I>kremvax</I>, thus neatly turning fiction into fact
   and demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor transcends
   cultural barriers.  [Mr. Antonov also contributed the
   Russian-language material for this lexicon. --ESR]<P>
   In an even more ironic historical footnote, <I>kremvax</I> became an
   electronic center of the anti-communist resistance during the
   bungled hard-line coup of August 1991.  During those three days the
   Soviet UUCP network centered on <I>kremvax</I> became the only
   trustworthy news source for many places within the USSR.  Though
   the sysops were concentrating on internal communications,
   cross-border postings included immediate transliterations of Boris
   Yeltsin's decrees condemning the coup and eyewitness reports of the
   demonstrations in Moscow's streets.  In those hours, years of
   speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to maintain its
   grip on politically-loaded information in the age of computer
   networking were proved devastatingly accurate -- and the original
   <I>kremvax</I> joke became a reality as Yeltsin and the new Russian
   revolutionaries of `glasnost' and `perestroika' made
   <I>kremvax</I> one of the timeliest means of their outreach to the
   West.  <P>
