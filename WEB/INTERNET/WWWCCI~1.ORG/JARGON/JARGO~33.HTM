<A NAME=TAG1925><B>wabbit</B></A> /wab'it/ /n./ <P> [almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's
   immortal line "You wascawwy wabbit!"] 1. A legendary early hack
   reported on a System/360 at RPI and elsewhere around 1978; this may
   have descended (if only by inspiration) from a hack called RABBITS
   reported from 1969 on a Burroughs 5500 at the University of
   Washington Computer Center.  The program would make two copies of
   itself every time it was run, eventually crashing the system.
   2. By extension, any hack that includes infinite self-replication
   but is not a  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1916" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1916">virus</A> or  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG2005" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG2005">worm</A>.

<A NAME=TAG1926><B>WAITS</B></A> /wayts/ /n./ <P> The mutant cousin of  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1819" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1819">TOPS-10</A> used
   on a handful of systems at  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1539" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1539">SAIL</A> up to 1990.  There was never
   an `official' expansion of WAITS (the name itself having been
   arrived at by a rather sideways process), but it was frequently
   glossed as `West-coast Alternative to ITS'.  Though WAITS was less
   visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas
   between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS
   exerted enormous indirect influence.  The early screen modes of
    <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG548" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG548">EMACS</A>, for example, were directly inspired by WAITS's `E'
   editor -- one of a family of editors that were the first to do
   `real-time editing', in which the editing commands were invisible
   and where one typed text at the point of insertion/overwriting.
   The modern style of multi-region windowing is said to have
   originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewhere
   played major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX Star,
   the Macintosh, and the Sun workstations.  Also invented there were
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG220" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG220">bucky bits</A> -- thus, the ALT key on every IBM PC is a WAITS
   legacy.  One notable WAITS feature seldom duplicated elsewhere was
   a news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store,
   and filter AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system
   also featured a still-unusual level of support for what is now
   called `multimedia' computing, allowing analog audio and video
   signals to be switched to programming terminals.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1927><B>waldo</B></A> /wol'doh/ /n./ <P> [From Robert A. Heinlein's story
   "Waldo"] 1. A mechanical agent, such as a gripper arm,
   controlled by a human limb.  When these were developed for the
   nuclear industry in the mid-1940s they were named after the
   invention described by Heinlein in the story, which he wrote in
   1942.  Now known by the more generic term `telefactoring', this
   technology is of intense interest to NASA for tasks like space
   station maintenance.  2. At Harvard (particularly by Tom Cheatham
   and students), this is used instead of  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG671" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG671">foobar</A> as a
   metasyntactic variable and general nonsense word.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG670" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG670">foo</A>,

<A NAME=TAG1928><B>walk</B></A> /n.,vt./ <P> Traversal of a data structure, especially an
   array or linked-list data structure in  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG353" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG353">core</A>.  See also

<A NAME=TAG1929><B>walk off the end of</B></A> /vt./ <P> To run past the end of an array,
   list, or medium after stepping through it -- a good way to land in
   trouble.  Often the result of an  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1287" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1287">off-by-one error</A>.  Compare

<P>
<A NAME=TAG1930><B>walking drives</B></A> /n./ <P> An occasional failure mode of
   magnetic-disk drives back in the days when they were huge, clunky
    <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1944" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1944">washing machine</A>s.  Those old  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG474" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG474">dinosaur</A> parts carried
   terrific angular momentum; the combination of a misaligned spindle
   or worn bearings and stick-slip interactions with the floor could
   cause them to `walk' across a room, lurching alternate corners
   forward a couple of millimeters at a time.  There is a legend about
   a drive that walked over to the only door to the computer room and
   jammed it shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to
   get at it!  Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of
   drive access (a fast seek across the whole width of the disk,
   followed by a slow seek in the other direction).  Some bands of
   old-time hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing patterns
   that would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive
   races.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1931><B>wall</B></A> /interj./ <P> [WPI] 1. An indication of confusion, usually spoken
   with a quizzical tone: "Wall??"  2. A request for further
   explication.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1285" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1285">octal forty</A>.  3. [Unix, from `write
   all'] /v./ To send a message to everyone currently logged in,
   esp. with the wall(8) utility.  <P>
   It is said that sense 1 came from the idiom `like talking to a
   blank wall'.  It was originally used in situations where, after you
   had carefully answered a question, the questioner stared at you
   blankly, clearly having understood nothing that was explained.  You
   would then throw out a "Hello, wall?" to elicit some sort of
   response from the questioner.  Later, confused questioners began
   voicing "Wall?" themselves.
<P>
<A NAME=TAG1932><B>wall follower</B></A> /n./ <P> A person or algorithm that compensates for
   lack of sophistication or native stupidity by efficiently following
   some simple procedure shown to have been effective in the past.
   Used of an algorithm, this is not necessarily pejorative; it
   recalls `Harvey Wallbanger', the winning robot in an early AI
   contest (named, of course, after the cocktail).  Harvey
   successfully solved mazes by keeping a `finger' on one wall and
   running till it came out the other end.  This was inelegant, but it
   was mathematically guaranteed to work on simply-connected mazes ---
   and, in fact, Harvey outperformed more sophisticated robots that
   tried to `learn' each maze by building an internal
   representation of it.  Used of humans, the term <EM>is</EM>
   pejorative and implies an uncreative, bureaucratic, by-the-book
   mentality.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG305" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG305">code grinder</A>; compare  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG514" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG514">droid</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1933><B>wall time</B></A> /n./ <P> (also `wall clock time') 1. `Real world'
   time (what the clock on the wall shows), as opposed to the system
   clock's idea of time.  2. The real running time of a program, as
   opposed to the number of  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1793" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1793">tick</A>s required to execute it (on a
   timesharing system these always differ, as no one program gets all
   the ticks, and on multiprocessor systems with good thread support
   one may get more processor time than real time).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1934><B>wallpaper</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A file containing a listing (e.g., assembly
   listing) or a transcript, esp. a file containing a transcript of
   all or part of a login session.  (The idea was that the paper for
   such listings was essentially good only for wallpaper, as evidenced
   at Stanford, where it was used to cover windows.)  Now rare, esp.
   since other systems have developed other terms for it (e.g., PHOTO
   on TWENEX).  However, the Unix world doesn't have an equivalent
   term, so perhaps  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1934" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1934">wallpaper</A> will take hold there.  The term
   probably originated on ITS, where the commands to begin and end
   transcript files were <CODE>:WALBEG</CODE> and <CODE>:WALEND</CODE>, with
   default file <CODE>WALL PAPER</CODE> (the space was a path delimiter).
   2. The background pattern used on graphical workstations (this is
   techspeak under the `Windows' graphical user interface to
   MS-DOS).  3. `wallpaper file' /n./ The file that contains the
   wallpaper information before it is actually printed on paper.
   (Even if you don't intend ever to produce a real paper copy of the
   file, it is still called a wallpaper file.) <P>
<A NAME=TAG1935><B>wango</B></A> /wang'goh/ /n./ <P> Random bit-level  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG811" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG811">grovel</A>ling
   going on in a system during some unspecified operation.  Often used
   in combination with  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1191" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1191">mumble</A>.  For example: "You start with the
   `.o' file, run it through this postprocessor that does mumble-wango
   -- and it comes out a snazzy object-oriented executable." <P>
<A NAME=TAG1936><B>wank</B></A> /wangk/ /n.,v.,adj./ <P> [Columbia University: prob. by
   mutation from Commonwealth slang /v./ `wank', to masturbate] Used
   much as  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A> is elsewhere, as a noun denoting a clever
   technique or person or the result of such cleverness.  May describe
   (negatively) the act of hacking for hacking's sake ("Quit wanking,
   let's go get supper!") or (more positively) a  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1994" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1994">wizard</A>.  Adj.
   `wanky' describes something particularly clever (a person,
   program, or algorithm).  Conversations can also get wanky when
   there are too many wanks involved.  This excess wankiness is
   signalled by an overload of the `wankometer' (compare
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG166" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG166">bogometer</A>).  When the wankometer overloads, the conversation's
   subject must be changed, or all non-wanks will leave.  Compare
   `neep-neeping' (under  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1223" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1223">neep-neep</A>).  Usage: U.S. only.  In
   Britain and the Commonwealth this word is <EM>extremely</EM> rude and
   is best avoided unless one intends to give offense.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1937><B>wannabee</B></A> /won'*-bee/ /n./ <P> (also, more plausibly, spelled
   `wannabe') [from a term recently used to describe Madonna fans
   who dress, talk, and act like their idol; prob. originally from
   biker slang] A would-be  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG833" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG833">hacker</A>.  The connotations of this term
   differ sharply depending on the age and exposure of the subject.
   Used of a person who is in or might be entering  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1011" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1011">larval stage</A>,
   it is semi-approving; such wannabees can be annoying but most
   hackers remember that they, too, were once such creatures.  When
   used of any professional programmer, CS academic, writer, or
    <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1716" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1716">suit</A>, it is derogatory, implying that said person is trying to
   cuddle up to the hacker mystique but doesn't, fundamentally, have a
   prayer of understanding what it is all about.  Overuse of terms
   from this lexicon is often an indication of the  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1937" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1937">wannabee</A>
   nature.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1245" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1245">newbie</A>.
<P>
   Historical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different
   flavor now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago.  When the
   people who are now hackerdom's tribal elders were in  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1011" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1011">larval stage</A>, the process of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious
   and unaffected by models known in popular culture -- communities
   formed spontaneously around people who, <EM>as individuals</EM>, felt
   irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and what wannabees
   experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to become
   similarly wizardly.  Those days of innocence are gone forever;
   society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980
   included the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero,
   and the result is that some people semi-consciously set out to
   <EM>be hackers</EM> and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the
   popular image of hackers.  Fortunately, to do this really well, one
   has to actually become a wizard.  Nevertheless, old-time hackers
   tend to share a poorly articulated disquiet about the change; among
   other things, it gives them mixed feelings about the effects of
   public compendia of lore like this one.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1938><B>war dialer</B></A> /n./ <P> A cracking tool, a program that calls a given
   list or range of phone numbers and records those which answer with
   handshake tones (and so might be entry points to computer or
   telecommunications systems).  Some of these programs have become
   quite sophisticated, and can now detect modem, fax, or PBX tones
   and log each one separately.  The war dialer is one of the most
   important tools in the  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1363" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1363">phreaker</A>'s kit.  These programs evolved
   from early  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG455" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG455">demon dialer</A>s. <P>
<A NAME=TAG1939><B>warez</B></A> /weirz/ /n./ <P> Widely used in  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG365" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG365">cracker</A> subcultures
   to denote cracked version of commercial software, that is versions
   from which copy-protection has been stripped.  Hackers recognize
   this term but don't use it themselves.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1940" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1940">warez d00dz</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1940><B>warez d00dz</B></A> /weirz doodz/ /n./ <P> A substantial subculture of
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG365" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG365">cracker</A>s refer to themselves as `warez d00dz'; there is
   evidently some connection with  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG103" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG103">B1FF</A> here.  As `Ozone Pilot',
   one former warez d00d, wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software.  If
it has copy protection on it, they break the protection so
the software can be copied.  Then they distribute it around
the world via several gateways.  Warez d00dz form badass
group names like RAZOR and the like.  They put up boards
that distribute the latest ware, or pirate program.  The
whole point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the pirate
program released and distributed before any other group.  I
know, I know.  But don't ask, and it won't hurt as much.
This is how they prove their poweress [sic].  It gives them
the right to say, "I released King's Quest IVXIX before you
so obviously my testicles are larger." Again don't ask...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
   The studly thing to do if one is a warez d00d, it appears, is emit
   `0-day warez', that is copies of commercial software copied and
   cracked on the same day as its retail release.  Warez d00ds also
   hoard software in a big way, collecting untold megabytes of
   arcade-style games, pornographic GIFs, and applications they'll
   never use onto their hard disks.  As Ozone Pilot acutely observes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[BELONG] is the only word you will need to know.  Warez d00dz want to
belong.  They have been shunned by everyone, and thus turn to
cyberspace for acceptance.  That is why they always start groups like
TGW, FLT, USA and the like.  Structure makes them happy. [...]
Warez d00dz will never have a handle like "Pink Daisy" because warez
d00dz are insecure.  Only someone who is very secure with a good dose
of self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man.  More
likely you will find warez d00dz with handles like:  Doctor Death,
Deranged Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown,
Renegade Chemist, Terminator, and Twin Turbo.  They like to sound
badass when they can hide behind their terminals.  More likely, if
you were given a sample of 100 people, the person whose handle is
Hellraiser is the last person you'd associate with the name.

   magnetic-disk drives in which the read-write head planes over the

   later became the IBM 3340 featured two 30-megabyte volumes; 30--30
   became `Winchester' when somebody noticed the similarity to the
   common term for a famous Winchester rifle (in the latter, the first
   30 referred to caliber and the second to the grain weight of the

<A NAME=TAG2011><B>write-only memory</B></A> /n./ <P> The obvious antonym to `read-only
   memory'.  Out of frustration with the long and seemingly useless
   chain of approvals required of component specifications, during
   which no actual checking seemed to occur, an engineer at Signetics
   once created a specification for a write-only memory and included
   it with a bunch of other specifications to be approved.  This
   inclusion came to the attention of Signetics  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1101" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1101">management</A> only
   when regular customers started calling and asking for pricing
   information.  Signetics published a corrected edition of the data
   book and requested the return of the `erroneous' ones.  Later,
   around 1974, Signetics bought a double-page spread in
   "Electronics" magazine's April issue and used the spec as an
   April Fools' Day joke.  Instead of the more conventional
   characteristic curves, the 25120 "fully encoded, 9046 x N, Random
   Access, write-only-memory" data sheet included diagrams of "bit
   capacity vs. Temp.", "Iff vs. Vff", "Number of pins remaining
   vs. number of socket insertions", and "AQL vs. selling
   price".  The 25120 required a 6.3 VAC VFF supply, a +10V VCC, and
   VDD of 0V, @Math{+/-} 2%.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2012><B>Wrong Thing</B></A> /n./ <P> A design, action, or decision that is

   merely good -- although good -- is nevertheless the Wrong

<A NAME=TAG2013><B>wugga wugga</B></A> /wuh'g* wuh'g*/ /n./ <P> Imaginary sound that a
   computer program makes as it labors with a tedious or difficult
   task.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG396" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG396">cruncha cruncha cruncha</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG803" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG803">grind</A> (sense 4).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2014><B>wumpus</B></A> /wuhm'p*s/ /n./ <P> The central monster (and, in many
   versions, the name) of a famous family of very early computer games
   called "Hunt The Wumpus", dating back at least to 1972 (several
   years before  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG11">ADVENT</A>) on the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System.
   The wumpus lived somewhere in a cave with the topology of an
   dodecahedron's edge/vertex graph (later versions supported other
   topologies, including an icosahedron and M&ouml;bius strip). The
   player started somewhere at random in the cave with five `crooked
   arrows'; these could be shot through up to three connected rooms,
   and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions introduced the
   wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for players,
   the movement necessary to map the maze was made hazardous not
   merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you stepped on him)
   but also by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that would
   pick you up and drop you at a random location (later versions added
   `anaerobic termites' that ate arrows, bat migrations, and
   earthquakes that randomly changed pit locations).  <P>
   This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random
   graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the
   even older Star Trek games).  In this respect, as in the
   dungeon-like setting and its terse, amusing messages, it prefigured
    <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG11">ADVENT</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2052" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2052">Zork</A> and was directly ancestral to the latter
   (Zork acknowledged this heritage by including a super-bat colony).
   Today, a port is distributed with SunOS and as freeware for the
   Mac.  A C emulation of the original Basic game is available at the
   Retrocomputing Museum, <I><a href="../../tppmsgs/msgs9.htm#932" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/retro">http://www.ccil.org/retro</a></I>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2015><B>WYSIAYG</B></A> /wiz'ee-ayg/ /adj./ <P> Describes a user interface
   under which "What You See Is <EM>All</EM> You Get"; an unhappy
   variant of  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG2016" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG2016">WYSIWYG</A>.  Visual, `point-and-shoot'-style
   interfaces tend to have easy initial learning curves, but also to
   lack depth; they often frustrate advanced users who would be better
   served by a command-style interface.  When this happens, the
   frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem.  This term is most often
   used of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs.
   WYSIWYG `desktop publishing' programs, for example, are a clear
   win for creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in
   them, especially things like newsletters and presentation slides.
   When typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale
   changes the nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG
   limitations, and the increased power and flexibility of a
   command-driven formatter like  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1777" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1777">TeX</A> or Unix's  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1837" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1837">troff</A>

<A NAME=TAG2016><B>WYSIWYG</B></A> /wiz'ee-wig/ /adj./ <P> Describes a user interface
   under which "What You See Is What You Get", as opposed to one
   that uses more-or-less obscure commands that do not result in
   immediate visual feedback.  True WYSIWYG in environments supporting
   multiple fonts or graphics is a a rarely-attained ideal; there are
   variants of this term to express real-world manifestations
   including WYSIAWYG (What You See Is <EM>Almost</EM> What You Get) and
   WYSIMOLWYG (What You See Is More or Less What You Get).  All these
   can be mildly derogatory, as they are often used to refer to
   dumbed-down  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1884" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1884">user-friendly</A> interfaces targeted at
   non-programmers; a hacker has no fear of obscure commands (compare
    <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG2015" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG2015">WYSIAYG</A>).  On the other hand,  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG548" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG548">EMACS</A> was one of the very
