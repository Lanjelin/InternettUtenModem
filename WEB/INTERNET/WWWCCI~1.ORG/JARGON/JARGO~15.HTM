    <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1066" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1066">lose</A>.  `Fall over hard' equates to  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG370" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG370">crash and burn</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG583><B>fall through</B></A> /v./ <P> (n. `fallthrough', var.
   `fall-through') 1. To exit a loop by exhaustion, i.e., by having
   fulfilled its exit condition rather than via a break or exception
   condition that exits from the middle of it.  This usage appears to
   be <EM>really</EM> old, dating from the 1940s and 1950s.  2. To fail
   a test that would have passed control to a subroutine or some other
   distant portion of code.  3. In C, `fall-through' occurs when the
   flow of execution in a switch statement reaches a <CODE>case</CODE> label
   other than by jumping there from the switch header, passing a point
   where one would normally expect to find a <CODE>break</CODE>.  A trivial
   example:
<P>
<PRE>
switch (color)
{
case GREEN:
   do_green();
   break;
case PINK:
   do_pink();
   /* FALL THROUGH */
case RED:
   do_red();
   break;
default:
   do_blue();
   break;
}
</PRE>
<P>
   The variant spelling <CODE>/* FALL THRU */</CODE> is also common. <P>
   The effect of the above code is to <CODE>do_green()</CODE> when color is
   <CODE>GREEN</CODE>, <CODE>do_red()</CODE> when color is <CODE>RED</CODE>,
   <CODE>do_blue()</CODE> on any other color other than <CODE>PINK</CODE>, and
   (and this is the important part) <CODE>do_pink()</CODE> <EM>and then</EM>
   <CODE>do_red()</CODE> when color is <CODE>PINK</CODE>.  Fall-through is
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG331" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG331">considered harmful</A> by some, though there are contexts (such as
   the coding of state machines) in which it is natural; it is
   generally considered good practice to include a comment
   highlighting the fall-through where one would normally expect a
   break.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG522" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG522">Duff's device</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG584><B>fan</B></A> /n./ <P> Without qualification, indicates a fan of science
   fiction, especially one who goes to  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG325" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG325">con</A>s and tends to hang out
   with other fans.  Many hackers are fans, so this term has been
   imported from fannish slang; however, unlike much fannish slang it
   is recognized by most non-fannish hackers.  Among SF fans the
   plural is correctly `fen', but this usage is not automatic to
   hackers.  "Laura reads the stuff occasionally but isn't really a
   fan." <P>
<A NAME=TAG585><B>fandango on core</B></A> /n./ <P> [Unix/C hackers, from the Mexican
   dance] In C, a wild pointer that runs out of bounds, causing a
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG355" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG355">core dump</A>, or corrupts the <CODE>malloc(3)</CODE>  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG36" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG36">arena</A> in such
   a way as to cause mysterious failures later on, is sometimes said
   to have `done a fandango on core'.  On low-end personal machines
   without an MMU, this can corrupt the OS itself, causing massive
   lossage.  Other frenetic dances such as the rhumba, cha-cha, or
   watusi, may be substituted.

<A NAME=TAG586><B>FAQ</B></A> /F-A-Q/ or /fak/ /n./ <P> [Usenet] 1. A Frequently Asked
   Question.  2. A compendium of accumulated lore, posted periodically
   to high-volume newsgroups in an attempt to forestall such
   questions.  Some people prefer the term `FAQ list' or `FAQL'
   /fa'kl/, reserving `FAQ' for sense 1.  <P>
   This lexicon itself serves as a good example of a collection of one
   kind of lore, although it is far too big for a regular FAQ
   posting.  Examples: "What is the proper type of NULL?"  and
   "What's that funny name for the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> character?" are both
   Frequently Asked Questions.  Several FAQs refer readers to
   the Jargon File (the on-line version of this lexicon).
<P>
<A NAME=TAG587><B>FAQ list</B></A> /F-A-Q list/ or /fak list/ /n./ <P> [Usenet] Syn

<P>
<A NAME=TAG589><B>faradize</B></A> /far'*-di:z/ /v./ <P> [US Geological Survey] To start any
   hyper-addictive process or trend, or to continue adding current to
   such a trend.  Telling one user about a new octo-tetris game you
   compiled would be a faradizing act -- in two weeks you might find
   your entire department playing the faradic game.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG590><B>farkled</B></A> /far'kld/ /adj./ <P> [DeVry Institute of Technology,
   Atlanta] Syn.  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG904" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG904">hosed</A>.  Poss. owes something to Yiddish
   `farblondjet' and/or the `Farkle Family' skits on "Rowan
   and Martin's Laugh-In", a popular comedy show of the late 1960s.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG591><B>farming</B></A> /n./ <P> [Adelaide University, Australia] What the heads
   of a disk drive are said to do when they plow little furrows in the
   magnetic media.  Associated with a  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG369" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG369">crash</A>.  Typically used as
   follows: "Oh no, the machine has just crashed; I hope the hard
   drive hasn't gone  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG591" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG591">farming</A> again." <P>
<A NAME=TAG592><B>fascist</B></A> /adj./ <P> 1. Said of a computer system with excessive or
   annoying security barriers, usage limits, or access policies.  The
   implication is that said policies are preventing hackers from
   getting interesting work done.  The variant `fascistic' seems to
   have been preferred at MIT, poss. by analogy with `touristic'
   (see  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1821" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1821">tourist</A>).  2. In the design of languages and other
   software tools, `the fascist alternative' is the most restrictive
   and structured way of capturing a particular function; the
   implication is that this may be desirable in order to simplify the
   implementation or provide tighter error checking.  Compare
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG177" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG177">bondage-and-discipline language</A>, although that term is global
   rather than local.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG593><B>fat electrons</B></A> /n./ <P> Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on
   the causation of computer glitches.  Your typical electric utility
   draws its line current out of the big generators with a pair of
   coil taps located near the top of the dynamo.  When the normal tap
   brushes get dirty, they take them off line to clean them up, and
   use special auxiliary taps on the <EM>bottom</EM> of the coil.  Now,
   this is a problem, because when they do that they get not ordinary
   or `thin' electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy electrons that are
   heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator.  These flow
   down ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a sharp
   corner (as in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck.
   This is what causes computer glitches.  [Fascinating.  Obviously,
   fat electrons must gain mass by  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG167" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG167">bogon</A> absorption --ESR]

<A NAME=TAG594><B>faulty</B></A> /adj./ <P> Non-functional; buggy.  Same denotation as

   milder.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG595><B>fd leak</B></A> /F-D leek/ /n./ <P> A kind of programming bug analogous
   to a  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG356" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG356">core leak</A>, in which a program fails to close file
   descriptors (`fd's) after file operations are completed, and
   thus eventually runs out of them.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1018" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1018">leak</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG596><B>fear and loathing</B></A> /n./ <P> [from Hunter S. Thompson] A state
   inspired by the prospect of dealing with certain real-world systems
   and standards that are totally  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG194" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG194">brain-damaged</A> but ubiquitous

   PCs to be able to talk to the AI machine.  Fear and loathing
   time!" <P>
<A NAME=TAG597><B>feature</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A good property or behavior (as of a
   program).  Whether it was intended or not is immaterial.  2. An
   intended property or behavior (as of a program).  Whether it is
   good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
    <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1153" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1153">misfeature</A>).  3. A surprising property or behavior; in
   particular, one that is purposely inconsistent because it works
   better that way -- such an inconsistency is therefore a
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG597" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG597">feature</A> and not a  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG223" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG223">bug</A>.  This kind of feature is sometimes
   called a  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1156" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1156">miswart</A>; see that entry for a classic example.  4. A
   property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though
   perhaps also impressive or cute.  For example, one feature of
   Common LISP's <CODE>format</CODE> function is the ability to print
   numbers in two different Roman-numeral formats (see  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG94" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG94">bells, whistles, and gongs</A>).  5. A property or behavior that was put in
   to help someone else but that happens to be in your way.  6. A bug
   that has been documented.  To call something a feature sometimes
   means the author of the program did not consider the particular
   case, and that the program responded in a way that was unexpected
   but not strictly incorrect.  A standard joke is that a bug can be
   turned into a  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG597" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG597">feature</A> simply by documenting it (then
   theoretically no one can complain about it because it's in the
   manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good.  "That's not a
   bug, that's a feature!" is a common catchphrase.  See also

   The relationship among bugs, features, misfeatures, warts, and
   miswarts might be clarified by the following hypothetical exchange
   between two hackers on an airliner:<P>
   A: "This seat doesn't recline."
<P>
   B: "That's not a bug, that's a feature.  There is an emergency
   exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to
   be kept clear."<P>
   A: "Oh.  Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased the
   spacing between rows here."<P>
   B: "Yes.  But if they'd increased spacing in only one section it
   would have been a wart -- they would've had to make
   nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced
   seats."<P>
   A: "A miswart, actually.  If they increased spacing throughout
   they'd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin.  So
   unequal spacing would actually be the Right Thing."
<P>
   B: "Indeed."
<P>
   `Undocumented feature' is a common, allegedly humorous euphemism
   for a  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG223" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG223">bug</A>.  There's a related joke that is sometimes referred
   to as the "one-question geek test".  You say to someone "I saw a
   Volkswagen Beetle today with a vanity license plate that read
   FEATURE".  If he/she laughs, he/she is a geek (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG323" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG323">computer geek</A>, sense #2). <P>
<A NAME=TAG598><B>feature creature</B></A> /n./ <P> [poss. fr. slang `creature feature'
   for a horror movie] 1. One who loves to add features to designs or
   programs, perhaps at the expense of coherence, concision, or
    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1754" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1754">taste</A>.  2. Alternately, a mythical being that induces
   otherwise rational programmers to perpetrate such crocks.  See also

<A NAME=TAG599><B>feature key</B></A> /n./ <P> The Macintosh key with the cloverleaf
   graphic on its keytop; sometimes referred to as `flower',
   `pretzel', `clover', `propeller', `beanie' (an apparent
   reference to the major feature of a propeller beanie),  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1682" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1682">splat</A>,
   or the `command key'.  The Mac's equivalent of an  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG23" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG23">alt</A> key.
   The proliferation of terms for this creature may illustrate one
   subtle peril of iconic interfaces.  <P>
   Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
   appears on the feature key.  Its oldest name is `cross of St.
   Hannes', but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative
   motif.  Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to
   mark sites of historical interest.  Apple picked up the symbol from
   an early Mac developer who happened to be Swedish.  Apple
   documentation gives the translation "interesting feature"!<P>
   There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this
   symbol.  It technically stands for the word `sev&auml;rdhet'
   (interesting feature); many of these are old churches. Some Swedes
   report as an idiom for it the word `kyrka', cognate to English
   `church' and Scots-dialect `kirk' but pronounced /shir'k*/ in
   modern Swedish.  Others say this is nonsense.  Another idiom
   reported for the sign is `runsten' /roon'stn/, derived from
   the fact that many of the interesting features are Viking
   rune-stones. <P>
<A NAME=TAG600><B>feature shock</B></A> /n./ <P> [from Alvin Toffler's book title
   "Future Shock"] A user's (or programmer's!) confusion when
   confronted with a package that has too many features and poor
   introductory material.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG601><B>featurectomy</B></A> /fee`ch*r-ek't*-mee/ /n./ <P> The act of removing
   a feature from a program.  Featurectomies come in two flavors, the
   `righteous' and the `reluctant'.  Righteous featurectomies are
   performed because the remover believes the program would be more
   elegant without the feature, or there is already an equivalent and
   better way to achieve the same end.  (Doing so is not quite the
   same thing as removing a  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1153" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1153">misfeature</A>.)  Reluctant
   featurectomies are performed to satisfy some external constraint
   such as code size or execution speed.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG602><B>feep</B></A> /feep/ <P> 1. /n./ The soft electronic `bell' sound of a
   display terminal (except for a VT-52); a beep (in fact, the
   microcomputer world seems to prefer  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG91" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG91">beep</A>).  2. /vi./ To cause
   the display to make a feep sound.  ASR-33s (the original TTYs) do
   not feep; they have mechanical bells that ring.  Alternate forms:
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG91" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG91">beep</A>, `bleep', or just about anything suitably onomatopoeic.
   (Jeff MacNelly, in his comic strip "Shoe", uses the word
   `eep' for sounds made by computer terminals and video games; this
   is perhaps the closest written approximation yet.)  The term
   `breedle' was sometimes heard at SAIL, where the terminal
   bleepers are not particularly soft (they sound more like the
   musical equivalent of a raspberry or Bronx cheer; for a close
   approximation, imagine the sound of a Star Trek communicator's beep
   lasting for five seconds).  The `feeper' on a VT-52 has been
   compared to the sound of a '52 Chevy stripping its gears.  See also

   deliberate spoonerism for  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG380" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG380">creeping featurism</A>, meant to imply
   that the system or program in question has become a misshapen
   creature of hacks.  This term isn't really well defined, but it
   sounds so neat that most hackers have said or heard it.  It is
   probably reinforced by an image of terminals prowling about in the
   dark making their customary noises.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG606><B>feetch feetch</B></A> /feech feech/ /interj./ <P> If someone tells you
   about some new improvement to a program, you might respond:
   "Feetch, feetch!"  The meaning of this depends critically on
   vocal inflection.  With enthusiasm, it means something like "Boy,
   that's great!  What a great hack!"  Grudgingly or with obvious
   doubt, it means "I don't know; it sounds like just one more
   unnecessary and complicated thing".  With a tone of resignation,
   it means, "Well, I'd rather keep it simple, but I suppose it has
   to be done".  <P>
<A NAME=TAG607><B>fence</B></A> /n./ 1. <P> A sequence of one or more distinguished
   ( <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1313" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1313">out-of-band</A>) characters (or other data items), used to
   delimit a piece of data intended to be treated as a unit (the
   computer-science literature calls this a `sentinel').  The NUL
   (ASCII 0000000) character that terminates strings in C is a fence.
   Hex FF is also (though slightly less frequently) used this way.
   See  <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2047" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2047">zigamorph</A>.  2. An extra data value inserted in an array or
   other data structure in order to allow some normal test on the
   array's contents also to function as a termination test.  For
   example, a highly optimized routine for finding a value in an array
   might artificially place a copy of the value to be searched for
   after the last slot of the array, thus allowing the main search
   loop to search for the value without having to check at each pass
   whether the end of the array had been reached.  3. [among users of
   optimizing compilers] Any technique, usually exploiting knowledge
   about the compiler, that blocks certain optimizations.  Used when
   explicit mechanisms are not available or are overkill.  Typically a
   hack: "I call a dummy procedure there to force a flush of the
   optimizer's register-coloring info" can be expressed by the
   shorter "That's a fence procedure".  <P>
<A NAME=TAG608><B>fencepost error</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A problem with the discrete
   equivalent of a boundary condition, often exhibited in programs by
   iterative loops.  From the following problem: "If you build a
   fence 100 feet long with posts 10 feet apart, how many posts do you
   need?"  (Either 9 or 11 is a better answer than the obvious 10.)
   For example, suppose you have a long list or array of items, and
   want to process items @Math{m} through @Math{n}; how many items are
   there?  The obvious answer is @Math{n - m}, but that is off by one;
   the right answer is @Math{n - m + 1}.  A program that used the
   `obvious' formula would have a fencepost error in it.  See also
    <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2046" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2046">zeroth</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1287" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1287">off-by-one error</A>, and note that not all
   off-by-one errors are fencepost errors.  The game of Musical Chairs
   involves a catastrophic off-by-one error where @Math{N} people try
   to sit in @Math{N - 1} chairs, but it's not a fencepost error.
   Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces
   between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether
   one should count one or both ends of a row.  2. [rare] An error
   induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which can (for
   instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary tree
   or hash table implementation.  (The error here involves the
   difference between expected and worst case behaviors of an
   algorithm.) <P>

   It is possible that the hackish sense of `flame' is much older than
   that.  The poet Chaucer was also what passed for a wizard hacker in
   his time; he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, the most advanced
   computing device of the day.  In Chaucer's "Troilus and
   Cressida", Cressida laments her inability to grasp the proof of a
   particular mathematical theorem; her uncle Pandarus then observes
   that it's called "the fleminge of wrecches."  This phrase seems
   to have been intended in context as "that which puts the wretches
   to flight" but was probably just as ambiguous in Middle English as
   "the flaming of wretches" would be today.  One suspects that
   Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet.  <P>

   quarks (the constituents of, e.g., protons) come in six flavors
   (up, down, strange, charm, top, bottom) and three colors (red,
   blue, green) -- however, hackish use of `flavor' at MIT predated
   QCD.  3. The term for `class' (in the object-oriented sense) in
   the LISP Machine Flavors system.  Though the Flavors design has

<A NAME=TAG657><B>flowchart</B></A> /n./ <P> [techspeak] An archaic form of visual

   consider them extremely silly, and associate them with  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG303" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG303">COBOL</A>

   This attitude follows from the observations that flowcharts (at
   least from a hacker's point of view) are no easier to read than
   code, are less precise, and tend to fall out of sync with the code
   (so that they either obfuscate it rather than explaining it, or

<A NAME=TAG659><B>flush</B></A> /v./ <P> 1. To delete something, usually superfluous, or to
   abort an operation.  "All that nonsense has been flushed."
   2. [Unix/C] To force buffered I/O to disk, as with an
   <CODE>fflush(3)</CODE> call.  This is <EM>not</EM> an abort or deletion as
   in sense 1, but a demand for early completion!  3. To leave at the
   end of a day's work (as opposed to leaving for a meal).  "I'm
   going to flush now."  "Time to flush."  4. To exclude someone
   from an activity, or to ignore a person.
<P>
   `Flush' was standard ITS terminology for aborting an output
   operation; one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but
   was not, as having been flushed.  It is speculated that this term
   arose from a vivid image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing
   down the internal output buffer, washing the characters away before
   they could be printed.  The Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was
   propagated by the <CODE>fflush(3)</CODE> call in C's standard I/O library
   (though it is reported to have been in use among BLISS programmers
   at DEC and on Honeywell and IBM machines as far back as 1965).
   Unix/C hackers find the ITS usage confusing, and vice versa.

   The etymology of hackish `foo' is obscure.  When used in
   connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the WWII-era Army
   slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All Repair'), later
   bowdlerized to  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG671" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG671">foobar</A>.  (See also  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG710" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG710">FUBAR</A>.)  <P>
   However, the use of the word `foo' itself has more complicated
   antecedents, including a long history in comic strips and cartoons.
   The old "Smokey Stover" comic strips by Bill Holman often
   included the word `FOO', in particular on license plates of cars;
   allegedly, `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's
   "Pogo" strips.  In the 1938 cartoon "The Daffy Doc", a very
   early version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying "SILENCE IS
   FOO!"; oddly, this seems to refer to some approving or positive
   affirmative use of foo.  It has been suggested that this might be
   related to the Chinese word `fu' (sometimes transliterated
   `foo'), which can mean "happiness" when spoken with the proper
   tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese
   restaurants are properly called "fu dogs").  <P>
   Paul Dickson's excellent book "Words" (Dell, 1982, ISBN
   0-440-52260-7) traces "Foo" to an unspecified British naval
   magazine in 1946, quoting as follows: "Mr. Foo is a mysterious
   Second World War product, gifted with bitter omniscience and
   sarcasm." <P>
   Other sources confirm that `FOO' was a semi-legendary subject of
   WWII British-army graffiti more-or-less equivalent to the American
   Kilroy.  Where British troops went, the graffito "FOO was here"
   or something similar showed up.  Several slang dictionaries aver
   that FOO probably came from Forward Observation Officer.  In this
   connection, the later American military slang `foo fighters' is
   interesting; at least as far back as the 1950s, radar operators
   used it for the kind of mysterious or spurious trace that would
   later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced in popular
   American usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better
   grunge-rock bands). <P>
   Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that
   hacker usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and Parody",
   the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint
   project of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in
   his mid-teens) later became one of the most important and
   influential artists in underground comics, this venture was hardly
   a success; indeed, the brothers later burned most of the existing
   copies in disgust.  The title FOO was featured in large letters on
   the front cover.  However, very few copies of this comic actually
   circulated, and students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have established
   that this title was a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover
   comics.  <P>
   An old-time member reports that in the 1959 "Dictionary of the

   the entire staff of what later became the MIT AI Lab was involved

   The Algol 68-R compiler used to initialize its storage to the
   character string "F00LF00LF00LF00L..."  because as a pointer or as
   a floating point number it caused a crash, and as an integer or a
   character string it was very recognizable in a dump.  Sadly, one
   day a very senior professor at Nottingham University wrote a
   program that called him a fool.  He proceeded to demonstrate the
   correctness of this assertion by lobbying the university (not quite

<A NAME=TAG674><B>Foonly</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. The  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1345" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1345">PDP-10</A> successor that was to have
   been built by the Super Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial
   Intelligence Laboratory along with a new operating system.  The
   intention was to leapfrog from the old DEC timesharing system SAIL
   was then running to a new generation, bypassing TENEX which at that
   time was the ARPANET standard.  ARPA funding for both the Super
   Foonly and the new operating system was cut in 1974.  Most of the
   design team went to DEC and contributed greatly to the design of
   the PDP-10 model KL10.  2. The name of the company formed by Dave
   Poole, one of the principal Super Foonly designers, and one of
   hackerdom's more colorful personalities.  Many people remember the
   parrot which sat on Poole's shoulder and was a regular companion.
   3. Any of the machines built by Poole's company.  The first was the
   F-1 (a.k.a.  Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used
   to create the graphics in the movie "TRON".  The F-1 was the
   fastest PDP-10 ever built, but only one was ever made.  The effort
   drained Foonly of its financial resources, and the company turned
   towards building smaller, slower, and much less expensive machines.
   Unfortunately, these ran not the popular  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1820" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1820">TOPS-20</A> but a TENEX
   variant called Foonex; this seriously limited their market.  Also,
   the machines shipped were actually wire-wrapped engineering
   prototypes requiring individual attention from more than usually
   competent site personnel, and thus had significant reliability
   problems.  Poole's legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer
   fools gladly did not help matters.  By the time of the Jupiter
   project cancellation in 1983, Foonly's proposal to build another
   F-1 was eclipsed by the  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1112" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1112">Mars</A>, and the company never quite

   3. <DFN>RAM footprint</DFN>: The minimum amount of RAM which an OS or other
   program takes; this figure gives one one an idea of how much will
   be left for other applications.  How actively this RAM is used is
   another matter entirely.  Recent tendencies to featuritis and

   overpriced products.  2. Describes a program with a limited
   interface, deliberately limited capabilities, non-orthogonality,
   inability to compose primitives, or any other limitation designed
   to not `confuse' a naive user.  This places an upper bound on
   how far that user can go before the program begins to get in the
   way of the task instead of helping accomplish it.  Used in
   reference to Macintosh software which doesn't provide obvious
   capabilities because it is thought that the poor lusers might not
   be able to handle them.  Becomes `the rest of <EM>them</EM>' when
   used in third-party reference; thus, "Yes, it is an attractive
   program, but it's designed for The Rest Of Them" means a program

   random number and realizes that it was not recognized as such, but
   even `non-random' numbers are occasionally used in this fashion.
   A related joke is that @Math{pi} equals 3 -- for small values

   Historical note: at MIT this usage has traditionally been traced to
   the programming language MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), an
   Algol-58-like language that was the most common choice among
   mainstream (non-hacker) users at MIT in the mid-60s.  It inherited
   from Algol-58 a control structure FOR VALUES OF X = 3, 7, 99 DO
   ... that would repeat the indicated instructions for each value in
   the list (unlike the usual FOR that only works for arithmetic
   sequences of values).  MAD is long extinct, but similar
   for-constructs still flourish (e.g., in Unix's shell languages). <P>

<A NAME=TAG692><B>freeze</B></A> /v./ <P> To lock an evolving software distribution or

   bug and we'll freeze for release." <P>
   There are more specific constructions on this term.  A `feature
   freeze', for example, locks out modifications intended to introduce
   new features but still allows bugfixes and completion of existing
   features; a `code freeze' connotes no more changes at all.  At
   Sun Microsystems and elsewhere, one may also hear references to
   `code slush' -- that is, an almost-but-not-quite frozen state.

   to request  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1994" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1994">wizard</A> privileges on the `professional courtesy'
   grounds that one is a wizard elsewhere.  The command is actually
   `frobnicate' but is universally abbreviated to the shorter form.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG698><B>frobnicate</B></A> /frob'ni-kayt/ /vt./ <P> [Poss. derived from
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG699" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG699">frobnitz</A>, and usually abbreviated to  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG697" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG697">frob</A>, but
   `frobnicate' is recognized as the official full form.] To
   manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  One frequently frobs bits or other
   2-state devices.  Thus: "Please frob the light switch" (that is,
   flip it), but also "Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break it".
   One also sees the construction `to frob a frob'.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1852" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1852">tweak</A>

   Usage: frob, twiddle, and tweak sometimes connote points along a
   continuum.  `Frob' connotes aimless manipulation; `twiddle'
   connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper
   setting; `tweak' connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is turning a
   knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it, he is
   probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the
   screen, he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it
   because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.  The variant
   `frobnosticate' has been recently reported.  <P>

   `frobule' (/frob'yool/).  Starting perhaps in 1979, `frobozz'
   /fr*-boz'/ (plural: `frobbotzim' /fr*-bot'zm/) has also
   become very popular, largely through its exposure as a name via

   "Under the TMRC [railroad] layout were many storage boxes, managed
   (in 1958) by David R. Sawyer.  Several had fanciful designations
   written on them, such as `Frobnitz Coil Oil'.  Perhaps DRS intended

<A NAME=TAG701><B>frogging</B></A> [University of Waterloo] /v./ <P> 1. Partial corruption
   of a text file or input stream by some bug or consistent glitch, as
   opposed to random events like line noise or media failures.  Might
   occur, for example, if one bit of each incoming character on a tty
   were stuck, so that some characters were correct and others were

   of text in a mode where the output device emits special symbols or
   mnemonics rather than conventional ASCII.  This often happens, for
   example, when using a terminal or comm program on a device like an
   IBM PC with a special `high-half' character set and with the
   bit-parity assumption wrong.  A hacker sufficiently familiar with

   a conversation with someone who is making replies without paying
   attention.  "Look at the dancing elephants!"  "Uh-huh."  "Do
   you know what I just said?"  "Sorry, you were talking to the

<A NAME=TAG706><B>FRS</B></A> // /n./ <P> Abbreviation for "Freely Redistributable

   [This entry is an extreme example of the hackish habit of coining
   elaborate and evocative terms for lossage. Here we see a quite
   self-conscious parody of mainstream expletives that has become a

   hackish tendency to turn any situation, even one of extreme
   frustration, into an intellectual game (the point being, in this
   case, to creatively produce a long-winded description of the
   most anatomically absurd mental image possible -- the short forms
   implicitly allude to all the ridiculous long forms ever spoken).
   Scatological language is actually relatively uncommon among

   numbers being compared for equality must be allowed to differ by a
   small amount; if that amount is too small, a computation may never
   terminate, while if it is too large, results will be needlessly
   inaccurate.  Fudge factors are frequently adjusted incorrectly by
   programmers who don't fully understand their import.  See also

<A NAME=TAG719><B>funky</B></A> /adj./ <P> Said of something that functions, but in a
   slightly strange, klugey way.  It does the job and would be
   difficult to change, so its obvious non-optimality is left alone.
   Often used to describe interfaces.  The more bugs something has
   that nobody has bothered to fix because workarounds are easier, the
   funkier it is.   <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1760" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1760">TECO</A> and UUCP are funky.  The Intel i860's
   exception handling is extraordinarily funky.  Most standards
   acquire funkiness as they age.  "The new mailer is installed, but
   is still somewhat funky; if it bounces your mail for no reason, try
   resubmitting it."  "This UART is pretty funky.  The data ready
   line is active-high in interrupt mode and active-low in DMA mode."  <P>
<A NAME=TAG720><B>funny money</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. Notional `dollar' units of computing
   time and/or storage handed to students at the beginning of a
   computer course; also called `play money' or `purple money' (in
   implicit opposition to real or `green' money).  In New Zealand
   and Germany the odd usage `paper money' has been recorded; in
   Germany, the particularly amusing synonym `transfer ruble'
   commemmorates the funny money used for trade between COMECON
   countries back when the Soviet Bloc still existed.  When your funny
   money ran out, your account froze and you needed to go to a
   professor to get more.  Fortunately, the plunging cost of
   timesharing cycles has made this less common.  The amounts
   allocated were almost invariably too small, even for the
   non-hackers who wanted to slide by with minimum work.  In extreme
   cases, the practice led to small-scale black markets in bootlegged
   computer accounts.  2. By extension, phantom money or quantity
   tickets of any kind used as a resource-allocation hack within a
   system.  Antonym: `real money'.  <P>
