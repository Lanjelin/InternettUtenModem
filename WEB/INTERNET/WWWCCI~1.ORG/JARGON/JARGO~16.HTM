<A NAME=TAG723><B>G</B></A> /pref.,suff./ <P> [SI] See  <A HREF="JARGO~31.HTM#TAG1443" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_32.html#TAG1443">quantifiers</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG724><B>g-file</B></A> /n./ <P> [Commodore BBS culture] Any file that is written
   with the intention of being read by a human rather than a machine,
   such as the Jargon File, documentation, humor files, hacker lore,
   and technical materials. <P>
   This term survives from the nearly forgotten Commodore 64
   underground and BBS community. In the early 80s, C-Net had emerged
   as the most popular C64 BBS software for systems which encouraged
   messaging (as opposed to file transfer).  There were three main
   options for files: Program files (p-files), which served the same
   function as `doors' in today's systems, UD files (the user
   upload/download section), and g-files.  Anything that was meant to
   be read was included in g-files.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG725><B>gabriel</B></A> /gay'bree-*l/ /n./ <P> [for Dick Gabriel, SAIL LISP
   hacker and volleyball fanatic] An unnecessary (in the opinion of
   the opponent) stalling tactic, e.g., tying one's shoelaces or
   combing one's hair repeatedly, asking the time, etc.  Also used to
   refer to the perpetrator of such tactics.  Also, `pulling a
   Gabriel', `Gabriel mode'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG726><B>gag</B></A> /vi./ <P> Equivalent to  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG283" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG283">choke</A>, but connotes more
   disgust. "Hey, this is FORTRAN code.  No wonder the C compiler
   gagged."  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG75" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG75">barf</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG727><B>gang bang</B></A> /n./ <P> The use of large numbers of loosely coupled
   programmers in an attempt to wedge a great many features into a
   product in a short time.  Though there have been memorable gang
   bangs (e.g., that over-the-weekend assembler port mentioned in
   Steven Levy's "Hackers"), most are perpetrated by large
   companies trying to meet deadlines; the inevitable result is
   enormous buggy masses of code entirely lacking in
    <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1308" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1308">orthogonal</A>ity.  When market-driven managers make a list of all
   the features the competition has and assign one programmer to
   implement each, the probability of maintaining a coherent (or even
   functional) design goes infinitesimal.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG627" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG627">firefighting</A>,

   variable (see  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG670" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG670">foo</A>); once popular among SAIL hackers.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG730><B>gas</B></A> <P> [as in `gas chamber'] 1. /interj./ A term of disgust
   and hatred, implying that gas should be dispensed in generous
   quantities, thereby exterminating the source of irritation.  "Some
   loser just reloaded the system for no reason!  Gas!"  2. /interj./ A
   suggestion that someone or something ought to be flushed out of
   mercy.  "The system's getting  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1951" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1951">wedged</A> every few minutes.
   Gas!"  3. /vt./  To  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG659" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG659">flush</A> (sense 1).  "You should gas that old
   crufty software."  4. [IBM] /n./ Dead space in nonsequentially
   organized files that was occupied by data that has since been
   deleted; the compression operation that removes it is called
   `degassing' (by analogy, perhaps, with the use of the same term
   in vacuum technology).  5. [IBM] /n./ Empty space on a disk that has
   been clandestinely allocated against future need.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG731><B>gaseous</B></A> /adj./ <P> Deserving of being  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG730" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG730">gas</A>sed.  Disseminated
   by Geoff Goodfellow while at SRI; became particularly popular after
   the Moscone-Milk killings in San Francisco, when it was learned
   that the defendant Dan White (a politician who had supported
   Proposition 7) would get the gas chamber under Proposition 7 if
   convicted of first-degree murder (he was eventually convicted of
   manslaughter).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG732><B>gawble</B></A> /gaw'bl/ /n./ <P> See  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG273" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG273">chawmp</A>. <P>
<A NAME=TAG733><B>GC</B></A> /G-C/ <P> [from LISP terminology; `Garbage Collect']
   1. /vt./ To clean up and throw away useless things.  "I think I'll
   GC the top of my desk today."  When said of files, this is
   equivalent to  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG748" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG748">GFR</A>.  2. /vt./ To recycle, reclaim, or put to
   another use.  3. /n./ An instantiation of the garbage collector
   process.  <P>
   `Garbage collection' is computer-science techspeak for a
   particular class of strategies for dynamically but transparently
   reallocating computer memory (i.e., without requiring explicit
   allocation and deallocation by higher-level software).  One such
   strategy involves periodically scanning all the data in memory and
   determining what is no longer accessible; useless data items are
   then discarded so that the memory they occupy can be recycled and
   used for another purpose.  Implementations of the LISP language
   usually use garbage collection.  <P>
   In jargon, the full phrase is sometimes heard but the  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG1" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG1">abbrev</A>
   GC is more frequently used because it is shorter.  Note that there
   is an ambiguity in usage that has to be resolved by context: "I'm
   going to garbage-collect my desk" usually means to clean out the
   drawers, but it could also mean to throw away or recycle the desk
   itself.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG734><B>GCOS</B></A> /jee'kohs/ /n./ <P> A  <A HREF="JARGO~31.HTM#TAG1447" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_32.html#TAG1447">quick-and-dirty</A>  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG299" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG299">clone</A> of
   System/360 DOS that emerged from GE around 1970; originally called
   GECOS (the General Electric Comprehensive Operating System).  Later
   kluged to support primitive timesharing and transaction processing.
   After the buyout of GE's computer division by Honeywell, the name
   was changed to General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS).
   Other OS groups at Honeywell began referring to it as `God's Chosen
   Operating System', allegedly in reaction to the GCOS crowd's
   uninformed and snotty attitude about the superiority of their
   product.  All this might be of zero interest, except for two facts:
   (1) The GCOS people won the political war, and this led in the
   orphaning and eventual death of Honeywell  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1188" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1188">Multics</A>, and (2)
   GECOS/GCOS left one permanent mark on Unix.  Some early Unix
   systems at Bell Labs used GCOS machines for print spooling and
   various other services; the field added to <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> to
   carry GCOS ID information was called the `GECOS field' and
   survives today as the <CODE>pw_gecos</CODE> member used for the user's
   full name and other human-ID information.  GCOS later played a
   major role in keeping Honeywell a dismal also-ran in the mainframe
   market, and was itself ditched for Unix in the late 1980s when
   Honeywell retired its aging  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG106" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG106">big iron</A> designs.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG735><B>GECOS</B></A> /jee'kohs/ /n./ <P> See  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG734" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG734">GCOS</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG736><B>gedanken</B></A> /g*-dahn'kn/ /adj./ <P> Ungrounded; impractical; not
   well-thought-out; untried; untested.  <P>
   `Gedanken' is a German word for `thought'.  A thought
   experiment is one you carry out in your head.  In physics, the term
   `gedanken experiment' is used to refer to an experiment that is
   impractical to carry out, but useful to consider because it can
   be reasoned about theoretically.  (A classic gedanken experiment of
   relativity theory involves thinking about a man in an elevator
   accelerating through space.)  Gedanken experiments are very useful
   in physics, but must be used with care.  It's too easy to idealize
   away some important aspect of the real world in constructing the
   `apparatus'.  <P>
   Among hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation.
   It is typically used of a project, especially one in artificial
   intelligence research, that is written up in grand detail
   (typically as a Ph.D.  thesis) without ever being implemented to
   any great extent.  Such a project is usually perpetrated by people
   who aren't very good hackers or find programming distasteful or are
   just in a hurry.  A `gedanken thesis' is usually marked by an
   obvious lack of intuition about what is programmable and what is
   not, and about what does and does not constitute a clear
   specification of an algorithm.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG15" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG15">AI-complete</A>,

<A NAME=TAG738><B>geek code</B></A> /n./ <P> (also "Code of the Geeks"). A set of
   codes commonly used in  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1607" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1607">sig block</A>s to broadcast the interests,
   skills, and aspirations of the poster.  Features a G at the left
   margin followed by numerous letter codes, often suffixed with
   plusses or minuses.  Because many net users are involved in
   computer science, the most common prefix is `GCS'.  To see a copy

   The geek code originated in 1993; it was inspired (according to the
   inventor) by previous "bear", "smurf" and "twink"
   style-and-sexual-preference codes from lesbian and gay
    <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1251" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1251">newsgroup</A>s. It has in turn spawned imitators; there is now
   even a "Saturn geek code" for owners of the Saturn car.  See also

<A NAME=TAG739><B>geek out</B></A> /vi./ <P> To temporarily enter techno-nerd mode while in
   a non-hackish context, for example at parties held near computer
   equipment.  Especially used when you need to do or say something
   highly technical and don't have time to explain: "Pardon me while
   I geek out for a moment."  See  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG323" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG323">computer geek</A>; see also

<A NAME=TAG740><B>gen</B></A> /jen/ /n.,v./ <P> Short for  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG743" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG743">generate</A>, used frequently
   in both spoken and written contexts.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG741><B>gender mender</B></A> /n./ <P> A cable connector shell with either two
   male or two female connectors on it, used to correct the mismatches
   that result when some  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1068" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1068">loser</A> didn't understand the RS232C
   specification and the distinction between DTE and DCE.  Used
   esp. for RS-232C parts in either the original D-25 or the IBM
   PC's bogus D-9 format.  Also called `gender bender', `gender
   blender', `sex changer', and even `homosexual adapter;'
   however, there appears to be some confusion as to whether a `male
   homosexual adapter' has pins on both sides (is doubly male) or
   sockets on both sides (connects two males).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG742><B>General Public Virus</B></A> /n./ <P> Pejorative name for some versions
   of the  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG765" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG765">GNU</A> project  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG351" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG351">copyleft</A> or General Public License

   copylefted code must be source-distributed on the same
   counter-commercial terms as GNU stuff.  Thus it is alleged that the
   copyleft `infects' software generated with GNU tools, which may
   in turn infect other software that reuses any of its code.  The
   Free Software Foundation's official position as of January 1991 is
   that copyright law limits the scope of the GPL to "programs
   textually incorporating significant amounts of GNU code", and that
   the `infection' is not passed on to third parties unless actual
   GNU source is transmitted (as in, for example, use of the Bison
   parser skeleton).  Nevertheless, widespread suspicion that the
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG351" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG351">copyleft</A> language is `boobytrapped' has caused many
   developers to avoid using GNU tools and the GPL.  Recent (July
   1991) changes in the language of the version 2.00 license may
   eliminate this problem.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG743><B>generate</B></A> /vt./ <P> To produce something according to an algorithm
   or program or set of rules, or as a (possibly unintended) side
   effect of the execution of an algorithm or program.  The opposite

   1. /v./  To invent a new name for something temporary, in such a way
   that the name is almost certainly not in conflict with one already
   in use.  2. /n./  The resulting name.  The canonical form of a gensym
   is `Gnnnn' where nnnn represents a number; any LISP hacker would
   recognize G0093 (for example) as a gensym.  3. A freshly generated
   data structure with a gensymmed name.  Gensymmed names are useful
   for storing or uniquely identifying crufties (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG390" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG390">cruft</A>).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG746><B>Get a life!</B></A> /imp./ <P> Hacker-standard way of suggesting that the

   (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG323" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG323">computer geek</A>).  Often heard on  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A>, esp. as a

   William Shatner on a "Saturday Night Live" episode in a
   speech that ended "Get a <EM>life</EM>!", but some respondents

   All these uses of `glitch' derive from the specific technical
   meaning the term has in the electronic hardware world, where it is
   now techspeak.  A glitch can occur when the inputs of a circuit

   very brief time before they settle down to the correct value.  If
   another circuit inspects the output at just the wrong time, reading
   the random value, the results can be very wrong and very hard to
   debug (a glitch is one of many causes of electronic  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG874" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG874">heisenbug</A>s).  <P>

   one whose job is to run and fetch things.  Finally, observe that
   gophers (aka woodchucks) dig long tunnels, and the idea of
   tunneling through the net to find information was a defining
   metaphor for the developers.  Probably all three things were true,

   Decades ago, back in the days when it was the sole supplier of
   long-distance hardcopy transmittal devices, the Teletype
   Corporation was faced with a major design choice.  To shorten code
   lengths and cut complexity in the printing mechanism, it had been
   decided that teletypes would use a monocase font, either ALL UPPER
   or all lower.  The Question Of The Day was therefore, which one to
   choose.  A study was conducted on readability under various
   conditions of bad ribbon, worn print hammers, etc.  Lowercase won;
   it is less dense and has more distinctive letterforms, and is thus
   much easier to read both under ideal conditions and when the
   letters are mangled or partly obscured.  The results were filtered
   up through  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1101" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1101">management</A>.  The chairman of Teletype killed the
   proposal because it failed one incredibly important criterion:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   "It would be impossible to spell the name of the Deity

<P>
   In this way (or so, at least, hacker folklore has it) superstition
   triumphed over utility.  Teletypes were the major input devices on
   most early computers, and terminal manufacturers looking for
   corners to cut naturally followed suit until well into the 1970s.

   Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind
   crank -- the R1, a research machine built toward the end of the
   days of the great vacuum tube computers, in 1959.  R1 (also known
   as `The Rice Institute Computer' (TRIC) and later as `The Rice
   University Computer' (TRUC)) had a single-step/free-run switch for
   use when debugging programs.  Since single-stepping through a large
   program was rather tedious, there was also a crank with a cam and
   gear arrangement that repeatedly pushed the single-step button.
   This allowed one to `crank' through a lot of code, then slow
   down to single-step for a bit when you got near the code of
   interest, poke at some registers using the console typewriter, and
   then keep on cranking.  <P>

   `to be one with'] The emphatic form is `grok in
   fullness'. 1. To understand, usually in a global sense.  Connotes
   intimate and exhaustive knowledge.  Contrast  <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2042" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2042">zen</A>, which is
   similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash.

   sufficient understanding.  "Almost all C compilers grok the
   <CODE>void</CODE> type these days."<P>
<A NAME=TAG808><B>gronk</B></A> /gronk/ /vt./ <P> [popularized by Johnny Hart's comic
   strip "B.C." but the word apparently predates that] 1. To
   clear the state of a wedged device and restart it.  More severe
   than `to  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG697" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG697">frob</A>' (sense 2).  2. [TMRC] To cut, sever, smash,
   or similarly disable.  3. The sound made by many 3.5-inch diskette

   "grink, gronk".  <P>
<A NAME=TAG809><B>gronk out</B></A> /vi./ <P> To cease functioning.  Of people, to go home
   and go to sleep.  "I guess I'll gronk out now; see you all
   tomorrow." <P>
<A NAME=TAG810><B>gronked</B></A> /adj./ <P> 1. Broken.  "The teletype scanner was
   gronked, so we took the system down."  2. Of people, the condition
   of feeling very tired or (less commonly) sick.  "I've been chasing
   that bug for 17 hours now and I am thoroughly gronked!"  Compare
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG207" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG207">broken</A>, which means about the same as  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG808" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG808">gronk</A> used of
   hardware, but connotes depression or mental/emotional problems in
   people.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG811><B>grovel</B></A> /vi./ <P> 1. To work interminably and without apparent
   progress.  Often used transitively with `over' or `through'.
   "The file scavenger has been groveling through the /usr

    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG395" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG395">crunch</A>.  Emphatic form: `grovel obscenely'.  2. To examine
   minutely or in complete detail.  "The compiler grovels over the
   entire source program before beginning to translate it."  "I
   grovelled through all the documentation, but I still couldn't find
   the command I wanted." <P>
<A NAME=TAG812><B>grunge</B></A> /gruhnj/ /n./ <P> 1. That which is grungy, or that which
   makes it so.  2. [Cambridge] Code which is inaccessible due to

   America is  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG427" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG427">dead code</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG813><B>gubbish</B></A> /guhb'*sh/ /n./ <P> [a portmanteau of `garbage' and
   `rubbish'; may have originated with SF author Philip K. Dick]
   Garbage; crap; nonsense.  "What is all this gubbish?"  The
   opposite portmanteau `rubbage' is also reported; in fact, it was
   British slang during the 19th century and appears in Dickens.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG814><B>guiltware</B></A> /gilt'weir/ /n./ <P> 1. A piece of  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG691" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG691">freeware</A>

   does not immediately send the poor suffering martyr gobs of money.
   2. A piece of  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1592" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1592">shareware</A> that works.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG815><B>gumby</B></A> /guhm'bee/ /n./ <P> [from a class of Monty Python
   characters, poss. with some influence from the 1960s claymation

   or other technical incompetent who impedes the progress of real
   work.  3. /adj./ Relating to things typically associated with people
   in sense 2.  (e.g.  "Ran would be writing code, but Richard gave

<A NAME=TAG816><B>gun</B></A> /vt./ <P> [ITS: from the <CODE>:GUN</CODE> command] To forcibly
   terminate a program or job (computer, not career).  "Some idiot
   left a background process running soaking up half the cycles, so I
   gunned it."  Usage: now rare.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG247" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG247">can</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG131" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG131">blammo</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG818><B>gurfle</B></A> /ger'fl/ /interj./ <P> An expression of shocked
   disbelief.  "He said we have to recode this thing in FORTRAN by
   next week.  Gurfle!"  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1954" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1954">weeble</A>.  <P>

   skill but also a history of being a knowledge resource for others.
   Less often, used (with a qualifier) for other experts on other
   systems, as in `VMS guru'.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1666" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1666">source of all good bits</A>.
<P>
<A NAME=TAG820><B>guru meditation</B></A> /n./ <P> Amiga equivalent of `panic' in Unix
   (sometimes just called a `guru' or `guru event').  When the
   system crashes, a cryptic message of the form "GURU MEDITATION
   #XXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYY" may appear, indicating what the problem was.
   An Amiga guru can figure things out from the numbers.  Sometimes a
    <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG819" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG819">guru</A> event must be followed by a  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1923" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1923">Vulcan nerve pinch</A>.  <P>
   This term is (no surprise) an in-joke from the earliest days of the
   Amiga.  There used to be a device called a `Joyboard' which was
   basically a plastic board built onto a joystick-like device; it was
   sold with a skiing game cartridge for the Atari game machine.  It
   is said that whenever the prototype OS crashed, the system
   programmer responsible would calm down by concentrating on a
   solution while sitting cross-legged on a Joyboard trying to keep
   the board in balance.  This position resembled that of a meditating
   guru.  Sadly, the joke was removed in AmigaOS 2.04 (actually in
   2.00, a buggy post-2.0 release on the A3000 only).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG821><B>gweep</B></A> /gweep/ <P> [WPI] 1. /v./ To  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A>, usually at night.
   At WPI, from 1975 onwards, one who gweeped could often be found at
   the College Computing Center punching cards or crashing the
    <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1345" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1345">PDP-10</A> or, later, the DEC-20.  A correspondent who was there at
   the time opines that the term was originally onomatopoetic,
   describing the keyclick sound of the Datapoint terminals long
   connected to the PDP-10.  The term has survived the demise of those
   technologies, however, and was still alive in late 1991.  "I'm
   going to go gweep for a while.  See you in the morning." "I gweep
   from 8 PM till 3 AM during the week."  2. /n./ One who habitually
   gweeps in sense 1; a  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG833" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG833">hacker</A>.  "He's a hard-core gweep,
   mumbles code in his sleep."<P>
