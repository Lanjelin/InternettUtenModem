<A NAME=TAG1890><B>vadding</B></A> /vad'ing/ /n./ <P> [from VAD, a permutation of ADV
   (i.e.,  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG11">ADVENT</A>), used to avoid a particular  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG10" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG10">admin</A>'s
   continual search-and-destroy sweeps for the game] A leisure-time
   activity of certain hackers involving the covert exploration of the
   `secret' parts of large buildings -- basements, roofs, freight
   elevators, maintenance crawlways, steam tunnels, and the like.  A
   few go so far as to learn locksmithing in order to synthesize
   vadding keys.  The verb is `to vad' (compare  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1364" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1364">phreaking</A>; see
   also  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A>, sense 9).  This term dates from the late 1970s,
   before which such activity was simply called `hacking'; the older
   usage is still prevalent at MIT.  <P>
   The most extreme and dangerous form of vadding is `elevator
   rodeo', a.k.a. `elevator surfing', a sport played by wrasslin'
   down a thousand-pound elevator car with a 3-foot piece of
   string, and then exploiting this mastery in various stimulating
   ways (such as elevator hopping, shaft exploration, rat-racing, and
   the ever-popular drop experiments).  Kids, don't try this at home!

<A NAME=TAG1891><B>vanilla</B></A> /adj./ <P> [from the default flavor of ice cream in the
   U.S.]  Ordinary  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG653" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG653">flavor</A>, standard.  When used of food, very
   often does not mean that the food is flavored with vanilla extract!
   For example, `vanilla wonton soup' means ordinary wonton soup, as
   opposed to hot-and-sour wonton soup.  Applied to hardware and
   software, as in "Vanilla Version 7 Unix can't run on a vanilla
   11/34."  Also used to orthogonalize chip nomenclature; for
   instance, a 74V00 means what TI calls a 7400, as distinct from a
   74LS00, etc.  This word differs from  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG250" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG250">canonical</A> in that the
   latter means `default', whereas vanilla simply means
   `ordinary'.  For example, when hackers go on a  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG794" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG794">great-wall</A>,
   hot-and-sour soup is the  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG250" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG250">canonical</A> soup to get (because that
   is what most of them usually order) even though it isn't the
   vanilla (wonton) soup.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1892><B>vannevar</B></A> /van'*-var/ /n./ <P> A bogus technological prediction
   or a foredoomed engineering concept, esp. one that fails by
   implicitly assuming that technologies develop linearly,
   incrementally, and in isolation from one another when in fact the
   learning curve tends to be highly nonlinear, revolutions are
   common, and competition is the rule.  The prototype was Vannevar
   Bush's prediction of `electronic brains' the size of the Empire
   State Building with a Niagara-Falls-equivalent cooling system for
   their tubes and relays, a prediction made at a time when the
   semiconductor effect had already been demonstrated.  Other famous
   vannevars have included magnetic-bubble memory, LISP machines,
    <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1910" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1910">videotex</A>, and a paper from the late 1970s that computed a
   purported ultimate limit on areal density for ICs that was in fact
   less than the routine densities of 5 years later.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1893><B>vaporware</B></A> /vay'pr-weir/ /n./ <P> Products announced far in
   advance of any release (which may or may not actually take place).

<A NAME=TAG1895><B>VAX</B></A> /vaks/ /n./ <P> 1. [from Virtual Address eXtension] The
   most successful minicomputer design in industry history, possibly
   excepting its immediate ancestor, the PDP-11.  Between its release
   in 1978 and its eclipse by  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG992" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG992">killer micro</A>s after about 1986, the
   VAX was probably the hacker's favorite machine of them all, esp.
   after the 1982 release of 4.2 BSD Unix (see  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG216">BSD</A>).  Esp.
   noted for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set
   -- an asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution.
   2. A major brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain.  Cited here because
   its sales pitch, "Nothing sucks like a VAX!" became a sort of
   battle-cry of RISC partisans.  It is even sometimes claimed that
   DEC actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax
   people that allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in
   return for not challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the
   U.S. <P>
   A rival brand actually pioneered the slogan: its original form was
   "Nothing sucks like Electrolux".  It has apparently become a classic
   example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not knowing
   the local idiom.  But in 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB,
   while confirming that the company used this slogan in the late 1960s,
   also tells us that their marketing people were fully aware of the
   possible double entendre and intended it to gain attention.  
   And gain attention it did -- the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people thought
   the slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it.  Several British
   hackers report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986--1987, and we
   have one report from a New Zealander that the infamous slogan
   surfaced there in TV ads for the product in 1992. <P>
<A NAME=TAG1896><B>VAXectomy</B></A> /vak-sek't*-mee/ /n./ <P> [by analogy with
   `vasectomy'] A VAX removal.  DEC's Microvaxen, especially, are
   much slower than newer RISC-based workstations such as the SPARC.
   Thus, if one knows one has a replacement coming, VAX removal can be
   cause for celebration.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1897><B>VAXen</B></A> /vak'sn/ /n./ <P> [from `oxen', perhaps influenced by
   `vixen'] (alt. `vaxen') The plural canonically used among
   hackers for the DEC VAX computers.  "Our installation has four
   PDP-10s and twenty vaxen."  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG188" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG188">boxen</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1898><B>vaxherd</B></A> /vaks'herd/ /n. obs./ <P> [from `oxherd'] A VAX
   operator. The image is reinforced because VAXen actually did tend
   to come in herds, technically known as `clusters'. <P>
<A NAME=TAG1899><B>vaxism</B></A> /vak'sizm/ /n./ <P> A piece of code that exhibits
    <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1900" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1900">vaxocentrism</A> in critical areas.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1341" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1341">PC-ism</A>,
    <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1873" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1873">unixism</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1900><B>vaxocentrism</B></A> /vak`soh-sen'trizm/ /n./ <P> [analogy with
   `ethnocentrism'] A notional disease said to afflict C programmers
   who persist in coding according to certain assumptions that are
   valid (esp. under Unix) on  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1897">VAXen</A> but false elsewhere. Among
   these are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>
The assumption that dereferencing a null pointer is safe because it
is all bits 0, and location 0 is readable and 0.  Problem: this may
instead cause an illegal-address trap on non-VAXen, and even on
VAXen under OSes other than BSD Unix.  Usually this is an implicit
assumption of sloppy code (forgetting to check the pointer before
using it), rather than deliberate exploitation of a
misfeature.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that characters are signed.
<P>
<LI>
The assumption that a pointer to any one type can freely be cast
into a pointer to any other type.  A stronger form of this is the
assumption that all pointers are the same size and format, which
means you don't have to worry about getting the casts or types
correct in calls.  Problem: this fails on word-oriented machines
or others with multiple pointer formats.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that the parameters of a routine are stored in
memory, on a stack, contiguously, and in strictly ascending or
descending order.  Problem: this fails on many RISC architectures.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that pointer and integer types are the same size,
and that pointers can be stuffed into integer variables (and
vice-versa) and drawn back out without being truncated or mangled.
Problem: this fails on segmented architectures or word-oriented
machines with funny pointer formats.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that a data type of any size may begin at any byte
address in memory (for example, that you can freely construct and
dereference a pointer to a word- or greater-sized object at an odd
char address).  Problem: this fails on many (esp. RISC)
architectures better optimized for  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG891" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG891">HLL</A> execution speed, and
can cause an illegal address fault or bus error.  <P>
<LI>
The (related) assumption that there is no padding at the end of
types and that in an array you can thus step right from the last
byte of a previous component to the first byte of the next one.
This is not only machine- but compiler-dependent.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that memory address space is globally flat and that
the array reference <CODE>foo[-1]</CODE> is necessarily valid.  Problem:
this fails at 0, or other places on segment-addressed machines like
Intel chips (yes, segmentation is universally considered a
 <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG194" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG194">brain-damaged</A> way to design machines (see  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1157" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1157">moby</A>), but that
is a separate issue).  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that objects can be arbitrarily large with no
special considerations.  Problem: this fails on segmented
architectures and under non-virtual-addressing environments.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that the stack can be as large as memory.  Problem:
this fails on segmented architectures or almost anything else
without virtual addressing and a paged stack.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that bits and addressable units within an object
are ordered in the same way and that this order is a constant of
nature.  Problem: this fails on  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG110" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG110">big-endian</A> machines.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that it is meaningful to compare pointers to
different objects not located within the same array, or to objects
of different types.  Problem: the former fails on segmented
architectures, the latter on word-oriented machines or others with
multiple pointer formats.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that an <CODE>int</CODE> is 32 bits, or (nearly
equivalently) the assumption that <CODE>sizeof(int) ==
sizeof(long)</CODE>.  Problem: this fails on PDP-11s, 286-based systems and
even on 386 and 68000 systems under some compilers.  <P>
<LI>
The assumption that <CODE>argv[]</CODE> is writable.  Problem: this fails
in many embedded-systems C environments and even under a few flavors
of Unix.  </OL>
<P>
   Note that a programmer can validly be accused of vaxocentrism
   even if he or she has never seen a VAX.  Some of these assumptions
   (esp. 2--5) were valid on the PDP-11, the original C machine, and
   became endemic years before the VAX.  The terms `vaxocentricity'
   and `all-the-world's-a-VAX syndrome' have been used synonymously.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1901><B>vdiff</B></A> /vee'dif/ /v.,n./ <P> Visual diff.  The operation of
   finding differences between two files by  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG579" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG579">eyeball search</A>.  The
   term `optical diff' has also been reported, and is sometimes more
   specifically used for the act of superimposing two nearly identical
   printouts on one another and holding them up to a light to spot
   differences.  Though this method is poor for detecting omissions in
   the `rear' file, it can also be used with printouts of graphics, a
   claim few if any diff programs can make.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG468" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG468">diff</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1902><B>veeblefester</B></A> /vee'b*l-fes`tr/ /n./ <P> [from the "Born
   Loser" comix via Commodore; prob. originally from "Mad"
   Magazine's `Veeblefeetzer' parodies ca. 1960] Any obnoxious person
   engaged in the (alleged) professions of marketing or management.

<A NAME=TAG1905><B>verbage</B></A> /ver'b*j/ /n./ <P> A deliberate misspelling and
   mispronunciation of  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1906" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1906">verbiage</A> that assimilates it to the word
   `garbage'.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG334" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG334">content-free</A>.  More pejorative than
   `verbiage'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1906><B>verbiage</B></A> /n./ <P> When the context involves a software or
   hardware system, this refers to  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG488" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG488">documentation</A>.  This term
   borrows the connotations of mainstream `verbiage' to suggest that
   the documentation is of marginal utility and that the motives
   behind its production have little to do with the ostensible
   subject.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1907><B>Version 7</B></A> alt. V7 /vee' se'vn/ /n./ <P> The first widely
   distributed version of  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A>, released unsupported by Bell Labs
   in 1978.  The term is used adjectivally to describe Unix features
   and programs that date from that release, and are thus guaranteed
   to be present and portable in all Unix versions (this was the
   standard gauge of portability before the POSIX and IEEE 1003
   standards).  Note that this usage does <EM>not</EM> derive from the
   release being the "seventh version of  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A>"; research
    <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A> at Bell Labs has traditionally been numbered according to
   the edition of the associated documentation.  Indeed, only the
   widely-distributed Sixth and Seventh Editions are widely known as
   V[67]; the OS that might today be known as `V10' is instead known
   in full as "Tenth Edition Research Unix" or just "Tenth
   Edition" for short.  For this reason, "V7" is often read by
   cognoscenti as "Seventh Edition".  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG216">BSD</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1886" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1886">USG Unix</A>,

   [from `Visual Interface'] A screen editor crufted together by Bill
   Joy for an early  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG216">BSD</A> release.  Became the <I>de facto</I>

   outside of MIT until the rise of  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG548" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG548">EMACS</A> after about 1984.
   Tends to frustrate new users no end, as it will neither take
   commands while expecting input text nor vice versa, and the default
   setup provides no indication of which mode the editor is in (one
   correspondent accordingly reports that he has often heard the
   editor's name pronounced /vi:l/).  Nevertheless it is still
   widely used (about half the respondents in a 1991 Usenet poll
   preferred it), and even EMACS fans often resort to it as a mail
   editor and for small editing jobs (mainly because it starts up
   faster than the bulkier versions of EMACS).  See  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG897">holy wars</A>.  <P>

   brush their teeth.  The idea bombed everywhere it wasn't
   government-subsidized, because by the time videotex was practical
   the installed base of personal computers could hook up to
   timesharing services and do the things for which videotex might
   have been worthwhile better and cheaper.  Videotex planners badly
   overestimated both the appeal of getting information from a
   computer and the cost of local intelligence at the user's end.

   The next day is often also a holiday or taken as an extra day off,
   in which case Wednesday of that week is a virtual Friday (and
   Thursday is a virtual Saturday, as is Friday).  There are also
   `virtual Mondays' that are actually Tuesdays, after the three-day
   weekends associated with many national holidays in the U.S.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1914><B>virtual reality</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. Computer simulations that use 3-D
   graphics and devices such as the Dataglove to allow the user to
   interact with the simulation.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG407" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG407">cyberspace</A>.  2. A form of
   network interaction incorporating aspects of role-playing games,
   interactive theater, improvisational comedy, and `true
   confessions' magazines.  In a virtual reality forum (such as
   Usenet's <I><a href="news:alt.callahans">alt.callahans</a></I> newsgroup or the  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1184" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1184">MUD</A> experiments on
   Internet), interaction between the participants is written like a
   shared novel complete with scenery, `foreground characters' that
   may be personae utterly unlike the people who write them, and
   common `background characters' manipulable by all parties.  The
   one iron law is that you may not write irreversible changes to a
   character without the consent of the person who `owns' it.
   Otherwise anything goes.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG65" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG65">bamf</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG407" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG407">cyberspace</A>,

   officially supports a whole bestiary of virtual card readers,
   virtual printers, and other phantom devices; these are used to
   supply some of the same capabilities Unix gets from pipes and I/O
   redirection.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1916><B>virus</B></A> /n./ <P> [from the obvious analogy with biological viruses,
   via SF] A cracker program that searches out other programs and
   `infects' them by embedding a copy of itself in them, so that
   they become  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1840" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1840">Trojan horse</A>s.  When these programs are executed,
   the embedded virus is executed too, thus propagating the
   `infection'.  This normally happens invisibly to the user.
   Unlike a  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG2005" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG2005">worm</A>, a virus cannot infect other computers without
   assistance.  It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading
   programs with their friends (see  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1586" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1586">SEX</A>).  The virus may do
   nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run
   normally.  Usually, however, after propagating silently for a
   while, it starts doing things like writing cute messages on the
   terminal or playing strange tricks with the display (some viruses
   include nice  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG482" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG482">display hack</A>s).  Many nasty viruses, written by
   particularly perversely minded  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG365" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG365">cracker</A>s, do irreversible
   damage, like nuking all the user's files.  <P>
   In the 1990s, viruses have become a serious problem, especially
   among IBM PC and Macintosh users (the lack of security on these
   machines enables viruses to spread easily, even infecting the
   operating system).  The production of special anti-virus software
   has become an industry, and a number of exaggerated media reports
   have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users; many
    <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1080" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1080">luser</A>s tend to blame <EM>everything</EM> that doesn't work as
   they had expected on virus attacks.  Accordingly, this sense of
   `virus' has passed not only into techspeak but into also popular
   usage (where it is often incorrectly used to denote a  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG2005" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG2005">worm</A> or
   even a  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1840" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1840">Trojan horse</A>).

   Artificial Intelligence researcher working on the problem of
   getting computers to `see' things using TV cameras.  (There
   isn't any problem in sending information from a TV camera to a
   computer.  The problem is, how can the computer be programmed to
   make use of the camera information?  See  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1637" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1637">SMOP</A>,

   At IBM, apparently, such a penchant is viewed with awe and wonder.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1918><B>VMS</B></A> /V-M-S/ /n./ <P> DEC's proprietary operating system for its
   VAX minicomputer; one of the seven or so environments that loom
   largest in hacker folklore.  Many Unix fans generously concede that
   VMS would probably be the hacker's favorite commercial OS if Unix
   didn't exist; though true, this makes VMS fans furious.  One major
   hacker gripe with VMS concerns its slowness -- thus the following
   limerick:
<P>
<PRE>
   There once was a system called VMS
   Of cycles by no means abstemious.
        It's chock-full of hacks
        And runs on a VAX
   And makes my poor stomach all squeamious.
