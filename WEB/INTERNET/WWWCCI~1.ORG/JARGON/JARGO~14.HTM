<A NAME=TAG533><B>earthquake</B></A> /n./ <P> [IBM] The ultimate real-world shock test for
   computer hardware.  Hackish sources at IBM deny the rumor that the
   Bay Area quake of 1989 was initiated by the company to test
   quality-assurance procedures at its California plants.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG534><B>Easter egg</B></A> /n./ <P> [from the custom of the Easter Egg hunt
   observed in the U.S. and many parts of Europe] 1. A message hidden
   in the object code of a program as a joke, intended to be found by
   persons disassembling or browsing the code.  2. A message, graphic,
   or sound effect emitted by a program (or, on a PC, the BIOS ROM) in
   response to some undocumented set of commands or keystrokes,
   intended as a joke or to display program credits.  One well-known
   early Easter egg found in a couple of OSes caused them to respond
   to the command <CODE>make love</CODE> with <CODE>not war?</CODE>.  Many
   personal computers have much more elaborate eggs hidden in ROM,
   including lists of the developers' names, political exhortations,
   snatches of music, and (in one case) graphics images of the entire
   development team.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG535><B>Easter egging</B></A> /n./ <P> [IBM] The act of replacing unrelated
   components more or less at random in hopes that a malfunction will
   go away.  Hackers consider this the normal operating mode of
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG611" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG611">field circus</A> techs and do not love them for it.  See also the

   hackers by the infamous  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG363" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG363">CPU Wars</A> comic; supposedly derive from
   a famously turgid line in a WWII-era anti-Nazi propaganda comic
   that ran "Eat flaming death, non-Aryan mongrels!" or something
   of the sort (however, it is also reported that the Firesign
   Theater's 1975 album "In The Next World, You're On Your Own"
   included the phrase "Eat flaming death, fascist media pigs"; this
   may have been an influence).  Used in humorously overblown
   expressions of hostility. "Eat flaming death,  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG537" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG537">EBCDIC</A> users!"  <P>
<A NAME=TAG537><B>EBCDIC</B></A> /eb's*-dik/, /eb'see`dik/, or /eb'k*-dik/ /n./ <P>
   [abbreviation, Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An
   alleged character set used on IBM  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG474" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG474">dinosaur</A>s.  It exists in at
   least six mutually incompatible versions, all featuring such
   delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the absence of
   several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern
   computer languages (exactly which characters are absent varies
   according to which version of EBCDIC you're looking at).  IBM
   adapted EBCDIC from  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1436" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1436">punched card</A> code in the early 1960s and
   promulgated it as a customer-control tactic (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG329" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG329">connector conspiracy</A>), spurning the already established ASCII standard.
   Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own
   description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them
   is still internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading.
   Hackers blanch at the very <EM>name</EM> of EBCDIC and consider it a
   manifestation of purest  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG567" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG567">evil</A>.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG596" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG596">fear and loathing</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG539><B>eighty-column mind</B></A> /n./ <P> [IBM] The sort said to be possessed by
   persons for whom the transition from  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1436" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1436">punched card</A> to tape was
   traumatic (nobody has dared tell them about disks yet).  It is said
   that these people, including (according to an old joke) the founder
   of IBM, will be buried `face down, 9-edge first' (the 9-edge being
   the bottom of the card).  This directive is inscribed on IBM's 1402
   and 1622 card readers and is referenced in a famous bit of doggerel
   called "The Last Bug", the climactic lines of which are as
   follows: <P>
<PRE>
   He died at the console
   Of hunger and thirst.
   Next day he was buried,
   Face down, 9-edge first.
</PRE>
<P>
   The eighty-column mind is thought by most hackers to dominate IBM's
   customer base and its thinking.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG919" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG919">IBM</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG596" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG596">fear and loathing</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG251" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG251">card walloper</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG540><B>El Camino Bignum</B></A> /el' k*-mee'noh big'nuhm/ /n./ <P> The road
   mundanely called El Camino Real, running along San Francisco
   peninsula.  It originally extended all the way down to Mexico City;
   many portions of the old road are still intact.  Navigation on the
   San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real,
   which defines  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1062" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1062">logical</A> north and south even though it isn't
   really north-south in many places.  El Camino Real runs right past
   Stanford University and so is familiar to hackers.
<P>
   The Spanish word `real' (which has two syllables: /ray-ahl'/)
   means `royal'; El Camino Real is `the royal road'.  In the FORTRAN
   language, a `real' quantity is a number typically precise to seven
   significant digits, and a `double precision' quantity is a larger
   floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen significant
   digits (other languages have similar `real' types).
<P>
   When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked what a
   long road El Camino Real was.  Making a pun on `real', he started
   calling it `El Camino Double Precision' -- but when the hacker
   was told that the road was hundreds of miles long, he renamed it
   `El Camino Bignum', and that name has stuck.  (See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG111" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG111">bignum</A>.)
   In recent years, the synonym `El Camino Virtual' has been
   reported as an alternate at IBM and Amdahl sites in the Valley. <P>
   [GLS has since let slip that the unnamed hacker in this story was
   in fact he --ESR] 
<P>
<A NAME=TAG541><B>elder days</B></A> /n./ <P> The heroic age of hackerdom (roughly,
   pre-1980); the era of the  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1345" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1345">PDP-10</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1760" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1760">TECO</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG958" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG958">ITS</A>, and the
   ARPANET.  This term has been rather consciously adopted from
   J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy epic "The Lord of the Rings".

<A NAME=TAG542><B>elegant</B></A> /adj./ <P> [from mathematical usage] Combining
   simplicity, power, and a certain ineffable grace of design.  Higher
   praise than `clever', `winning', or even  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG403" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG403">cuspy</A>.  <P>
   The French aviator, adventurer, and author Antoine de
   Saint-Exup'ery, probably best known for his classic children's
   book "The Little Prince", was also an aircraft designer.  He
   gave us perhaps the best definition of engineering elegance when he
   said "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there
   is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take
   away." <P>
<A NAME=TAG543><B>elephantine</B></A> /adj./ <P> Used of programs or systems that are both
   conspicuous  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG894" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG894">hog</A>s (owing perhaps to poor design founded on
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG215" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG215">brute force and ignorance</A>) and exceedingly  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG844" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG844">hairy</A> in
   source form.  An elephantine program may be functional and even
   friendly, but (as in the old joke about being in bed with an
   elephant) it's tough to have around all the same (and, like a
   pachyderm, difficult to maintain).  In extreme cases, hackers have
   been known to make trumpeting sounds or perform expressive
   proboscatory mime at the mention of the offending program.  Usage:
   semi-humorous.  Compare `has the elephant nature' and the
   somewhat more pejorative  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1167" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1167">monstrosity</A>.  See also

<A NAME=TAG544><B>elevator controller</B></A> /n./ <P> An archetypal dumb embedded-systems
   application, like  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1812" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1812">toaster</A> (which superseded it).  During one
   period (1983--84) in the deliberations of ANSI X3J11 (the C
   standardization committee) this was the canonical example of a
   really stupid, memory-limited computation environment.  "You can't
   require <CODE>printf(3)</CODE> to be part of the default runtime library
   -- what if you're targeting an elevator controller?"  Elevator
   controllers became important rhetorical weapons on both sides of
   several  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG897">holy wars</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG545><B>elite</B></A> /adj./ <P> Clueful.  Plugged-in.  One of the cognoscenti.
   Also used as a general positive adjective.  This term is not
   actually hacker slang in the strict sense; it is used primarily by
   crackers and  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1940" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1940">warez d00dz</A>.  Cracker usage is probably related to
   a 19200cps modem called the `Courier Elite' that was widely popular
   on pirate boards before the V.32bis standard.  A true hacker would
   be more likely to use `wizardly'. Oppose  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1008" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1008">lamer</A>. <P>
<A NAME=TAG546><B>ELIZA effect</B></A> /*-li:'z* *-fekt'/ /n./ <P> [AI community] The
   tendency of humans to attach associations to terms from prior
   experience.  For example, there is nothing magic about the symbol
   <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> that makes it well-suited to indicate addition; it's just
   that people associate it with addition.  Using <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> or `plus'
   to mean addition in a computer language is taking advantage of the
   ELIZA effect.
<P>
   This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum,
   which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by rephrasing many of
   the patient's statements as questions and posing them to the
   patient.  It worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution
   of key words into canned phrases.  It was so convincing, however,
   that there are many anecdotes about people becoming very
   emotionally caught up in dealing with ELIZA.  All this was due to
   people's tendency to attach to words meanings which the computer
   never put there.  The ELIZA effect is a  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG778" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG778">Good Thing</A> when
   writing a programming language, but it can blind you to serious
   shortcomings when analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system.

<A NAME=TAG547><B>elvish</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. The Tengwar of Feanor, a table of letterforms
   resembling the beautiful Celtic half-uncial hand of the "Book
   of Kells".  Invented and described by J. R. R. Tolkien in "The
   Lord of The Rings" as an orthography for his fictional `elvish'
   languages, this system (which is both visually and phonetically
    <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG542" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG542">elegant</A>) has long fascinated hackers (who tend to be intrigued
   by artificial languages in general).  It is traditional for
   graphics printers, plotters, window systems, and the like to
   support a Feanorian typeface as one of their demo items.  See also
    <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG541" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG541">elder days</A>.  2. By extension, any odd or unreadable typeface
   produced by a graphics device.  3. The typeface mundanely called
   `B&ouml;cklin', an art-decoish display font.
<P>
<A NAME=TAG548><B>EMACS</B></A> /ee'maks/ /n./ <P> [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus
   ultra of hacker editors, a programmable text editor with an entire
   LISP system inside it.  It was originally written by Richard
   Stallman in  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1760" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1760">TECO</A> under  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG958" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG958">ITS</A> at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554
   described it as "an advanced, self-documenting, customizable,
   extensible real-time display editor".  It has since been
   reimplemented any number of times, by various hackers, and versions
   exist that run under most major operating systems.  Perhaps the
   most widely used version, also written by Stallman and now called
   " <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG765" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG765">GNU</A> EMACS" or  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG766" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG766">GNUMACS</A>, runs principally under Unix.
   It includes facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and
   receive mail; many hackers spend up to 80% of their  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1846" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1846">tube time</A>

   UniPress EMACS, Montgomery EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS.
<P>
   Some EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an
   overflowing kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the
   editor does not (yet) include.  Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too

<P>
   Oddly enough, the word `emailed' is actually listed in the OED;
   it means "embossed (with a raised pattern) or perh. arranged in a
   net or open work".  A use from 1480 is given. The word is probably
   derived from French `'emaill'e' (enameled) and related to Old
   French `emmaille&uuml;re' (network).  A French correspondent tells
   us that in modern French, `email' is a hard enamel obtained by
   heating special paints in a furnace; an `emailleur' (no final e) is
   a craftsman who makes email (he generally paints some objects
   (like, say, jewelry) and cooks them in a furnace). <P>
   There are numerous spelling variants of this word.  In Internet
   traffic up to 1995, `email' predominates, `e-mail' runs a
   not-too-distant second, and `E-mail' and `Email' are a distant
   third and fourth. <P>

   of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what were intended to
   be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-100%-serious

<A NAME=TAG551><B>empire</B></A> /n./ <P> Any of a family of military simulations derived

   The hackish senses of `engine' are actually close to its original,
   pre-Industrial-Revolution sense of a skill, clever device, or
   instrument (the word is cognate to `ingenuity').  This sense had
   not been completely eclipsed by the modern connotation of

<A NAME=TAG558><B>EOU</B></A> /E-O-U/ /n./ <P> The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control

   delimiter and control characters left in ASCII from the days when
   it was associated more with wire-service teletypes than computers
   (e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX, and esp. EOT).  It is worth
   remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical beasts with a

<A NAME=TAG559><B>epoch</B></A> /n./ <P> [Unix: prob. from astronomical timekeeping] The

   GMT, January 1, 1970; under VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858
   (base date of the U.S. Naval Observatory's ephemerides); on a
   Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning January 1 1904.  System time
   is measured in seconds or  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1793" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1793">tick</A>s past the epoch.  Weird

   counting 10 ticks per second, a signed 32-bit count of ticks is
   good only for 6.8 years.  The 1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is

   does not imply incompetence or bad design, but rather a set of
   goals or design criteria fatally incompatible with the speaker's.
   This usage is more an esthetic and engineering judgment than a
   moral one in the mainstream sense.  "We thought about adding a
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG154" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG154">Blue Glue</A> interface but decided it was too evil to deal

   the additional connotation that the rudeness was due to malice
   rather than incompetence.  Thus, for example: Microsoft's Windows
   NT is <I>evil</I> because it's a competent implementation of a bad
   design; it's <I>rude</I> because it's gratuitously incompatible with
   Unix in places where compatibility would have been as easy and
   effective to do; but it's <I>evil and rude</I> because the
   incompatibilities are apparently there not to fix design bugs in
   Unix but rather to lock hapless customers and developers into the
