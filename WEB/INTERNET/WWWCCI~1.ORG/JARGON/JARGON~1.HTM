<H1>Jargon File Resources</H1>

This page indexes all the WWW resources associated with the Jargon File and
its print version, <CITE>The New Hacker's Dictionary</CITE>. It's as official
as anything associated with the Jargon File gets.  Note: you're best off
not linking to pages below this one, as the HTML structure underneath may
change without notice.<P>

Everything below was generated for the Jargon File's 4.0.0 version (released
25 July 1996), which corresponds to the third paper edition of
<CITE>The New Hacker's Dictionary</CITE> due out in September '96.  Expect
4.0.1 sometime around Yule, and a fourth paper edition in maybe three years. <P>
