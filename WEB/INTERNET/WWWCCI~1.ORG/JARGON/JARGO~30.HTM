<A NAME=TAG1746><B>T</B></A> /T/ <P> 1. [from LISP terminology for `true'] Yes.  Used
   in reply to a question (particularly one asked using  <A HREF="JARGON~6.HTM#SEC8" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_5.html#SEC8">The `-P' convention</A>).  In LISP, the constant T means `true', among other
   things.  Some Lisp hackers use `T' and `NIL' instead of `Yes' and
   `No' almost reflexively.  This sometimes causes misunderstandings.
   When a waiter or flight attendant asks whether a hacker wants
   coffee, he may absently respond `T', meaning that he wants coffee;
   but of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead.
   Fortunately, most hackers (particularly those who frequent Chinese
   restaurants) like tea at least as well as coffee -- so it is not
   that big a problem.  2. See  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1799" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1799">time T</A> (also  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1615" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1615">since time T equals minus infinity</A>).  3. [techspeak] In transaction-processing
   circles, an abbreviation for the noun `transaction'.  4. [Purdue]
   Alternate spelling of  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1761" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1761">tee</A>.  5. A dialect of  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1047" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1047">LISP</A>
   developed at Yale. (There is an intended allusion to NIL, "New
   Implementation of Lisp", another dialect of Lisp developed for the

<A NAME=TAG1748><B>talk mode</B></A> /n./ <P> A feature supported by Unix, ITS, and some
   other OSes that allows two or more logged-in users to set up a
   real-time on-line conversation.  It combines the immediacy of
   talking with all the precision (and verbosity) that written
   language entails.  It is difficult to communicate inflection,
   though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section
   on writing style in the Prependices for details).
<P>
   Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing,
   which are not used orally.  Some of these are identical to (and
   probably derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs
   since the 1920s.

<P>
   Most of the above sub-jargon is used at both Stanford and MIT.

   FYI, FYA, BTW, BCNU, WTF, and CUL.  A few other abbreviations have
   been reported from commercial networks, such as GEnie and
   CompuServe, where on-line `live' chat including more than two
   people is common and usually involves a more `social' context,
   notably the following:<P>

<P>
   Most of these are not used at universities or in the Unix world,
   though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is
   common; conversely, most of the people who know these are
   unfamiliar with FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP,  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1256" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1256">NIL</A>, and  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1746" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1746">T</A>.  <P>
   The  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1184" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1184">MUD</A> community uses a mixture of Usenet/Internet emoticons,
   a few of the more natural of the old-style talk-mode abbrevs, and
   some of the `social' list above; specifically, MUD respondents
   report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF, TTFN, and WTH.  The use
   of `rehi' is also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re-
   compounds and will frequently `rehug' or `rebonk' (see
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG178" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG178">bonk/oif</A>) people.  The word `re' by itself is taken as
   `regreet'.  In general, though, MUDders express a preference for
   typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations; this may
   be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to
   include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links.  The
   following uses specific to MUDs are reported:<P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DD>are you OK?
</DL>
<P>
   Some  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG103" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG103">B1FF</A>isms (notably the variant spelling <CODE>d00d</CODE>)
   appear to be passing into wider use among some subgroups of
   MUDders.  <P>
   One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode,
   often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because
   they are typing rather than speaking.  This is not the best
   approach.  It can be very frustrating to wait while your partner
   pauses to think of a word, or repeatedly makes the same spelling
   error and backs up to fix it.  It is usually best just to leave
   typographical errors behind and plunge forward, unless severe
   confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just to type
   "xxx" and start over from before the mistake.  <P>

   last gasp at supporting the ISA) they made the case lower and many
   industry-standard tall cards wouldn't fit; this was felt to be a

   hackers.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG904" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG904">hosed</A>.  Popularized as a synonym for
   `drunk' by Steve Dallas in the late lamented "Bloom County"
   comic strip.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1752><B>TANSTAAFL</B></A> /tan'stah-fl/ <P> [acronym, from Robert Heinlein's
   classic "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress".]  "There Ain't No
   Such Thing As A Free Lunch", often invoked when someone is balking
   at the prospect of using an unpleasantly  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG873" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG873">heavyweight</A>
   technique, or at the poor quality of some piece of free software,
   or at the  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1610" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1610">signal-to-noise ratio</A> of unmoderated Usenet
   newsgroups.  "What? Don't tell me I have to implement a database
   back end to get my address book program to work!"  "Well,
   TANSTAAFL you know."  This phrase owes some of its popularity to
   the high concentration of science-fiction fans and political
   libertarians in hackerdom (see  <A HREF="JARGO~51.HTM#SEC57" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_50.html#SEC57">A Portrait of J. Random Hacker</A> in Appendix B).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1753><B>tar and feather</B></A> /vi./ <P> [from Unix <CODE>tar(1)</CODE>] To create a
   transportable archive from a group of files by first sticking them
   together with <CODE>tar(1)</CODE> (the Tape ARchiver) and then
   compressing the result (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG320" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG320">compress</A>).  The latter action is
   dubbed `feathering' partly for euphony and (if only for contrived
   effect) by analogy to what you do with an airplane propeller to
   decrease wind resistance, or with an oar to reduce water
   resistance; smaller files, after all, slip through comm links more
   easily.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1754><B>taste</B></A> [primarily MIT] /n./ <P> 1. The quality in a program that
   tends to be inversely proportional to the number of features,
   hacks, and kluges programmed into it.  Also `tasty',
   `tasteful', `tastefulness'.  "This feature comes in @Math{N}
   tasty flavors."  Although `tasty' and `flavorful' are
   essentially synonyms, `taste' and  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG653" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG653">flavor</A> are not.  Taste
   refers to sound judgment on the part of the creator; a program or
   feature can <EM>exhibit</EM> taste but cannot <EM>have</EM> taste.  On
   the other hand, a feature can have  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG653" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG653">flavor</A>.  Also,  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG653" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG653">flavor</A>
   has the additional meaning of `kind' or `variety' not shared by
   `taste'.  The marked sense of  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG653" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG653">flavor</A> is more popular than
   `taste', though both are widely used.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG542" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG542">elegant</A>.

<A NAME=TAG1757><B>TCP/IP</B></A> /T'C-P I'P/ /n./ <P> 1. [Transmission Control
   Protocol/Internet Protocol] The wide-area-networking protocol that
   makes the Internet work, and the only one most hackers can speak
   the name of without laughing or retching.  Unlike such allegedly
   `standard' competitors such as X.25, DECnet, and the ISO 7-layer
   stack, TCP/IP evolved primarily by actually being <EM>used</EM>,
   rather than being handed down from on high by a vendor or a
   heavily-politicized standards committee.  Consequently, it (a)
   works, (b) actually promotes cheap cross-platform connectivity, and
   (c) annoys the hell out of corporate and governmental
   empire-builders everywhere.  Hackers value all three of these
   properties. See  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG377" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG377">creationism</A>.  2.  [Amateur Packet Radio]
   Sometimes expanded as "The Crap Phil Is Pushing".  The reference
   is to Phil Karn, KA9Q, and the context is an ongoing
   technical/political war between the majority of sites still running
   AX.25 and a growing minority of TCP/IP relays. <P>
<A NAME=TAG1758><B>tea, ISO standard cup of</B></A> /n./ <P> [South Africa] A cup of tea
   with milk and one teaspoon of sugar, where the milk is poured into
   the cup before the tea.  Variations are ISO 0, with no sugar; ISO
   2, with two spoons of sugar; and so on.
<P>
   Like many ISO standards, this one has a faintly alien ring in North
   America, where hackers generally shun the decadent British practice
   of adulterating perfectly good tea with dairy products and
   prefer instead to add a wedge of lemon, if anything.  If one were
   feeling extremely silly, one might hypothesize an analogous `ANSI
   standard cup of tea' and wind up with a political situation
   distressingly similar to several that arise in much more serious
   technical contexts.  Milk and lemon don't mix very well.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1759><B>TechRef</B></A> /tek'ref/ /n./ <P> [MS-DOS] The original "IBM PC
   Technical Reference Manual", including the BIOS listing and
   complete schematics for the PC.  The only PC documentation in the
   original-issue package that was considered serious by real
   hackers. <P>
<A NAME=TAG1760><B>TECO</B></A> /tee'koh/ /n.,v. obs./ <P> 1. [originally an acronym for
   `[paper] Tape Editor and COrrector'; later, `Text Editor and
   COrrector'] /n./ A text editor developed at MIT and modified by just
   about everybody.  With all the dialects included, TECO may have
   been the most prolific editor in use before  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG548" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG548">EMACS</A>, to which it
   was directly ancestral.  Noted for its powerful
   programming-language-like features and its unspeakably hairy
   syntax.  It is literally the case that every string of characters
   is a valid TECO program (though probably not a useful one); one
   common game used to be mentally working out what the TECO commands
   corresponding to human names did.  2. /vt./ Originally, to edit using
   the TECO editor in one of its infinite variations (see below).
   3. vt.,obs.  To edit even when TECO is <EM>not</EM> the editor being
   used!  This usage is rare and now primarily historical.  <P>
   As an example of TECO's obscurity, here is a TECO program that
   takes a list of names such as: <P>
<PRE>
Loser, J. Random
Quux, The Great
Dick, Moby
</PRE>
<P>
   sorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the
   surname last, removing the comma, to produce the following:
<P>
<PRE>
Moby Dick
J. Random Loser
The Great Quux
</PRE>

   The program is

   fans insist on the correct (guttural) pronunciation, and the
   correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with the E depressed
   below the baseline; the mixed-case `TeX' is considered an
   acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices).  Fans like to proliferate
   names from the word `TeX' -- such as TeXnician (TeX

   TeX programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique.  See also

   Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining
   quality of the typesetting in volumes I--III of his monumental
   "Art of Computer Programming" (see  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG1004" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG1004">Knuth</A>, also
    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG101" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG101">bible</A>).  In a manifestation of the typical hackish urge to
   solve the problem at hand once and for all, he began to design his
   own typesetting language.  He thought he would finish it on his
   sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8 years.  The
   language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of "The
   Art of Computer Programming" is not expected to appear until 2002.
   The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such that
   nobody minds this very much.  Many grand hackish projects have
   started as a bit of  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1816" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1816">toolsmith</A>ing on the way to something else;
   Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.  <P>
   TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but
   high-quality software.  Knuth used to offer monetary awards to
   people who found and reported bugs in it; as the years wore on and
   the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to
   find), the bribe went up.  Though well-written, TeX is so large
   (and so full of cutting edge technique) that it is said to have

<A NAME=TAG1792><B>thunk</B></A> /thuhnk/ /n./ <P> 1. "A piece of coding which provides
   an address", according to P. Z. Ingerman, who invented thunks in
   1961 as a way of binding actual parameters to their formal
   definitions in Algol-60 procedure calls.  If a procedure is called
   with an expression in the place of a formal parameter, the compiler
   generates a thunk which computes the expression and leaves the
   address of the result in some standard location.  2. Later
   generalized into: an expression, frozen together with its
   environment, for later evaluation if and when needed (similar to
   what in techspeak is called a `closure').  The process of
   unfreezing these thunks is called `forcing'.  3. A

   Historical note: There are a couple of onomatopoeic myths
   circulating about the origin of this term.  The most common is that
   it is the sound made by data hitting the stack; another holds that
   the sound is that of the data hitting an accumulator.  Yet another
   suggests that it is the sound of the expression being unfrozen at
   argument-evaluation time.  In fact, according to the inventors, it
   was coined after they realized (in the wee hours after hours of
   discussion) that the type of an argument in Algol-60 could be
   figured out in advance with a little compile-time thought,
   simplifying the evaluation machinery.  In other words, it had
   `already been thought of'; thus it was christened a `thunk',
   which is "the past tense of `think' at two in the morning".

   test security measures.  These people are paid professionals who do
   hacker-type tricks, e.g., leave cardboard signs saying "bomb" in
   critical defense installations, hand-lettered notes saying "Your
   codebooks have been stolen" (they usually haven't been) inside
   safes, etc.  After a successful penetration, some high-ranking
   security type shows up the next morning for a `security review'
   and finds the sign, note, etc., and all hell breaks loose.  Serious
   successes of tiger teams sometimes lead to early retirement for
   base commanders and security officers (see the  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1335" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1335">patch</A> entry for

   by programmers in their employers' machines, to go off if the
   programmer is fired or laid off and is not present to perform the
   appropriate suppressing action periodically.  <P>
   Interestingly, the only such incident for which we have been
   pointed to documentary evidence took place in the Soviet Union in
   1986!  A disgruntled programmer at the Volga Automobile Plant
   (where the Fiat clones called Ladas were manufactured) planted a
   time bomb which, a week after he'd left on vacation, stopped the
   entire main assembly line for a day.  The case attracted lots of
   attention in the Soviet Union because it was the first cracking

<A NAME=TAG1799><B>time T</B></A> /ti:m T/ /n./ <P> 1. An unspecified but usually
   well-understood time, often used in conjunction with a later time
   @Math{T+1}.  "We'll meet on campus at time @Math{T} or at Louie's
   at time @Math{T+1}" means, in the context of going out for dinner:
   "We can meet on campus and go to Louie's, or we can meet at
   Louie's itself a bit later."  (Louie's was a Chinese restaurant in
   Palo Alto that was a favorite with hackers.)  Had the number 30
   been used instead of the number 1, it would have implied that the
   travel time from campus to Louie's is 30 minutes; whatever time
   @Math{T} is (and that hasn't been decided on yet), you can meet
   half an hour later at Louie's than you could on campus and end up

<A NAME=TAG1805><B>TLA</B></A> /T-L-A/ /n./ <P> [Three-Letter Acronym] 1. Self-describing
   abbreviation for a species with which computing terminology is
   infested.  2. Any confusing acronym.  Examples include MCA, FTP,
   SNA, CPU, MMU, SCCS, DMU, FPU, NNTP, TLA.  People who like this
   looser usage argue that not all TLAs have three letters, just as
   not all four-letter words have four letters.  One also hears of
   `ETLA' (Extended Three-Letter Acronym, pronounced /ee tee el
   ay/) being used to describe four-letter acronyms.  The term
   `SFLA' (Stupid Four-Letter Acronym) has also been reported.  See

   The self-effacing phrase "TDM TLA" (Too Damn Many...) is
   often used to bemoan the plethora of TLAs in use.  In 1989, a
   random of the journalistic persuasion asked hacker Paul Boutin
   "What do you think will be the biggest problem in computing in
   the 90s?"  Paul's straight-faced response: "There are only
   17,000 three-letter acronyms." (To be exact, there are @Math{26^3
   = 17,576}.)<P>
<A NAME=TAG1806><B>TMRC</B></A> /tmerk'/ /n./ <P> The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one
   of the wellsprings of hacker culture.  The 1959 "Dictionary of
   the TMRC Language" compiled by Peter Samson included several terms
   that became basics of the hackish vocabulary (see esp.  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG670" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG670">foo</A>,

   By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity
   (and has grown in the thirty years since; all the features
   described here are still present).  The control system alone
   featured about 1200 relays.  There were  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1556" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1556">scram switch</A>es located
   at numerous places around the room that could be thwacked if
   something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train going
   full-bore at an obstruction.  Another feature of the system was a
   digital clock on the dispatch board, which was itself something of
   a wonder in those bygone days before cheap LEDs and seven-segment
   displays.  When someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and
   the display was replaced with the word `FOO'; at TMRC the scram
   switches are therefore called `foo switches'.  <P>
   Steven Levy, in his book "Hackers" (see the
    <A HREF="JARGO~72.HTM#SEC77" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_70.html#SEC77">Bibliography</A> in Appendix C), gives a stimulating account of
   those early years.  TMRC's Power and Signals group included most of
   the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later became the core of
   the MIT AI Lab staff.  Thirty years later that connection is still
   very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes a number of
   entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary.  <P>

   comes from `toggle switches', such as standard light switches,
   though the word `toggle' actually refers to the mechanism that
   keeps the switch in the position to which it is flipped rather than
   to the fact that the switch has two positions.  There are four
   things you can do to a bit: set it (force it to be 1), clear (or
   zero) it, leave it alone, or toggle it.  (Mathematically, one would

   barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after
   the earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after Multics' RUNOFF by
   Jerome Saltzer (<EM>that</EM> name came from the expression "to run

   In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive
   phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT.  His paper
   describing that work ("A Typesetter-independent troff," AT&#38;T CSTR
   #97) explains troff's durability.  After discussing the program's
   "obvious deficiencies -- a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious
   and undocumented properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite
   for computer resources" and noting the ugliness and extreme
   hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan concludes: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating
Ossanna's accomplishment with TROFF.  It has proven a
remarkably robust tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a
variety of preprocessors and being forced into uses that
were never conceived of in the original design, all with
considerable grace under fire.

<A NAME=TAG1847><B>tunafish</B></A> /n./ <P> In hackish lore, refers to the mutated
   punchline of an age-old joke to be found at the bottom of the
   manual pages of <CODE>tunefs(8)</CODE> in the original  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG216">BSD</A> 4.2
   distribution.  The joke was removed in later releases once
   commercial sites started using 4.2.  Tunefs relates to the
   `tuning' of file-system parameters for optimum performance, and
   at the bottom of a few pages of wizardly inscriptions was a `BUGS'
   section consisting of the line "You can tune a file system, but
   you can't tunafish".  Variants of this can be seen in other BSD
   versions, though it has been excised from some versions by
   humorless management  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG514" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG514">droid</A>s.  The [nt]roff source for SunOS
   4.1.1 contains a comment apparently designed to prevent this:
   "Take this out and a Unix Demon will dog your steps from now until
   the <CODE>time_t</CODE>'s wrap around." <P>
   [It has since been pointed out that indeed you can tunafish.

<A NAME=TAG1850><B>Turing tar-pit</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A place where anything is possible but
   nothing of interest is practical.  Alan Turing helped lay the
   foundations of computer science by showing that all machines and
   languages capable of expressing a certain very primitive set of
   operations are logically equivalent in the kinds of computations
   they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities that differ
   only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly
   designed computers.  However, no machine or language exactly
   matching Turing's primitive set has ever been built (other than
   possibly as a classroom exercise), because it would be horribly
   slow and far too painful to use.  A `Turing tar-pit' is any
   computer language or other tool that shares this property.  That
   is, it's theoretically universal -- but in practice, the harder
   you struggle to get any real work done, the deeper its inadequacies
   suck you in.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG177" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG177">bondage-and-discipline language</A>.  2. The

<A NAME=TAG1854><B>TWENEX</B></A> /twe'neks/ /n./ <P> The TOPS-20 operating system by DEC
   -- the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 -- preferred by most
   PDP-10 hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not
    <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG958" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG958">ITS</A> or  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1926" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1926">WAITS</A> partisans).  TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt,
   Beranek &#38; Newman's TENEX operating system using special paging
   hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of the systems on the
   ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX from BBN and
   began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name for
   the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System);
   when customers started asking questions, the name was changed to
   SNARK so DEC could truthfully deny that there was any project
   called VIROS.  When the name SNARK became known, the name was
   briefly reversed to become KRANS; this was quickly abandoned when
   someone objected that `krans' meant `funeral wreath' in Swedish
   (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
   `wreath'; this part of the story may be apocryphal).  Ultimately
   DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it was
   as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of
   its origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of `twenty
   TENEX'), even though by this point very little of the original
   TENEX code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&#38;T V6
   Unix and BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard "TWENEX", but
   the term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation `20x'
   was also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact,
   there was a period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent
   a culture of partisans as Unix or ITS -- but DEC's decision to
   scrap all the internal rivals to the VAX architecture and its
   relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to
   TWENEX's brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20
   users to convert to  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1918" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1918">VMS</A>, but instead, by the late 1980s, most
   of the TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1855><B>twiddle</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. Tilde (ASCII 1111110, <SAMP>`~'</SAMP>).  Also called
   `squiggle', `sqiggle' (sic -- pronounced /skig'l/), and
   `twaddle', but twiddle is the most common term.  2. A small and
   insignificant change to a program.  Usually fixes one bug and
   generates several new ones (see also  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1600" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1600">shotgun debugging</A>).
   3. /vt./ To change something in a small way.  Bits, for example, are
   often twiddled.  Twiddling a switch or knob implies much less sense
   of purpose than toggling or tweaking it; see  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG698" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG698">frobnicate</A>.  To
   speak of twiddling a bit connotes aimlessness, and at best doesn't
   specify what you're doing to the bit; `toggling a bit' has a more
   specific meaning (see  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG119" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG119">bit twiddling</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1814" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1814">toggle</A>).  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1858><B>twirling baton</B></A> /n./ <P> [PLATO] The overstrike sequence -/|\-/|\-
   which produces an animated twirling baton.  If you output it with a
   single backspace between characters, the baton spins in place.  If
   you output the sequence BS SP between characters, the baton spins
   from left to right.  If you output BS SP BS BS between characters,
   the baton spins from right to left.  <P>
   The twirling baton was a popular component of animated signature
   files on the pioneering PLATO educational timesharing system.  The
   <CODE>archie</CODE> Internet service is perhaps the best-known baton
   program today; it uses the twirling baton as an idler indicating
