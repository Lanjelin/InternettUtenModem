   Obfuscated C Code Contest', or IOCCC) An annual contest run since
   1984 over Usenet by Landon Curt Noll and friends.  The overall
   winner is whoever produces the most unreadable, creative, and
   bizarre (but working) C program; various other prizes are awarded
   at the judges' whim.  C's terse syntax and macro-preprocessor
   facilities give contestants a lot of maneuvering room.  The winning
   programs often manage to be simultaneously (a) funny, (b)
   breathtaking works of art, and (c) horrible examples of how
   <EM>not</EM> to code in C.

   This relatively short and sweet entry might help convey the flavor

   NeXT machine).  Objectionable-C uses a Smalltalk-like syntax, but
   lacks the flexibility of Smalltalk method calls, and (like many
   such efforts) comes frustratingly close to attaining the  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1507" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1507">Right Thing</A> without actually doing so.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1289><B>ogg</B></A> /og/ /v./ <P> [CMU] 1. In the multi-player space combat
   game Netrek, to execute kamikaze attacks against enemy ships which
   are carrying armies or occupying strategic positions.  Named during
   a game in which one of the players repeatedly used the tactic while
   playing Orion ship G, showing up in the player list as "Og".
   This trick has been roundly denounced by those who would return to
   the good old days when the tactic of dogfighting was dominant, but
   as Sun Tzu wrote, "What is of supreme importance in war is to
   attack the enemy's strategy."  However, the traditional answer to
   the newbie question "What does ogg mean?" is just "Pick up some
   armies and I'll show you."  2. In other games, to forcefully
   attack an opponent with the expectation that the resources expended
   will be renewed faster than the opponent will be able to regain his
   previous advantage.  Taken more seriously as a tactic since it has
   gained a simple name.  3. To do anything forcefully, possibly
   without consideration of the drain on future resources.  "I guess
   I'd better go ogg the problem set that's due tomorrow."  "Whoops!
   I looked down at the map for a sec and almost ogged that oncoming
   car."<P>
<A NAME=TAG1290><B>old fart</B></A> /n./ <P> Tribal elder.  A title self-assumed with
   remarkable frequency by (esp.) Usenetters who have been
   programming for more than about 25 years; often appears in  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1607" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1607">sig block</A>s attached to Jargon File contributions of great
   archeological significance.  This is a term of insult in the second

<A NAME=TAG1292><B>one-banana problem</B></A> /n./ <P> At mainframe shops, where the
   computers have operators for routine administrivia, the programmers
   and hardware people tend to look down on the operators and claim
   that a trained monkey could do their job.  It is frequently
   observed that the incentives that would be offered said monkeys can
   be used as a scale to describe the difficulty of a task.  A
   one-banana problem is simple; hence, "It's only a one-banana job
   at the most; what's taking them so long?" <P>
   At IBM, folklore divides the world into one-, two-, and
   three-banana problems.  Other cultures have different hierarchies
   and may divide them more finely; at ICL, for example, five grapes
   (a bunch) equals a banana.  Their upper limit for the in-house

   source claims it's three bananas and one grape, but observes
   "However, this is subject to local variations, cosmic rays and
   ISO").  At a complication level any higher than that, one asks the
   manufacturers to send someone around to check things.  <P>

The objective is to see who can code the most interesting
   and/or useful routine in one line of operators chosen from APL's
   exceedingly  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG844" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG844">hairy</A> primitive set.  A similar amusement was
   practiced among  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1760" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1760">TECO</A> hackers and is now popular among
    <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1353" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1353">Perl</A> aficionados.     
   Ken Iverson, the inventor of APL, has been credited with a

   prime numbers from 1 to @Math{N} inclusive.  It looks like this: <P>

   "Bartholomew and the Oobleck"; the spelling `oobleck' is still
   current in the mainstream] A bizarre semi-liquid sludge made from
   cornstarch and water.  Enjoyed among hackers who make batches
   during playtime at parties for its amusing and extremely
   non-Newtonian behavior; it pours and splatters, but resists rapid
   motion like a solid and will even crack when hit by a hammer.
   Often found near lasers.  <P>

<P>
   This recipe isn't quite as non-Newtonian as a pure cornstarch
   ooblick, but has an appropriately slimy feel.  <P>
   Some, however, insist that the notion of an ooblick <EM>recipe</EM>
   is far too mechanical, and that it is best to add the water in
   small increments so that the various mixed states the cornstarch
   goes through as it <EM>becomes</EM> ooblick can be grokked in
   fullness by many hands.  For optional ingredients of this

All programmers are optimists.  Perhaps this

programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists.  But

<A NAME=TAG1308><B>orthogonal</B></A> /adj./ <P> [from mathematics] Mutually independent;
   well separated; sometimes, irrelevant to.  Used in a generalization
   of its mathematical meaning to describe sets of primitives or
   capabilities that, like a vector basis in geometry, span the entire
   `capability space' of the system and are in some sense
   non-overlapping or mutually independent.  For example, in
   architectures such as the PDP-11 or VAX where all or nearly all
   registers can be used interchangeably in any role with respect to
   any instruction, the register set is said to be orthogonal.  Or, in
   logic, the set of operators `not' and `or' is orthogonal, but
   the set `nand', `or', and `not' is not (because any one of
   these can be expressed in terms of the others).  Also used in
   comments on human discourse: "This may be orthogonal to the
   discussion, but...." <P>

   Mentioning it is usually good for a cheap laugh among hackers ---

   informed hackers now rate them superior to Microsoft Windows (an
   endorsement which, however, could easily be construed as damning
   with faint praise).  See  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1167" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1167">monstrosity</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG383" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG383">cretinous</A>,

<A NAME=TAG1313><B>out-of-band</B></A> /adj./ <P> [from telecommunications and network
   theory] 1. In software, describes values of a function which are
   not in its `natural' range of return values, but are rather
   signals that some kind of exception has occurred.  Many C
   functions, for example, return a nonnegative integral value, but
   indicate failure with an out-of-band return value of -1.

   The term  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1344" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1344">pdl</A> seems to be primarily an MITism; outside MIT this

<A NAME=TAG1316><B>overrun</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. [techspeak] Term for a frequent consequence
   of data arriving faster than it can be consumed, esp. in serial
   line communications.  For example, at 9600 baud there is almost
   exactly one character per millisecond, so if a  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1613" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1613">silo</A> can hold
   only two characters and the machine takes longer than 2 msec to get
   to service the interrupt, at least one character will be lost.
   2. Also applied to non-serial-I/O communications.  "I forgot to
   pay my electric bill due to mail overrun."  "Sorry, I got four
   phone calls in 3 minutes last night and lost your message to
   overrun."  When  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1787" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1787">thrash</A>ing at tasks, the next person to make a
