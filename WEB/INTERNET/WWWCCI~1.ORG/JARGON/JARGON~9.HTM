<A NAME=TAG1><B>abbrev</B></A> /*-breev'/, /*-brev'/ /n./ <P> Common abbreviation for
   `abbreviation'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2><B>ABEND</B></A> /a'bend/, /*-bend'/ /n./ <P> [ABnormal END] Abnormal
   termination (of software);  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG369" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG369">crash</A>;  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1071" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1071">lossage</A>.  Derives from
   an error message on the IBM 360; used jokingly by hackers but
   seriously mainly by  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG305" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG305">code grinder</A>s.  Usually capitalized, but
   may appear as `abend'.  Hackers will try to persuade you that
   ABEND is called `abend' because it is what system operators do to
   the machine late on Friday when they want to call it a day, and
   hence is from the German `Abend' = `Evening'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG3><B>accumulator</B></A> /n. obs./ <P> 1. Archaic term for a register.  On-line
   use of it as a synonym for `register' is a fairly reliable
   indication that the user has been around for quite a while and/or
   that the architecture under discussion is quite old.  The term in
   full is almost never used of microprocessor registers, for example,
   though symbolic names for arithmetic registers beginning in `A'
   derive from historical use of the term `accumulator' (and not,
   actually, from `arithmetic').  Confusingly, though, an `A'
   register name prefix may also stand for `address', as for
   example on the Motorola 680x0 family.  2. A register being used for
   arithmetic or logic (as opposed to addressing or a loop index),
   especially one being used to accumulate a sum or count of many
   items.  This use is in context of a particular routine or stretch
   of code.  "The FOOBAZ routine uses A3 as an accumulator."
   3. One's in-basket (esp. among old-timers who might use sense 1).
   "You want this reviewed?  Sure, just put it in the accumulator."
   (See  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1690" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1690">stack</A>.)<P>
<A NAME=TAG4><B>ACK</B></A> /ak/ /interj./ <P> 1. [from the ASCII mnemonic for 0000110]
   Acknowledge.  Used to register one's presence (compare mainstream
   <EM>Yo!</EM>).  An appropriate response to  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1368" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1368">ping</A> or  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG555" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG555">ENQ</A>.
   2. [from the comic strip "Bloom County"] An exclamation of
   surprised disgust, esp. in "Ack pffft!"  Semi-humorous.
   Generally this sense is not spelled in caps (ACK) and is
   distinguished by a following exclamation point.  3. Used to
   politely interrupt someone to tell them you understand their point
   (see  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1209" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1209">NAK</A>).  Thus, for example, you might cut off an overly
   long explanation with "Ack.  Ack.  Ack.  I get it now".
<P>
   There is also a usage "ACK?" (from sense 1) meaning "Are you
   there?", often used in email when earlier mail has produced no
   reply, or during a lull in  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1748" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1748">talk mode</A> to see if the person has
   gone away (the standard humorous response is of course  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1209" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1209">NAK</A>
   (sense 2), i.e., "I'm not here").  <P>
<A NAME=TAG5><B>Acme</B></A> /n./ <P> The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and
   non-functional gadgetry -- where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson
   shop.  Describing some X as an "Acme X" either means "This is
    <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG944" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG944">insanely great</A>", or, more likely, "This looks  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG944" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG944">insanely great</A> on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot yourself
   in the foot with it."  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1371" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1371">pistol</A>.
<P>
   This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained
   here for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the
   Warner Brothers' series of "Roadrunner" cartoons.  In these
   cartoons, the famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to
   catch up with, trap, and eat the Roadrunner.  His attempts usually
   involved one or more high-technology Rube Goldberg devices --
   rocket jetpacks, catapults, magnetic traps, high-powered
   slingshots, etc.  These were usually delivered in large cardboard
   boxes, labeled prominently with the Acme name.  These devices
   invariably malfunctioned in violent and improbable ways.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG6><B>acolyte</B></A> /n. obs./ <P> [TMRC] An  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1311" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1311">OSU</A> privileged enough to

<A NAME=TAG7><B>ad-hockery</B></A> /ad-hok'*r-ee/ /n./ <P> [Purdue] 1. Gratuitous
   assumptions made inside certain programs, esp. expert systems,
   which lead to the appearance of semi-intelligent behavior but are
   in fact entirely arbitrary.  For example, fuzzy-matching of
   input tokens that might be typing errors against a symbol table can
   make it look as though a program knows how to spell.
   2. Special-case code to cope with some awkward input that would
   otherwise cause a program to  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG283" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG283">choke</A>, presuming normal inputs
   are dealt with in some cleaner and more regular way.  Also called
   `ad-hackery', `ad-hocity' (/ad-hos'*-tee/), `ad-crockery'.

<A NAME=TAG8><B>Ada</B></A> /n./ <P> A  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1333" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1333">Pascal</A>-descended language that has been made
   mandatory for Department of Defense software projects by the
   Pentagon.  Hackers are nearly unanimous in observing that,
   technically, it is precisely what one might expect given that kind
   of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee, crockish, difficult
   to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle
   (one common description is "The PL/I of the 1980s").  Hackers
   find Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication
   features particularly hilarious.  Ada Lovelace (the daughter of
   Lord Byron who became the world's first programmer while
   cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical
   computing engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch
   at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest
   thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good
   small language screaming to get out from inside its vast,
    <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG543" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG543">elephantine</A> bulk.  <P>

   the middle name of an infamous  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1768" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1768">tenured graduate student</A>] To
   make a bonehead move with consequences that could have been
   foreseen with even slight mental effort.  E.g., "He started
   removing files and promptly adgered the whole project".  Compare

<A NAME=TAG10><B>admin</B></A> /ad-min'/ /n./ <P> Short for `administrator'; very
   commonly used in speech or on-line to refer to the systems person
   in charge on a computer.  Common constructions on this include
   `sysadmin' and `site admin' (emphasizing the administrator's
   role as a site contact for email and news) or `newsadmin'
   (focusing specifically on news).  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1400" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1400">postmaster</A>,

<A NAME=TAG11><B>ADVENT</B></A> /ad'vent/ /n./ <P> The prototypical computer adventure
   game, first designed by Will Crowther on the  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1345" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1345">PDP-10</A> in the
   mid-1970s as an attempt at computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and
   expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in
   1976.  Now better known as Adventure, but the  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1819" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1819">TOPS-10</A>
   operating system permitted only six-letter filenames.  See also

   This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in
   text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have
   become fixtures of hacker-speak:  "A huge green fierce snake bars
   the way!"  "I see no X here" (for some noun X).  "You are in a
   maze of twisty little passages, all alike."  "You are in a little
   maze of twisty passages, all different."  The `magic words'
    <A HREF="JARGO~37.HTM#TAG2024" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_39.html#TAG2024">xyzzy</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1384" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1384">plugh</A> also derive from this game. <P>
   Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the
   Mammoth &#38; Flint Ridge cave system; it actually <EM>has</EM> a
   `Colossal Cave' and a `Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that
   also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary
   entrance.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG15><B>AI-complete</B></A> /A-I k*m-pleet'/ /adj./ <P> [MIT, Stanford: by
   analogy with `NP-complete' (see  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1269" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1269">NP-</A>)] Used to describe
   problems or subproblems in AI, to indicate that the solution
   presupposes a solution to the `strong AI problem' (that is, the
   synthesis of a human-level intelligence).  A problem that is
   AI-complete is, in other words, just too hard.
<P>
   Examples of AI-complete problems are `The Vision Problem'
   (building a system that can see as well as a human) and `The
   Natural Language Problem' (building a system that can understand
   and speak a natural language as well as a human).  These may appear
   to be modular, but all attempts so far (1996) to solve them have
   foundered on the amount of context information and `intelligence'
   they seem to require. See also  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG736" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG736">gedanken</A>.  <P>

   RS/6000 series (some hackers think it is funnier just to pronounce
   "AIX" as "aches").  A victim of the dreaded "hybridism"

   PC usage does not simply set the 0200 bit).  2. /n./ The `clover'
   or `Command' key on a Macintosh; use of this term usually reveals
   that the speaker hacked PCs before coming to the Mac (see also
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG599" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG599">feature key</A>).  Some Mac hackers, confusingly, reserve `alt'
   for the Option key (and it is so labeled on some Mac II keyboards).
   3. /n.,obs/.  [PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name for
   the ASCII ESC character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap labeling
   on some older terminals; also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/).  This
   character was almost never pronounced `escape' on an ITS system,
   in  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1760" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1760">TECO</A>, or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in "Type alt alt
   to end a TECO command" or "alt-U onto the system" (for "log
   onto the [ITS] system").  This usage probably arose because alt is
   more convenient to say than `escape', especially when followed by
   another alt or a character (or another alt <EM>and</EM> a character,
   for that matter).  4. The <I>alt</I> hierarchy on Usenet, the tree of
   newsgroups created by users without a formal vote and approval

<A NAME=TAG33><B>ANSI</B></A> /an'see/ <P> 1. /n./ [techspeak] The American National
   Standards Institute. ANSI, along with the International Organization
   for Standards (ISO), standardized the C programming language (see
    <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG979" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG979">K&#38;R</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG294" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG294">Classic C</A>), and promulgates many other important
   software standards.  2. /n./ [techspeak] A terminal may be said to be
   `ANSI' if it meets the ANSI X.364 standard for terminal control.
   Unfortunately, this standard was both over-complicated and too
   permissive.  It has been retired and replaced by the ECMA-48
   standard, which shares both flaws.  3. /n./ [BBS jargon] The set of
   screen-painting codes that most MS-DOS and Amiga computers accept.
   This comes from the ANSI.SYS device driver that must be loaded on
   an MS-DOS computer to view such codes.  Unfortunately, neither DOS
   ANSI nor the BBS ANSIs derived from it exactly match the ANSI X.364
   terminal standard.  For example, the ESC-[1m code turns on the bold
   highlight on large machines, but in IBM PC/MS-DOS ANSI, it turns on
   `intense' (bright) colors.  Also, in BBS-land, the term `ANSI' is
   often used to imply that a particular computer uses or can emulate
   the IBM high-half character set from MS-DOS.  Particular use
   depends on context. Occasionally, the vanilla ASCII character set
   is used with the color codes, but on BBSs, ANSI and `IBM
   characters' tend to go together. <P>

   To increase the amount of something. "AOS the campfire."

    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG230" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG230">bump</A>.

   supported at one time by Data General.  This was pronounced
   /A-O-S/ or /A-os/.  A spoof of the standard AOS system
   administrator's manual ("How to Load and Generate your AOS
   System") was created, issued a part number, and circulated as
   photocopy folklore; it was called "How to Goad and Levitate
   your CHAOS System".  3. /n./ Algebraic Operating System, in reference
   to those calculators which use infix instead of postfix (reverse
   Polish) notation.  4. A  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG216">BSD</A>-like operating system for the IBM
   RT. <P>
   Historical note: AOS in sense 1 was the name of a  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1345" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1345">PDP-10</A>
   instruction that took any memory location in the computer and added
   1 to it; AOS meant `Add One and do not Skip'.  Why, you may ask,
   does the `S' stand for `do not Skip' rather than for `Skip'?  Ah,
   here was a beloved piece of PDP-10 folklore.  There were eight such
   instructions: AOSE added 1 and then skipped the next instruction
   if the result was Equal to zero; AOSG added 1 and then skipped if
   the result was Greater than 0; AOSN added 1 and then skipped
   if the result was Not 0; AOSA added 1 and then skipped Always;
   and so on.  Just plain AOS didn't say when to skip, so it never
   skipped.
<P>
   For similar reasons, AOJ meant `Add One and do not Jump'.  Even
   more bizarre, SKIP meant `do not SKIP'!  If you wanted to skip the
   next instruction, you had to say `SKIPA'.  Likewise, JUMP meant
   `do not JUMP'; the unconditional form was JUMPA.  However, hackers
   never did this.  By some quirk of the 10's design, the  <A HREF="JARGO~25.HTM#TAG974" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_25.html#TAG974">JRST</A>
   (Jump and ReSTore flag with no flag specified) was actually faster
   and so was invariably used.  Such were the perverse mysteries of
   assembler programming.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG35><B>app</B></A> /ap/ /n./ <P> Short for `application program', as opposed
   to a systems program.  Apps are what systems vendors are forever
   chasing developers to create for their environments so they can
   sell more boxes.  Hackers tend not to think of the things they
   themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker parlance the term excludes
   compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a
   user would consider all those to be apps.  (Broadly, an app is
   often a self-contained environment for performing some well-defined
   task such as `word processing'; hackers tend to prefer more
   general-purpose tools.) See  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG991" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG991">killer app</A>; oppose  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1815" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1815">tool</A>,

   The pronunciation of <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> as `pound' is common in the U.S.
   but a bad idea;  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG317" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG317">Commonwealth Hackish</A> has its own, rather more
   apposite use of `pound sign' (confusingly, on British keyboards
   the pound graphic
   happens to replace <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>; thus Britishers sometimes
   call <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard `pound', compounding the
   American error).  The U.S. usage derives from an old-fashioned
   commercial practice of using a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> suffix to tag pound weights
   on bills of lading.  The character is usually pronounced `hash'
   outside the U.S.  There are more culture wars over the correct
   pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to
   the  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG823" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG823">ha ha only serious</A> suggestion that it be pronounced
   `shibboleth' (see Judges 12.6 in a Christian Bible). <P>
   The `uparrow' name for circumflex and `leftarrow' name for
   underline are historical relics from archaic ASCII (the 1963
   version), which had these graphics in those character positions
   rather than the modern punctuation characters.  <P>
   The `swung dash' or `approximation' sign is not quite the same
   as tilde in typeset material
   but the ASCII tilde serves for both (compare  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG30" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG30">angle brackets</A>).  <P>
   Some other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>,
   <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> characters, for example, are all
   pronounced "hex" in different communities because various
   assemblers use them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in
   particular, <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> in many assembler-programming cultures,
   <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in the 6502 world, <SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> at Texas Instruments, and
   <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and some Z80 machines).  See
   also  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1682" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1682">splat</A>.  <P>
   The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the
   world's other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits
   look more and more like a serious  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1153" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1153">misfeature</A> as the use of

   the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that
   characters have 7 bits; this is a a major irritant to people who
   want to use a character set suited to their own languages.
   Perversely, though, efforts to solve this problem by proliferating
   `national' character sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use
   a <EM>smaller</EM> subset common to all those in use.  <P>

   There is a newsgroup, <I><a href="news:alt.ascii.art">alt.ascii.art</a></I>, devoted to this

<A NAME=TAG45><B>ASCIIbetical order</B></A> /as'kee-be'-t*-kl or'dr/ /adj.,n./ <P> Used
   to indicate that data is sorted in ASCII collated order rather than
   alphabetical order.  This lexicon is sorted in something close to
   ASCIIbetical order, but with case ignored and entries beginning
   with non-alphabetic characters moved to the end.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG46><B>atomic</B></A> /adj./ <P> [from Gk. `atomos', indivisible]
   1. Indivisible; cannot be split up.  For example, an instruction
   may be said to do several things `atomically', i.e., all the
   things are done immediately, and there is no chance of the
   instruction being half-completed or of another being interspersed.
   Used esp. to convey that an operation cannot be screwed up by
   interrupts.  "This routine locks the file and increments the
   file's semaphore atomically."  2. [primarily techspeak] Guaranteed
   to complete successfully or not at all, usu. refers to database
   transactions.  If an error prevents a partially-performed
   transaction from proceeding to completion, it must be "backed out,"
   as the database must not be left in an inconsistent state.  <P>
   Computer usage, in either of the above senses, has none of the
   connotations that `atomic' has in mainstream English (i.e.  of
   particles of matter, nuclear explosions etc.).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG47><B>attoparsec</B></A> /n./ <P> About an inch.  `atto-' is the standard SI
   prefix for multiplication by @Math{10^(-18)}.  A parsec
   (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an attoparsec is thus
   @Math{3.26 * 10^(-18)} light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1
   attoparsec/ <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1143" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1143">microfortnight</A> equals about 1 inch/sec).  This unit
   is reported to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among
   hackers in the U.K.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1140" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1140">micro-</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG49><B>automagically</B></A> /aw-toh-maj'i-klee/ /adv./ <P> Automatically, but
   in a way that, for some reason (typically because it is too
   complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the speaker
   doesn't feel like explaining to you.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1092" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1092">magic</A>.  "The
   C-INTERCAL compiler generates C, then automagically invokes
   <CODE>cc(1)</CODE> to produce an executable."  <P>
   This term is quite old, going back at least to the mid-70s and
   probably much earlier.  The word `automagic' occurred in advertising
   (for a shirt-ironing gadget) as far back as the late 1940s. <P>
<A NAME=TAG50><B>avatar</B></A> /n./ Syn. <P> 1. Among people working on virtual reality
   and  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG407" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG407">cyberspace</A> interfaces, an <DFN>avatar</DFN> is an icon or
   representation of a user in a shared virtual reality.  The term is
   sometimes used on  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1184" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1184">MUD</A>s.  2. [CMU, Tektronix]  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1515" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1515">root</A>,
    <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1725" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1725">superuser</A>.  There are quite a few Unix machines on which the
   name of the superuser account is `avatar' rather than `root'.
   This quirk was originated by a CMU hacker who disliked the term
   `superuser', and was propagated through an ex-CMU hacker at
   Tektronix.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG51><B>awk</B></A> /awk/ <P> 1. /n./ [Unix techspeak] An interpreted language
   for massaging text data developed by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger,
   and Brian Kernighan (the name derives from their initials).  It is
   characterized by C-like syntax, a declaration-free approach to
   variable typing and declarations, associative arrays, and
   field-oriented text processing.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1353" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1353">Perl</A>.  2. n.
