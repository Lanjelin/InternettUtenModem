<A NAME=TAG917><B>I didn't change anything!</B></A> /interj./ <P> An aggrieved cry often
   heard as bugs manifest during a regression test.  The
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG250" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG250">canonical</A> reply to this assertion is "Then it works just the
   same as it did before, doesn't it?"  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1293" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1293">one-line fix</A>.
   This is also heard from applications programmers trying to blame an
   obvious applications problem on an unrelated systems software
   change, for example a divide-by-0 fault after terminals were added
   to a network.  Usually, their statement is found to be false.  Upon
   close questioning, they will admit some major restructuring of the
   program that shouldn't have broken anything, in their opinion, but
   which actually  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG904" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG904">hosed</A> the code completely.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG918><B>I see no X here.</B></A> <P> Hackers (and the interactive computer
   games they write) traditionally favor this slightly marked usage
   over other possible equivalents such as "There's no X here!" or
   "X is missing."  or "Where's the X?".  This goes back to the
   original PDP-10  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG11">ADVENT</A>, which would respond in this wise if
   you asked it to do something involving an object not present at
   your location in the game.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG919><B>IBM</B></A> /I-B-M/ <P> Inferior But Marketable; It's Better
   Manually; Insidious Black Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning;
   Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a near- <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG937" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG937">infinite</A> number of even
   less complimentary expansions, including `International Business
   Machines'.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1805" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1805">TLA</A>.  These abbreviations illustrate the
   considerable antipathy most hackers have long felt toward the
   `industry leader' (see  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG596" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG596">fear and loathing</A>).  <P>
   What galls hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level isn't
   so much that they are underpowered and overpriced (though that does
   count against them), but that the designs are incredibly archaic,
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG393" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG393">crufty</A>, and  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG543" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG543">elephantine</A> ... and you can't <EM>fix</EM> them
   -- source code is locked up tight, and programming tools are
   expensive, hard to find, and bletcherous to use once you've found
   them.  With the release of the Unix-based RIOS family this may have
   begun to change -- but then, we thought that when the PC-RT came
   out, too.  <P>
   In the spirit of universal peace and brotherhood, this lexicon now
   includes a number of entries attributed to `IBM'; these derive from
   some rampantly unofficial jargon lists circulated within IBM's own
   beleaguered hacker underground.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG920><B>IBM discount</B></A> /n./ <P> A price increase.  Outside IBM, this
   derives from the common perception that IBM products are generally
   overpriced (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG299" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG299">clone</A>); inside, it is said to spring from a
   belief that large numbers of IBM employees living in an area cause
   prices to rise.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG921><B>ICBM address</B></A> /n./ <P> (Also `missile address') The form used to
   register a site with the Usenet mapping project includes a blank
   for longitude and latitude, preferably to seconds-of-arc accuracy.
   This is actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of
   Usenet links on a plotter; however, it has become traditional to
   refer to this as one's `ICBM address' or `missile address', and
   many people include it in their  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1607" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1607">sig block</A> with that name.  (A
   real missile address would include target altitude.)  <P>
<A NAME=TAG922><B>ice</B></A> /n./ <P> [coined by Usenetter Tom Maddox, popularized by
   William Gibson's cyberpunk SF novels: a contrived acronym for
   `Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics'] Security software (in
   Gibson's novels, software that responds to intrusion by attempting
   to immobilize or even literally kill the intruder).  Hence,
   `icebreaker': a program designed for cracking security on a
   system.  <P>
   Neither term is in serious use yet as of early 1996, but many
   hackers find the metaphor attractive, and each may develop a
   denotation in the future. In the meantime, the speculative usage
   could be confused with `ICE', an acronym for "in-circuit
   emulator".  <P>
   In ironic reference to the speculative usage, however, some hackers
   and computer scientists formed ICE (International Cryptographic
   Experiment) in 1994. ICE is a consortium to promote uniform
   international access to strong cryptography.  ICE has a home page
   at <I><a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS10.HTM#1040" tppabs="http://www.tis.com/crypto/ice.html">http://www.tis.com/crypto/ice.html</a></I>. <P>
<A NAME=TAG923><B>idempotent</B></A> /adj./ <P> [from mathematical techspeak] Acting as if
   used only once, even if used multiple times.  This term is often
   used with respect to  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG242" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG242">C</A> header files, which contain common
   definitions and declarations to be included by several source
   files.  If a header file is ever included twice during the same
   compilation (perhaps due to nested #include files), compilation
   errors can result unless the header file has protected itself
   against multiple inclusion; a header file so protected is said to
   be idempotent.  The term can also be used to describe an
   initialization subroutine that is arranged to perform some critical
   action exactly once, even if the routine is called several times.
<P>
<A NAME=TAG924><B>If you want X, you know where to find it.</B></A> <P> There is a legend
   that Dennis Ritchie, inventor of  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG242" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG242">C</A>, once responded to demands
   for features resembling those of what at the time was a much more
   popular language by observing "If you want PL/I, you know where to
   find it."  Ever since, this has been hackish standard form for
   fending off requests to alter a new design to mimic some older
   (and, by implication, inferior and  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG80" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG80">baroque</A>) one.  The case X =
    <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1333" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1333">Pascal</A> manifests semi-regularly on Usenet's <I><a href="news:comp.lang.c">comp.lang.c</a></I>
   newsgroup.  Indeed, the case X = X has been reported in discussions
   of graphics software (see  <A HREF="JARGO~37.HTM#TAG2017" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_39.html#TAG2017">X</A>).  <P>

<A NAME=TAG926><B>ill-behaved</B></A> /adj./ <P> 1. [numerical analysis] Said of an
   algorithm or computational method that tends to blow up because of
   accumulated roundoff error or poor convergence properties.
   2. Software that bypasses the defined  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1309" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1309">OS</A> interfaces to do
   things (like screen, keyboard, and disk I/O) itself, often in a way
   that depends on the hardware of the machine it is running on or
   which is nonportable or incompatible with other pieces of software.
   In the IBM PC/MS-DOS world, there is a folk theorem (nearly true)
   to the effect that (owing to gross inadequacies and performance
   penalties in the OS interface) all interesting applications are
   ill-behaved.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG74" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG74">bare metal</A>. Oppose  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1958" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1958">well-behaved</A>,

    <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A> first got off the ground in 1980--81, it has grown
   exponentially, approximately doubling in size every year.  On the
   other hand, most people feel the  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1610" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1610">signal-to-noise ratio</A> of
   Usenet has dropped steadily.  These trends led, as far back as
   mid-1983, to predictions of the imminent collapse (or death) of the
   net.  Ten years and numerous doublings later, enough of these
   gloomy prognostications have been confounded that the phrase
   "Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!" has become a running joke,
   hauled out any time someone grumbles about the  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1535" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1535">S/N ratio</A> or
   the huge and steadily increasing volume, or the possible loss of a
   key node or link, or the potential for lawsuits when ignoramuses
   post copyrighted material, etc., etc., etc.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG929><B>in the extreme</B></A> /adj./ <P> A preferred superlative suffix for many
   hackish terms.  See, for example, `obscure in the extreme' under

<A NAME=TAG934><B>indent style</B></A> /n./ <P> [C programmers] The rules one uses to
   indent code in a readable fashion.  There are four major C indent
   styles, described below; all have the aim of making it easier for
   the reader to visually track the scope of control constructs.  The
   significant variable is the placement of <SAMP>`{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`}'</SAMP>
   with respect to the statement(s) they enclose and to the guard or
   controlling statement (<CODE>if</CODE>, <CODE>else</CODE>, <CODE>for</CODE>,

   style' because the Unix kernel is written in it, and the `One True
   Brace Style' (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans.  The basic indent
   shown here is eight spaces (or one tab) per level; four spaces are
   occasionally seen, but are much less common.

   Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
   common, with about equal mind shares.  K&#38;R/1TBS used to be nearly
   universal, but is now much less common (the opening brace tends to
   get lost against the right paren of the guard part in an <CODE>if</CODE>
   or <CODE>while</CODE>, which is a  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG60" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG60">Bad Thing</A>).  Defenders of 1TBS
   argue that any putative gain in readability is less important than
   their style's relative economy with vertical space, which enables
   one to see more code on one's screen at once.  Doubtless these
   issues will continue to be the subject of  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG897">holy wars</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG936><B>infant mortality</B></A> /n./ <P> It is common lore among hackers (and in
   the electronics industry at large; this term is possibly techspeak
   by now) that the chances of sudden hardware failure drop off
   exponentially with a machine's time since first use (that is, until
   the relatively distant time at which enough mechanical wear in I/O
   devices and thermal-cycling stress in components has accumulated
   for the machine to start going senile).  Up to half of all chip and
   wire failures happen within a new system's first few weeks; such
   failures are often referred to as `infant mortality' problems
   (or, occasionally, as `sudden infant death syndrome').  See

   follow `infinite', though, is  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG842" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG842">hair</A>.  (It has been pointed
   out that fractals are an excellent example of infinite hair.)
   These uses are abuses of the word's mathematical meaning.  The term
   `semi-infinite', denoting an immoderately large amount of some
   resource, is also heard.  "This compiler is taking a semi-infinite
   amount of time to optimize my program."  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1582" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1582">semi</A>.  <P>

    <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG214" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG214">brute force</A> method; the implication is that, with enough

   This theorem was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur
   Eddington.  It became part of the idiom of techies via the classic
   SF short story "Inflexible Logic" by Russell Maloney, and

<A NAME=TAG940><B>infinity</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. The largest value that can be represented in
   a particular type of variable (register, memory location, data
   type, whatever).  2. `minus infinity': The smallest such value,
   not necessarily or even usually the simple negation of plus
   infinity.  In @Math{N}-bit twos-complement arithmetic, infinity is
   @Math{2^(N-1) - 1} but minus infinity is @Math{-
   (2^(N-1))}, not @Math{-(2^(N-1) - 1)}.  Note also that this
   is different from <DFN>time T equals minus infinity</DFN>, which is

   unspeakable.  An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will

It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose
work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem.  For example, if

any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd.  Since this
is indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look
foolish in front of his boss, who would of course have happened to
turn up, as bosses are wont to do.  The effect would be no less
devastating for the programmer having been correct.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

   INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even
   more unspeakable.  The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used
   by many (well, at least several) people at Princeton.  The language
   has been recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently
   enjoying an unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an

<A NAME=TAG947><B>Internet</B></A> /n./  <P> The mother of all networks.  First
   incarnated beginning in 1969 as the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of
   Defense research testbed.  Though it has been widely believed that
   the goal was to develop a network architecture for military
   command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to and
   including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was
   conceived from the start as a way to get most economical use out of
   then-scarce large-computer resources. <P>
   As originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to
   support what is now called remote login and more sophisticated
   forms of distributed computing, but the infant technology of
   electronic mail quickly grew to dominate actual usage.
   Universities, research labs and defense contractors early
   discovered the Internet's potential as a medium of communication
   between <EM>humans</EM> and linked up in steadily increasing numbers,
   connecting together a quirky mix of academics, techies, hippies, SF
   fans, hackers, and anarchists.  The roots of this lexicon lie in
   those early years. <P>
   Over the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many
   ways. The typical machine/OS combination moved from DEC
    <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1345" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1345">PDP-10</A>s and  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1346" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1346">PDP-20</A>s, running  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1819" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1819">TOPS-10</A> and
    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1820" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1820">TOPS-20</A>, to PDP-11s and VAXes and Suns running  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A>, and
   in the 1990s to Unix on Intel microcomputers.  The Internet's
   protocols grew more capable, most notably in the move from NCP/IP
   to  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1757" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1757">TCP/IP</A> in 1982 and the implementation of Domain Name
   Service in 1983.  With TCP/IP and DNS in place.  It was around this
   time that people began referring to the collection of
   interconnected networks with ARPANET at its core as "the
   Internet". <P>
   The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines --
   connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related
   research project.  By the mid-80s, many of the organizations
   clamoring to join didn't fit this profile.  In 1986, the National
   Science Foundation built NSFnet to open up access to its five
   regional supercomputing centers; NSFnet became the backbone of the
   Internet, replacing the original ARPANET pipes (which were formally
   shut down in 1990).  Between 1990 and late 1994 the pieces of
   NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications companies until 
   the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial. <P>
   That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture
   discovered the Internet.  Once again, the  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG991" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG991">killer app</A> was not the
   anticipated one -- rather, what caught the public imagination was
   the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web.  As of
   early 1996, the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger
   (the OSI protocol stack favored by European telecom monopolies) and
   is in the process of absorbing into itself many of of the
   proprietary networks built during the second wave of wide-area
   networking after 1980.  It is now a commonplace even in mainstream
   media to predict that a globally-extended Internet will become the
   key unifying communications technology of the next century. See

   influential though highly idiosyncratic operating system written for
   PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and long used at the MIT AI Lab.  Much
   AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS folklore, and to have been `an
   ITS hacker' qualifies one instantly as an old-timer of the most
   venerable sort.  ITS pioneered many important innovations,
   including transparent file sharing between machines and
   terminal-independent I/O.  After about 1982, most actual work was
   shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run
   essentially as a hobby and service to the hacker community.  The
   shutdown of the lab's last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end
   of an era and sent old-time hackers into mourning nationwide (see
    <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG886" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG886">high moby</A>).  The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden is
   maintaining one `live' ITS site at its computer museum (right
   next to the only TOPS-10 system still on the Internet), so ITS is
   still alleged to hold the record for OS in longest continuous use
   (however,  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1926" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1926">WAITS</A> is a credible rival for this palm).  2. A

   continue believing that an OS maintained by assembly-language
   hand-hacking that supported only monocase 6-character filenames in
   one directory per account remains superior to today's state of
   commercial art (their venom against Unix is particularly intense).
