<A NAME=TAG1202><B>N</B></A> /N/ /quant./ <P> 1. A large and indeterminate number of
   objects: "There were @Math{N} bugs in that crock!"  Also used in
   its original sense of a variable name: "This crock has @Math{N}
   bugs, as @Math{N} goes to infinity."  (The true number of bugs is
   always at least @Math{N + 1}; see  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1077" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1077">Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology</A>.)  2. A variable whose value is inherited from the
   current context.  For example, when a meal is being ordered at a
   restaurant, @Math{N} may be understood to mean however many people
   there are at the table.  From the remark "We'd like to order
   @Math{N} wonton soups and a family dinner for @Math{N - 1}" you
   can deduce that one person at the table wants to eat only soup,
   even though you don't know how many people there are (see
    <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG794" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG794">great-wall</A>).  3. `@Math{N'th}: /adj./ The ordinal counterpart
   of @Math{N}, senses 1 and 2.  "Now for the @Math{N}th and last
   time..." In the specific context "@Math{N}th-year grad
   student", @Math{N} is generally assumed to be at least 4, and is
   usually 5 or more (see  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1768" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1768">tenured graduate student</A>).  See also

<A NAME=TAG1203><B>nadger</B></A> /nad'jr/ /v./ <P> [UK] Of software or hardware (not
   people), to twiddle some object in a hidden manner, generally so
   that it conforms better to some format.  For instance, string
   printing routines on 8-bit processors often take the string text
   from the instruction stream, thus a print call looks like <CODE>jsr
   print:"Hello world"</CODE>.  The print routine has to `nadger' the
   saved instruction pointer so that the processor doesn't try to
   execute the text as instructions when the subroutine returns.  <P>
   Apparently this word originated on a now-legendary 1950s radio
   comedy program called "The Goon Show".  The Goon Show usage
   of "nadger" was definitely in the sense of "jinxed"
   "clobbered" "fouled up".  The American mutation  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG9" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG9">adger</A>
   seems to have preserved more of the original flavor. <P>
<A NAME=TAG1204><B>nagware</B></A> /nag'weir/ /n./ <P> [Usenet] The variety of  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1592" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1592">shareware</A>
   that displays a large screen at the beginning or end reminding you
   to register, typically requiring some sort of keystroke to continue
   so that you can't use the software in batch mode.  Compare

<A NAME=TAG1207><B>naive</B></A> /adj./ <P> Untutored in the perversities of some particular
   program or system; one who still tries to do things in an intuitive
   way, rather than the right way (in really good designs these
   coincide, but most designs aren't `really good' in the
   appropriate sense).  This trait is completely unrelated to general
   maturity or competence, or even competence at any other specific
   program.  It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of
   computing that the natural opposite of this term is often claimed
   to be `experienced user' but is really more like `cynical
   user'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1208><B>naive user</B></A> /n./ <P> A  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1080" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1080">luser</A>.  Tends to imply someone who is
   ignorant mainly owing to inexperience.  When this is applied to
   someone who <EM>has</EM> experience, there is a definite implication
   of stupidity.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1209><B>NAK</B></A> /nak/ /interj./ <P> [from the ASCII mnemonic for 0010101]
   1. On-line joke answer to  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG4" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG4">ACK</A>?: "I'm not here."  2. On-line
   answer to a request for chat: "I'm not available."  3. Used to
   politely interrupt someone to tell them you don't understand their
   point or that they have suddenly stopped making sense.  See
    <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG4" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG4">ACK</A>, sense 3.  "And then, after we recode the project in
   COBOL...." "Nak, Nak, Nak!  I thought I heard you say
   COBOL!" <P>
<A NAME=TAG1210><B>nano</B></A> /nan'oh/ /n./ <P> [CMU: from `nanosecond'] A brief
   period of time.  "Be with you in a nano" means you really will be
   free shortly, i.e., implies what mainstream people mean by "in a
   jiffy" (whereas the hackish use of `jiffy' is quite different
   -- see  <A HREF="JARGO~25.HTM#TAG968" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_25.html#TAG968">jiffy</A>).  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1212><B>nanoacre</B></A> /nan'oh-ay`kr/ /n./ <P> A unit (about 2 mm square) of
   real estate on a VLSI chip.  The term gets its giggle value from
   the fact that VLSI nanoacres have costs in the same range as real
   acres once one figures in design and fabrication-setup costs.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1213><B>nanobot</B></A> /nan'oh-bot/ /n./ <P> A robot of microscopic
   proportions, presumably built by means of  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1216">nanotechnology</A>.  As
   yet, only used informally (and speculatively!).  Also called a
   `nanoagent'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1214><B>nanocomputer</B></A> /nan'oh-k*m-pyoo'tr/ /n./ <P> A computer with
   molecular-sized switching elements.  Designs for mechanical
   nanocomputers which use single-molecule sliding rods for their
   logic have been proposed.  The controller for a  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1213" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1213">nanobot</A> would
   be a nanocomputer.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1215><B>nanofortnight</B></A> /n./ <P> [Adelaide University] 1 fortnight
   @Math{* 10^(-9)}, or about 1.2 msec.  This unit was used
   largely by students doing undergraduate practicals.  See
    <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1143" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1143">microfortnight</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG47" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG47">attoparsec</A>, and  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1140" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1140">micro-</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1216><B>nanotechnology</B></A> /nan'-oh-tek-no`l*-jee/ /n./ <P> A hypothetical
   fabrication technology in which objects are designed and built with
   the individual specification and placement of each separate atom.
   The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments took place in
   1990, for example with the deposition of individual xenon atoms on
   a nickel substrate to spell the logo of a certain very large
   computer company.  Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the
   hacker subculture ever since the term was coined by K. Eric Drexler
   in his book "Engines of Creation" (Anchor/Doubleday, ISBN
   0-385-19973-2), where he predicted that nanotechnology could give
   rise to replicating assemblers, permitting an exponential growth of
   productivity and personal wealth.

<A NAME=TAG1217><B>nasal demons</B></A> /n./ <P> Recognized shorthand on the Usenet group
   <I><a href="news:comp.std.c">comp.std.c</a></I> for any unexpected behavior of a C compiler on
   encountering an undefined construct.  During a discussion on that
   group in early 1992, a regular remarked "When the compiler
   encounters [a given undefined construct] it is legal for it to make
   demons fly out of your nose" (the implication is that the compiler
   may choose any arbitrarily bizarre way to interpret the code
   without violating the ANSI C standard).  Someone else followed up
   with a reference to "nasal demons", which quickly became
   established.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1218><B>nastygram</B></A> /nas'tee-gram/ /n./ <P> 1. A protocol packet or item
   of email (the latter is also called a  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1027" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1027">letterbomb</A>) that takes
   advantage of misfeatures or security holes on the target system to
   do untoward things.  2. Disapproving mail, esp. from a
    <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1227" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1227">net.god</A>, pursuant to a violation of  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1234" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1234">netiquette</A> or a
   complaint about failure to correct some mail- or news-transmission
   problem.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1598" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1598">shitogram</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1097" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1097">mailbomb</A>.  3. A status
   report from an unhappy, and probably picky, customer.  "What'd
   Corporate say in today's nastygram?"  4. [deprecated] An error
   reply by mail from a  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG415" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG415">daemon</A>; in particular, a  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG184" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG184">bounce message</A>.  <P>

    <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG43" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG43">ASCII</A>).  Oh, you want an etymology?  Notionally, from "I
   regret that I have only one asterisk for my country!", a misquote
   of the famous remark uttered by Nathan Hale just before he was
   hanged.  Hale was a (failed) spy for the rebels in the American War
   of Independence.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1220><B>nature</B></A> /n./ <P> See  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG863" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG863">has the X nature</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1221><B>neat hack</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A clever technique.  2. A brilliant
   practical joke, where neatness is correlated with cleverness,
   harmlessness, and surprise value.  Example: the Caltech Rose Bowl
   card display switch (see " <A HREF="JARGO~44.HTM#SEC51" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_44.html#SEC51">The Meaning of `Hack'</A>",
   Appendix A).  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG824" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG824">hack</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1222><B>neats vs. scruffies</B></A> /n./ <P> The label used to refer to one of
   the continuing  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG897">holy wars</A> in AI research.  This conflict
   tangles together two separate issues.  One is the relationship
   between human reasoning and AI; `neats' tend to try to build
   systems that `reason' in some way identifiably similar to the
   way humans report themselves as doing, while `scruffies' profess
   not to care whether an algorithm resembles human reasoning in the
   least as long as it works.  More importantly, neats tend to believe
   that logic is king, while scruffies favor looser, more ad-hoc
   methods driven by empirical knowledge.  To a neat, scruffy methods
   appear promiscuous, successful only by accident, and not productive
   of insights about how intelligence actually works; to a scruffy,
   neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and irrelevant to
   the hard-to-capture `common sense' of living intelligences.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1223><B>neep-neep</B></A> /neep neep/ /n./ <P> [onomatopoeic, widely spread
   through SF fandom but reported to have originated at Caltech in the
   1970s] One who is fascinated by computers.  Less specific than
    <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG833" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG833">hacker</A>, as it need not imply more skill than is required to
   boot games on a PC.  The derived noun `neeping' applies
   specifically to the long conversations about computers that tend to
   develop in the corners at most SF-convention parties (the term
   `neepery' is also in wide use).  Fandom has a related proverb to
   the effect that "Hacking is a conversational black hole!".
   <P>
<A NAME=TAG1224><B>neophilia</B></A> /nee`oh-fil'-ee-*/ /n./ <P> The trait of being
   excited and pleased by novelty.  Common among most hackers, SF
   fans, and members of several other connected leading-edge
   subcultures, including the pro-technology `Whole Earth' wing of
   the ecology movement, space activists, many members of Mensa, and
   the Discordian/neo-pagan underground.  All these groups overlap
   heavily and (where evidence is available) seem to share
   characteristic hacker tropisms for science fiction,  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1200" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1200">music</A>, and
    <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1305" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1305">oriental food</A>.  The opposite tendency is `neophobia'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1225><B>nerd</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. [mainstream slang] Pejorative applied to anyone
   with an above-average IQ and few gifts at small talk and ordinary
   social rituals.  2. [jargon] Term of praise applied (in conscious
   ironic reference to sense 1) to someone who knows what's really
   important and interesting and doesn't care to be distracted by
   trivial chatter and silly status games.  Compare the two senses of
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG323" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG323">computer geek</A>.  <P>
   The word itself appears to derive from the lines "And then, just to
   show them, I'll sail to Ka-Troo / And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep
   and a Proo, / A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker, too!" in the
   Dr. Seuss book "If I Ran the Zoo" (1950). (The spellings
   `nurd' and `gnurd' also used to be current at MIT.) How it
   developed its mainstream meaning is unclear, but sense 1 seems to
   have entered mass culture in the early 1970s (there are reports
   that in the mid-1960s it meant roughly "annoying misfit"
   without the connotation of intelligence). <P>
   An IEEE Spectrum article (4/95, page 16) once derived `nerd' in its
   variant form `knurd' from the word `drunk' backwards, but this
   bears all the earmarks of a bogus folk etymology. <P>
   Hackers developed sense 2 in self-defense perhaps ten years later,
   and some actually wear "Nerd Pride" buttons, only half as a
   joke.  At MIT one can find not only buttons but (what else?) pocket
   protectors bearing the slogan and the MIT seal.  <P>

   Display of a network address is essential if one wants to be to be
   taken seriously by hackers; in particular, persons or organizations

   This is mostly functional, but is also a signal that one identifies
   with hackerdom (like lodge pins among Masons or tie-dyed T-shirts
   among Grateful Dead fans).  Net addresses are often used in email

   Network meltdown is often a result of network designs that are
   optimized for a steady state of moderate load and don't cope well
   with the very jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real world.  One
   amusing instance of this is triggered by the the popular and very
   bloody shoot-'em-up game <I>Doom</I> on the PC.  When used in
   multiplayer mode over a network, the game uses broadcast packets to
   inform other machines when bullets are fired.  This causes problems
   with weapons like the chain gun which fire rapidly -- it can blast
   the network into a meltdown state just as easily as it shreds
   opposing monsters.  <P>

   in-house networks and commercial time-sharing services (such as
   CompuServe, GEnie and AOL) that gateway to them.  A site is
   generally considered `on the network' if it can be reached

   mass-culture discovery of the Internet in 1994 and subsequent

   increasingly synonymous with the Internet itself (as it was before
   the second wave of wide-area computer networking began around 1980).

<A NAME=TAG1255><B>Nightmare File System</B></A> /n./ <P> Pejorative hackerism for Sun's
   Network File System (NFS).  In any nontrivial network of Suns
   where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when one Sun goes down,
   the others often freeze up.  Some machine tries to access the down
   one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.  This causes
   it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually happening is
   that it is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to
   a higher  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1680" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1680">spl</A> level).  Then another machine tries to reach
   either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself
   becomes pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is
   now trying both to access the down one and to respond to the
   pseudo-down one, so it is even harder to reach.  This situation
   snowballs very quickly, and soon the entire network of machines is

   microprocessor race, the specs on these chips made them look like
   serious competition for the rising Intel 80x86 and Motorola 680x0
   series.  Unfortunately, the actual parts were notoriously flaky and
   never implemented the full instruction set promised in their
   literature, apparently because the company couldn't get any of the
   mask steppings to work as designed.  They eventually sank without

<A NAME=TAG1265><B>nonlinear</B></A> /adj./ <P> [scientific computation] 1. Behaving in an
   erratic and unpredictable fashion; unstable.  When used to describe
   the behavior of a machine or program, it suggests that said machine
   or program is being forced to run far outside of design
   specifications.  This behavior may be induced by unreasonable
   inputs, or may be triggered when a more mundane bug sends the
   computation far off from its expected course.  2. When describing

<A NAME=TAG1269><B>NP-</B></A> /N-P/ /pref./ <P> Extremely.  Used to modify adjectives
   describing a level or quality of difficulty; the connotation is
   often `more so than it should be' This is generalized from the
   computer-science terms `NP-hard' and `NP-complete';
   NP-complete problems all seem to be very hard, but so far no one
   has found a good <I>a priori</I> reason that they should be.  NP is
   the set of Nondeterministic-Polynomial algorithms, those that can
   be completed by a nondeterministic Turing machine in an amount of
   time that is a polynomial function of the size of the input; a

   There is a mainstream variant of this myth involving a `Trunk Line
   Monitor', which supposedly used speech recognition to extract words
   from telephone trunks.  This one was making the rounds in the
   late 1970s, spread by people who had no idea of then-current
   technology or the storage, signal-processing, or speech recognition
   needs of such a project.  On the basis of mass-storage costs alone
   it would have been cheaper to hire 50 high-school students and just
   let them listen in.  Speech-recognition technology can't do this
   job even now (1996), and almost certainly won't in this millennium,
   either.  The peak of silliness came with a letter to an alternative
   paper in New Haven, Connecticut, laying out the factoids of this
   Big Brotherly affair.  The letter writer then revealed his actual
   agenda by offering -- at an amazing low price, just this once, we
   take VISA and MasterCard -- a scrambler guaranteed to daunt the

   they all arrived nude, so we had to spend a an extra weekend with
   the installation tapes."  This usage is a recent innovation
   reflecting the fact that most PC clones are now delivered with DOS

   particular to PC support groups.  <P>
