Ethnic.  Spicy.  Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan,
Hunan, and Mandarin (hackers consider Cantonese vaguely <I>d'eclass'e</I>).
Hackers prefer the exotic; for example, the Japanese-food fans among
them will eat with gusto such delicacies as fugu (poisonous
pufferfish) and whale.  Thai food has experienced flurries of
popularity.  Where available, high-quality Jewish delicatessen food is
much esteemed.  A visible minority of Southwestern and Pacific Coast
hackers prefers Mexican.  <P>
For those all-night hacks, pizza and microwaved burritos are big.
Interestingly, though the mainstream culture has tended to think of
hackers as incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have at least mildly
health-foodist attitudes and are fairly discriminating about what they
eat.  This may be generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the
stereotype was more on the mark before the early 1980s.  <P>
