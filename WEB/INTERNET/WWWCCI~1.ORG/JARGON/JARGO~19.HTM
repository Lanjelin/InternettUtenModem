<A NAME=TAG961><B>J. Random</B></A> /J rand'm/ /n./ <P> [generalized from  <A HREF="JARGO~25.HTM#TAG962" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_25.html#TAG962">J. Random Hacker</A>] Arbitrary; ordinary; any one; any old.  `J. Random' is
   often prefixed to a noun to make a name out of it.  It means
   roughly `some particular' or `any specific one'.  "Would you
   let J. Random Loser marry your daughter?"  The most common uses
   are `J. Random Hacker', `J. Random Loser', and `J. Random Nerd'
   ("Should J. Random Loser be allowed to  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG816" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG816">gun</A> down other
   people?"), but it can be used simply as an elaborate version of
    <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1457" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1457">random</A> in any sense.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG962><B>J. Random Hacker</B></A> /J rand'm hak'r/ /n./ <P> [MIT] A mythical
   figure like the Unknown Soldier; the archetypal hacker nerd.  See
    <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1457" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1457">random</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1728" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1728">Suzie COBOL</A>.  This may originally have been
   inspired by `J. Fred Muggs', a show-biz chimpanzee whose name was a
   household word back in the early days of  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1806" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1806">TMRC</A>, and was
   probably influenced by `J. Presper Eckert' (one of the co-inventors
   of the electronic computer).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG963><B>jack in</B></A> /v./ <P> To log on to a machine or connect to a network
   or  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG88" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG88">BBS</A>, esp. for purposes of entering a  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1914" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1914">virtual reality</A>
   simulation such as a  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1184" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1184">MUD</A> or  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG952" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG952">IRC</A> (leaving is "jacking
   out").  This term derives from  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG406" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG406">cyberpunk</A> SF, in which it was
   used for the act of plugging an electrode set into neural sockets
   in order to interface the brain directly to a virtual reality.  It
   is primarily used by MUD and IRC fans and younger hackers on BBS
   systems.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG964><B>jaggies</B></A> /jag'eez/ /n./ <P> The `stairstep' effect observable
   when an edge (esp. a linear edge of very shallow or steep slope)
   is rendered on a pixel device (as opposed to a vector display).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG965><B>JCL</B></A> /J-C-L/ /n./ <P> 1. IBM's supremely  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1529" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1529">rude</A> Job Control
   Language.  JCL is the script language used to control the execution
   of programs in IBM's batch systems.  JCL has a very  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG592" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG592">fascist</A>
   syntax, and some versions will, for example,  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG75" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG75">barf</A> if two
   spaces appear where it expects one.  Most programmers confronted
   with JCL simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the
   file names.  Someone who actually understands and generates unique
   JCL is regarded with the mixed respect one gives to someone who
   memorizes the phone book.  It is reported that hackers at IBM
   itself sometimes sing "Who's the breeder of the crud that mangles
   you and me?  I-B-M, J-C-L, M-o-u-s-e" to the tune of the
   "Mickey Mouse Club" theme to express their opinion of the
   beast.  2. A comparative for any very  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1529" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1529">rude</A> software that a
   hacker is expected to use.  "That's as bad as JCL."  As with
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG303" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG303">COBOL</A>, JCL is often used as an archetype of ugliness even by
   those who haven't experienced it.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG919" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG919">IBM</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG596" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG596">fear and loathing</A>.  <P>
   A (poorly documented, naturally) shell simulating JCL syntax is
   available at the Retrocomputing Museum <I><a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS9.HTM#932" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/retro">http://www.ccil.org/retro</a></I>. <P>
<A NAME=TAG966><B>JEDR</B></A> // /n./ <P> Synonymous with  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG960" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG960">IYFEG</A>.  At one time,
   people in the Usenet newsgroup <I><a href="news:rec.humor.funny">rec.humor.funny</a></I> tended to use
   `JEDR' instead of  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG960" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG960">IYFEG</A> or `&#60;ethnic&#62;'; this stemmed from a
   public attempt to suppress the group once made by a loser with
   initials JEDR after he was offended by an ethnic joke posted there.
   (The practice was  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1499" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1499">retcon</A>ned by the expanding these initials as
   `Joke Ethnic/Denomination/Race'.)  After much sound and fury JEDR
   faded away; this term appears to be doing likewise.  JEDR's only
   permanent effect on the net.culture was to discredit
   `sensitivity' arguments for censorship so thoroughly that more
   recent attempts to raise them have met with immediate and
   near-universal rejection.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG967><B>JFCL</B></A> /jif'kl/, /jaf'kl/, /j*-fi'kl/ vt., obs. <P> (alt.
   `jfcl') To cancel or annul something.  "Why don't you jfcl that
   out?"  The fastest do-nothing instruction on older models of the
   PDP-10 happened to be JFCL, which stands for "Jump if Flag set and
   then CLear the flag"; this does something useful, but is a very
   fast no-operation if no flag is specified.  Geoff Goodfellow, one
   of the Steele-1983 co-authors, had JFCL on the license plate of his
   BMW for years.  Usage: rare except among old-time PDP-10 hackers.<P>
<A NAME=TAG968><B>jiffy</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. The duration of one tick of the system clock on
   your computer (see  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1793" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1793">tick</A>).  Often one AC cycle time (1/60 second
   in the U.S. and Canada, 1/50 most other places), but more recently
   1/100 sec has become common.  "The swapper runs every 6 jiffies"
   means that the virtual memory management routine is executed once
   for every 6 ticks of the clock, or about ten times a second.
   2. Confusingly, the term is sometimes also used for a 1-millisecond
    <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1933" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1933">wall time</A> interval.  Even more confusingly, physicists
   semi-jokingly use `jiffy' to mean the time required for light to
   travel one foot in a vacuum, which turns out to be close to one
   <EM>nanosecond</EM>.  3. Indeterminate time from a few seconds to
   forever.  "I'll do it in a jiffy" means certainly not now and
   possibly never.  This is a bit contrary to the more widespread use
   of the word.  Oppose  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1210" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1210">nano</A>. See also  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1479" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1479">Real Soon Now</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG969><B>job security</B></A> /n./ <P> When some piece of code is written in a
   particularly  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1284" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1284">obscure</A> fashion, and no good reason (such as time
   or space optimization) can be discovered, it is often said that the
   programmer was attempting to increase his job security (i.e., by
   making himself indispensable for maintenance).  This sour joke
   seldom has to be said in full; if two hackers are looking over some
   code together and one points at a section and says "job
   security", the other one may just nod.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG970><B>jock</B></A> /n./ <P> 1. A programmer who is characterized by large and
   somewhat brute-force programs.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG214" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG214">brute force</A>.  2. When
   modified by another noun, describes a specialist in some particular
   computing area.  The compounds `compiler jock' and `systems
   jock' seem to be the best-established examples.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG971><B>joe code</B></A> /joh' kohd`/ /n./ <P> 1. Code that is overly
    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1766" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1766">tense</A> and unmaintainable.  " <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1353" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1353">Perl</A> may be a handy program,
   but if you look at the source, it's complete joe code."  2. Badly
   written, possibly buggy code.  <P>
   Correspondents wishing to remain anonymous have fingered a
   particular Joe at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and observed
   that usage has drifted slightly; the original sobriquet `Joe code'
   was intended in sense 1.  <P>
   1994 update: This term has now generalized to `&#60;name&#62; code', used
   to designate code with distinct characteristics traceable to its
   author. "This section doesn't check for a NULL return from malloc()!
   Oh.  No wonder! It's Ed code!". Used most often with a programmer
   who has left the shop and thus is a convenient scapegoat for
   anything that is wrong with the project. <P>
<A NAME=TAG972><B>jolix</B></A> /joh'liks/ /n.,adj./ <P> 386BSD, the freeware port of
   the BSD Net/2 release to the Intel i386 architecture by Bill Jolitz
   and friends.  Used to differentiate from BSDI's port based on the
   same source tape, which used to be called BSD/386 and is now
   BSD/OS.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG216" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG216">BSD</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG973><B>JR[LN]</B></A> /J-R-L/, /J-R-N/ /n./ <P> The names JRL and JRN were
   sometimes used as example names when discussing a kind of user ID
   used under  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1819" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1819">TOPS-10</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1926" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1926">WAITS</A>; they were understood to be
   the initials of (fictitious) programmers named `J. Random Loser'
   and `J. Random Nerd' (see  <A HREF="JARGO~25.HTM#TAG961" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_25.html#TAG961">J. Random</A>).  For example, if one
   said "To log in, type log one comma jay are en" (that is, "log
   1,JRN"), the listener would have understood that he should use his
   own computer ID in place of `JRN'.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG974><B>JRST</B></A> /jerst/ /v. obs./ <P> [based on the PDP-10 jump
   instruction] To suddenly change subjects, with no intention of
   returning to the previous topic.  Usage: rather rare except among
   PDP-10 diehards, and considered silly.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG34" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG34">AOS</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG975><B>juggling eggs</B></A> /vi./ <P> Keeping a lot of  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1694" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1694">state</A> in your head
   while modifying a program.  "Don't bother me now, I'm juggling
   eggs", means that an interrupt is likely to result in the
   program's being scrambled.  In the classic first-contact SF novel
   "The Mote in God's Eye", by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle,
   an alien describes a very difficult task by saying "We juggle
   priceless eggs in variable gravity."  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG826" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG826">hack mode</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG976><B>jump off into never-never land</B></A> /v./ <P> [from J. M. Barrie's
   "Peter Pan"] Same as  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG197" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG197">branch to Fishkill</A>, but more common
   in technical cultures associated with non-IBM computers that use
   the term `jump' rather than `branch'.  Compare
    <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG915" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG915">hyperspace</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG977><B>jupiter</B></A> /vt./ <P> [IRC] To kill an  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG952" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG952">IRC</A>  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1510" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1510">robot</A> or user
   and then take its place by adopting its  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1252" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1252">nick</A> so that it cannot
   reconnect.  Named after a particular IRC user who did this to
   NickServ, the robot in charge of preventing people from
   inadvertently using a nick claimed by another user.  <P>
