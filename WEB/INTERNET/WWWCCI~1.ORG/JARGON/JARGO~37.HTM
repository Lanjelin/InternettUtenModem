<A NAME=TAG2040><B>zap</B></A> <P> 1. /n./ Spiciness.  2. /vt./ To make food spicy.  3. /vt./ To
   make someone `suffer' by making his food spicy.  (Most hackers
   love spicy food.  Hot-and-sour soup is considered wimpy unless it
   makes you wipe your nose for the rest of the meal.)  See
    <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2041" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2041">zapped</A>.  4. /vt./ To modify, usually to correct; esp. used
   when the action is performed with a debugger or binary patching
   tool.  Also implies surgical precision.  "Zap the debug level to 6
   and run it again."  In the IBM mainframe world, binary patches are
   applied to programs or to the OS with a program called
   `superzap', whose file name is `IMASPZAP' (possibly contrived
   from I M A SuPerZAP).  5. /vt./ To erase or reset.  6. To  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG707" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG707">fry</A> a
   chip with static electricity.  "Uh oh -- I think that lightning
   strike may have zapped the disk controller." <P>
<A NAME=TAG2041><B>zapped</B></A> /adj./ <P> Spicy.  This term is used to distinguish
   between food that is hot (in temperature) and food that is
   <EM>spicy</EM>-hot.  For example, the Chinese appetizer Bon Bon
   Chicken is a kind of chicken salad that is cold but zapped; by
   contrast,  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1891" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1891">vanilla</A> wonton soup is hot but not zapped.  See also
    <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1305" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1305">oriental food</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1013" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1013">laser chicken</A>.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2040" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2040">zap</A>, senses 1 and
   2.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2042><B>zen</B></A> /vt./ <P> To figure out something by meditation or by a
   sudden flash of enlightenment.  Originally applied to bugs, but
   occasionally applied to problems of life in general.  "How'd you
   figure out the buffer allocation problem?"  "Oh, I zenned it."
   Contrast  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG807" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG807">grok</A>, which connotes a time-extended version of
   zenning a system.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG826" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG826">hack mode</A>.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG819" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG819">guru</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2043><B>zero</B></A> /vt./ <P> 1. To set to 0.  Usually said of small pieces of
   data, such as bits or words (esp. in the construction `zero
   out').  2. To erase; to discard all data from.  Said of disks and
   directories, where `zeroing' need not involve actually writing
   zeroes throughout the area being zeroed.  One may speak of
   something being `logically zeroed' rather than being
   `physically zeroed'.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1563" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1563">scribble</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2044><B>zero-content</B></A> /adj./ <P> Syn.  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG334" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG334">content-free</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2045><B>Zero-One-Infinity Rule</B></A> /prov./ <P> "Allow none of  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG670" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG670">foo</A>,
   one of  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG670" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG670">foo</A>, or any number of  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG670" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG670">foo</A>."  A rule of thumb for
   software design, which instructs one to not place  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1457" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1457">random</A>
   limits on the number of instances of a given entity (such as:
   windows in a window system, letters in an OS's filenames, etc.).
   Specifically, one should either disallow the entity entirely, allow
   exactly one instance (an "exception"), or allow as many as the
   user wants -- address space and memory permitting. <P>
   The logic behind this rule is that there are often situations where
   it makes clear sense to allow one of something instead of none.
   However, if one decides to go further and allow N (for N &#62; 1), then
   why not N+1?  And if N+1, then why not N+2, and so on?  Once above
   1, there's no excuse not to allow any N; hence,  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG940" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG940">infinity</A>. <P>
   Many hackers recall in this connection Isaac Asimov's SF novel
   "The Gods Themselves" in which a character announces that the
   number 2 is impossible -- if you're going to believe in more than
   one universe, you might as well believe in an infinite number of
   them. <P>
<A NAME=TAG2046><B>zeroth</B></A> /zee'rohth/ /adj./ <P> First.  Among software designers,
   comes from C's and LISP's 0-based indexing of arrays.  Hardware
   people also tend to start counting at 0 instead of 1; this is
   natural since, e.g., the 256 states of 8 bits correspond to the
   binary numbers 0, 1, ..., 255 and the digital devices known as
   `counters' count in this way.
<P>
   Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first
   chapter of a publication `Chapter 0', especially if it is of an
   introductory nature (one of the classic instances was in the First
   Edition of  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG979" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG979">K&#38;R</A>).  In recent years this trait has also been
   observed among many pure mathematicians (who have an independent
   tradition of numbering from 0).  Zero-based numbering tends to
   reduce  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG608" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG608">fencepost error</A>s, though it cannot eliminate them
   entirely.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2047><B>zigamorph</B></A> /zig'*-morf/ /n./ <P> 1. Hex FF (11111111) when used
   as a delimiter or  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG607" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG607">fence</A> character.  Usage: primarily at IBM
   shops.  2. [proposed] /n./ The Unicode non-character U+FFFF
   (1111111111111111), a character code which is not assigned to any
   character, and so is usable as end-of-string.  (Unicode (a subset
   of ISO 10646) is a 16-bit character code intended to cover all of
   the world's writing systems, including Roman, Greek, Cyrillic,
   Chinese, hiragana, katakana, Devanagari, Ethiopic, Thai, Laotian
   and many other languages (support for  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG547" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG547">elvish</A> is planned for a
   future release).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2048><B>zip</B></A> /vt./ <P> [primarily MS-DOS] To create a compressed archive
   from a group of files using PKWare's PKZIP or a compatible
   archiver.  Its use is spreading now that portable implementations
   of the algorithm have been written.  Commonly used as follows:
   "I'll zip it up and send it to you."  See  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1753" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1753">tar and feather</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2049><B>zipperhead</B></A> /n./ <P> [IBM] A person with a closed mind.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2050><B>zombie</B></A> /n./ <P> [Unix] A process that has died but has not yet
   relinquished its process table slot (because the parent process
   hasn't executed a <CODE>wait(2)</CODE> for it yet).  These can be seen in
   <CODE>ps(1)</CODE> listings occasionally.  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1306" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1306">orphan</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2051><B>zorch</B></A> /zorch/ <P> 1. [TMRC] /v./ To attack with an inverse heat
   sink.  2. [TMRC] /v./ To travel, with @Math{v} approaching @Math{c}
   [that is, with velocity approaching lightspeed --ESR].  3. [MIT]
   /v./ To propel something very quickly.  "The new comm software is
   very fast; it really zorches files through the network."  4. [MIT]
   /n./  Influence.  Brownie points.  Good karma.  The intangible and
   fuzzy currency in which favors are measured.  "I'd rather not ask
   him for that just yet; I think I've used up my quota of zorch with
   him for the week."  5. [MIT] /n./ Energy, drive, or ability.  "I
   think I'll  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1437" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1437">punt</A> that change for now; I've been up for 30 hours
   and I've run out of zorch."  6. [MIT] /v./ To flunk an exam or
   course.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2052><B>Zork</B></A> /zork/ /n./ <P> The second of the great early experiments
   in computer fantasy gaming; see  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG11">ADVENT</A>.  Originally written
   on MIT-DM during 1977-1979, later distributed with BSD Unix (as a
   patched, sourceless RT-11 FORTRAN binary; see  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1501" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1501">retrocomputing</A>)
   and commercialized as `The Zork Trilogy' by  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG942" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG942">Infocom</A>.  The
   FORTRAN source was later rewritten for portability and released to
   Usenet under the name "Dungeon".  Both FORTRAN "Dungeon" and
   translated C versions are available at many FTP sites.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG2053><B>zorkmid</B></A> /zork'mid/ /n./ <P> The canonical unit of currency in
   hacker-written games.  This originated in  <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2052" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2052">Zork</A> but has spread
   to  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1233" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1233">nethack</A> and is referred to in several other games.  <P>
