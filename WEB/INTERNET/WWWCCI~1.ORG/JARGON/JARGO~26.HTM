<A NAME=TAG1332><B>parse</B></A> [from linguistic terminology] /vt./ <P> 1. To determine the

   aos the zotz."  "I can't parse that."  3. Of fish, to have to
   remove the bones yourself.  "I object to parsing fish", means "I

<A NAME=TAG1333><B>Pascal</B></A> /n./ <P> An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus
   Wirth on the CDC 6600 around 1967--68 as an instructional tool for
   elementary programming.  This language, designed primarily to keep
   students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus extremely
   restrictive from a general-purpose-programming point of view, was
   later promoted as a general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the
   ancestor of a large family of languages including Modula-2 and
    <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG8" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG8">Ada</A> (see also  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG177" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG177">bondage-and-discipline language</A>).  The
   hackish point of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a
   devastating (and, in its deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper
   by Brian Kernighan (of  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG979" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG979">K&#38;R</A> fame) entitled "Why Pascal is
   Not My Favorite Programming Language", which was turned down by the
   technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies.  It was
   eventually published in "Comparing and Assessing Programming
   Languages", edited by Alan Feuer and Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall,
   1984).  Part of his discussion is worth repeating here, because its
   criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself after ten years of
   improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other
   bondage-and-discipline languages.  At the end of a summary of the
   case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
9. There is no escape
<P>
This last point is perhaps the most important.  The language is
inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its
limitations.  There are no casts to disable the type-checking when
necessary.  There is no way to replace the defective run-time
environment with a sensible one, unless one controls the compiler
that defines the "standard procedures".  The language is
closed.  <P>
People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal
trap.  Because the language is impotent, it must be extended.  But
each group extends Pascal in its own direction, to make it look
like whatever language they really want.  Extensions for separate
compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string data types, internal
static variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit operators,
etc., all add to the utility of the language for one group but
destroy its portability to others.  <P>
I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond
its original target.  In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language,
suitable for teaching but not for real programming.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
   Pascal has since been almost entirely displaced (by  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG242" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG242">C</A>) from the
   niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems
   programming, but retains some popularity as a hobbyist language in
   the MS-DOS and Macintosh worlds.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1334><B>pastie</B></A> /pay'stee/ /n./ <P> An adhesive-backed label designed to
   be attached to a key on a keyboard to indicate some non-standard
   character which can be accessed through that key.  Pasties are
   likely to be used in APL environments, where almost every key is
   associated with a special character.  A pastie on the R key, for
   example, might remind the user that it is used to generate the
   rho character.  The term properly refers to
   nipple-concealing devices formerly worn by strippers in concession
   to indecent-exposure laws; compare  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1804" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1804">tits on a keyboard</A>.
<P>
<A NAME=TAG1335><B>patch</B></A> <P> 1. /n./ A temporary addition to a piece of code,
   usually as a  <A HREF="JARGO~31.HTM#TAG1447" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_32.html#TAG1447">quick-and-dirty</A> remedy to an existing bug or
   misfeature.  A patch may or may not work, and may or may not
   eventually be incorporated permanently into the program.
   Distinguished from a  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG468" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG468">diff</A> or  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1159" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1159">mod</A> by the fact that a patch
   is generated by more primitive means than the rest of the program;
   the classical examples are instructions modified by using the front
   panel switches, and changes made directly to the binary executable
   of a program originally written in an  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG891" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG891">HLL</A>.  Compare

   modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching program.  IBM
   operating systems often receive updates to the operating system in
   the form of absolute hexadecimal patches.  If you have modified
   your OS, you have to disassemble these back to the source.  The
   patches might later be corrected by other patches on top of them
   (patches were said to "grow scar tissue").  The result was often
   a convoluted  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1336" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1336">patch space</A> and headaches galore.  5. [Unix] the
   <CODE>patch(1)</CODE> program, written by Larry Wall, which automatically
   applies a patch (sense 3) to a set of source code.  <P>
   There is a classic story of a  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1796" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1796">tiger team</A> penetrating a secure
   military computer that illustrates the danger inherent in binary
   patches (or, indeed, any patches that you can't -- or don't ---
   inspect and examine before installing).  They couldn't find any
    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1830" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1830">trap door</A>s or any way to penetrate security of IBM's OS, so
   they made a site visit to an IBM office (remember, these were
   official military types who were purportedly on official business),
   swiped some IBM stationery, and created a fake patch.  The patch
   was actually the trapdoor they needed.  The patch was distributed
   at about the right time for an IBM patch, had official stationery
   and all accompanying documentation, and was dutifully installed.
   The installation manager very shortly thereafter learned something
   about proper procedures.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1336><B>patch space</B></A> /n./ <P> An unused block of bits left in a binary so
   that it can later be modified by insertion of machine-language
   instructions there (typically, the patch space is modified to
   contain new code, and the superseded code is patched to contain a
   jump or call to the patch space).  The widening use of HLLs has
   made this term rare; it is now primarily historical outside IBM
   shops.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1335" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1335">patch</A> (sense 4),  <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2040" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2040">zap</A> (sense 4),  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG901" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG901">hook</A>.

    <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG948" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG948">Internet address</A>; a node-by-node specification of a link
   between two machines.  2. [Unix] A filename, fully specified
   relative to the root directory (as opposed to relative to the
   current directory; the latter is sometimes called a `relative
   path').  This is also called a `pathname'.  3. [Unix and MS-DOS]
   The `search path', an environment variable specifying the
   directories in which the  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1594" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1594">shell</A> (COMMAND.COM, under MS-DOS)
   should look for commands.  Other, similar constructs abound under
   Unix (for example, the C preprocessor has a `search path' it
   uses in looking for <CODE>#include</CODE> files).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1338><B>pathological</B></A> /adj./ <P> 1. [scientific computation] Used of a
   data set that is grossly atypical of normal expected input, esp.
   one that exposes a weakness or bug in whatever algorithm one is
   using.  An algorithm that can be broken by pathological inputs may
   still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely to occur in
   practice.  2. When used of test input, implies that it was
   purposefully engineered as a worst case.  The implication in both
   senses is that the data is spectacularly ill-conditioned or that
   someone had to explicitly set out to break the algorithm in order
   to come up with such a crazy example.  3. Also said of an unlikely
   collection of circumstances.  "If the network is down and comes up
   halfway through the execution of that command by root, the system
   may just crash."  "Yes, but that's a pathological case."  Often
   used to dismiss the case from discussion, with the implication that
   the consequences are acceptable, since they will happen so
   infrequently (if at all) that it doesn't seem worth going to the
   extra trouble to handle that case (see sense 1).  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1345><B>PDP-10</B></A> /n./ <P> [Programmed Data Processor model 10] The machine
   that made timesharing real.  It looms large in hacker folklore
   because of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university
   computing facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab,
   Stanford, and CMU.  Some aspects of the instruction set (most
   notably the bit-field instructions) are still considered
   unsurpassed.  The 10 was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines
   (descendants of the PDP-11) when DEC recognized that the 10 and VAX
   product lines were competing with each other and decided to
   concentrate its software development effort on the more profitable
   VAX.  The machine was finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983,
   following the failure of the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a
   viable new model.  (Some attempts by other companies to market
   clones came to nothing; see  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG674" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG674">Foonly</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1112" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1112">Mars</A>.)  This event

<A NAME=TAG1360><B>phase</B></A> <P> 1. /n./ The offset of one's waking-sleeping schedule

   schedule.  It is not uncommon to change one's phase by as much as 6
   hours per day on a regular basis.  "What's your phase?"  "I've
   been getting in about 8 P.M. lately, but I'm going to  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG2008" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG2008">wrap around</A> to the day schedule by Friday."  A person who is roughly
   12 hours out of phase is sometimes said to be in `night mode'.
   (The term `day mode' is also (but less frequently) used, meaning
   you're working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to 6).)  The act of
   altering one's cycle is called `changing phase'; `phase
   shifting' has also been recently reported from Caltech.
   2. `change phase the hard way': To stay awake for a very long
   time in order to get into a different phase.  3. `change phase
   the easy way': To stay asleep, etc.  However, some claim that

   is <EM>shortening</EM> your day or night that is really hard (see

   cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two distinct
   causes: the strain of travel per se, and the strain of changing
   phase.  Hackers who suddenly find that they must change phase

   True story: Once upon a time there was a bug that really did depend
   on the phase of the moon.  There was a little subroutine that had
   traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
   approximation to the moon's true phase.  GLS incorporated this
   routine into a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would
   print a timestamp line almost 80 characters long.  Very
   occasionally the first line of the message would be too long and
   would overflow onto the next line, and when the file was later read
   back in the program would  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG75" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG75">barf</A>.  The length of the first line
   depended on both the precise date and time and the length of the
   phase specification when the timestamp was printed, and so the bug
   literally depended on the phase of the moon!
<P>
   The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included
   an example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug,
   but the typesetter `corrected' it.  This has since been
   described as the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.  <P>

   At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among

   intellectual game and a form of exploration was OK, but serious
   theft of services was taboo.  There was significant crossover
   between the hacker community and the hard-core phone phreaks who
   ran semi-underground networks of their own through such media as
   the legendary "TAP Newsletter".  This ethos began to break
   down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of the techniques put
   them in the hands of less responsible phreaks.  Around the same
   time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
   ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came
   to depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card
   numbers.  The crimes and punishments of gangs like the `414 group'
   turned that game very ugly.  A few old-time hackers still phreak
   casually just to keep their hand in, but most these days have

   People who are very happy tend to exude pings; furthermore, one can
   intentionally create pings and aim them at a needy party (e.g., a
   depressed person).  This sense of ping may appear as an
   exclamation; "Ping!" (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of
   happiness; I have been struck by a quantum of happiness).  The form
   "pingfulness", which is used to describe people who exude pings,
   also occurs.  (In the standard abuse of language, "pingfulness"
   can also be used as an exclamation, in which case it's a much
   stronger exclamation than just "ping"!).  Oppose  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG132" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG132">blargh</A>.

   The funniest use of `ping' to date was described in January 1991 by
   Steve Hayman on the Usenet group <I><a href="news:comp.sys.next">comp.sys.next</a></I>.  He was trying
   to isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to
   a NeXT machine, and got tired of having to run back to his console
   after each cabling tweak to see if the ping packets were getting
   through.  So he used the sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then
   wrote a script that repeatedly invoked <CODE>ping(8)</CODE>, listened for
   an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet.
   Result?  A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and
   over, "Ping ... ping ... ping ..." as long as the
   network was up.  He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through
   the building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector
   in no time.  <P>

   1. An electronic-mail or  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A> persona adopted by a human for
   amusement value or as a means of avoiding negative repercussions of
   one's net.behavior; a `nom de Usenet', often associated with
   forged postings designed to conceal message origins.  Perhaps the
   best-known and funniest hoax of this type is  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG103" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG103">B1FF</A>.  See also
    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1767" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1767">tentacle</A>.  2. Notionally, a  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG641" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG641">flamage</A>-generating AI program
   simulating a Usenet user.  Many flamers have been accused of
   actually being such entities, despite the fact that no AI program
   of the required sophistication yet exists.  However, in 1989 there
   was a famous series of forged postings that used a
   phrase-frequency-based travesty generator to simulate the styles of
   several well-known flamers; it was based on large samples of their
   back postings (compare  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG483" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG483">Dissociated Press</A>).  A significant
   number of people were fooled by the forgeries, and the debate over
   their authenticity was settled only when the perpetrator came
   forward to publicly admit the hoax.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1430><B>pseudoprime</B></A> /n./ <P> A backgammon prime (six consecutive occupied
   points) with one point missing.  This term is an esoteric pun
   derived from a mathematical method that, rather than determining
   precisely whether a number is prime (has no divisors), uses a
   statistical technique to decide whether the number is `probably'
   prime.  A number that passes this test was, before about 1985,
   called a `pseudoprime' (the terminology used by number theorists
   has since changed slightly; pre-1985 pseudoprimes are now
   `probable primes' and `pseudoprime' has a more restricted meaning
   in modular arithmetic).  The hacker backgammon usage stemmed from
   the idea that a pseudoprime is almost as good as a prime: it does
   the job of a prime until proven otherwise, and that probably won't
   happen.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1431><B>pseudosuit</B></A> /soo'doh-s[y]oot`/ /n./ <P> A  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1716" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1716">suit</A> wannabee; a
   hacker who has decided that he wants to be in management or
   administration and begins wearing ties, sport coats, and (shudder!)
   suits voluntarily.  It's his funeral.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1057" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1057">lobotomy</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1433><B>psyton</B></A> /si:'ton/ /n./ <P> [TMRC] The elementary particle 
   carrying the sinister force.  The probability of a process losing
   is proportional to the number of psytons falling on it.  Psytons
   are generated by observers, which is why demos are more likely to
   fail when lots of people are watching.  [This term appears to have

<A NAME=TAG1436><B>punched card</B></A> n.obs. <P> [techspeak] (alt. `punch card') The
   signature medium of computing's  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1700" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1700">Stone Age</A>, now obsolescent
   outside of some IBM shops.  The punched card actually predated
   computers considerably, originating in 1801 as a control device for
   mechanical looms.  The version patented by Hollerith and used with
   mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890 U.S. Census was a piece
   of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm.  There is a widespread myth
   that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used for that
   era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have falsified
   this.  <P>
   IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married
   the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as
   patterns of small rectangular holes; one character per column,
   80 columns per card.  Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and
   hole shapes were tried at various times.
<P>
   The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the
   IBM punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards
   distributed with many varieties of computers even today.  See

<A NAME=TAG1437><B>punt</B></A> /v./ <P> [from the punch line of an old joke referring to
   American football: "Drop back 15 yards and punt!"] 1. To give up,
   typically without any intention of retrying.  "Let's punt the
   movie tonight."  "I was going to hack all night to get this
   feature in, but I decided to punt" may mean that you've decided
   not to stay up all night, and may also mean you're not ever even
   going to put in the feature.  2. More specifically, to give up on
   figuring out what the  <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1507" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1507">Right Thing</A> is and resort to an
   inefficient hack.  3. A design decision to defer solving a problem,
   typically because one cannot define what is desirable sufficiently
   well to frame an algorithmic solution.  "No way to know what the
   right form to dump the graph in is -- we'll punt that for now."
   4. To hand a tricky implementation problem off to some other
   section of the design.  "It's too hard to get the compiler to do
   that; let's punt to the runtime system." <P>

<A NAME=TAG1439><B>purple wire</B></A> /n./ <P> [IBM] Wire installed by Field Engineers to work
   around problems discovered during testing or debugging.  These are
   called `purple wires' even when (as is frequently the case) their
   actual physical color is yellow....  Compare  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG156" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG156">blue wire</A>,

<A NAME=TAG1440><B>push</B></A> <P> [from the operation that puts the current information
   on a stack, and the fact that procedure return addresses are saved
   on a stack] (Also PUSH /push/ or PUSHJ /push'J/, the latter
   based on the PDP-10 procedure call instruction.) 1. To put
   something onto a  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1690" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1690">stack</A> or  <A HREF="JARGO~34.HTM#TAG1344" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_31.html#TAG1344">pdl</A>.  If one says that
   something has been pushed onto one's stack, it means that the
   Damoclean list of things hanging over ones's head has grown longer
   and heavier yet.  This may also imply that one will deal with it
   <EM>before</EM> other pending items; otherwise one might say that the
   thing was `added to my queue'.  2. /vi./ To enter upon a
   digression, to save the current discussion for later.  Antonym of
