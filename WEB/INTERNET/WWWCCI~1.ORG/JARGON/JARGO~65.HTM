<H2><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="JARGON~1.HTM#SEC74" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_toc.html#SEC74">Weaknesses of the Hacker Personality</A></H2>

Hackers have relatively little ability to identify emotionally with
other people.  This may be because hackers generally aren't much like
`other people'.  Unsurprisingly, hackers also tend towards
self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and impatience with people
and tasks perceived to be wasting their time.  <P>
As cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the
world, they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational,
`cool', and imaginative as they consider themselves.  This bias often
contributes to weakness in communication skills.  Hackers tend to be
especially poor at confrontation and negotiation.  <P>
Because of their passionate embrace of (what they consider to be) the
 <A HREF="JARGO~33.HTM#TAG1507" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_33.html#TAG1507">Right Thing</A>, hackers can be unfortunately intolerant and bigoted
on technical issues, in marked contrast to their general spirit of
camaraderie and tolerance of alternative viewpoints otherwise.
Old-time  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG958" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG958">ITS</A> partisans look down on the ever-growing hordes of
 <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A> hackers; Unix aficionados despise  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1918" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1918">VMS</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1182" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1182">MS-DOS</A>;
and hackers who are used to conventional command-line user interfaces
loudly loathe mouse-and-menu based systems such as the Macintosh.
Hackers who don't indulge in  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A> consider it a huge waste of
time and  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG68" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG68">bandwidth</A>; fans of old adventure games such as
 <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG11" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG11">ADVENT</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~41.HTM#TAG2052" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_41.html#TAG2052">Zork</A> consider  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1184" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1184">MUD</A>s to be glorified chat
systems devoid of atmosphere or interesting puzzles; hackers who are
willing to devote endless hours to Usenet or MUDs consider  <A HREF="JARGO~24.HTM#TAG952" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_24.html#TAG952">IRC</A> to
be a <EM>real</EM> waste of time; IRCies think MUDs might be okay if
there weren't all those silly puzzles in the way.  And, of course,
there are the perennial  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG897" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG897">holy wars</A> --  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG548" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG548">EMACS</A> vs.  <A HREF="JARGO~36.HTM#TAG1909" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_37.html#TAG1909">vi</A>,
 <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG110" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG110">big-endian</A> vs.   <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1051" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1051">little-endian</A>, RISC vs. CISC, etc., etc.,
etc.  As in society at large, the intensity and duration of these
debates is usually inversely proportional to the number of objective,
factual arguments available to buttress any position.  <P>
As a result of all the above traits, many hackers have difficulty
maintaining stable relationships.  At worst, they can produce the
classic  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG323" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG323">computer geek</A>: withdrawn, relationally incompetent,
sexually frustrated, and desperately unhappy when not submerged in
his or her craft.  Fortunately, this extreme is far less common than
mainstream folklore paints it -- but almost all hackers will
recognize something of themselves in the unflattering paragraphs
above.  <P>
Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy about dealing
with the physical world.  Bills don't get paid on time, clutter piles
up to incredible heights in homes and offices, and minor maintenance
tasks get deferred indefinitely.  <P>
1994-95's fad behavioral disease was a syndrome called Attention Deficit
Disorder, supposedly characterized by (among other things) a combination of
short attention span with an ability to `hyperfocus' imaginatively on
interesting tasks.  There are grounds for questioning whether ADD actually
exists, and if it does whether it is really a `disease' rather than an extreme
of a normal genetic variation like having freckles or being able to taste DPT;
but it is certainly true that many hacker traits coincide with major
indicators for ADD, and probably true that ADD boosters would find a far higher
rate of clinical ADD among hackers than the supposedly mainstream-normal 10%.
<P>
The sort of person who routinely uses phrases like `incompletely socialized'
usually thinks hackers are.  Hackers regard such people with contempt when they
notice them at all.  <P>
