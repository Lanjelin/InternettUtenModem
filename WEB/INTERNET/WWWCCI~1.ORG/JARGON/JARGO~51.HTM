Some hobbies are widely shared and recognized as going with the
culture: science fiction, music, medievalism (in the active form
practiced by the Society for Creative Anachronism and similar
organizations), chess, go, backgammon, wargames, and intellectual
games of all kinds.  (Role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons
used to be extremely popular among hackers but they lost a bit of
their luster as they moved into the mainstream and became heavily
commercialized.  More recently, "Magic: The Gathering" has been
widely popular among hackers.)  Logic puzzles.  Ham radio.  Other
interests that seem to correlate less strongly but positively with
hackerdom include linguistics and theater teching.  <P>
