<TITLE>About the Jargon File</TITLE>
<H1>About the Jargon File</H1>

Here comes everything you always wanted to know about access to the
Jargon File and its book version, <CITE>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</CITE>.  And, at the bottom, a small peroration about why you
want the book to sell many, many copies...

<H1>Access to the File</H1>

World Wide Web: The Jargon File is available for World Wide Web access
at <a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#22" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon">http://www.ccil.org/jargon</a>.
This site has won awards; see the <A HREF="AWARDS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/awards.html">trophy page.</A>
<P>
FTP: The File can also be downloaded from www.ccil.org,
but as the machine has a relatively slow Internet link, we would
prefer that you fetch it from 
<a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#23" tppabs="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/jarg333.txt.gz">the GNU archive site</a>
at prep.ai.mit.edu; the file is pub/gnu/jarg333.txt.gz.  An 
<a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#24" tppabs="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/jarg333.info.gz">info version</a>
(same name with `.info.gz' rather than `.txt.gz' suffix) is also
available.
<P>
Electronic mail: Unfortunately, the Jargon File is far too big to email.
<P>
Note: The Info version is being phased out and may not be
offered past 3.3.0.  The reason for this is that I expect to be switching
to a different markup system (either
<a href="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#25" tppabs="ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/mdw">Linuxdoc-SGML</a>
or straight HTML) soon.

<H1>Why There Are No diff Files</H1>

Many people have asked why I don't release diff files for new versions, so
people can avoid having to FTP or uucp-fetch the whole thing each time.  It's
because diffs tend to lose the actual semantic changes in a lot of noise
resulting from very low-level tweaks (typo fixes, re-justifications, etc.).
This bulks the diffs up to the point where I don't think they're enough smaller
than the File itself to justify the hassle costs of issuing or using them.

<H1>The Book</H1>

In fall 1991, the 2.9.6 version of the File was published as
"The New Hacker's Dictionary".  Version 3.0.0, with over 250 new
entries and numerous changes, was published in August 1993 as TNHD's
second edition (ISBN 0-262-68079-3).  

There will be a third edition in Fall 1996.

If you are viewing this through a graphics-capable browser, here's the
Second Edition cover art. <IMG SRC="COVER.GIF" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/cover.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE
ALT="But, apparently you aren't."> <P>

Here's a <A HNAME="sales">sales breakdown</A> for the First and Second
editions.  The First Edition sold 23,409 paperbacks and 871 hardcover
copies; the Second Edition, up to 25 January 1996, had sold 14,367
paperback and 741 hardcover copies. <P>

<H1>Why You Should Buy The Book</H1>

The ftpable version is flat ASCII.  The original is marked up in
Texinfo; an info version is also available.  The Texinfo source
involves sufficient custom hackery for things like schwa and Palatino
fonts that it wouldn't do anybody but the author much good even if
publishing it weren't in violation of the book contract.  There is no
nroff, Scribe or Postscript version.
<P>
Besides nice typography, the book gives you prefaces by Guy Steele and
Eric Raymond, a cover by Duane Bibby (he of the TeX lion and the Metafont
kitty), and the infamous Crunchly cartoons by Guy Steele as interior illos.
<P>
No one can stop you from adding your own markup to the flat-ASCII
version and laser-printing the result, and the coauthors have legally
relinquished the right to even try in order to respect hackish
traditions of information sharing.  We do <STRONG>ask</STRONG> you not
to do this; widespread `pirating' of a typeset version would ruin
anyone else's future chances of cooperating with a publisher on a
project involving both free and commercial distribution.
<P>
You should buy this book because, if it does well, it will encourage
future projects that combine free and commercial distribution channels.
This would be a Good Thing, because it would both promote free electronic
access to information and reward people in the marketplace for putting
it together and making it accessible.

<H1>How To Find It In Bookstores</H1>

The nice typeset book version is being carried by all major U.S. book
chains --- B. Dalton's, Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble, Brentano's, etc.
(The D.C.-area Crown chain is an exception; they don't like the
Press's discount structure.)
<P>
It will also be in many college bookstores and the more cerebral
sort of independent bookseller (especially SF and technical
bookstores).  Many stores will feature a big cardboard pop-up display
featuring art by Duane Bibby.
<P>
If you don't see it at your favorite bookstore, ask for it by name.
Sometimes lesser branches of the chains won't actually order copies in
from the chain's warehouses until they have someone order it.  The
good side of this is that your single request may cause them to order
ten or more copies, which would be good for reasons I go into below.

<H1>What The Public And Reviewers Are Saying</H1>

Sales have been brisk: see the <A HREF="#sales">sales figures</A>.
<P>
Internet hackerdom has taken this book to its collective heart.  
<P>
William Safire's December 8th 1991 "On Language" column in the
New York Times mentioned TNHD as one of his picks for gift-giving
that Christmas.  <I>Byte</I> ran an unabashed rave in their January 1992
issue.  Laudatory reviews have also appeared in <I>PC Magazine</I>,
<I>IEEE Spectrum</I>, <I>PC World</I> and <I>Wired</I>.  The December 1991
issue of <I>Computing Reviews</I> ran TNHD's definition of `creationism' on
its cover.  More recently, the British journal <I>New Scientist</I>,
<I>Sciences</I>, and <I>Mondo 2000</I> have all praised the book.  In
mid-October 1992 it made "On Language" again and was cited by name on
the front page of the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.  MTV has based segments
of the "CyberStuff" feature of "This Week in Rock" on excerpts from the
File.
<P>
As TNHD II hit the street, <I>Newsweek</I> magazine ran a major article on
the Internet and its history, using the Jargon File as a primary source and
quoting several File entries in a prominent sidebar.  And in November 1995,
<CITE>Time Magazine</CITE> used TNHD as the basis for an entire article on
network culture in its first-ever "Time Digital" section.
<P>
For scholars, the <CITE>Oxford English Dictionary</CITE> now uses TNHD as
a major source for computing neologisms.  
<P>
We have continued to collect raves whenever the book has been reviewed,
except for one or two reviewers who just didn't get it and went away
puzzled. 

<H1>Why You Want This Book To Sell 1e6 Copies</H1>

A word from your humble compiler... <P>

One of my major objectives in seeing the Jargon File published on paper
is to help the general public to get a truer and more positive image
of hackers than they seem to have now.
<P>
Right now, our society is in a phase of reforming its attitudes and
laws about information privacy, intellectual property, hacking, and
First Amendment issues in electronic networking.  It is not a good
thing for this process that many in the public think of hackers as a
potential conspiracy of dangerous nerds, that the very term "hacker"
is now considered by many ignorant people to be a synonym for
"computer criminal".  We must reclaim the word "hacker" for our own!
<P>
There is a real danger to hackers that restrictive, wrong-headed
information laws and strict licensing requirements for "software
professionals" might kill our open, free-spirited culture.  This would
be a tragedy not just for us but for the whole world that benefits from
our creativity.
<P>
Groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have been formed to
fight for hackerdom on the legal and political level.  To support
that, though, the public needs to be educated about all the
positive aspects of hackerdom.  We need them to see our sense of
humor, our dedication, our playfulness, our idealism; we need to
communicate the excitement, challenge and promise of the new worlds
we're exploring.  We need the man in the street to see us as allies,
not as a threat.
<P>
I think this book can be a big help with that.  If it sells a
million copies, that's a million people who will learn something of
our traditions, and our dreams, and (perhaps most importantly) how to
laugh with us.  That's a million friends.  I think we need those
friends, and I think we're going to need them a lot more before
society completes its adaptation to the new computing technologies.
<P>
Since I wrote the preceding in 1991 (five years ago), positive changes
in the mainstream culture have made some of these issues perhaps a bit
less pressing.  The battle to reclaim the term `hacker' hasn't been
definitively won, but at least Time Magazine and its ilk routinely
mention the hacker vs. cracker distinction in major stories.
<P>
Despite the occasional cyberporn flap, the public seems to generally
side with hackers and civil libertarians on information-freedom issues.
The Clipper-chip power-grab of '92 was foiled by Internet-centered
agitation, and the obscenely repressive "Communications Decency Act"
was thoroughly nuked by a federal court following a high-profile
campaign by freee-speech rights groups.  And the public is voting
with their dollars for more freedom, turning away from video-on-demand
and filtered commercial BBSes like Prodigy towards the
Internet. Positive buzz about the Internet is everywhere.  Even IBM
now advertises its hardware and software on the strength of its
Internet-access capabilities.  And perhaps most remarkably, there
are studies suggesting the the Internet is even pulling mainstream 
Americans away from their TV sets!
<P>
We're still a tiny minority, but our stock in the pop culture has
definitely risen since TNHD I.  Movies like "Sneakers", "The Net", and
"Independence Day", silly though they are, feature hacker heroes.  The
kinds of teenage techno-nerds that sometimes mature into hackers have
become admired role models rather than automatic objects of contempt.
Despite the tiresomeness of much `information superhighway' rhetoric,
it has focused a lot of attention and approval on the infrastructure
hackers have been quietly helping to build for decades.
<P>
In short, hackerdom seems to be winning its culture war.  Now we have
to cope with success.
<P>
The explosion of public interest in the Internet since 1994 has, if
anything, made TNHD's role more important.  While it's kind of fun to
have everybody want to play our game after thirty years of being
marginalized as dreamers and geeks, there's now another real danger;
that the culture and shared values that make the Internet work could
get lost in the noise made by millions of newbies.  To counter this,
we need to tell our story and transmit our culture in a way that's
accessible to those hordes of new users.  While TNHD can't do that all
by itself (because it takes long-term person-to-person contact to do
acculturation really right), it's far from the least effective vector
we have.  And TNHD plus Internet exposure <EMPH>is</EMPH> effective.
<P>
This is why I hope you will want <CITE>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</CITE> to sell a million copies.  I think there's a
significant chance for it to make a significant impact on the public's
consciousness, by becoming everybody's idea of the perfect gift book
for the budding Internet user.
<P>
Soooo...tell your friends about this book.  I used to say "the freedom
you help save may be your own".  That's still an issue, but
I can now ask you to plug TNHD for less fearful reasons.  Help out
the poor bewildered Internet newbies in their teeming millions!  Our
hacker heritage is just what they need to make moral and mythic
sense of the infant cyberspace struggling to be born out of the Net.
This is our time.  This is our book.  Share, and enjoy!
