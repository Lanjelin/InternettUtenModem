<A NAME=TAG1087><B>macro</B></A> /mak'roh/ [techspeak] /n./ <P> A name (possibly followed
   by a formal  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG37" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG37">arg</A> list) that is equated to a text or symbolic
   expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with the
   substitution of actual arguments) by a macro expander.  This
   definition can be found in any technical dictionary; what those
   won't tell you is how the hackish connotations of the term have
   changed over time.
<P>
   The term `macro' originated in early assemblers, which encouraged
   the use of macros as a structuring and information-hiding device.
   During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became ubiquitous, and
   sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG891" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG891">HLL</A>s, only to fall
   from favor as improving compiler technology marginalized assembler
   programming (see  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1010" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1010">languages of choice</A>).  Nowadays the term is
   most often used in connection with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one
   of several special-purpose languages built around a macro-expansion
   facility (such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff suite).
<P>
   Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective
   `macros' is now sometimes used for code in any special-purpose
   application control language (whether or not the language is
   actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities
   such as the `keyboard macros' supported in some text editors
   (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard enhancers).  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1088><B>macro-</B></A> /pref./ <P> Large.  Opposite of  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1140" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1140">micro-</A>.  In the
   mainstream and among other technical cultures (for example, medical
   people) this competes with the prefix  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1122" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1122">mega-</A>, but hackers tend
   to restrict the latter to quantification.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1089><B>macrology</B></A> /mak-rol'*-jee/ /n./ <P> 1. Set of usually complex or
   crufty macros, e.g., as part of a large system written in
    <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1047" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1047">LISP</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1760" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1760">TECO</A>, or (less commonly) assembler.  2. The art and
   science involved in comprehending a macrology in sense 1.
   Sometimes studying the macrology of a system is not unlike
   archeology, ecology, or  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1782" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1782">theology</A>, hence the sound-alike
   construction.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG189" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG189">boxology</A>.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1092><B>magic</B></A> /adj./ <P> 1. As yet unexplained, or too complicated to
   explain; compare  <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG49" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG49">automagically</A> and (Arthur C.) Clarke's Third
   Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
   from magic."  "TTY echoing is controlled by a large number of
   magic bits."  "This routine magically computes the parity of an
   8-bit byte in three instructions."  2. Characteristic of something
   that works although no one really understands why (this is
   especially called  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG128" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG128">black magic</A>).  3. [Stanford] A feature not
   generally publicized that allows something otherwise impossible, or
   a feature formerly in that category but now unveiled.  Compare

   in Appendix A.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1093><B>magic cookie</B></A> /n./ <P> [Unix] 1. Something passed between routines
   or programs that enables the receiver to perform some operation; a
   capability ticket or opaque identifier.  Especially used of small
   data objects that contain data encoded in a strange or
   intrinsically machine-dependent way.  E.g., on non-Unix OSes with a
   non-byte-stream model of files, the result of <CODE>ftell(3)</CODE> may
   be a magic cookie rather than a byte offset; it can be passed to
   <CODE>fseek(3)</CODE>, but not operated on in any meaningful way.  The
   phrase `it hands you a magic cookie' means it returns a result
   whose contents are not defined but which can be passed back to the
   same or some other program later.  2. An in-band code for changing
   graphic rendition (e.g., inverse video or underlining) or
   performing other control functions (see also  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG342" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG342">cookie</A>).  Some
   older terminals would leave a blank on the screen corresponding to
   mode-change magic cookies; this was also called a  <A HREF="JARGO~23.HTM#TAG760" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_22.html#TAG760">glitch</A> (or
   occasionally a `turd'; compare  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1179" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1179">mouse droppings</A>).  See also
    <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG342" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG342">cookie</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1094><B>magic number</B></A> /n./ <P> [Unix/C] 1. In source code, some
   non-obvious constant whose value is significant to the operation of
   a program and that is inserted inconspicuously in-line
   ( <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG860" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG860">hardcoded</A>), rather than expanded in by a symbol set by a
   commented <CODE>#define</CODE>.  Magic numbers in this sense are bad
   style.  2. A number that encodes critical information used in an
   algorithm in some opaque way.  The classic examples of these are
   the numbers used in hash or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a
   linear congruential generator for pseudo-random numbers.  This
   sense actually predates and was ancestral to the more commonsense
   1.  3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file
   to indicate its type to a utility.  Under Unix, the system and
   various applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish
   between types of executable file by looking for a magic number.
   Once upon a time, these magic numbers were PDP-11 branch
   instructions that skipped over header data to the start of
   executable code; 0407, for example, was octal for `branch 16 bytes
   relative'.  Many other kinds of files now have magic numbers
   somewhere; some magic numbers are, in fact, strings, like the
   <SAMP>`!&#60;arch&#62;'</SAMP> at the beginning of a Unix archive file or the
   <SAMP>`%!'</SAMP> leading PostScript files.  Nowadays only a  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1994" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1994">wizard</A>
   knows the spells to create magic numbers.  How do you choose a
   fresh magic number of your own?  Simple -- you pick one at random.
   See?  It's magic! <P>
   <EM>The</EM> magic number, on the other hand, is @Math{7+/-2}.  See
   "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on
   our capacity for processing information" by George Miller, in the
   "Psychological Review" 63:81-97 (1956).  This classic paper
   established the number of distinct items (such as numeric digits)
   that humans can hold in short-term memory.  Among other things,
   this strongly influenced the interface design of the phone system.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1095><B>magic smoke</B></A> /n./ <P> A substance trapped inside IC packages that
   enables them to function (also called `blue smoke'; this is
   similar to the archaic `phlogiston' hypothesis about
   combustion).  Its existence is demonstrated by what happens when a
   chip burns up -- the magic smoke gets let out, so it doesn't work
   any more.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1635" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1635">smoke test</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1026" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1026">let the smoke out</A>.
<P>
   Usenetter Jay Maynard tells the following story: "Once, while
   hacking on a dedicated Z80 system, I was testing code by blowing
   EPROMs and plugging them in the system, then seeing what happened.
   One time, I plugged one in backwards.  I only discovered that
   <EM>after</EM> I realized that Intel didn't put power-on lights under
   the quartz windows on the tops of their EPROMs -- the die was
   glowing white-hot.  Amazingly, the EPROM worked fine after I erased
   it, filled it full of zeros, then erased it again.  For all I know,
   it's still in service.  Of course, this is because the magic smoke
   didn't get let out."  Compare the original phrasing of  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1199" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1199">Murphy's Law</A>.  <P>

   recipient's system.  Sometimes done in retaliation for a perceived
   serious offense.  Mailbombing is itself widely regarded as a
   serious offense -- it can disrupt email traffic or other

   1. An  <A HREF="JARGO~20.HTM#TAG549" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_20.html#TAG549">email</A> address that is an alias (or  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1087" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1087">macro</A>, though
   that word is never used in this connection) for many other email
   addresses.  Some mailing lists are simple `reflectors',
   redirecting mail sent to them to the list of recipients.  Others
   are filtered by humans or programs of varying degrees of
   sophistication; lists filtered by humans are said to be
   `moderated'.  2. The people who receive your email when you send
   it to such an address.
<P>
   Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction,
   along with  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1882" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1882">Usenet</A>.  They predate Usenet, having originated
   with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections.  They are often used
   for private information-sharing on topics that would be too
   specialized for or inappropriate to public Usenet groups.  Though
   some of these maintain almost purely technical content (such as the
   Internet Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the
   `sf-lovers' list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are
   recreational, and many are purely social.  Perhaps the most
   infamous of the social lists was the eccentric <I>bandykin</I>
   distribution; its latter-day progeny, <I>lectroids</I> and
   <I>tanstaafl</I>, still include a number of the oddest and most
   interesting people in hackerdom.  <P>
   Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a
   significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large,
   at which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail
   software).  Thus, they are often created temporarily by working
   groups, the members of which can then collaborate on a project
   without ever needing to meet face-to-face.  Much of the material in
   this lexicon was criticized and polished on just such a mailing
   list (called `jargon-friends'), which included all the co-authors
   of Steele-1983.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1099><B>main loop</B></A> /n./ <P> The top-level control flow construct in an

   smaller `minicomputer' designs in the early 1970s, the
   traditional  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG106" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG106">big iron</A> machines were described as `mainframe
   computers' and eventually just as mainframes.  The term carries the
   connotation of a machine designed for batch rather than interactive
   use, though possibly with an interactive timesharing operating
   system retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of machines built
   by IBM, Unisys, and the other great  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG474" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG474">dinosaur</A>s surviving from

<P>
   It has been common wisdom among hackers since the late 1980s that
   the mainframe architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside
   of the tiny market for  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1275" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1275">number-crunching</A> supercomputers (see

   technology and low-cost personal computing.  As of 1993, corporate
   America is just beginning to figure this out -- the wave of
   failures, takeovers, and mergers among traditional mainframe makers
   have certainly provided sufficient omens (see  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG476" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG476">dinosaurs mating</A> and  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG992" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG992">killer micro</A>).  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1112><B>Mars</B></A> /n./ <P> A legendary tragic failure, the archetypal Hacker
   Dream Gone Wrong.  Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10
   compatible computers built by Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group):
   the multi-processor SC-30M, the small uniprocessor SC-25M, and the
   never-built superprocessor SC-40M.  These machines were marvels of
   engineering design; although not much slower than the unique
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG674" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG674">Foonly</A> F-1, they were physically smaller and consumed less
   power than the much slower DEC KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4
   machines.  They were also completely compatible with the DEC KL10,
   and ran all KL10 binaries (including the operating system) with no
   modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a KL10.  <P>
   When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983, Systems Concepts
   should have made a bundle selling their machine into shops with a
   lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their spring
   1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the
   PDP-10 world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of
   1984, and TOPS-20 by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers
   running Systems Concepts were much better at designing machines
   than at mass producing or selling them; the company allowed itself
   to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism into continually
   improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery dates
   continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and VAX 8600 and
   failed to reckon with the likes of Sun Microsystems and other
   hungry startups building workstations with power comparable to the
   KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped the first
   SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or
   Unix boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being
   purchased by CompuServe.  <P>

<A NAME=TAG1137><B>MFTL</B></A> /M-F-T-L/ <P> [abbreviation: `My Favorite Toy Language']
   1. /adj./  Describes a talk on a programming language design that
   is heavy on the syntax (with lots of BNF), sometimes even talks
   about semantics (e.g., type systems), but rarely, if ever, has any
   content (see  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG334" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG334">content-free</A>).  More broadly applied to talks ---
   even when the topic is not a programming language -- in which the
   subject matter is gone into in unnecessary and meticulous detail at
   the sacrifice of any conceptual content.  "Well, it was a typical
   MFTL talk".  2. /n./ Describes a language about which the
   developers are passionate (often to the point of proselytic zeal)
   but no one else cares about.  Applied to the language by those
   outside the originating group.  "He cornered me about type
   resolution in his MFTL." <P>
   The first great goal in the mind of the designer of an MFTL is
   usually to write a compiler for it, then bootstrap the design away
   from contamination by lesser languages by writing a compiler for it
   in itself.  Thus, the standard put-down question at an MFTL talk is
   "Has it been used for anything besides its own compiler?"  On
   the other hand, a language that cannot even be used to write
   its own compiler is beneath contempt.  See  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG200" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG200">break-even point</A>.
<P>
   (On a related note, Doug McIlroy once proposed a test of the
   generality and utility of a language and the operating system under
   which it is compiled: "Is the output of a FORTRAN program
   acceptable as input to the FORTRAN compiler?"  In other words, can
   you write programs that write programs? (See  <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1816" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1816">toolsmith</A>.)
   Alarming numbers of (language, OS) pairs fail this test,
   particularly when the language is FORTRAN; aficionados are quick to
   point out that  <A HREF="JARGO~35.HTM#TAG1869" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_36.html#TAG1869">Unix</A> (even using FORTRAN) passes it handily.
   That the test could ever be failed is only surprising to those who
   have had the good fortune to have worked only under modern systems
   which lack OS-supported and -imposed "file types".)<P>

    <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1260" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1260">noddy</A> (that is, trivial) program.  Doesn't necessarily have

   mickey mouse stuff!"; sometimes trivial programs can be very
   useful.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1140><B>micro-</B></A> /pref./ <P> 1. Very small; this is the root of its use as
   a quantifier prefix.  2. A quantifier prefix, calling for
   multiplication by @Math{10^(-6)} (see  <A HREF="JARGO~31.HTM#TAG1443" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_32.html#TAG1443">quantifiers</A>).
   Neither of these uses is peculiar to hackers, but hackers tend to
   fling them both around rather more freely than is countenanced in
   standard English.  It is recorded, for example, that one CS
   professor used to characterize the standard length of his lectures
   as a microcentury -- that is, about 52.6 minutes (see also
    <A HREF="JARGO~17.HTM#TAG47" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_16.html#TAG47">attoparsec</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1212" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1212">nanoacre</A>, and especially
    <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1143" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1143">microfortnight</A>).  3. Personal or human-scale -- that is,
   capable of being maintained or comprehended or manipulated by one
   human being.  This sense is generalized from `microcomputer',
   and is esp. used in contrast with `macro-' (the corresponding
   Greek prefix meaning `large').  4. Local as opposed to global (or
    <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1088" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1088">macro-</A>).  Thus a hacker might say that buying a smaller car to
   reduce pollution only solves a microproblem; the macroproblem of
   getting to work might be better solved by using mass transit,
   moving to within walking distance, or (best of all) telecommuting.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1141><B>MicroDroid</B></A> /n./ <P> [Usenet] A Microsoft employee, esp. one who

   one would now use a floppy disk: as a small, portable way to save

<A NAME=TAG1153><B>misfeature</B></A> /mis-fee'chr/ or /mis'fee`chr/ /n./ <P> A feature
   that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is not adequate
   for a new situation that has evolved.  Since it results from a
   deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a
   bug.  Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies
   that the feature in question was carefully planned, but its
   long-term consequences were not accurately or adequately predicted
   (which is quite different from not having thought ahead at all).  A
   misfeature can be a particularly stubborn problem to resolve,
   because fixing it usually involves a substantial philosophical
   change to the structure of the system involved.  <P>
   Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise
   because the designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes
   for laws of nature.  Often a former feature becomes a misfeature
   because trade-offs were made whose parameters subsequently change
   (possibly only in the judgment of the implementors).  "Well, yeah,
   it is kind of a misfeature that file names are limited to six
   characters, but the original implementors wanted to save directory
   space and we're stuck with it for now." <P>

<A NAME=TAG1157><B>moby</B></A> /moh'bee/ <P> [MIT: seems to have been in use among
   model railroad fans years ago.  Derived from Melville's "Moby
   Dick" (some say from `Moby Pickle').] 1. /adj./ Large, immense,
   complex, impressive.  "A Saturn V rocket is a truly moby frob."
   "Some MIT undergrads pulled off a moby hack at the Harvard-Yale
   game."  (See " <A HREF="JARGO~44.HTM#SEC51" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_44.html#SEC51">The Meaning of `Hack'</A>").
   2. /n./ obs. The maximum address space of a machine (see below).  For
   a 680[234]0 or VAX or most modern 32-bit architectures, it is
   4,294,967,296 8-bit bytes (4 gigabytes).  3. A title of address
   (never of third-person reference), usually used to show admiration,
   respect, and/or friendliness to a competent hacker.  "Greetings,
   moby Dave.  How's that address-book thing for the Mac going?"
   4. /adj./ In backgammon, doubles on the dice, as in `moby sixes',
   `moby ones', etc.  Compare this with  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG111" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG111">bignum</A> (sense 3):
   double sixes are both bignums and moby sixes, but moby ones are not
   bignums (the use of `moby' to describe double ones is sarcastic).
   Standard emphatic forms: `Moby foo', `moby win', `moby loss'.
   `Foby moo': a spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt.  5. The
   largest available unit of something which is available in discrete
   increments.  Thus, ordering a "moby Coke" at the local fast-food
   joint is not just a request for a large Coke, it's an explicit
   request for the largest size they sell.  <P>
   This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge
   when it was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical
   memory size for a timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a
   moby is classically 256K 36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or
   PDP-10 moby.  Back when address registers were narrow the term was
   more generally useful, because when a computer had virtual memory
   mapping, it might actually have more physical memory attached to it
   than any one program could access directly.  One could then say
   "This computer has 6 mobies" meaning that the ratio of physical
   memory to address space is 6, without having to say specifically
   how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that the
   computer could timeshare six `full-sized' programs without having
   to swap programs between memory and disk.  <P>
   Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto
   a machine, so most systems have much <EM>less</EM> than one
   theoretical `native' moby of  <A HREF="JARGO~19.HTM#TAG353" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_18.html#TAG353">core</A>.  Also, more modern
   memory-management techniques (esp. paging) make the `moby
   count' less significant.  However, there is one series of
   widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived ---
   the Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG194" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG194">brain-damaged</A>
   segmented-memory designs.  On these, a `moby' would be the
   1-megabyte address span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a
   PDP-10 moby was exactly 1 megabyte of 9-bit bytes).  <P>

   esp. with reference to bug fixes or minor design changes in

<A NAME=TAG1160><B>mode</B></A> /n./ <P> A general state, usually used with an adjective
   describing the state.  Use of the word `mode' rather than
   `state' implies that the state is extended over time, and
   probably also that some activity characteristic of that state is
   being carried out. "No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode."  In its
   jargon sense, `mode' is most often attributed to people, though
   it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. In
   particular, see  <A HREF="JARGO~26.HTM#TAG826" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_23.html#TAG826">hack mode</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~21.HTM#TAG422" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_19.html#TAG422">day mode</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~29.HTM#TAG1254" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_29.html#TAG1254">night mode</A>,

    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1748" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1748">talk mode</A>.  <P>
   One also often hears the verbs `enable' and `disable' used in
   connection with jargon modes.  Thus, for example, a sillier way of
   saying "I'm going to crash" is "I'm going to enable crash mode
   now".  One might also hear a request to "disable flame mode,
   please".  <P>
   In a usage much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that
   certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain
   functions.  For example, in order to insert characters into a
   document in the Unix editor <CODE>vi</CODE>, one must type the "i" key,
   which invokes the "Insert" command.  The effect of this command
   is to put vi into "insert mode", in which typing the "i" key
   has a quite different effect (to wit, it inserts an "i" into the
   document).  One must then hit another special key, "ESC", in
   order to leave "insert mode".  Nowadays, modeful interfaces are
   generally considered  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1069" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1069">losing</A> but survive in quite a few widely

   have something to demo for IBM on time, and the rest is history.
   Numerous features, including vaguely Unix-like but rather broken
   support for subdirectories, I/O redirection, and pipelines, were
   hacked into Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as a result,
   there are two or more incompatible versions of many system calls,

   character to use as an option switch or whether to be
   case-sensitive.  The resulting appalling mess is now the
   highest-unit-volume OS in history.  Often known simply as DOS,
   which annoys people familiar with other similarly abbreviated
   operating systems (the name goes back to the mid-1960s, when it was
   attached to IBM's first disk operating system for the 360).  The

   relatively simple interrupt services.  Some people like to
   pronounce DOS like "dose", as in "I don't work on dose, man!",
   or to compare it to a dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button

<A NAME=TAG1183><B>mu</B></A> /moo/ <P> The correct answer to the classic trick question
   "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?".  Assuming that you
   have no wife or you have never beaten your wife, the answer "yes"
   is wrong because it implies that you used to beat your wife and
   then stopped, but "no" is worse because it suggests that you have
   one and are still beating her.  According to various Discordians
   and Douglas Hofstadter the correct answer is usually "mu", a
   Japanese word alleged to mean "Your question cannot be answered
   because it depends on incorrect assumptions".  Hackers tend to be
   sensitive to logical inadequacies in language, and many have
   adopted this suggestion with enthusiasm.  The word `mu' is
   actually from Chinese, meaning `nothing'; it is used in
   mainstream Japanese in that sense, but native speakers do not
   recognize the Discordian question-denying use.  It almost certainly
   derives from overgeneralization of the answer in the following

   experiments accessible via the Internet.  These are real-time chat
   forums with structure; they have multiple `locations' like an
   adventure game, and may include combat, traps, puzzles, magic, a
   simple economic system, and the capability for characters to build
   more structure onto the database that represents the existing
   world.  2. /vi./ To play a MUD.  The acronym MUD is often lowercased
   and/or verbed; thus, one may speak of `going mudding', etc.  <P>
   Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU-
   form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the
   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of
   that game still exist today and are sometimes generically called
   <I>BartleMUD</I>s.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,
   unfortunately, by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name
   MUD was trademarked to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British
   Telecom (the motto: "You haven't <EM>lived</EM> 'til you've
   <EM>died</EM> on MUD!"); however, this is false -- Richard Bartle
   explicitly placed `MUD' in the public domain in 1985.  BT was upset
   at this, as they had already printed trademark claims on some maps
   and posters, which were released and created the myth.  <P>
   Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the
   MUD concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD).
   Many of these had associated bulletin-board systems for social
   interaction.  Because these had an image as `research' they
   often survived administrative hostility to BBSs in general.  This,
   together with the fact that Usenet feeds were often spotty and
   difficult to get in the U.K., made the MUDs major foci of hackish
   social interaction there.  <P>
   AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and
   quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large
   hacker communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom
   (some observers see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the
   early 1980s).  The second wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants)
   tended to emphasize social interaction, puzzles, and cooperative
   world-building as opposed to combat and competition.  By 1991, over
   50% of MUD sites were of a third major variety, LPMUD, which
   synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and older systems
   with the extensibility of TinyMud.  In 1996 the cutting edge of the
   technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO, even more extensible using a
   built-in object-oriented language.  The trend toward greater
   programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue.  <P>
   The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly,
   with new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month.
   Around 1991 there was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the
   term  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1184" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1184">MUD</A> itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding variety
   of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
   explored.  It survived.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~18.HTM#TAG178" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_17.html#TAG178">bonk/oif</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG666" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG666">FOD</A>,

   eats, sleeps, and breathes MUD.  Mudheads have been known to fail
   their degrees, drop out, etc., with the consolation, however, that
   they made wizard level.  When encountered in person, on a MUD, or
   in a chat system, all a mudhead will talk about is three topics:
   the tactic, character, or wizard that is supposedly always unfairly
   stopping him/her from becoming a wizard or beating a favorite MUD;
   why the specific game he/she has experience with is so much better
   than any other; and the MUD he or she is writing or going to write
   because his/her design ideas are so much better than in any
   existing MUD.  See also  <A HREF="JARGO~40.HTM#TAG1937" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_38.html#TAG1937">wannabee</A>.  <P>

   Like many early hacker terms, this one seems to have originated at
    <A HREF="JARGO~38.HTM#TAG1806" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_35.html#TAG1806">TMRC</A>; it was already in use there in 1958.  Peter Samson
   (compiler of the original TMRC lexicon) thinks it may originally
   have been onomatopoeic for the sound of a relay spring (contact)
   being twanged.  However, it is known that during the World Wars,
   `mung' was U.S. army slang for the ersatz creamed chipped beef
   better known as `SOS', and it seems quite likely that the word in
   fact goes back to Scots-dialect  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1198" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1198">munge</A>.  <P>
<A NAME=TAG1198><B>munge</B></A> /muhnj/ /vt./ <P> 1. [derogatory] To imperfectly
   transform information.  2. A comprehensive rewrite of a routine,
   data structure or the whole program.  3. To modify data in some way 
   the speaker doesn't need to go into right now or cannot describe
   succinctly (compare  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1191" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1191">mumble</A>). <P>
   This term is often confused with  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1197" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1197">mung</A>, which probably was
   derived from it.  However, it also appears the word `munge' was in
   common use in Scotland in the 1940s, and in Yorkshire in the 1950s,
   as a verb, meaning to munch up into a masticated mess, and
   as a noun, meaning the result of munging something up (the
   parallel with the  <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG1000" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG1000">kluge</A>/ <A HREF="JARGO~27.HTM#TAG999" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_26.html#TAG999">kludge</A> pair is amusing). <P>
<A NAME=TAG1199><B>Murphy's Law</B></A> /prov./ <P> The correct, <EM>original</EM> Murphy's
   Law reads: "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one
   of those ways can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do
   it."  This is a principle of defensive design, cited here because
   it is usually given in mutant forms less descriptive of the
   challenges of design for  <A HREF="JARGO~28.HTM#TAG1080" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_27.html#TAG1080">luser</A>s.  For example, you don't make a
   two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if it
   matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical (see also the anecdote under  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1095" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1095">magic smoke</A>).  <P>
   Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 to test
   human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981).  One experiment
   involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of
   the subject's body.  There were two ways each sensor could be glued
   to its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 the wrong
   way around.  Murphy then made the original form of his
   pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp)
   quoted at a news conference a few days later.  <P>
   Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical
   cultures connected to aerospace engineering.  Before too many years
   had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination,
   changing as they went.  Most of these are variants on "Anything
   that can go wrong, will"; this is correctly referred to as
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG620" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG620">Finagle's Law</A>.  The memetic drift apparent in these mutants
   clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself! <P>
<A NAME=TAG1200><B>music</B></A> /n./ <P> A common extracurricular interest of hackers
   (compare  <A HREF="JARGO~46.HTM#TAG1555" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_34.html#TAG1555">science-fiction fandom</A>,  <A HREF="JARGO~32.HTM#TAG1305" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_30.html#TAG1305">oriental food</A>; see also
    <A HREF="JARGO~22.HTM#TAG617" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_21.html#TAG617">filk</A>).  Hackish folklore has long claimed that musical and
   programming abilities are closely related, and there has been at
   least one large-scale statistical study that supports this.
   Hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop musical
   appreciation in unusual and interesting directions.  Folk music is
   very big in hacker circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of
   elaborate instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called
   `progressive' and isn't recorded much any more.  The hacker's
   musical range tends to be wide; many can listen with equal
   appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle Giant, Pat
   Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King Sunny
   Ade, The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti.
   It is also apparently true that hackerdom includes a much higher
   concentration of talented amateur musicians than one would expect
   from a similar-sized control group of  <A HREF="JARGO~30.HTM#TAG1196" tppabs="http://www.ccil.org/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1196">mundane</A> types.  <P>
