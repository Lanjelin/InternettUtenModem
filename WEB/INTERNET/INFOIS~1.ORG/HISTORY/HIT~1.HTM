<center><h3><A NAME="FAQ">Hobbes' Internet Timeline FAQ</A></h3></center>
<DL>
<DT>1. Why did you compile Hobbes' Internet Timeline?
<DD>For use in the Internet courses I taught: Introduction to the Internet,
   Internet Tools Administration, and Net Surfing 101.
<p>
<DT>2. How do I get Hobbes' Internet Timeline?
<DD>The Timeline is archived at: <A HREF="HIT~1.HTM" tppabs="http://info.isoc.org/guest/zakon/Internet/History/HIT.html">http://info.isoc.org/guest/zakon/Internet/History/HIT.html</A>.
   If you prefer a copy via e-mail, send a blank message to timeline@hobbes.mitre.org. 
   For comments/corrections please use hobbes@hobbes.mitre.org.  
<p>
<DT>3. What do you do at MITRE?
<DD>I design the soccer shoe of the future (wrong MITRE :-)  Actually, I 
   wear the following hats: Net Evangelist, HCI Engineer, Systems Integrator,
   Information Engineer, NIDR Administrator, Lead Scientist, Instructor, 
   He with the Most Toys
<p>
<DT>4. Why don't you list the # of Internet users?
<DD>This is too controversial, and relatively inaccurate, an issue which the 
   author does not want to get flamed or spammed for.  His guess would be 
   between 1 (himself) and 5 billion (but then again, one never knows if 
   you're a dog on the Net). 
<p>
<DT>5. Is your license plate really NET SURF?
<DD>Yes, and there is a frame around it with INTERNET at the top, and my
   e-mail address at the bottom. (My wife is too embarrassed to drive it:)
   Oh, and the bumper sticker says "I'd Rather Be Net Surfing"
<p>
<DT>6. Can I re-print the Timeline or use parts of it for ... ?
<DD>Drop me an e-mail.  The answer is most likely (though don't assume) 'yes' 
   for non-profit use, and 'maybe' for for-profit; but to be sure you are not 
   going to break any copyright laws, drop me an e-mail and wait for a reply.

<DT>[ I realize the question below is outdated, but I leave it as proof of
  my prediction powers :-]
<DT>7. Who do you think is going to win the '94 World Cup?
<DD>Brasil, of course!  (I was born in Rio de Janeiro ...)

The author is on an eternal genealogical search.  If you know of someone
whose last name is Zakon or could spare 1 minute to check your local phone
book, please e-mail any info (i.e., name, phone, address, city) to
rhz@po.cwru.edu; your help is greatly appreciated.

Help update: Thanks to Net folks, 39 new Zakon's have been found so far, making
             the current total around 175! (this after a decade of research)
