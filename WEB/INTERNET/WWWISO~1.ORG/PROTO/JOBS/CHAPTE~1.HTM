<b>Chapter Development/Relations Director</b>
<p>
The <B>Internet Society (ISOC)</B> has more than 7,000 individual and 130
organizational members around the world, and we're about to take off.  We
have chapters in 12 countries, with more clamoring for help in getting
started.
<p>
We are looking for a top-notch chapters person to help us grow even faster.
Someone with recent, proven experience in expanding and strengthening a
network of worldwide chapters.  Someone who can create programs that
increase the level of activities on the part of the chapters, and get the
members involved to a greater degree.  Someone with marketing, business,
and (preferably) some technical smarts.  In short: a chapters pro who's
both a strategizer on a practical level and an implementer (not much staff
here, yet)! 
<p>
ISOC is a non-profit international organization whose mission is to assure
the beneficial, open evolution of the Internet through leadership in
standards, issues, and education. 
<p>
Applicants should have a Bachelor's degree, three to five years of chapter
development/relations experience, the ability to manage multiple projects
and deadlines, strong organizational and teamwork skills, excellent
communications skills, Internet literate, used to providing solid plans and
status reports, and able to prepare and give presentations.  International
experience a big plus.  Salary open.  
Non-smoking office.
