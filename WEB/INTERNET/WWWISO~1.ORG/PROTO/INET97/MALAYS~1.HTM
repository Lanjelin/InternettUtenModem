<P>
Dining in Kuala Lumpur is a gastronomic adventure - a treat for your tastebuds.  Owing to the composition of its populace and their individual cultures, Kuala Lumpur has evolved into a gourmet's paradise with its varied offerings of Malay, Chinese and Indian food - each characterized by a distinctly unique aroma and flavor.
<P>
<DT><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Shopping</B></FONT>
<P>
Kuala Lumpur is a bargain hunter's paradise offering a wide variety of goods, ranging from oriental art objects and curios to local handicraft items, designer fashions, shoes and handbags, leather goods, cameras and photographic equipment, electrical and electronic goods.  From the air-conditioned comfort of modern shopping complexes to the quaint shops and bustling night markets, Kuala Lumpur offers a unique shopping experience.

Credit cards and travelers cheques are accepted at larger establishments.  Most banks readily accept foreign currencies like the US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Yen, Deustchmark and Franc for exchange into Ringgit Malaysia.  Although prices at larger establishments are generally fixed, do not hesitate to ask for discounts.   The real fun of shopping in Kuala Lumpur is at the smaller shops and roadside stalls where bargaining is still very much in vogue and where verbal skills and a poker face may help to bring prices down dramatically.
