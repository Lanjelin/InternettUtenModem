INET is the premier international event for Internet and internetworking professionals and the crossroads at which the world's pioneers of cyberspace meet to exchange experiences and plan their next steps. Each year, network technologists, industry and government representatives, and social experts meet to exchange experiences, share information, and shape the future of the Internet and its related internetworking technologies. INET 97 will address both the traditional and evolving frontiers of the Internet as well as its significant impact on education, commerce, and societies throughout the world. Multiple conference tracks will address critical issues ranging from network engineering to user needs, from regulatory issues to the Internet's role as a conduit for social change, and from the transformation of education to the redefinition of commerce.

<P>
Since 1992, the Internet Society has served as the international organization for global coordination and cooperation on the Internet, promoting and maintaining a broad spectrum of activities focused on the Internet's development, availability, and associated technologies.
<P>
The Internet Society acts not only as a global clearinghouse for Internet information and education but also as a facilitator and coordinator of Internet-related initiatives around the world.  Through its annual International Networking (INET) conference and other sponsored events, developing-country training workshops, tutorials, statistical and market research, publications, public policy and trade activities, regional and local chapters, standardization activities, committees and an international secretariat, the Internet Society serves the needs of the growing global Internet community.  From commerce to education to social issues, our goal is to enhance the availability and utility of the Internet on the widest possible scale.
