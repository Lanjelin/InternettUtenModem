<DT><FONT SIZE=+2><B>1997 Workshop on Network Technology<BR>For Countries in the Early Stages of Internetworking</B></FONT>
<P>
In conjunction with the INET'97 Conference, the Internet Society will again, as in 1993 through 1996, sponsor a Network Technology Workshop prior to the conference itself.  The workshop will be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at the Permata Training Centre, during June 15-21, 1997.  The focus of the workshop will be upon assisting countries that are either not yet connected to the Internet or are in the process of developing and enhancing
an initial national Internet.
<P>
Attendance at the workshop includes mandatory attendance at the Internet Society's annual conference, INET'97, which will be held in Kuala Lumpur during June 24-27, 1997 following the workshop.
<P>
This workshop is an outgrowth of and builds upon the experiences of four similar workshops held during 1993-1996 at Stanford University, U.S.A., Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic, University of Hawaii, U.S.A., and McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

<P>
<DT><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Goals</B></FONT>
<P>
The goals of the workshop are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>To train a critical mass of trainer/professionals in network infrastructure, transport, services, and management to be able to support an extension of meaningful Internet-related activities within the countries represented.
<P>
<LI>To identify and share individual and institutional contacts as well as information sources that will assist the process of national development, using international Internet connections.
<P>
<LI>To build robust professional linkages between all participants in the programs so that the mentor-student and colleague-colleague relationships formed during the workshop and conferences will remain strong and of continuing usefulness well beyond the workshop and conference.
<P>
<LI>To increase the level of cooperation among existing projects and activities for establishing public data networks in developing countries.
<P>
<LI>To train people and groups of people who will return to their country and region and who will teach others what they have learned at the workshop.
</OL>

<P>
<DT><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Program</B></FONT>
<P>
An intensive program of instruction is planned for the workshop, composed of four instructional tracks, plus a supplementary pre-workshop session for some specifically invited participants.
<P>
Participants attend only one of the four tracks, since the tracks run concurrently (with the exception of the pre-workshop UNIX track).
<P>
All participants (except the National Network Management track) will engage in extensive hands-on training, either setting up a prototype network or using actual Internet resources or both, as appropriate, using facilities at the Permata Training Centre.
<P>
The course descriptions below include for each instructional track:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Who should attend this course.
<LI>What you need to know to enter this course and benefit from it (Prerequisites).
<LI>What you will learn in this course.
<LI>What you should be able to do after completing the course (Goals).

Those who will be involved in the establishment and/or operation of an Internet presence, possibly initiating the deployment of a basic national network infrastructure in the country.
<P>
<B>Prerequisites:</B> UNIX use and maybe some Unix system administration (*); some
BBS or other modem-based experience, as user or provider.

end users (who are likely DOS/Mac/... based).  The national network may
initially be connected to the international Internet by store and forward
technology such as UUCP or intermittent dial-up IP; end users may be mostly
accessing locally cached Internet information.
<P>
(* If you do not have basic UNIX experience, which is a prerequisite for
tracks one and two, and if you are admitted to one of these tracks, then you
will be required to attend a three day UNIX startup course on Thursday, 12

cannot apply for this startup course; attendance will be determined by the
workshop instructors on the basis of apparent need for and benefit from
your participation.)</DD>

<P>
<DT><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Track 2: Backbone Internetworking Technology</B></FONT>

<DT><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Eligibility</B></FONT>
<P>
The workshop is specifically directed toward the needs of people from
developing countries who are playing or will play an important part in
introducing and extending public internetworking in their countries and
regions.  Attendees should be involved in planning to establish or in
establishing the Internet's presence in their countries and regions, in
institutionalizing its operation, and in assisting the country's schools and
universities, governmental agencies, local firms, and residents in
learning about and exploiting the range of services available through the
net.  By the Internet, we mean the publicly accessible Internet, with
unrestricted access for educational institutions and the not-for-profit
community.
<P>
Staff members of international and bilateral technical co-operation
agencies, as well as professionals having substantial involvement in
international technical assistance activities, are also eligible for
admission as space allows.
<P>
Participants who have attended one or more previous Developing Countries
Workshop will be considered eligible to attend the 1997 workshop; however,
these former participants must apply for a course of study other than
subjects studied previously.  Their request must be consistent with their
responsibilities in a national and/or regional context, and a convincing
argument for repeated attendance must accompany the application.  This
should include a statement of the activities carried out as a result of the
previous workshop.  Less financial aid will be available for repeat
attendees than for first-time applicants.
