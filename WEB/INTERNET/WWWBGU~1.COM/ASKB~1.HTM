<!-INPUT NEW QUESTION HERE-!><a name="answers"><font size=+2>Q.</font>  
I'm looking for site or chat group regarding Austria, as our family is planning a trip there next summer. (Austria, by the way, is 1000 years old this year.)<p>

<a href ="mailto:lmrousseau@talvest.com">lmrousseau@talvest.com</a><p>

<!-INPUT NEW ANSWER HERE-!><font size=+2>A.</font>  
The first stop on any big trip is, you guessed it, my own <A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.bguide.com/webguide/travel/">travel reviews</A>, where sophisticated peripatetics of every stripe go for the best travel resources on the web.<p> 

For Austrian information in particular, trek over to  <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#612" tppabs="http://www.webfoot.com/travel/guides/austria/austria.html">The Webfoot's Guide to Austria</A>, the online  headquarters for heaps of weird Austrian info, including satellite weather maps and stats from the U.S. CIA factbook.  Yes, it does feel a little more like espionage than travel-planning, but I recommend it highly all the same.  And Usenet is particularly handy for talking with others about travel destinations.  Try "alt.culture.austrian."<p>

Finally: Happy Birthday, Austria. Where would we be without you?<p>

<font size=+2>Q.</font>  
I am in my late 20s and was recently diagnosed with scoliosis in my lower back.  I have electrotherapy and chiropractic work done twice a week (my work schedule makes additional therapy impossible).  Is there anything I can do, stretches or something, that will help relieve my pain and speed up the process of straightening my back?  Thanks!<p>

<font size=+2>A.</font>  
That is a question for your doctor or healthcare provider, Keichan.  I can refer you to information and support groups on the web, where you may get advice from other patients or from doctors who specialize in scoliosis.  <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#613" tppabs="http://www.ai.mit.edu/scoliosis/scoliosis.html">The Scoliosis Mailing List</a> is "maintained by and composed of people who have scoliosis." Its web page explains how to subscribe to the list, even anonymously. For more web resources, surf around the site listings at the <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#614" tppabs="http://www.yahoo.com/Health/Diseases_and_Conditions/Scoliosis/">Yahoo! scoliosis links page</a>.<p>

<font size=+2>A.</font>  Since you're in Connecticut, your best bet is the colossal <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#615" tppabs="http://www.bargainnews.com/">Bargain News Online</A>, the online version of
Connecticut's mecca for dumping unwanted stuff -- cars in particular.<P>

If your car is so valuable that you think some passionate car lover might be
willing to drive across the U.S. to pick it up, try the national <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#616" tppabs="http://www.traderonline.com/auto/">Auto-Trader Online</A>, which claims to have more than 200,000 ads and is updated daily. <P>

<font size=+2>A.</font>  Aren't we cheeky?  I have believed for a long time that the universe began
as a subatomic particle containing all existent matter and energy.  That
subatomic particle (which is now the universe) is expanding at roughly the
rate of your flippancy.  Of course, that's just one web dweller's opinion.<P>

If you must test my theory, try Dr. Sten Odenwald's stellar homepage, <A
HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#617" tppabs="http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/qanda.html">Ask the
Astronomer</A>, or the universally acclaimed and aptly titled <A
HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#618" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/3001/">Black Holes and the
Mysteries of the Cosmos</A>.  Lastly, a cozier introduction to the enigmas
of creation can be found on <A

Your most decorous option is to go straight to my <A
HREF="http://www.bguide.com/webguide/hg/">Home & garden</A> reviews.  Since
your house is new, you might also try my home improvement links under <A
HREF="WEBGUIDE/FIXIT/INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.bguide.com/webguide/fixit/">Fix-it</A>, which will take
you to the decorating section of Home Central. Another well-known online
resource is <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#620" tppabs="http://livinghome.com/">Living Home</A>, a web magazine
with daily updates. <p> If you're in a more sedentary mood, Women's Wire
has a guide to <A

<font size=+2>Q.</font> I asked you last week if you could name three recent volcanic
eruptions, and give me some information regarding them.  Have I stumped you?  Just
wondering, because you've yet to respond.<p>

Laura Holman <p>

<font size=+2>A.</font>  No, you haven't stumped me. It's just that I handle potentially explosive
questions with great care. For starters, surf over to the <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#623" tppabs="http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/home.html">Cascades Volcano Observatory Home Page</A>. It features
scientific information as well as fun movies and pictures of many of your favorite
peaks blowing themselves into little bits. And don't miss <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#624" tppabs="http://hiiaka.uhh.hawaii.edu/csav/start.html">Hawaii's Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes</A>.<p>

Have you noticed the red hot air blowing out of Hollywood?  Movies <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#625" tppabs="http://www.dantespeak.com/">Dante's Peak</A> and <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#626" tppabs="http://www.volcano.com/">Volcano</A> are both making a bang on the web.<p>


<br><p><br><p>

<font size=+2>Q.</font> How can I say to a girl in my class (I am a boy) that I like her?<p>

Shy Guy<p>

<font size=+2>A.</font> Just like that, kiddo.  You could even try asking her to the movies.  If
you think you need some electronic help, try sending her a Valentine's
postcard from <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#627" tppabs="http://www.nando.net/toys/cyrano.html">The Cyrano
Server</a>, a fun online love-note generator, or send her a <a
href="POSTCA~1/WALL" tppabs="http://www.bguide.com/postcards/wall">valentine</a> from my site.
Good luck!
<p>

<font size=+2>Q.</font>  My ex-boyfriend Colin is always commenting on my clothing as being
strange, but I like it. Help!
<p>
Renae<br> 
(no email, in Alaska)
<p>
<font size=+2>A.</font>  Good for you!  Revel in your eccentric duds -- AND Colin's attention.
Heck, high style for men is all the rage, so why not broaden <b>Colin's</b>
fashion horizons with these <a
 href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#628" tppabs="http://www.papermag.com/stylin/walt/">wild styles</a> for guys.
Here's how I see it: Colin is noticing you again because he's suddenly
realized that (gasp!) other guys notice you, too.  Give him an ultimatum:
If he wants to run with Alaska's premier fashion maven (read: you), he's
gotta spice up his bland, boring, "I'm an outdoorsy, tundra-loving kinda
guy" look.
<p>
If that doesn't work, buy yourself a <a
href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#629" tppabs="http://www.chocoholic.com/">box of chocolates</a> and a dartboard.
Put Colin's picture on the dartboard, and a have a chocolate or two (or
three or four...).  Then throw a dart (or three of four...) You get the
idea!
<p>

<font size=+2>Q.</font> I need info on black women in communications, specifically ones who host TV shows like Rolonda.  My question is where can I find this info on people such as Rolonda Watts and Roz Abrams?  Also, what is the best way to get an interview with one of these newsanchors?<p>

Corris<br>
<a href="mailto: web4753@charweb.org">web4753@charweb.org</a><p>

<font size=+2>A.</font> Well, Corris, Rolonda was an easy one.  A quickie search (see this week's <a href="TECHTI~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.bguide.com/techtip.html">tech tip</a> on people-finders) turned up her <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#630" tppabs="http://www.kingworld.com/rolonda/index.html">web site</a>, which lists a contact for interview requests and includes a short profile.  You can try the same with New York City TV personality Roz Abrams.<p> 

For more resources on women's affinity groups, look at my <a href="WEBGUIDE/WOMENET" tppabs="http://www.bguide.com/webguide/womenet">Women & the Net</a> reviews.  You'll find links to a couple of search engines for women's sites, WWWomen and
 Cybergrrl's Femina, as well as a Yahoo! search.  I'd also surf around <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#631" tppabs="http://www.netnoir.com/">Net Noir</a>, a site dedicated to African-American lifestyle, community and empowerment issues.<p> 

<br><p><br><p>


<font size=+2>Q.</font>  Why do men's dress shirts button left over right? I'll give you "impressed by your knowledge" points the faster you respond. After all, you could be researching this.<p>

Jed<br>
<a href="mailto:anjlm3@uaa.alaska.edu">anjlm3@uaa.alaska.edu</a><p>

<font size=+2>A.</font>  Jed, I'm afraid you don't get it.  In the information age, it's not how much you know, it's how much you can find out!  Would you mock a schoolchild for going to the library?  Shame a chemist who consults a reference book?  Don't you understand that the beauty of the web is exactly what you say in your letter: I could be researching this.<p>

But I'm not, 'cause you could, too.  First, check out <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs3.htm#301" tppabs="http://www.swoon.com/">Swoon's</a> magazine rack.  There, between women's mags Glamour and Mademoiselle, you'll find Details magazine, whose Style Guy Glenn O'Brien offers "advice to the flair impaired."  Submit your question there, or try Papermag's <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#632" tppabs="http://www.papermag.com/stylin/mrmickey">Mr. Mickey</a>, a funky fashion mastermind.  Isn't this fun?  Happy hunting!<p>

<br><p><br><p>

<font size=+2>Q.</font> OK. I give. Who is Beatrice? Or was it the name 
that came as a result of a focus group meeting? 
I've done all the "whois" searches for yours and 
related domains --  but no Beatrice. In other 
words, a corporation masquerading as an 
'everyday person'???<p>

Kevbob<br>
<a href="mailto:kevcol@hotmail.com">kevcol@hotmail.com</a>
<p>

<font size=+2>A.</font> Who am I? Kevbob, I am SO glad you asked. But your 
guess that I'm anything like an everyday person is 
way off the mark. This may surprise you, honey, but 
I'm actually a cartoon. (Who's fooling who here? Did 
your mother name you Kevbob? I think not.)
<p>

I'm proud to carry on the tradition of my virtual 
sisters Olive Oyl, Jessica Rabbit, Minnie Mouse and 
Lisa Simpson -- not to mention 
my good friend <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#633" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2667/boop.html">Betty Boop</a>. I'm 
delighted to share my name with the fair city of <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#634" tppabs="http://www.infoanalytic.com/beatrice/">Beatrice, 
Neb.</a>; the delicacy <a href=
"../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#635" tppabs="http://www.beatricecheese.com/">Beatrice Cheese</a>; my good friends at <a href="../tppmsgs/msgs6.htm#636" tppabs="http://www.beatrice.com/">
Beatrice.com</a> and, of course, Dante's exalted object of 
beauty, the lovely Beatrice.
