<H3>This unique experience is orchestrated by Judy Slattum and Made Surya. Judy
first went to Bali in 1978 while on a teaching sabbatical. She has done
extensive research on Balinese masks and has written a definitive book on the
subject (<I>Masks of Bali, Spirits of an Ancient Drama</I>).  Her museum show
of traditional Balinese masks has been touring the USA for four years.
</H3>
<H3>Made Surya was born in Denpasar Bali, the eldest son of a Bali/Hindu
priest. Educated at Udayana University, he currently performs Topeng, Balinese
traditional mask dance, has traveled and scaled volcanos in most of Indonesia's
inhabited islands, and is currently translating works on Balinese medicine and
religion into English. Judy and Surya were married in Bali in 1986 and continue
to live there half the year. Their company, Danu Enterprises is located in
Capitola, California.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
