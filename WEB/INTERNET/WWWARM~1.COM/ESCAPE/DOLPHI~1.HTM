<H2>The Escape</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>There is a unique blend of fascination and interactive learning to be found
in dolphin to human contact. Those on the cutting edge of the healing arts have
suggested that close encounters with these complex and wondrous creatures can
assist in the development of stress control techniques essential for a healthy
life-styles. </H3>
<H3>During this tropical island getaway you will have the rare chance to swim,
frolic and just be with the remarkable dolphins of Dolphin Discovery, Mexico's
newest marine mammal facility. </H3>
<H3>Your accommodations are air conditioned and on the oceanfront. On day 1 you
will meet the dolphins and enjoy a feast on the beach to set the mood for a week
of elation and relaxation. Ample dock and water time is scheduled so that you
will have numerous chances to experience the thrill of hands-on contact with
gentle dolphins who are equally inquisitive and eager to play. </H3>
<H3>You will also have time to explore and snorkel the crystal clear waters
around Island Mujeres. You may also visit the Mayan ruin of Ixchel (Goddess of
the Moon.).</H3>
<H3>Quiet strolls along the beach and kicking around the quaint cobblestone
streets of the fishing village combined with the lure of the dolphins make this
an escape like no other!</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
