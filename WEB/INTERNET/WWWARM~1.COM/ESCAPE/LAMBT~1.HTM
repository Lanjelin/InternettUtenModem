<H4>March 3rd of 1996 marked the eleventh running of the Los Angeles Marathon
and the second running of the LA Marathon Bike Tour. Over 19,000 ran and over
11,000 rode. I don't know if other city marathons have a bike tour associated
with them, but if they don't, they should. For those who have run the marathon,
it's a great opportunity to experience the marathon from a new perspective --
the topography of L.A. reads differently when astride a bike than when pounding
the pavement.  For those who aren't runners, riding the bike tour gives a good
feeling for the excitement of running the marathon with only a modicum of the
work and commitment required to do so.</H4>

to start</I></CENTER>
<H4>One of the best features of L.A. is its racial and ethnic diversity. The
marathon is laid out to take advantage of it. Like in many large cities, we tend
to isolate ourselves from each other. Events like the marathon and the Olympics
bring us back together. I remember the 1984 Olympics which were held in Los
Angeles. The city was magic. Our personal space shrunk; we greeted and talked to
strangers (much like backpackers do when they meet on the trail); suspicion was
on hold. We were a community. I get the same feeling at each running of the
marathon. For a brief moment we are truly a melting pot. This is a moment to be
savored. It's too bad we can't do this every month even though the feeling would
probably change if we did.</H4>
<P></P>
<H4>The marathon organizers stressed that this was a &quot;bike tour&quot; and
not a &quot;race&quot;. This was to reduce liability but also to avoid the
potential carnage of a destruction derby that might ensue if 10,000+
not-necessarily-trained &quot;racers&quot; took to the streets. The tour/race
distinction was lost on more than a few. It's hard to pull in the reins when
given the streets of LA without cars and traffic lights.</H4>
<P></P>
<H4>The bike tour started at 6am on Hollywood Boulevard near Vine and headed
east. I got to the starting area at 5 AM; there were already several hundred
ahead of me. The mix was as diverse as LA itself -- seasoned cyclists with bikes
and outfits to match, cyclists riding two- seater bikes, a lot of mountain
bikers, a few persons on experimental and sitting-position cycles, a few retro
guys on high wheelers, and a lot of just plain folks riding a variety of bikes
from grunge to big-buck. The young, the old, the fit, the marginally fit - the
mix mirrored the marathon itself. </H4>
<P></P>
<H4>It was still dark at the start of the &quot;tour&quot;. Our mayor, who is
an avid cyclist, gave a brief speech and ended with something to the effect of &quot;Let's
get on with the race.&quot; Not a few of us in the crowd responded
tongue-in-cheek with &quot;'<I>tour</I>' not '<I>race</I>' -- '<I>tour</I>'.&quot;
I guess even our mayor got caught up in the spirit of the thing just like we
did. </H4>
<P></P>
<H4>So at 6am with the mayor, several elite cyclists and members of the LA
Wheelmen leading off, the tour began. Even at this early hour there were
musicians and spectators along the way to cheer us on. For me, the music, the
crowds, the spectacle and the shared experience are a large part of what the
marathon is all about. The bike tour is an opportunity for a lot of people who
aren't runners or volunteers to share the feeling. </H4>
<P></P>
<H4>This year the LA Marathon changed direction and starting point. It used to
start and finish near the coliseum; now it starts and ends in downtown LA. We
bikers actually began and ended our tour around mile 17 so as not to conflict
with the runners and wheelchair racers. This is probably a good idea but makes
it difficult on those who want to ride the tour and then run (or walk) the
marathon or 5K afterwards. </H4>
<P></P>
<H4>One of the advantages of a dawn start was the opportunity to ride as the
sun came up. The air was cool (in the low 60's) and slightly humid; dawn broke
with color. Last year was a different story -- we rode the slick streets of LA
in a light rain. Luckily, the rain god was appeased and LA got it's rain on
March 4th of this year instead.</H4>
<P></P>
<H4>You would think that with over 11,000 cyclists it would be a traffic jam
all the way. Surprisingly, that wasn't the case. After a few miles interspersed
with Metro Rail construction along Hollywood and Sunset boulevards, the crowd
thinned and it was relatively easy to ride safely at whatever pace you wished.
Los Angeles has wide streets along the route.</H4>

<P><I>At the finish, Hollywood &amp; Vine, Columbia Records Bldg. on the right</I></P>
<H4>In about an hour we got to the finish at Hollywood and Vine -- a loop of
around 21 miles. Looking back down Vine Street after the finish, I could see an
ocean of cyclists stretching back towards Wilshire Blvd. Maybe the real
accomplishment of this marathon bike tour was finding a way to get so many
people up before dawn to ride in a group around L.A. </H4>
<P></P>
<H4>Thus with rock music reverberating against the Capital Records building and
many more cyclists still to come in, I left the heart of Hollywood for home to
watch the elite runners on TV doing the course the hard way.</H4></BLOCKQUOTE>
