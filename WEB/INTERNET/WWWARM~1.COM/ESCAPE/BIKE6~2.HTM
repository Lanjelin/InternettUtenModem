<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Our Austin layover was delightful, but a day too long. Getting going again
was a bit tough. In Eastern Texas, we moved into pine forests - read: logging
trucks - which are still with here in Alabama. Some nice camping. A little rain.</H4>
<H4>Louisiana was different. To begin with, the roads are simply AWFUL. The
county backroads are better, but the state roads are quite simply not
maintained. The people, however, are quite wonderful, open and willing to
inquire. We were in Louisiana just two hours - on Easter Sunday** - when a
pickup truck pulled over in front of me; a pleasant-looking young man leaped
out, introduced himself, and invited us to his family home (which we'd just
passed) for Easter dinner. We spent three hours there and had a warm, wonderful
time with a delightful family. It was difficult to leave. The next day, in a
small town, we were interviewed for their weekly local &quot;Good News&quot;
program.</H4>
<H4>(<I>** We entered Texas on St. Patrick's Day, Sunday, and left it three
weeks later on Easter Sunday, after 1021.1 miles.)</I></H4>
<H4>And so went Louisiana. We were interviewed a second time in the eastern
portion of the state. We learned that, according to Louisianans themselves,
Louisiana has the crookedest government in the land. And the roads are lousy
because &quot;all the money goes into pockets.&quot;</H4>
<H4>Mississippi roads are MUCH better, though we have not had any shoulder to
speak of since Texas. Mississippi, where we are, is just as green and lush as
was Louisiana: forests, grasslands, GREEN. We changed course somewhat in
Mississippi to make allowances for bad weather moving through. In Lucedale last
night, we witnessed (from indoors) a giant gulf thunderstorm. HUGE bolts and
cracks of lightning, which I could see through my closed eyelids. Boombooms
which shook the building. Predictions of 3&quot; of rain PER HOUR. And some
areas did get that. So we dallied for a couple of hours this morning till we
were sure it was safe to set out. We don't mind getting wet, but riding through
an electrical storm is not something we wanted to do. But it didn't even rain on
us.</H4>
<H4>This was our second electrical storm. We have encountered all manner of
weather except snow, but so far none of it has delayed us - it yet may, but it
hasn't yet.</H4>
<H4>Tomorrow we will ride the ferry across four miles of the mouth of Mobile
Bay. The following day we enter Florida, for the last leg. We will have had two
nights in Mississippi and two nights in Alabama. There is no doubt that we look
like aliens wherever we go. Westerners are used to oddity. Texans didn't care.
Louisianans were open and inquiring. Mississippians were aloof and cool, and
almost judgmental. No read, yet, on Alabamians, though they do seem to be
willingly helpful.</H4>
<H4>I have begun to think seriously of home. I have a craving for good music,
for good bread, for good, solid, real, <B>unfried</B> food. (It's amazing how
good bad food can taste when one has ridden on empty for 30+ miles.) I want to
wake up in the same room day after day after day. I want to ride an unburdened
bike. I love this journey. I love the doing, the change, the constant newness.
And I love home; routine; belonging.</H4>

<P><STRONG>Three Nights Later: Crestview, Florida</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Can't really say much about Alabama, except that the roads are
good; still few shoulders, but the lanes are wider than in Louisiana. The bridge
to Dauphin Island is lovely. The island itself looks like Palm Springs with
conifers. Scrub palms grow directly below the pines. The ferry ride took 45
minutes, but not a soul chose to converse with us. We are into a tourist region
and people are very close. We camped in the Gulf Shores State Park, which is a
clean, green, lovely facility. Made a couple of friends there. Then on through
beachfront communities along the Gulf, which looked like beach communities
anywhere. </H4>
<H4>Into the state of Florida on 17 April, after 2247 miles. First stop in
Pensacola was a bike shop: in Mississippi, after 2100 miles, I finally had my
first flat tire since my threads had gotten too thin. So I got new tires in
Pensacola. Had I done so in Austin as I had intended, I'd have done the whole
trip flat-free. But the mechanic there insisted the tires could easily finish
the trip and I chose to believe him. He was wrong - due, in large part I'm sure
- to the lousy roads in Louisiana. </H4>
<H4>We are once again dodging thunderstorms. We really thought we'd have sun
all through the South, but -boy- were we wrong. This morning we couldn't leave
til 10AM, though we did not get any rain til five minutes after we finished the
day's increment.</H4>
<H4>We still have about 8-9 riding days left, depending on the weather, of
course. But we have done a full projection for the remaining miles, and have
purchased return tickets.</H4>
<H4>I will arrive home on 29 April, two months to the day since I left home.
Also, a week or two sooner than I anticipated. With luck, that will give us a
day or two to snoop around St. Augustine. But that's our cushion for the
unknowns of the weather.</H4>

<P><STRONG>This is Bunni's last fedex to us from the road. In a few days she
will follow up with a description of the last days of the trip, what it feels
like to actually <I>finish</I>, and hopefully a perspective on the entire
adventure. So check back to Armchair World for the conclusion to &quot;Ocean to
Ocean on Two Wheels&quot;!  (AW)</STRONG></P>
