<H3>Here's an adventure that you could take next year. For now, sit back and
fantasize. </H3></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>Like &quot;sails on a sea of grass.&quot; This description of covered
wagons inspired the name &quot;<I>Prairie Schooner</I>.&quot; Venture into the
past and relive the experiences of early pioneers who expanded the nation's
frontiers.

<H2>The Escape</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Imagine.. You are met in Jackson, Wyoming and transported to the wagon
trail. At the call &quot;roll the wagons,&quot; the Prairie Schooners line out
for the trek along the back roads of the Targhee National Forest, located
between Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park. Gentle riding
horses are available for those who would like to ride in rotation with other
guests. </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="WAGONBFT.GIF" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/escape/wagonbft.gif" ALIGN="TOP">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The wagons travel to a new camp each day. You spend two evenings on the
shores of high mountain lakes, home of the Loon and the Trumpeter Swan. Moose,
elk and deer are passing visitors. The wagons form a circle to signal that camp
has been reached. </H3>
<H3>At the camps you will have plenty of time to take nature hikes, swim,
horseback ride, canoe, or just relax. Your evenings will be spent singing with
the cowboys around the campfire and listening to yarns about the Old West. 
</H3>
<H3>And food.. Enjoy tasty meals prepared in Dutch ovens over an open fire.
When you wake up in the morning, the smell of coffee and bacon sizzling is a
great enticement to get up and start the day.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>This trip into the Old West is run by the Jackson Hole Teton Country Wagon
Train. Teton Country Wagon Train is owned by Bill Thomas, who with his three
sons, provide the personal attention and service which have made them one of the
best outfitters in the Jackson Hole area. Western hospitality is a way of life
for the Thomas family. This heritage dates back to 1854 when &quot;Uncle Nick&quot;
Wilson as a boy of 12 passed through Jackson Hole with the Shoshone Indians.
</H3>
<H3>&quot;Uncle Nick&quot; or &quot;yaghaki&quot; as he was known to the
indians, was Bill Thomas's great grandfather. He was adopted by Washakie, chief
of the Shoshone, and lived with them for two years. In later years Uncle Nick
rode for the Pony Express and drove for the Overland Stage.</H3>
<H3>In 1889 Uncle Nick drove the first covered wagons over Teton Pass into
Jackson Hole, and the town of Wilson still bears his name. This personal covered
wagon experience could not be led by a more experienced family. When you are
ready to try this adventure for real, contact the Thomas family at:</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
