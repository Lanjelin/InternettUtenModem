<LI><STRONG> The many small phone companies that serve the outlying areas
charge 25-cents in a pay phone just to call the operator or an 800 number. In
Del Rio I found a situation where the pay phone in the gas station on my side of
the highway required a quarter, but the phone in the station <I>right across
the street</I> did not, being a different company.
</STRONG><P></P></LI>
<LI><STRONG> One warm day on the way to Sanderson, we planned a lunch break at
a picnic area listed on the map and arrived there to find it full of campers and
trailers. Pooey, we thought (euphemistically). It turned out to be seven people
in four vehicles from Michigan, travelling together, who made room for us AND
fed us royally from their well-stocked galleys in return for our stories of the
road.
</STRONG><P></P></LI>
<LI> <STRONG>Our longest day to date - and hopefully the whole trip - was an
89.88 mile haul through the desert, a wide-open-spaces necessity since there was
nothing in between.
</STRONG><P></P></LI>
<LI><STRONG> About ten miles before Uvalde, on a COLD, wet day, I found a
tootsie roll in the bottom of my handlebar bag, and suddenly knew I wouldn't
make it to town unless I ate it. It was frozen solid. In the softening and
gnawing stage I pulled out a gold inlay in the tootsie goo, and stashed it
carefully. Once dry and reclothed, I looked up dentists in the Uvalde Yellow
Pages and found five - three within a mile of the motel, and two further afield.
That narrowed the choice. The three had offices right next to each other. Being
totally objective, I called the one whose name I liked best. The receptionist
said, &quot;Sure, y'all come on over at 5 o'clock and we'll put that thing back
in for you.&quot; It was 4:30. I did (&quot;Turn right at Church's Chicken&quot;).
They did. For a pittance. Wow.
</STRONG><P></P></LI>
<LI><STRONG> In Van Horn we connected with another cyclist whom we'd initially
met on our second day out. He's from Prince George, British Columbia. For the
next eight days we played leap-frog. He'd get ahead and then take a rest day or
some such. We shared several meals. Since may of the towns have only one or two
motels, the odds were good that we'd keep connecting. Our paths have finally
diverged, however, as we head north to Austin. We saw him last in Bandera.
</STRONG><P></P></LI>
<LI><STRONG> The &quot;convenience store&quot; stuff that we're sometimes
stuck with is more than offset by the good country-cookin' cafe fare. In
Bracketville I scarfed down a bowl of oatmeal, a side of hash browns, a donut,
and two cups of cocoa. $3.24 total.
</STRONG><P></P></LI>
<LI><STRONG> At one point along the road, a <B><I>small</I></B> dog - maybe
twice the size of a Chihuahua <B><I>at most</I></B> - came charging and
yapping across the depth of his yard toward me. I wasn't concerned because there
was a full cattle grate across his driveway and he was - well - so small. But,
believe it or not, he cleared the cattle grate in two - yes <B><I>two</I></B>
- leaps, landing and pushing off again from one of the middle bars with what
must be VERY well-practiced agility. I mean, he was <B><I>so</I></B> small he
probably would fall <B><I>between</I></B> the grate bars if he were parallel
to them. So yes, he came after me. No threat.
