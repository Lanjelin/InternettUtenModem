<H4>The &quot;Bobobs&quot; rode into town last week, on their way from the
Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean on bicycles. You read it right - bicycles! 
</H4>
<H4>They named themselves Bobobs: &quot;Batty old broads on bicycles&quot;,
these two middle aged ladies from California. Bunni Zimberoff of Santa Rosa is
55; her bike mate, Carolyn Walker of Pismo Beach is 60.  </H4>
<H4>It was, in fact, Carolyn's approaching 60th birthday that prompted the
trip. &quot;I wanted to do something challenging to mark that milestone,&quot;
she said. A three thousand one hundred thirty five mile trip on a 22 speed bike
will certainly cover her goal. </H4>
<H4>Bunni, her partner on the road, answered an ad Carolyn had in the national
bicycling magazine and after months of telephone calls, took up the challenge.
Both Bunni and Carolyn have grown children and Carolyn is a grandmother. </H4>
<H4>Both have found that the outward journey has also been an inward one. &quot;I
can't believe how naive we were&quot;, said Bunni. &quot;It has been more than
we imagined.&quot; </H4>
<H4>Carolyn added, &quot;It's true, some of our friends and family thought we
were batty to even attempt this, but it has, so far, been going so well.&quot;
</H4>
<H4>The biggest problem? Finding bathrooms! They have stayed some in motels and
have also camped out. They have been freezing cold at times and were grateful
for the mild weather in the deep South. </H4>
<H4>The biggest surprise? &quot;The friendliness of the people&quot;, both said
in unison. For example: &quot;We were warned about Louisiana - warned to be
extra careful. But two hours after we crossed into the state, a man in a pickup
truck drove up besides us and invited us to have Easter dinner with his family!
They were wonderful and friendly. It's been like that almost every where we go.&quot;
</H4>
<H4>I was puzzled as to how they happened to come through Franklinton which is
certainly &quot;off the beaten track&quot;. The fact is that a route published
in the Bike Travel Association guide runs right through The Fair City, from
California to Florida. It traces the shortest route from ocean to ocean. </H4>
<H4>Travel maps, instructions and tips are meticulously explained in the
Bicycle Travel Association manual. For example, riding conditions from St.
Helena to Washington Parishes are as follows: &quot;After Tangipahoa, SR 440 has
a good riding surface and becomes hilly. The route leaves SR 440 briefly to
avoid a dangerous stretch of roadway. At the junction of SR 10/16/25 west of
Franklinton, the route becomes a very busy high speed 2-lane road  with no
shoulders. Traffic picks up again after quiet SR 1072 as the route enters
Bogalusa on SR 60. Bogalusa is a working town. The streets can be narrow and
very busy during rush hours...&quot; </H4>
<H4>Also noted in the same brochure is the Washington Parish Free Fair and
Bogalusa's Festival in the Park for those traveling in October. </H4>
<H4>The Bobobs departed Franklinton just after noon. From here they continued
on to Bogalusa, Poplarville, Gulf Shores, and  over into Florida where they will
ride to the Atlantic Ocean, via St. Augustine, a journey they expect to take at
least three or four more weeks. They had been on the road six weeks when they
rode into Franklinton. </H4>
<H4>And the wind was not always at their backs...</H4>
<H4>&quot;We have learned so much already,&quot; said Bunni. &quot;Not just the
obvious lessons, but also inward ones. You tend to do a lot of inward
reflections when you are out here.&quot; Carolyn agreed. &quot;The challenge has
been more than rough terrain, fatigue, cold, heat, and whatever. It's also been
a challenge to find out who we are....&quot; </H4>
<H4>They may call themselves &quot;batty old broads on bicycles&quot;, but
these courageous and adventuresome ladies have proven they can meet life with or
without the wind at their backs.</H4>
<H4>Or enough bathrooms!</H4>
<P><STRONG><I>(Era-Leader Ed. Note: Bunni sent the Era-Leader a card dated
April 25. She wrote, &quot;We Did  It! We Did It! We actually got here and were
ahead of schedule to boot. I think often and warmly of the brief visit we had
with you and of the questions I wish I'd asked your. Once I get settled in a
home, I'll send a note. But at this point I want to thank you for your interest
in us, and for your wonderful contribution to our experience.&quot;     </I></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
