<H3>Consider an expedition into Southern Ethiopia where you can meet  the
tribal peoples of the Omo River Valley. </H3></CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>The Escape</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Omo River Valley is still a virgin environment where tribal traditions
have remained unchanged. The women still dress in elaborately decorated skins
and the men celebrate adulthood with special colored hair buns.
</H3>
<H3>Meet the<B> Mursi</B> tribe whose women wear huge lip plates and whose men
participate in ritualistic stick dueling; the <B>Hamar</B> women, among the
most beautiful in East Africa and whose various metal ornaments indicate their
marital status; the <B>Karo</B>, known for their body painting and erotic
dancing; and other tribes like the <B>Tsamai, Bana, Erbore, Konso, Gabbra and
Borana</B>, with equally fascinating customs.</H3>
<H3>And you'll delight in the unexpected richness of southern Ethiopia's
classical African wildlife as you travel through the lakes and parks of the
great <B>Rift Valley. </B>Nights are spent camping alongside the tribal
peoples.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Turtle Tours began 10 years ago with trips into the Sahara Desert. That
initial passion for the Sahara has evolved into an equally intense interest for
the nomadic and tribal peoples of the Sahara and for tribal peoples all over the
world. Turtle tours has been featured in Arthur Frommer's Travel Television
Show, Fodor's Guides to North Africa and South America, and has most recently
guided a Reader's Digest film crew for a television documentary on the Sahara.
Irma Turtle, the director of Turtle Tours, is currently writing a book on the
role of ritual in tribal preservation.</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
