<H1>The 1997 Los Angeles Marathon Bike Tour III</H1></CENTER>

<P><STRONG>March 2nd  marked the twelfth  running of the Los Angeles Marathon
and the third running of the LA Marathon Bike Tour. This year just under 20,000
runners ran the Marathon and over 12,000 cyclists participated in the Bike Tour.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Over the last two years the marathon course  has been getting
easier while the bike tour course has been getting more difficult. I like it
that way.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG> In 1995 the bike tour essentially followed the route of the
marathon, starting near the coliseum and ending at USC. A challenge for runners
and a minor obstacle for cyclists was the uphill grade from downtown to
Hollywood Blvd through the Silverlake District.</STRONG></P>
<P> <STRONG>In 1996 the marathon route was  changed and reversed, turning the
challenging Silverlake up-grade into the piece-of-cake Silverlake down-grade. To
reduce potential runner/cyclist conflicts, the bike tour started on Hollywood
Blvd at Mile 17 and finished on a gentle upgrade at Hollywood and Vine well away
from the start and finish of the marathon. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>1997 saw yet another change in the marathon route - aimed at
further easing the grades and lowering the times. The bike tour route was also
changed - but for other purposes. This year the tour started at Universal
Studios, crossed over Cahuenga Pass into Hollywood and ended up back at
Universal after an approximately 23 mile ride. This kept the cyclists
geographically and temporally  isolated from the runners, walkers and
wheel-chair racers. The re-routing also yielded a prolonged up grade to the
finish. Having ridden in all three bike tours, I like the increased difficulty
of this latest route and hope the organizers keep it for a few years. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I arrived at Universal Studios about 4:45AM, parked on Ventura
Blvd. and rode to the staging area. There were already about 300-400 cyclists in
front of me. We were staged on a dark downgrade connecting to an access road
beside the Hollywood Freeway. As we waited we could see the steadily increasing
flow of bike-laden cars approaching the offramp to Universal. The moral is - &quot;With
12,000 like-minded and not necessarily well-trained cyclists to ride with  -
<I>Get There Early</I></STRONG>.&quot; </P>

of the Bike Tour</I> <BR><STRONG>At about 5:30 we all rode downhill along the
access road to the start of the bike tour on Cahuenga Blvd - about a mile away.
There we waited until about 6 A.M when the tour officially started. A contingent
of LA Wheelmen, CORBA and LAPD cyclists led the pack -  a tradition aimed at
keeping speeds below 15 mph until the pack thins out. </STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>The first part of the new route had a lot of down grades which
tended to get the cyclists spread out quickly and out of each others' way. In
spite of the large number of participants with varying skill levels, I would be
surprised if there were   many accidents during the bike tour. In the three
years I've done the tour I've only seen one minor accident.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The new route courses over Cahuenga into Hollywood; runs down a
bumpy Hollywood Blvd toward downtown; traverses Virgil to Wilshire past McArthur
Park;  runs along Union, Venice and Figueroa;  passes the 707 jet  incongruously
and permanently parked next to the Museum of Science and Industry;  winds around
the Coliseum; heads up Exposition, Rodeo, Crenshaw and  Wilshire; continues
along Rossmore and Vine to Hollywood Blvd. ; and passes over Cahuenga for the
return  to Universal Studios and the finish. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>What sets this bike tour apart from the earlier ones is the upgrade
toward the end of the tour. After crossing Hollywood Blvd you've got about 2-1/2
miles of rather steady upgrade on Cahuenga to the finish near the entrance of
Universal City Walk. If this were a race rather than a tour,  it would probably
be decided in this ending stretch.</STRONG></P>

the Finish </I></P>
<P><STRONG>I like the  bike tour. It makes the marathon experience accessible
to more people without stealing any thunder from the the runners and wheel-chair
racers. I like watching the sun slowly come up as the tour progresses. I like
the feeling of a bicycle free-for-all with no cars allowed. I like the shared
energy. It's not quite the same shared energy you feel when you are running the
marathon but it's there in its own way.  I like the reaction of the people
watching along the route. And I like the geographic and ethnic diversity of this
city which isn't as apparent from behind the wheel of a car as from the seat of
a bike on Marathon Sunday. </STRONG></P>
