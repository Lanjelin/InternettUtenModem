<P><STRONG>Some people see the cup as half full, others see it as half empty.
The way we travel is a litmus test that decisively tells which type we are.
Stephen sees the cup as half full. He had read the brochures and done his
research into Copper Canyon - Mexico's Grand Canyon. He didn't find what he had
expected but found much more. We hope you enjoy his writing as much as we do. We
are eagerly awaiting his next adventure or perhaps a recounting of a past trip &quot;off
the beaten path.&quot; (AW)</STRONG></P>

<CENTER><H3>Trekking in Copper Canyon</H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><H4>The reports seemed too good to be true! The travel brochures
too colorful to be real (scenes vaguely reminiscent of the lush greenery of the
South Pacific). The information that I read alluded to a venture reminiscent of
the &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, definitely a place too exciting to ignore.
So I left Los Angeles for Los Mochis, Mexico (on the coast of the Gulf of
California), to travel by train 9 hours to Creel, to reach the interior of
Chihuahua and the entrance to the Grand Canyon of Mexico - Barranca del Cobre -
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre - Sierra Tarahumara!</H4></BLOCKQUOTE>  
<BLOCKQUOTE><H4>I was eager to see fantastic sights! To explore legendary
cities! To witness the culture of the Tarahumara Indians. To be absorbed in a
land that time had forgotten! I was going to explore where few people had gone
before-The Mysterious Copper Canyon- and discover an untapped wilderness BEFORE
it was discovered by the tourist industry. </H4>
<H4>I left, I saw, and I returned. Was I disappointed?  Well, let's say the
hype never equaled the reality. The tourist industry HAD discovered Copper
Canyon. It hadn't rained much in the region for the past three years so the
tropical look of the brochures was difficult to find (My trip took place over a
8 day period in early April-just after the rainy season). I never saw a
Tarahumara Indian even jogging, let alone running. NOTE: The information on the
Tarahumarans consistently referred their great feats of running endurance - &quot;They
run and never tire!&quot;.</H4>
<H4>BUT the trip was the unique experience I had hoped for.</H4>
<H4>Copper Canyon has something to offer for all ages and budgets and getting
there was an experience in itself. After arriving in Los Mochis late Saturday
evening and negotiating, in limited Spanish, a taxi ride to the heart of the
city, I encountered my first problem. I wasn't able to purchase an advance
ticket for the train ride to Creel and was told IF I wanted to ensure a ticket,
I needed to be at the Los Mochis train station at 4:30 a.m. The &quot;first
class&quot; train left at 6:00 a.m. (Cost in U.S. about $15.00). The &quot;second
class&quot; train left an hour later but stopped at almost every city (9 hours
would become 12 hours)- That was it for trains leaving that day. Needless to
say, if I missed the first class train my trip schedule would have been
seriously jeopardized.</H4>
<H4>By 5:00 A.M. the train station was alive with activity, including a
multitude of kids, families, pets, and at least enough supplies next to the
above to sustain a family of four for a month. The bustle of activity, however,
did not extend to the ticket booth. This, and the fact that there appeared to be
at least 500 people waiting for the &quot;few&quot; available first class train
seats, heightened my anxiety and caused minor heart palpitations. One of my
traveling companions through guile and ingenuity was positioned close to the
ticket window for at least an hour and a half. The window opened right on time
(at 6:20- more panic) but <I>no problem</I>. The hordes of people at the
station were waiting for the second class train.</H4>
<H4>By 6:30 we were on our way and the brochure pictures were dancing in my
mind. A look out the train window sobered me instantly. For at least the next
ten miles I saw the shacks of thousands of poor people living next to the
railroad tracks. It was truly depressing to see so many families living it what
appeared to be dire poverty waving at &quot;the first class train&quot;.</H4>
<H4>One thing I should point out about the railroad is that the persistent
reports of 19th century style train robberies are greatly exaggerated. I felt
very comfortable with the ever present armed guard who patrolled the cars and
the fact that at EACH rail stop  machine gun toting soldiers were always
visible. What, me worry?  </H4>
<H4>The Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad was not quite (I learned to use this
phrase quite a bit on this trip) as spectacular as the brochures indicated. For
example, &quot;The Chihuahua al Pacifico is the most spectacular train ride in
North America in terms of scenery and sheer engineering marvels&quot;. The
engineering marvel comment is probably accurate. (My engineering background is
limited to reading new car specifications). The length of track is about 400
miles, (Creel is the halfway point); the train traverses canyons and more
canyons (from sea level to 8,000 feet at its highest point), goes over a
multitude of bridges and through an even greater multitude of tunnels, and at
one point near Temoris, makes a 360 degree circle on its journey into and out of
the canyon.</H4>
<H4>Hanging out on the platforms between the cars, while not spectacular, is a
must. It was the best part of the train ride. Often the sides of the canyon
walls were so close to the tracks that I could touch the foliage of the trees.
And speeding into a tunnel while standing on the platform gave me an interesting
perspective on depth perception. </H4>

<H4>Railroad aficionados probably do use the term spectacular while describing
the railroad; and I'm sure many rail aficionados come to this area just to ride
the train and revel in the engineering that went into building the railroad. 
The scenery, however, was not &quot;awe inspiring&quot; but it did have its
moments, especially at Temoris and Divisadero. Divisadero is the first major
stop (the half-way point) and the view is spectacular. It is also major
sightseeing stop and the first real look &quot;into the Grand Canyon of Mexico&quot;.
The views are unobstructed (except for camera fanatics). This is also your first
chance to buy hand-made baskets from the Tarahumara Indians (women) dressed in a
kaleidoscope of color. It seems that the further I got from Los Mochis, the more
&quot;traditional&quot; the scene became. A short 15 minutes later it was back
on the train and more bridges, tunnels, shrubs and armed guards.</H4>
<H4>Before you could say, &quot;Nine Hours!&quot;, we were at Creel. Creel is a
great city, with a beautiful church and a surprising calmness that transcends
the area. It also is a far cry from the urban centered Los Mochis. In Creel the
local population is friendly, the traffic limited, the restaurants good, and the
scenery inspiring. We had arrived.</H4>
<H4>Our first stop, before backpacking and camping in the local area, was the
Pension Creel. I can heartily recommend this restored hacienda style Bed and
Breakfast ($45.00). The rooms are spacious and the food was excellent. The price
was also very reasonable compared to the &quot;big bucks&quot; charged by the
Lodge at Creel ($250.00 per night, per person, food and outings included. Did I
forget to mention the 5 night minimum?). </H4>
<H4>The Pension Creel also has its own guide service to various points of
interest (additional cost). Another reasonable motel was the Cascada Inn
($35.00) which also has its own guide service (additional cost). By far the most
reasonable motel in Creel is the Casa de Margarita's ($15.00, with breakfast and
dinner included). Yes, the Margarita has its own guide service (additional
cost). The Margarita is a favorite spot for backpackers, students, low budget
travelers, and those who like few amenities - but it's better than a tent. </H4><IMG

<CENTER><I>Church in Batopilas</I></CENTER>
<H4>There are good hiking opportunities around Creel. For starters and to
acclimate yourself to the area, I would suggest a day hike, first to the
cemetery (of historical interest), next to the Mission San Ignacio, and then
into the surrounding canyons (through Tarahumara ranchitos). Stay on the main
road and you don't need a guide. The views are wonderful.</H4>
<H4>Be sure to skip the visit to a cave home just outside of Creel; in the
backcountry it would be a point of high interest; 2 miles outside of town with
tour busses lined up, it's degrading.</H4>
<H4>There are good camping areas located at Arareco Lake, about 8 miles outside
of town. You can hitchhike there in almost perfect safety-or walk on the well
paved road. Hitchhiking is very easy since the local population is not worried
about crime. I never worried about crime in either Creel or the surrounding
area. (It's great to feel safe).</H4>
<H4>A quick note regarding points of local interest in the Creel area: There
are about 8 major half day and full day tours available leaving from Creel. If
you like &quot;packaged&quot; tours, they're easy to schedule; however, with a
little ingenuity, it's easy to create your own &quot;tour package&quot;.  All
you need is a description of the area, a &quot;little&quot; Spanish, and an
adventurous spirit. If you want to spend money, everything can be done for you.
In fact, you can also be transported (by car) at the end of any paid tour to all
local Indian craft stores. Of course, you can walk there by yourself for free.
By the way, Tarahumara basketry is well-crafted, inexpensive and often recently
made. Collecting baskets is essential on any trip to Copper Canyon.</H4>
<H4>Important Note: Buy more baskets than you think you need! Consider baskets
like film - Don't economize! </H4>
<H4>&quot;Areas&quot; I would recommend to explore around Creel include: </H4>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>The Waterfall at Cusarare (33 miles from Creel):</STRONG> a great
hitchhike and day hike from Creel (all day trip). Don't forget to visit the
Mission at Cusarare. Throughout this trip, I was fascinated by the missions and
churches I visited. The church architecture is a link to the past and if you
enjoy photography, the buildings offer countless opportunities to get in touch
with your &quot;Ansel Adams&quot; inner-self.
</LI>
<LI> <STRONG>The Hot Spring of Recohuata (22 miles from Creel with at least
one hour by car on a dirt road):</STRONG> this all day trip involves a hike down
the canyon, a Tarahumara &quot;toll&quot; booth, and reasonable hot springs -
don't expect steam. 
</LI>
<LI><STRONG> La Bufa (130 miles from Creel; all day):</STRONG> You need a tour
service and about $40.00; I wouldn't recommend hitchhiking - but it can be done
for a few pesos. Great views of the canyon. If you are planning to go to
Batopilas (and you should), skip La Bufa - it's redundant.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG> The Basasechic Water Fall (174 miles from Creel):</STRONG> This
is a real waterfall - 13th tallest in the world. $65.00. I never got there but
the locals are impressed with the area.
</LI>
<LI> <STRONG>Batopilas (174 miles from Creel):</STRONG> $65.00. This is a
must; you descend almost 8,000 feet (the last 80 or 90 miles on a dirt, one
lane, hair-pin, sheer drop-off-the-cliff, trip to a historic copper mining town.
You can negotiate a ride down, take the bus, or hitchhike down. But remember you
have to get back up the same way you came. This excursion is not for the faint
of heart or those who will not ride in a car unless you can chip diamonds in
perfect comfort. It was all too common for us to come around a blind curve and &quot;confront&quot;
a car, bus, or mini-van assuming that they had the right of way. When you are on
the drop-off side of the cliff (about 3,000 feet straight down) and on a dirt
road, hitting your brakes and skidding gently to the exposed side, is a
disquieting experience.

<CENTER><I>On the road to Batopilas with donkey</I></CENTER>
<H4>Batopilas is a two or three day visit with excellent camping possibilities
on the river or even at the non-restored, but historic hacienda San Miquel.
Don't be surprised if you share the hacienda with cows and chickens.  </H4>
<H4>Batopilas also has an unique mission - Mission Satevo. This is a great day
hike (8 miles round trip). The mission is a combination of many conflicting
styles and the interior is of special interest. By the way, there are a number
of great full and half-day hikes in the area. The aqueduct trail, with stream
crossings, can be hiked for as long or as short as you like. This also is true
of the Arroyo las Minas and Arroya Huinolito trails (refer to a good guide book
- you don't need a guide!).</H4>
<H4>For inexpensive accommodations, the Hotel Mary is a great place to stay
($8.00); in fact, the clientele and the ambience reminded me of a Hemingway
novel. For just $250.00 per night you can stay at the historic Riverside Inn;
it's a great place to visit (cost free). </H4>
<H4>For anyone interested in the Creel area, any good tour book will provide
all the information needed to plan a trip. If you plan to backpack for any
length of time, you DO need a guide. Maps are somewhat useless in the area
because there are about 10 million Tarahumara trails crisscrossing the area. The
10 million figure is not hyperbole.</H4>
<H4>On our return to Creel, it was time once again to go through the &quot;railroad
drill&quot;. (1) We couldn't purchase tickets in advance; (2) The train was
full; (3) Start lining up at the ticket booth early! and (4) The on-time train
(which was leaving Creel at noon) was 2 hours late. </H4>
<H4>What does this mean?: &quot;9 hours plus 2 hours, equals Los Mochis at
midnight.&quot; Adversity does have it's advantages. The late arrival forced us
to stop at El Fuerte instead of Los Mochis (we saved about 2 hours). The
colonial town of El Fuerte is historical, beautiful, and a MUST on any Copper
Canyon trip. The cathedral was inspiring, the central square was magnificent,
and the town itself a treasure.   </H4>
<H4>After a day in El Fuerte, we took a local bus to Los Mochis, a taxi to the
airport, and without incident, home to Los Angeles. </H4>
<H4>I thought I would add a few interesting points about traveling to Copper
Canyon during the Easter season. It's a great time to be in Mexico!</H4>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>The Drums:</STRONG> The Tarahumarans are a deeply religious people
and they have retained a number of Indian customs to accommodate their
Catholicism. During Easter, the pounding of &quot;authentic&quot; Tarahumara
drums (also available at the craft stores), takes on a religious significance.
We could hear the pounding throughout the day and night. Please do not confuse
pounding with music. However, the sound of &quot;distant drums&quot; did have a
certain mystical quality when hiking the canyons.    
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>The Tarahumara Dress:</STRONG> The Tarahumarans are more apt to
congregate in town during Easter week. It's quite a sight to see these gentle
people in their traditional colored skirts and blouses.  
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>The Combo:</STRONG> We were able to see a group of Tarahumara boys
and men, each with their own drum, dancing in circles in the main street of
Creel. The point is that during Easter, you are going to see local color.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>The Crafts:</STRONG> At almost every location, Tarahumara women
are visible selling native basketry. Every location could easily be on the dirt
road to Batopilas, any tour destination, in front of the town square, etc. This
is intensified during Easter.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>The Easter Chorale:</STRONG> Who would have thought that being in
church on a Tuesday night in Creel would have resulted in one of the most
memorable concert experiences I can remember? Three choirs (from Chihuahua),
each with a choral director and at least 30 members, performed for almost 3
hours (non-stop). The spiritual nature of the performance and the competence of
the groups was extraordinary. This unexpected event was definitely a highlight
of the trip.
