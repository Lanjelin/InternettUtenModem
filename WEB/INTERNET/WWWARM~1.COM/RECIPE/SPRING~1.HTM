<P><STRONG>The Cold Springs Tavern was originally a stagecoach stop on San
Marcos Pass between the Santa Ynez Valley and Santa Barbara, California. While
the stagecoaches are long gone, the tavern is still here serving great  and
hearty meals in the same rustic building that has stood for over 100 years. 
</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>The Armchair folks have tried this chili at the Tavern and really
like it. It is reminiscent of the black bean soups served in Haiti and the
Dominican Republic -- however with a twist -- it's chili. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The Cold Springs Tavern has reduced the recipe to a manageable size
for home use. While wild game is recommended, you can substitute a variety of
meats (chicken, turkey, beef) and cuts to your taste. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As with all chili recipes, experiment and modify the recipe to your
liking.</STRONG></P>
