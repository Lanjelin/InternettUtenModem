<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>&quot;Wine is a beverage of pleasure,&quot; Andre Tchelistcheff
told a <I>New York Times</I> writer some years ago.  &quot;It is a mistake to
over analyze wine.  Ask a European what's in Haut-Brion.  He'll say, 'I don't
know.'  He's buying wine, not technology.&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Mr. Tchelistcheff, who died in 1994 at the age of 92, was one of
America's most celebrated wine makers.  Born in Russia and educated in France,
he became wine maker at Beaulieu Vineyard in California's Napa Valley in 1938. 
He pioneered cold fermentation and malolactic fermentation in American wine and
produced some of the world's greatest cabernet sauvignon at Beaulieu before
retiring in 1973 to become a roving consultant, for Beaulieu and other wineries.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Mr. Tchelistcheff was still at Beaulieu when I worked there as a
cellarman during a fall harvest.  I got to know him only slightly, but his
presence, and his reputation as a legend in American wine, gave a sense of pride
and purpose to my work of shoveling pomace from the bottom of 10,000-gallon
fermentation tanks.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>There was a feeling, shared I think by most of the cellarmen, that
somewhere at the end of our daily sweat would be a world-class wine.  The pay
was good, and our labor wasn't being squandered on generic bulk burgundy or
run-of-the-mill Napa cabernet.  Even corporate distiller Heublein, which bought
Beaulieu in 1969, wasn't tampering with the Private Reserve.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>For all his celebrity status and the trickle-down pride he
generated, Mr. Tchelistcheff didn't seem a prima donna or dictatorial master of
the realm--at least not from my perspective as a low man on the totem pole.  He
seemed intense and energetic, but approachable, a star you could talk to--if you
weren't asking a stupid question.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>His comments to the <I>New York Times</I> remind me of an anecdote
I heard about him.  Mr. Tchelistcheff, a long-time heavy smoker, once quit
smoking.  After a short while, however, he started again because his wine
tasting had suffered.  His renowned palate had apparently grown accustomed to
tobacco.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I don't know how true that story is, but for me it illustrates how
personal and idiosyncratic wine tasting and appreciation can be.  It may be
nice, drinking a glass of wine, to know about vintage and soil, fermentation
temperature and residual sugar.  But, as Mr. Tchelistcheff implied, such
knowledge is no substitute for passion.</STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
