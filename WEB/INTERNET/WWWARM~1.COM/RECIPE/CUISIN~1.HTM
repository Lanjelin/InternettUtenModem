<P><STRONG><I>Armchair Cuisine</I> is an exploration of culture, memories and
experience through the medium of food and wine. Here we have brought our sense
of exploration from the outside world into the cyber kitchen. Continue your
explorations by experimenting with the recipes you find here. Experience a
by-gone era through the senses of taste and smell. Share your experiences by
submitting one of your own recipes. Reminisce by comparing your experiences and
recipes with some of ours. </STRONG></P>

<P><B>We all have associations of food and wine with time, place and memory.
In this section we present short essays and  recipes that might tap into a
common consciousness. </B>

history</A></H2>
<P><STRONG>This section  contains essays, lore,  facts and fiction about food
and wine.  We lead off with  &quot;Thoughts on Wine&quot; a column by our new
wine author, Louis Guida.  We also present a brief essay on sourdough starters -
a mainstay ingredient in the larders of 19th century settlers during their
migration west. Starters are a &quot;secret ingredient&quot; of some of our
finest chefs.</STRONG></P>
