<H1>Baked Kibbe</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><B>This dish was featured at the Stardew - a wonderful little Lebanese
restaurant in Westwood (part of Los Angeles). This was a family  affair run with
love by brother Larry Nahas and his sisters, Sadie and Marcia. Sadie did all the
cooking, Marcia served and Larry made sure everything ran smoothly. Doris Day
was one of their regular customers. <BR><BR>Aside from kibbe, the restaurant
featured  other Lebanese delicacies such as fatayer, kusa meshee, meshee areesh,
and of course shish-kabob. <BR><BR>While the restaurant has been closed since
1978, sisters Sadie and Marcia are keeping the Stardew's memory alive and have
been kind enough to share this recipe with us. </B>

<P></P>
<P>Sadie suggests that you serve the kibbe with a cucumber salad and rice. A
simple cucumber salad can be made by combining sliced cucumbers, yogurt, a
little garlic powder or fresh mashed garlic, a pinch of dried mint leaves, and a
touch of salt. Enjoy!</P>
