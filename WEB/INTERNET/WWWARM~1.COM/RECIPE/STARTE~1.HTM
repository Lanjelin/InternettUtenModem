<P><STRONG>What is a sourdough starter? It's a mixture of flour, water and a
yeast culture containing literally millions of lactobacilli. It acts as a
leavening and flavoring agent that is used to make great bread, pancakes,
waffles and biscuits. It's generally kept in a stoneware crock or plastic
container and is kept refrigerated between uses. On the night before you want to
make bread or pancakes, you take a cup of the starter from the crock, add more
water and flour, stir,  and then let the mixture sit in a warm place. The next
morning (with the mixture frothy and infused with a multitude of liberated
carbon dioxide bubbles), you put one cup of the mix back in the starter pot, and
use the rest to make your bread product. What you get will depend on the unique
makeup of your starter, the ingredients you add and the type of flour you use.
One thing is sure: the flavor and texture will be fantastic!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Starters have been around since the pyramids in Egypt were being
built. During the nineteenth century, settlers felt undernourished unless they
had an adequate supply biscuits and bread. The starter was required to make the
bread rise. Thus the starter pot was a necessary part of each cook's larder as
it made it possible to make bread while on the trail west. The term &quot;sourdough&quot;
arose to describe the frontier cook who religiously guarded his sourdough
starter and used it to make the daily bread. Starters have a history; we'll be
looking for personal accounts from the wagon trains and settlers and ranchers to
share with our Armchair Worlders.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Some of the best breads and pancakes you probably have ever had
were probably made using a starter. There is a story in Los Angeles about a
baker who made the best pumpernickel bread in the city. No one could copy it
because his starter was unique. As the story goes (which might be an urban myth)
he used to lock the starter in a safe each night to protect it - because all you
needed to do to copy the taste of his bread was to get some of his starter. The
other ingredients you could figure out. What you couldn't do is copy the exact
makeup of his starter - and thus reproduce the taste of his bread.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>One of our Armchair World staff has been making starter breads and
pancakes for a number of years.  One of his starters is over 15 years old. This
is a youngster in the starter world. We've heard of starters over 100 years old.
This is possible since if the starter is kept cold (it can even be frozen) and &quot;rejuvenated&quot;
occasionally, it is theoretically possible to &quot;keep it alive&quot; for
numerous generations. The starter could very well be the bonsai tree of the food
world.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>You might like to try the recipe for <A HREF="BAKE00~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/recipe/bake002.html">Amish
Friendship Bread. </A> It requires a starter,  takes several days to make, but
the taste is well worth it. We'll soon be putting other bread, bisquit and
pancake recipes on Armchair World that we've tried and found worth passing
along.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>So how does one get a starter? The first way is to get a friend who
has a starter going to give you a cup.  The second way is to get a packaged
sourdough starter that you &quot;activate&quot; with water and flour in your own
home. We've looked around and found an excellent sourdough starter; it's
reasonably priced and we can send it to you. We've also found an excellent book
on sourdough baking which should contain all the information you need to make
some of the most delicious breads, pancakes and muffins you've ever tasted.
