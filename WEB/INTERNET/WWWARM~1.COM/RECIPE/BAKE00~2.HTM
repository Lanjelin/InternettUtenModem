<H1>Amish Friendship Bread</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><B>This is a great idea for the holidays.  The recipe comes to us from Mrs.
Norma Condon of Los Angeles. The bread takes eight days to make and when you're
done you can give your friends a sample of the bread <I>and</I> the starter
that made it!</B></P>
<P><STRONG>This is a genuine starter bread. For those of you who have never
tasted pancakes or bread made with a live yeast starter, you are in for a treat.
The problem is that you need to have a cup of starter to begin this recipe. (See
our section on <A HREF="STARTE~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/recipe/starter.html">starters</A>  for more information.)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>If you know someone with a starter, you are in luck. For those of
you without access to a starter, we've looked around and found an excellent
sourdough starter that is in powder form and can be activated with flour and
water; it's reasonably priced and we can send it to you. We've also found an
excellent book on sourdough baking which should contain all the information you
need to make some of the most delicious breads, pancakes and muffins you've ever
tasted.
