<P><I>For those of us living in an urban/city environment, self defense is an
issue we should all be aware of. It speaks to self reliance, survival and
self-worth. Knowledge of self defense is enabling; it is knowing one's
limitations so that one can act appropriately in a given situation. (AW)  </I></P>

<H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Very few of us can say that we nor any of our friends, relatives,
or acquaintances have been free of violent crime. In fact recent surveys clearly
show that crime is of major concern to most of us.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Fortunately, most of us can learn ways of avoiding attacks which
will significantly reduce our chances of being violently confronted. Strategies
which keep us out of the way of attacks will be periodically discussed and
updated in this column. We will also be describing self-defense moves which can
be used to maximize our chances of survival once we are under attack. We will
update these items of information on a regular basis to give visitors to this
webpage the knowledge necessary to avoid becoming a statistic.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>And the statistics look grim!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, a violent crime
occurs every 21 seconds in the U.S. A Detroit or Los Angeles woman has a 30 to
40 percent chance of being raped. A San Francisco or Los Angeles man or woman
has close to a 50 percent chance of being a victim of aggravated assault.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Outside of the U.S. violent crime rates are generally considerably
lower. However, according to reports in non-American publications such as the
Sydney Morning Herald, the London Times, Der Spiegel, etc., violent crime rates
have risen to an extent sufficient to create considerable concern, discussion
and self-defense needs.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Cold crime reports and statistics don't address themselves to the
billions of dollars worth of medical expenses, time lost from work, legal costs
and the tremendous psychological toll for the victims, their friends and their
families. But a woman, even with minimal self-defense knowledge, who fights a
rapist has a 90 percent chance of escaping without a scratch or a bruise.
Likewise, a man with some fighting skills has an 85 percent chance of stopping
an attack.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The more strategies you use to fight back -- strategies such as
yelling, running, fighting -- the more likely it is that you will escape without
harm. And both men and women who stop an attack by fighting have fewer divorces,
spend less time with mental health professionals and resume their normal lives
much more quickly.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>You can reduce your chance of being harmed and assure your survival
by practicing the tested self-defense methods we will depict in this column. We
also suggest that you take classes offered in your area. We plan to alternate
between more difficult self-defense situations and less difficult ones as well
as advice about prevention.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Our first topic will deal  with a life and death attack which is
difficult -- but not impossible -- to defend oneself against.  It is a knife
attack where an assailant is threatening  to cut your throat from behind.</STRONG>

<P><B> In this first column Dr. Weiss addresses a situation which we hope we
never will find ourselves in. The point is that with <I>some</I> self-defense
training, you can increase your chances of surviving even the most drastic of
situations. Future articles will deal with more common situations you may
encounter. (AW)</B>
