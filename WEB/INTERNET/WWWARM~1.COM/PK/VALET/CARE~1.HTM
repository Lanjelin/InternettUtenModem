<H4><STRONG>We offer the most convenient, secure and economical parking at the
airport.  Owner owned and managed since 1970.</STRONG></H4>
<H4><STRONG> Here's how we take the hassle out of airport parking. You arrive
at our entrance and an attendant directs you to a parking space. Our courteous
shuttle drivers then meet you right at your parking space, assist you with your
luggage, and drive you to your airline check-in in an air-conditioned van. We
are only 3-4 minutes from the Terminal.</STRONG></H4>
<H4><STRONG>Upon your return, we meet you and drive you directly to your car.
At Valet you receive car-to-car service. Our personnel provide security for you
and your vehicle 24 hours a day. We never close. We have been providing hassle
free parking for thousands of business and leisure travelers for over 26 years.
We look forward to counting you as one of our many satisfied (and repeat)
customers!</STRONG></H4>
