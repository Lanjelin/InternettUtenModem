<H3>A micro-site on Armchair World dealing with Physical Fitness and Self
Defense Issues. </H3></CENTER>
<P><I>We at Armchair World don't advocate couch-potato-hood. Yes, sit at your
computer, explore that world <I>but also</I> whenever possible  experience it
first-hand. If your physical limitations place constraints on your physical
activities, then by all means work within those constraints.  Our &quot;take&quot;
will be to provide educational and informative topics on fitness and self
defence that will be of value to those starting out and to those who consider
fitness an integral part of their lives.</I></P>
<P></P>
<P><I>We begin with a column on self defense by 7-th degree blackbelt Dr.
Bernie Weiss. In addition to his obvious karate skills, Dr. Weiss is a
psychologist, educator and reserve police officer. This unique mix of training
ideally suits him for writing on a topic where awareness of the problem,
psychological perspective and physical training  are all  important
considerations. (AW)</I></P><IMG SRC="LINE02.GIF" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/fitness/line02.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">
