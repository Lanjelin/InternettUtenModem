<DD><STRONG>Armchair World's own indoor water fountain. Outdoor water
fountains have been a delight since times of antiquity. Now you can have your
own  <I>indoor</I> personal water sculpture to be put by your bedside or on
your desk or coffee table. Combining the movement of water with soothing sound,
our sculpture brings the outside into your home or office while making a unique
and quietly elegant statement that complements any decor. Our fountain has a
translucent cobalt blue glass base with a polished copper water column
surrounded by iridescent glass beads.  Water gently flows from the column and
side elements and courses over the beads in a subtly changing pattern. The
fountain  has a six-inch footprint, is eight inches high and is powered by a
small and quiet submersible pump. It  doesn't splash and is virtually
maintenance free except for occasional addition of water lost by evaporation. 
Vary the amount of water in the glass base to change the intensity of the
sculpture's sound. You are bound to find our water fountain  meditative,
relaxing and a beautiful addition to your environment. </STRONG></DD>
