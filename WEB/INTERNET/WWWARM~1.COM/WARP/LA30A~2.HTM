<H2>Los Angeles and Environs in the 1930's</H2></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>The following essays are excerpted from a wonderful little guide to
Los Angeles written by Elizabeth Webb-Herrick in 1935 entitled &quot;<I>Curious
California Customs</I>&quot; published by Pacific Carbon and Printing Company. 
We've written a little introduction to each essay to bring you up to date.</STRONG></P>

<H3><STRONG>Collegiate Westwood</STRONG></H3></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Westwood village has undergone a number of transformations since
the main campus of UCLA moved to the village around 1930. To me, Westwood has
lost its scale. High rise office buildings have changed it from a sleepy
Spanish-Moorish style village catering to the student population to a discordant
mix of shops, restaurants and offices, movie theaters and traffic problems. (<I>gf</I>)
</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The bustling village of Westwood was built primarily as a campus for the
U.C.L.A., and therefore, is only about five years old. To see the community life
of the place, however, and the substantial buildings which comprise it, you
would never in the world guess its age. There are restrictive building measures,
which account for the uniformity of the Spanish type architecture, and every
enterprise is housed in a decorative and distinctive manner, and inside and out,
it's the last word in design.</P>
<P>Many downtown stores have a Westwood branch, and on one corner of the street
we find our old friend, Bullock's - with a smart shop, catering to the
collegienne who knows her styles. Dressing the co-ed these days seems to occupy
a large percentage of the population (including the papas who are laboring
manfully downtown to pay the bills) and a number of their most startling effects
find expression here.</P>
<P>Anyone who ever attended college, remembers the superlative food that always
crops up about a campus, for these &quot;educated palates&quot; demand their
nourishment at regular intervals, and it had better be good! Up on the balcony,
we found the cutest tea room! The forty cent special was casserole of vegetables
au gratin with crisp bacon (these gals keep an eye on their calories evidently)
and there were other table d'hote specials up to seventy-five cents. Did you
ever taste baked avocado on the half-shell, filled with escalloped crab? No, we
thought not, neither did we, but we're certainly going to do something about
getting it recognized now that we have! There was the most delicious fresh
cranberry and orange relish, and a cinnamon bread and a spinach ring, all of
them not at all hard to take. As a finish, we topped off with that famous Creole
Pecan Pie, publicized by Anna Roosevelt. It's an old N'Awleans secret and of all
the unforgettable flavors! </P>
<P>Of course, the proper procedure would be to take the salad bowl; a lovely
looking green mixture, served with little bottles of Bullock's French Dressing,
and rye crisp, and <I>then</I> top off with that pie. Or, we don't care. Fix it
up anyway you like - only close your eyes to the evening dress mannequins if you
don't study out the calorie system - you can't keep your perfect 32 on that sort
of rations you know! Such is life.</P>
<P>Teas are deservedly popular and range in price from 35 cents to 85 cents.
Try the Maple cream toast. It's entirely new and we wonder who lies awake nights
to think up these temptations? The circulating library is up here on the balcony
also, and it makes it very cozy.</P>
<P>Who could blame you for tearing off a couple of chapters of popular reading
if you &quot;forget&quot; your trigonometry book?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>The Assistance League - Where to  See the Stars</STRONG></H3></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>Angelenos used to go to the Assistance League to see the stars. The
tradition of volunteerism evidenced there reached a zenith during WW2 with the
canteens serving the off-duty needs of service men and women. (<I>gf</I>)</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There is one Place in which the visitor may be certain that not only will
there be a number of feminine stellar lights on display, but usually the
additional treat of masculine favorites. Here at 5604 De Longpre, Hollywood,
daily, women forget to eat their salads and allow the tea to become cold in
their cups at the breathless thrill of almost rubbing shoulders with Leslie
Howard, or being waited on by Bebe Daniels. Unless you have a Strong heart, and
can take your thrills or leave `em, we can't advise you to come here. Strong
women have been in a dazed condition for days after lunching here on a Guest
Day. For charity, all of filmdom's elite have appeared here at some time or
other. </P>
<P>The organization does a noble work. the workroom teaches fine      French
embroideries to women handy with their needles, and the knitting department is
becoming a very busy place. There is a day nursery where working mothers may
bring their babies during the day. Similar groups may do as much charitable work
as these women, but the heart and soul of the enterprise lies in the tearoom.
Not only for charity do the stars and their public congregate here, the food is
simply beyond words.</P>
<P>A visit to their Thrift Shop, l301 North Western Avenue will yield rich
dividends sometimes. You know someone else's white elephants may be just what
you are looking for, and this place is packed to the rafters with other people's
castoffs. Remember every cent you spend here is contributing to a very worthy
cause.</P>
<P>Only the slim can let themselves go on the desserts to California, and the
triple X salad plate ($1.00), featuring chicken, fruit and combination salads
with corn bread and flaky hot biscuits, is another universal favorite.</P>
<P>The waitresses are all volunteers, recruited from the ranks of the Junior
League of the Wampus Baby stars, and many well known favorites of the screen,
sponsor special days and entertain guests. Even the tips go to charity. There's
a narrow stairway leading to the tearoom, so we'd advise an early luncheon hour,
so as not to be killed in the rush. Just s'pose Clark Gable should happen to
drop in today! The poor dear man lost fifteen pounds on his recent personal
appearance tour east, and was hiding ingloriously in his dressing room, living
on ham sandwiches afraid to face his ardent fans. Out here, life is much more
simple, although the importunate autograph hunters have that purposeful gleam in
their eye.</P>
<P>How awful it must be for the favorites, that fateful day when their entrance
into a public place fails to take on all the aspects of imperial Caesar's march
into Rome! They realize their popularity must be on the wane. We hope their
little minor triumphs comfort them to remember then, don't you? But it must make
anyone jittery to have hundreds of staring eyes taking in every mouthful. Only
for sweet charity's sake, could one endure such an ordeal.</P>
<P>We've seen waitresses impersonating duchesses many times, but here's where
your bona fide social leader leaves off all her rings but the simple little five
carat solitaire, and knits her carefully trained eyebrows in an effort to
remember as far as the kitchen that you ordered your steak rare.</P>
<P>Heavens! what a massaging and anointing the poor dears must demand at night
after their strenuous day at the League! It should make them speak a bit less
sharply to the girl next time she forgets and brings lemon instead of cream. On
the whole, the waitresses give a better performance than their more fortunate
sisters. That's the secret of the success of many of filmdom's great - how
easily they can bridge the gap from rags to riches.</P>
<P>Incidentally, all those extraordinarily lovely girls in the cafes and stores
don't just happen. If you get acquainted, you'll probably find the girl who
brings your coffee in the little shop around the corner mornings won a beauty
contest in Emporia, Kansas, and as even actresses have to eat, is living in
daily anticipation of being discovered by a film scout and launched on a stellar
career.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Santa Catalina Island</STRONG></H3></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>I've taken the steamship, the amphibious plane, a private plane,
sailboats and speedboats to Catalina. I've dived off the island, bowled there as
a kid, and sunbathed when it wasn't politically incorrect to do so. I've never
danced at the ballroom on Catalina. The steamboat is now gone as are many of the
attractions mentioned below. However, Catalina is still a romantic getaway, has
some great bed and breakfasts and has a (difficult) marathon through the
backcountry. Someday... (<I>gf</I>)</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ancient cartographers sometimes omitted to draw the Island lying twenty-five
miles offshore from the mainland of California when they were making their
charts, but there is little doubt in the minds of the thousands who have visited
Catalina since Mr. Wrigley threw all his heft into improvements, that it is very
<I>much</I> on the map today. Its first records name <I>Vizcaino</I> as its
discoverer in 1602, and previous to that it had been the home of-the Channel
Indians. Don Juan Cabrillo true to his bloody Spanish tradition, decimated them
as rapidly as they came under his august displeasure, and made the Island a base
for his early supplies.</P>
<P>There is the usual piratical tradition of a splenetic individual with the
delightful pseudonym of Peg-Leg given a lot of space by the Stevenson -
influenced romancers, who babble of buried treasure and desert islands, on the
least provocation. The natural harbor has undoubtedly seen many types of sailing
vessels, as well as the canoes of its Indian tribes leave, and come safely back
again, since stately galleons sailed the Spanish Main and brought fire and
desolation in their wake. Madame Tingley made a special trip to the Island, and
her followers connect it up with the Lost Island of Lemuria, and archaeologists
nod their heads sagely and insist that the surface of the discoveries has only
just been scratched. After passing from hand to hand, it was given to Pio Pico,
the redoubtable governor who had so much to do with the early history of
Southern California, and he in turn sold it to George Shatto for $150,000. Its
final sale by the Bannings to Mr. Wrigley names the price as $7,000,000; so keep
chewing, sisters -- it takes an awful lot of gum to pay back $7,000,000.00!</P>
<P>Smugglers frequented the secret coves, but found it too inconvenient for
their enterprises, so the sinister aspects of the Island gradually have been
lived down, and when the Bay was re-named Avalon Bay (from King Arthur's fabled
earthly paradise) it took on a very respectable air, and tried to forget its
scarlet past. Nothing -wicked remains today but the Chinese Junk on the Isthmus,
Ning-pu, where for fifteen cents, you may visit the macabre dungeons and torture
rooms, where pirates drank their grog and roared their mighty songs. (See, what
this piratical strain does, it's got us doing it too!) The old camphor wood logs
of which the ship is made still retain a slight trace of their pungent odor.</P>
<P>One of the most ironical aspects of the Island is its name. Discovered on
the name day of Santa Caterina, it was given that early Christian martyr's name.
The point they probably did not consider, however, is that St. Catherine was the
patron saint of the spinsters, and today, this Island which bears her name, has
become one vast honeymoon sigh and a lure for lovers of all ages and
descriptions!</P>
<P>One thing we can check up on and prove, is that the great-great grandfathers
of the goats and sheep scurrying swiftly up and down the rocky canyons, were
placed on there by the Spaniards, who turned the place into a grazing ground to
make sure of having fresh meat when they dropped anchor in the bay.</P>
<P>Mr. Wrigley determined to preserve the old Spanish traditions, and to build.
Avalon into a city true in detail to his ideal of Romance. To this end, he has
bent all his energies, and since his death, his cherished plans have been
faithfully carried out. Those hundreds of palm trees along the coast are a part
of the great plan, and certainly contribute the proper note to the general
effect of the South Seas. Every one of them was transported bodily, and huge as
they are, they took root in the rich soil and look as indigenous as though they
had always grown there. Think of that, some of you who rented a couple of palms
from the florist for a wedding! There's your California lavishness for you!</P>
<P>Nothing seemed to dismay Mr. Wrigley. When he was building the astounding
Casino, he had the inlaid woods for the flooring <I>floated</I> over to the
Island by rafts, especially constructed for that purpose. So today, it is not at
all strange that the Spanish troubadours who meet the boat exemplify the old
Castilian hospitality, and the sombreroed and red-sashed policemen keep up the
good work.</P>
<P>In the Paseo de El Encanto (Promenade of Enchantment) which was built as a
tribute to the memory of Wm Wrigley, Jr., one finds a complete Spanish village;
the glass shops, the inevitable candle maker, the Puppeteer show, and the quaint
cafe, serving typical Spanish food. Try the fidio (incredibly fine vermicelli)
huacamole (sp), and other more familiar dishes. And be sure to try the Mexican
chocolate. There's a drink, mind you, that Moctezuma served to Cortes; swizzled
about until foamy and seasoned with cinnamon. Have you sampled the cactus candy
yet?</P>
<P>Following the guide through the plant of the Catalina Potteries is a
fascinating business. From the clay pits right here on the Island come the basic
elements for those incredibly lovely ceramics, and when you meet them in
Ovington's or Field's, back home, you'll re-live the experience and handle them
with a new respect. These products enjoy a national reputation, and we need not
describe them here. In the Arcade, they sell out the &quot;seconds&quot; every
day at half price. The line forms on the right early in the morning to pick up
bargains. One of our most prized possessions is such a turquoise tea pot, and it
would &quot;defy the face of clay&quot; to find the flaws in it. One of the
charming Island customs is using their pottery in all the restaurants. It's
great propaganda, as nothing <I>could</I> be more Californian in feeling than
these expressive dishes. </P>
<P>Catalina's streets are paved with native granite, and a trip to the quarry
will reward you. Fifteen hundred men found homes and work there this past winter
and are busily engaged in chiseling off mountainsides and transporting huge
slabs to the mainland for the Santa Monica breakwater. Mr. Wrigley's impressive
mausoleum is appropriately built of the native rock of his beloved Island
paradise.</P>
<P>Through the medium of the news reels, everyone is aware that this is the
winter home of the Cubs; and the sight of Zane Grey, side-by-side with a marlin
swordfish (how can we be sure it isn't always the same fish?) is as familiar to
us as Graham McNamee's voice. The fountain in the marketplace is a veritable
Fisherman's Heaven. Here any day one finds strange creatures of the deep hanging
ingloriously by their tails, giving their conquerors that thrill of achievement
just before they're served up with parsley and boiled potatoes. Just think, that
sword fish steak you're devouring, no longer ago than yesterday, was a part of a
gamey, fighting monster, all muscle and strength, with a frantic determination
to shake off the steel hook or perish in the attempt.</P>
<P>The Tuna Club House plays host to all deep-sea anglers, who are ambitious to
display their prowess &quot;on their own hook&quot;. If you think your
piscatorial exploits have made you a match for them on mendacious stories, and
have a photograph of yourself with a prop fish handy, drop around sometime.
They'll welcome you heartily. There's a woman taxidermist (the only one in the
world it's rumored) who will be glad to sell you a tuna, all embalmed and
stuffed, for a scenic effect. A visit to her place is about the most interesting
thing to do on the Island, to our notion.</P>
<P>The aviary boasts &quot;the largest bird cage in the world&quot;, and you'll
be amused to talk to those uncanny minehs. They actually answer you. The other
exotic birds merely serve as a colorful background for these stars who hog the
camera, the limelight and the publicity, like the stellar performers they are.</P>
<P>If it's golf you're interested in, be sure not to miss the Country Club,
which is open to the public for luncheon and breakfast. For a small greens fee,
you may combine Swiss mountain climbing with playing, and this famous course
will delight you, as well as test your mettle. Up hill and down into canyons;
during fig season, there's sufficient incentive however, to go the entire
eighteen holes, for these figs seem much more delicious than any place else for
some reason. All the golfers munch on them when they should be looking for
balls. (Watch your drive, however. Remember this is an Island!)</P>
<P>At Sportland, you'll find archery, badminton, boxing and ping pong. And of
course, we forgot to mention it - but <I>some </I>people come over here to <I>swim!</I>
Actually, from the looks of things, nine-tenths of the population only take off
their bathing suits to go to bed. That Avalon Bay, on a warm day, looks like the
Ganges during a Hindu festival. Most Californians are amphibious from birth.</P>
<P>When the carillon of the chimes rings out from the sidehill for dinner,
there's a mad scramble for seafood cocktails. There are plenty of these little
stalls, and it makes a snappy prelude to your abalone steak. The Casino is the
Mecca after that, and to the stimulating strains of a &quot;hot&quot; orchestra,
Saturday nights, the rest of the evening can be danced away. The famous circular
ballroom is built over the water and those wide verandahs bode no good to your &quot;Angel
child&quot;, madam! Better keep checking up on her and the &quot;boy friend.&quot;</P>
<P>On the whole, though, the Island's remarkably innocuous. There's only one
beer parlor, and although that's plenty tough, all the incipient Pretty Boy
Floyd's and their gals flock there to drink their &quot;spiritus fermenti&quot;
- leaving the rest of the terrain to the respectable element.</P>
<P>You might enjoy the moonlight drive, and when the moon is at the full, the
scene is sheer enchantment. It's a honey, this drive; and we hope that you'll
have just the thrilling romantic type by your side, my dears, to tell you that
you are too. Don't go unless you know all the proper answers - <I>don't</I>
waste a heavenly night! And don't forget the flying fish.</P>
<P>Weekends, the yacht harbor's always full of celebrities, especially movie
stars. They lead rather circumscribed lives while &quot;shooting&quot; and can
only sail their little boats across the Channel and back before Monday morning.
Many notable films have been made over here, as the scenery has served for every
region from Morocco to the Arctic Regions and the Sea of Galilee to the South
Sea Islands. When Joan Crawford was making &quot;Rain&quot;, everybody on
Catalina went Pago-Pago, and Gloria Swanson's opus of the same name was also
laid in this locale.</P>
<P>The boat trip takes a couple of hours and costs $2.75 from Los Angeles.
There are couriers on the boat and on the Island with nothing to do but pilot
you about and show you the sights, and if you don't go to Catalina, you'll never
cease to be sorry.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
