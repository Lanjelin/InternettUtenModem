<H3><STRONG>Women Inventors (<I>ca 1900</I>)</STRONG></H3></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>The article on woman inventors below is part of a patent manual
written by Fred Dieterich in 1899.  The interesting point here is not that it is
surprising to see a piece written today about women inventors, but that when the
article below was written it was 1899 and women didn't yet have the &quot;right&quot;
to vote. We will be supplying a bibliography on women and invention shortly, so
check back soon.</STRONG></P>

<H3>Women as Inventors</H3></CENTER>
<P>That woman is rapidly coming to the front as an inventor is evidenced by the
large increase in the number of applications being filed by them. It is an
erroneous impression that women invent improvements on articles especially
adapted and intended for their sex, for the reason that they are constantly
exercising their ingenuity in the direction of improving  many of the devices
and implements with which men only as a rule are supposed to.</P>
<P>The records of the Patent Office bear witness to the fact that the inventive
genius of the fair sex is constantly accomplishing remarkable, advantageous and
profitable results.</P>
<P>Particularly in the lines of wearing apparel, household articles, and
furniture, the accessories to the boudoir, novelties, etc. are women displaying
active and practical ingenuity.</P>
<P>In May, 1805, the first patent to a woman was granted, a device for weaving
straw with silk and thread. Some years later, Mary Brush received a patent for a
new corset.</P>
<P>One of the earliest inventors was Lavina H. Foy, of Worcester, Mass., who in
1862 received a patent for a corset skirt support.</P>
<P>Each weekly issue of the Official Patent Office Gazette now shows a number
of new ideas invented and patented by women, and it is a fact, as a rule,
inventions the product of the fair sex do not relate to or set out devices of
the extreme chimerical or visionary kind too often the product of an
inexperienced &quot;first time&quot; male.</P>
<P>There is wide field for the exercise of ingenious minds of women. Every
woman (and there are many) having a knack for mechanical structure should study
to develop some new idea or thought, as the opportunity for substantial
financial returns resulting therefrom is not surpassed in any other direction.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
