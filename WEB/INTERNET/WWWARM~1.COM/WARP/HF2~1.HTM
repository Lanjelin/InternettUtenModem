<P><STRONG>With the world human population approaching the 6+ billion mark as
this century closes, those of us who are still here cannot help but wonder about
where man's inherent urge to produce new technology will take us. It hasn't
always been to good places. But not all bad, either. As our technical and social
knowledge about the management of man-made systems has grown, we have indeed
made spectacular progress in the fields of safety, ease of equipment use and
extensions of human capabilities. &quot;Human      centered engineering&quot; is
the current buzz phrase in engineering education. Emphasis on human factors and
ergonomics has led to an explosion of human focused activity among professionals
in law, medicine and management. New professional societies, extensive trade
show activity and articles in popular magazines and newspapers have provided a
kickoff into the upcoming 21st century. The situation has come a long way from
the &quot;time study&quot; concepts of P. W. Taylor in the 1880's when he
discovered that by timing the sub-activities of machinists and masons, a
rearrangement of the order of procedures could produce dramatic changes in total
work output.</STRONG></P>
