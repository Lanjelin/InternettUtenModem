<H2>Los Angeles and Environs in the 1930's</H2></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>The following essays are excerpted from a wonderful little guide to
Los Angeles written by Elizabeth Webb-Herrick in 1935 entitled &quot;<I>Curious
California Customs</I>&quot; published by Pacific Carbon and Printing Company. 
We've written a little introduction to each essay to bring you up to date.</STRONG></P>

<H3><STRONG>Bullock's Tea Room (Downtown)</STRONG></H3>
</CENTER>
<P><STRONG>Tea rooms were big in the thirties. When's the last time you had a
'finger sandwich'? Teatime is coming back and several L.A. restaurants now offer
a four o'clock tea. Retro gentility... (<I>gf</I>)</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If we could make a flying cook's tour of the various cities which we
mentioned in our Prologue, what fun it would be to seek out the outstanding
tearoom in each place in order to determine what culinary tidbit is peculiar to
that vicinity. Thus, in New York, we would doubtless find our way to one of
Alice Foote Mac-Dougall's charming locations. There we would sample her famous
waffles, and either the coffee or chocolate for which she is famous. Of course,
Long Island duck must be eaten on its native heath to really be appreciated. At
Filene's, in Boston, we would order their famous scallops.</P>
<P>Philadelphia's pride, Strawbridge and Clothier, make a bid for fame with
their Rockaway Club Sandwich, made with fried oysters instead of the traditional
chicken. Citizens of the Windy-City-on-the-Lake are loyal to their own Marshall
Field's, and usually order the potato flour muffins, which started as a
necessity during the war, and have been basking in well deserved popularity ever
since. Chicagoans consume quantities of their stuffed chicken legs at Field's
also.  </P>
<P>In New Orleans' Creole Quarter, at Antoine's, we find it very easy to
develop a taste for soft shell crabs fried deliciously crisp in breadcrumbs and
their famous pralines have been distributed pretty generally everywhere but
taste better here for some reason. If we can arrange it, we might drop in at
Stix, Baer &amp; Fuller's in St. Louis and order their deep seafood plate with
toasted anchovy rolls. Back in California, however, we make a bee line for
Bullock's, Broadway, Hill and Seventh, where we gorge ourselves on the Spanish
Plate. This is about the finest introduction we could devise for visitors,
unused to Spanish food, because it is not overseasoned and yet different enough
to warrant experimentation. As a civic gesture, we point with pride to this
truly representative dish. Consists of small Tamales, Spanish Bean, Salad and
toasted cheese sandwiches.</P>
<P>For over twenty-five years now, the name of Bullock's has stood, for
something definite to Angelenos. Their downtown store has many unusual
departments, and the tea room has been the outstanding meeting place for
shoppers and business people. There is usually <I>one</I> place in every town,
you know, and this is it.     </P>
<P>Miss Larson handles the tea rooms in all three of the Bullock's Stores -
Westwood and the Wilshire Boulevard project, and what alchemy she uses to
concoct menus is her own secret. Everything she serves looks like a page from
Good Housekeeping in its perfection, and tastes like the prize recipes of the
greatest  experts in domestic science.</P>
<P>At the moment, they are making a specialty of the buffet luncheon service,
which gives one a bewildering choice of hot dishes and salads such as only seem
to originate in the fertile brain of a culinary artist. Everything looks so
appetizing on a buffet table, doesn't it? You fill up your plate and take your
seat and your choice of drinks is brought to you, together with the particular
hot bread you order. There are a number of choices for dessert. They're all
capital - you just can't go wrong. These buffets are 85 cents - and there's a
table d'hote luncheon also and the usual diet special. (Spectre at the feast!)
These run about the same price. The only trouble with this place is it's even
better than home. We wouldn't advise taking the man of the family there, he
might draw some unflattering comparisons, but on the other hand you wouldn't
have any trouble getting him to take you to lunch again either!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>Bullocks Wilshire Store</STRONG></H3></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>The Bullocks Wilshire store is a excellent example of art deco
style architecture. I've always loved the building. It's currently being
re-invented as a law school and library. To me this seems odd -- but it's better
than the wrecking ball don't you know.</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On the Fifth Avenue of Los Angeles, Wilshire Boulevard, the visitor's eye is
immediately attracted by a graceful building with a greenish tower, which soars
241 feet above the Boulevard. In this building, one finds the quintessence of
modernity and smartness in a series of small shops, very similar to those &quot;little
shops&quot; which are so publicized by authors and fashion magazines, situated
on Park and Madison Avenues in New York City. The different decorations and
lighting maintains the separate unit illusion, despite the fact that it is all
one store.</P>
<P>One doesn't just go through this place, but is gently inducted into its many
manifestations of carefully worked out display. It's rather like scrutinizing an
extremely smart woman, whose clothes are subservient to her individuality, and
yet signal their expensive simplicity to even the most unobservant. There is a
noticeable lack of swank, and yet so exquisitely worked out in each tiny detail,
that the atmosphere is one of dignity and charm.</P>
<P>The giant porte cochere hospitably welcomes all cars as they sweep up to the
back entrance, and the passengers alight in perfect seclusion. One's car is
spirited away by uniformed attendants, and the ever present menace of the
parking problem is solved for once. It's a perfect set-up for the motion picture
colony, who have virtually taken possession of this store and marked it for
their own.</P>
<P>There isn't a day that at least several of them fail to pay a visit, and the
sight of Norma Shearer nonchalantly garbed in pale pink lounging pajamas trying
on gloves, or Adolphe Menjou and his glamorous new bride pricing (and buying)
English pigskin luggage,  is a common enough sight here.</P>
<P>The Desert Tea Room on the Fifth floor is the rendezvous for every body. The
day we were last there, Gloria Swanson, closely squired by her latest fancy,
Herbert Marshall, wasn't even creating a flutter. The employees are so used to
this sort of thing, you see.</P>
<P>By the way, this tea room is something you must be sure to visit. The desert
motif is so very restful and the copper cactus on the window grating sets the
tempo, which is so well carried out that even the slats on the Venetian blinds
are painted alternately in pink and green and ivory to keep the decor!</P>
<P>Miss Larson holds sway over this tea room also, insuring the usual Bullock
standard of culinary excellence. There is usually a &quot;streamline luncheon&quot;
on the menu, for those built on Westian lines to order with a clear conscience,
and here the poor souls need not envy their more fortunate sisters who are
eating away for dear Life on pecan rolls and French chocolate layer cake. For
once in their lives, they get a break. Even the vegetable plate is well-planned
and will restore the good humor of the most unwilling dieter; grilled tomatoes,
mushrooms, string beans, peas, asparagus, squash and celery - all of them
delicious and you can do your duty by your stomach and enjoy yourself.</P>
<P>There are such things as stuffed zucchini, cream cheese ring with assorted
fruit, fresh strawberry dressing, and always orange bread and date and nut bread
and cheese bread (ambrosial!) and a list of desserts to make one's mouth water.</P>
<P>Tuesdays there is a fashion luncheon at $1.25, which is slightly more than
the usual $I.00 affair, or a salad special at 85 cents or thereabouts. Out in
the Desert Lounge, are cannily displayed the most decorative baskets of stuffed
fruits, and the show case is always filled with delectable cookies; little fancy
cookies which tempt the weak sisters anew, as well they may, with their enticing
shapes and nutty goodness. The fruit cake is one of the house specialties at
$1.25 the pound, and is very gay with its top dressing of candied fruits. At the
moment, they are featuring agar-agar candy, again for the diet-conscious, which
sells for $1.00 a pound and is simply extraordinary - ask them to let you taste
it, and you're as good as sold.</P>
<P>Tea time is always lovely up here, for the view is superb from the top
story, embracing as it does the blue hills of Hollywood and an avenue of regal
palms lining an adjacent street. Here again you will have the urban
sophistication we promised you, plus the scenic panorama, which we just throw
in! It all comes under the heading of California - didn't we tell you?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><STRONG>The Beverly Wilshire Hotel</STRONG></H3></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>Located in Beverly Hills abutting Rodeo Drive, the Beverly Wilshire
Hotel is still with us and remains in very good health in its middle age. (<I>gf</I>)</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is quite a nice gesture on the part of Fate, that it should be Walter
McCarty who is the proud possessor of this de luxe caravansary, for Mr. McCarty,
you know, is one of the papas of Beverly Hills, or didn't you know? Oh, yes, he
subdivided or plotted it (or whatever it is they do to land before there are any
streets or lights or houses on it) and he was one of the lucky few who came out
of the huddle with his shirt still on; so often these real estate promoters lose
theirs. Now, he is able to point with pride to the super-structures which stand
in serried ranks against a sunset sky in vivid contrast to the fields of waving
barley of the not-so-long-ago. </P>
<P>No wonder Californians are so fond of this country out here. You see they
have literally <I>created</I> every single stick and stone, and the buildings
aren't the only things that are staggered - the imagination's pretty breathless
too!</P>
<P>It must be lots of fun to see a dream come true and when it takes on such
form as this splendid hotel,  it must be soul-satisfying. The lobby is done in
Louis Quinze period style, all ormolu clocks and gilt and cupids and Aubusson
carpets, and the graciousness of  this motif after the austerity of the Spanish
and modern interiors we've been seeing, is very warm and grateful to the eye.</P>
<P>There's a lot to be said for this period all right, and it's all being very
well expressed by this unusually fine example. Women especially like this sort
of background. It sets them off, and reaches a focus with the cut glass
chandeliers, Their tinkling, sparkling prisms catch and hold the daintiness of a
festive era. </P>
<P>In the Gold Room, the quintessence of luxury has been attained. No expense
or pains have been spared to make it a superb playground for Fortune's
favorites, and Friday nights the younger set moves in and takes possession.
Saturday nights belong to the hoi polloi and Sundays there is the best crowd of
all for dinner dancing. </P>
<P>It seems Los Angeles prohibits dancing on the Sabbath, so if you feel a
rhumba coming on, get into your car quick, and do the few miles in nothing flat,
and dance to your heart's content. Vincent Lopez wields the baton, so you won't
find it very tough going! Friday nights there is a cover charge of $1.00 after
9:30 o'clock, and Saturdays and Sundays $1.50. They feature a table d'hote
dinner for $1.50 and a de luxe affair for $2 .50. Suppers consist of interesting
items ranging in price from $1.00 up. One combination consists of lobster a la
newburg with melba toast (as a sop to the conscience probably) coffee, and
rainbow ice. Their liquors are their especial pride. Drop around some night and
tell the genial Mr. Jennings, the manager, we sent you!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
