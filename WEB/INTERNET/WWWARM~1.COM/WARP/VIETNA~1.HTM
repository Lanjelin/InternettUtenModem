<P><I>If you are old enough, you will probably remember what you were doing
and thinking on the day that John Kennedy was assassinated. Woven into our
memories, events of collective sadness, joy, beginning and ending are
touchstones that bring us together as a people. In this article, Bill Hilliard
remembers the day, his thoughts and how the event shaped his future. (AW)</I></P>

<P><STRONG>Anxiously, he looked out the window of the plane. Below he saw the
green jungled edge of the land neatly jagged and bordered by a thin line of
beach jutting into the blue of the ocean. From 18,000 feet the earth takes on an
unreal quality. Height causes large areas of the earth to blend into almost
distinct patches of color. Looking into the cloudless sky, he found himself
suspended, saw the sun staring down with an unfelt heat.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The inside of the plane was dank while in the light outside the
engines droned on without change as the plane imperceptibly crossed the boundary
of sea and land. Looking down once more, a small chill started at the base of
his spine and quickly tickled the hairs on the back of his neck. Thoughts
floated back to that late fall day, two years ago: November 22, 1963.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Sitting at his desk in the small insurance agency where he had
worked for the past three years since graduating from high school, he reached in
the top desk drawer and took out the letter that had arrived in that morning's
mail and read &quot;... you will report for induction into the U.S. Army, at
0530, 5 DEC, 1963 at the County Building.&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>This can't be real. He put it back in the drawer for the fourth or
fifth time, thinking of the discussion with the professor of his political
science course at the local junior college. The Vietcong in Vietnam raided small
villages to get young men to add to their &quot;forces&quot;, under threat of
death to them and their families. How barbaric.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Taking out his &quot;Greetings&quot; once more, he read: &quot;Persons
failing to report may be fined not to exceed $10, 000.00 or may be imprisoned
for not more than five years, or both.&quot; Not much different from the jungles
of Vietnam, he mused. He had thirteen days to decide what he would do. Time for
lunch.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>After lunch the radio brought the tragic news that shook him as
well as the rest of the world: President Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, Texas.
As soon as the radio confirmed the President's death, he made preparations to
close the office. He went upstairs to his studio/apartment which was in the same
building. In his studio he found what he was looking for in an old copy of Life
magazine, a large full page picture of the President, with which to make a sign
for the front door of the office. On the opposite page were the words of the now
late leader: &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do
for your country.&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>He pasted the picture on a large piece of posterboard and carefully
outlined it with a thick black line of India ink. At the bottom he printed in
large plain block letters:</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>CLOSED IN MEMORIAM</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>He looked up at the painting he was working on: a large bird could
be seen flying free from the abstract patterns of color on the canvas. He looked
at the now torn copy of Life magazine. He went downstairs.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>After carefully taping the black bordered sign to the glass of the
front door and pulling the blinds, he walked back into the office, now darkened
by the pulled blinds. Everyone else was gathered around the radio listening to
the aftermath of chaos. Picking up the telephone book he flipped through the
pages until he found what he was looking for -  Navy Recruiter - and dialed the
number listed. No answer. Air Force Recruiter. He dialled again: &quot;U.S. Air
Force Recruiting Office,&quot; said the voice on the other end of the phone.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Five days later he was in &quot;Boot Camp&quot; at Lackland Air
Force Base, Texas. After a few months of school in communications electronics he
was assigned to Japan.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>He liked Japan. In fact, he didn't mind the service too much. His
work was interesting and required that he travel a lot: Korea, Hawaii, Okinawa,
Taiwan, and various other small islands in the Pacific.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>One day his name was on the bulletin board: &quot;Report to the
Rifle Range the next day at 1400 hours for training with the M-16 rifle.&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>It was a warm late summer afternoon Indian summer it was called
back home. The qualifying consisted of firing the rifle from various positions
(standing, kneeling, and prone) at a target with the black silhouette of a man
on a white background. His rifle was already &quot;sighted in&quot; as he scored
ten bull's-eyes out of ten practice shots. He shot sixty more times (twenty in
each position), not missing once.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The target had a large gaping hole ripped from its center. &quot;You
could have killed seventy men,&quot; said the range sergeant. Or one man seventy
times, he thought to himself. It was only a cardboard target. Not a real live
human. The orders came a week later.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The plane shook a little as it started its landing approach. The
green ground now broke into small, square water-filled patches of rice paddies.
They rushed by, faster and faster. The plane touched down almost gently and
taxied to a stop. Picking up his rifle, he stepped into the hot, wet, blinding
sun of south Vietnam.</STRONG></P>
