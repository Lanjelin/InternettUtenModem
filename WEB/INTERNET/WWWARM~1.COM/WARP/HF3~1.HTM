<H4>In 1911 Frank Gilbreth, an engineer and his wife, Lillian, a psychologist,
published the book, &quot;Motion Study&quot; which placed emphasis on the
patterns of movement that were made by factory workers in their tasks. From
their observation a classification system consisting of 17 basic hand and arm
activities evolved. Typical motions, such as &quot;reach&quot; and &quot;grasp&quot;
were described and coded into units that could be precisely described and timed.
These units became known as &quot;therbligs&quot; (Gilbreth spelled backward
with the &quot;th&quot; unreversed) and evolved to a universally accepted basis
for human movement analysis in the workplace. The concept led to continuing
refinement of motion descriptions. Precision timing with motion picture
photography provided &quot;micromotion&quot; descriptions with a precision of
milliseconds and even microseconds in special cases. The information was used
for workstation design, safety analysis and for setting work rate standards
during union negotiations. With the time factor and the motion factor considered
together, workplace tasks could be redesigned to provide increased output,
improved worker comfort and safety and, of course, a payoff in the profit bottom
line. Overall, micromotion analysis and task redesign led to higher efficiencies
in the manufacturing environment. However, as time and motion standards for
specific tasks were set, it became apparent that all workers did not have the
same talents and capabilities. Attention in the 1930's was thus directed to
placing more emphasis on worker selection and training.</H4></BLOCKQUOTE>
