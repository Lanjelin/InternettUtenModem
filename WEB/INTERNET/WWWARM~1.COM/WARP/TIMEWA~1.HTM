<P><STRONG>What is the Time Warp? It's a glimpse into our past and a look into
possible futures. We will be looking at how we saw ourselves, what's changed,
and what is no longer here; we shall also take the role of futurist and give
some insights into where we think we are going. These insights will be open to
debate as are most predictions -  we are notoriously bad at predicting our short
term future. For instance, during the 1939 World's Fair it was predicted that by
1960 there would be floating dirigible hangers (think <I>water bearings</I>)
that could be easily pointed in the direction of the prevailing winds thus
facilitating takeoffs. However by 1946, economics, advances in aviation, the war
and the Hindenberg, spelled the demise of the blimp and the necessity for
hangers to house them. Today, what hangers do exist are mainly used for other
purposes and blimps and blimp hangers have become a curiosity. Not being immune
to curiosity, a couple of years ago I ran  in a 10K &quot;Run through the
Hangers&quot; at the Marine Corps Air Station in Tustin, California, home of the
largest blimp hangers in the world.   </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>It's been said that true enlightenment is moment-to-moment
awareness. This is significant since our sensory systems are designed for change
- not constancy - and we should be programmed to reach this form of
enlightenment somewhat automatically. This however isn't the case. We filter our
inputs to keep the barrage of sensory information from overwhelming us. Thus is
it any wonder that on a perceptual basis we go around largely unaware of the
small perturbations around us and thus fall prey to loosing touch with the big
picture? Being aware - moment-to-moment takes work.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Come with us. See where we have been. Let us know where you think
we are going. If you have any ideas on topics you would like to see in The Time
Warp or would like to submit an essay for possible inclusion, please email us at
