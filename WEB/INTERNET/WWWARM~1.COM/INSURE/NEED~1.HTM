<H1>Why You May Need Travel Insurance</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> It takes the worry out of both the foreseen and unforeseen. 
</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG> It just makes good common sense to protect yourself. 
</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG> Because you may get sick or hurt and need medical evacuation.  
</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG> Because even the best tour companies, cruise lines and hotels
sometimes get in financial trouble (i.e. go bankrupt after you have paid for
your trip).
</STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG> Because you may become a victim of a travel scam. </STRONG></LI>
<LI><STRONG> Because the cost is reasonable. 
</STRONG></LI></UL>
<H3><STRONG>Here are some more concrete reasons:</STRONG></H3>
<P><IMG SRC="COPTER2.GIF" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/insure/copter2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><B>Evacuation:</B> If you need to be
evacuated for medical reasons during your trip and don't have evacuation
insurance coverage, you will need to pay for your evacuation. Costs can run from
about U.S.$10,000 to over U.S.$20,000. We at Armchair World strongly feel that
if you are going to travel where medical care is not at least equivalent to U.S.
standards, then evacuation insurance is a necessity. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="MANBROKE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/insure/manbroke.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><B>Accidental Injury:</B> If you
are injured on your trip and need medical and/or hospital attention and your
private insurance doesn't cover you, travel insurance could <I>help</I> to pay
some of the costs. We should note that if this coverage is not sufficient for
your needs, you should consider obtaining international major medical coverage.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="PLANE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/insure/plane.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><B>Trip Cancellation/Interruption:</B>
You've booked and paid for a tour or cruise; the tour or cruise company goes
belly up. What happens to the money you paid? Travel insurance in many instances
could protect part or all of your investment. As another example, you've
pre-paid fees for travel and transportation arrangements and you've missed them
because of injury, sickness, accident or airline bankruptcy.  Travel insurance
could help cover  non-refundable pre-paid fees and travel costs. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="BED.GIF" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/insure/bed.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><B>Sickness:</B> What if you get sick on
your trip and need to stay in a hospital? If your personal health insurance
doesn't cover you, travel insurance could help pay some of the costs. Again, we
should note that if this coverage is not sufficient for your needs, you should
consider obtaining international major medical coverage.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="BAG1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.armchair.com/insure/bag1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><B>Baggage:</B> You've lost you
luggage; insurance can  help pay for baggage replacement.</P>
