<P><STRONG>Do you need travel insurance? Do you need a major medical plan for
your travel.  Do you need both?</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG> <I>Travel  insurance</I> generally provides coverage for such
things as trip cancelation, tour company bankruptcy, baggage loss, emergency
evacuation and accidental injury. You should be aware that while travel
insurance provides exceptional coverage in most areas, medical coverage tends to
be limited.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>  <I>International major medical insurance</I> deals strictly with
<I>medical</I> issues and provides substantial coverage similar to home-based
major medical policies. Coverage can be obtained for the U.S. citizen traveling
outside the U.S. <I>and</I> for the foreign national visiting the U.S.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Depending on your needs, you can purchase one or <I>both</I> types
of insurance. If you need travel insurance but require more medical coverage
than travel insurance alone provides, then consider the purchase of both types
of insurance.  If you are planning to leave your home country for an extended
stay (say, for business assignments or religious service) then you should
consider an international major medical policy; in this latter case, travel
insurance might not provide you with useful coverage.   </STRONG></P>
