<P><STRONG>We are not paranoid but we have heard and read more horror stories
than most. Our idea in travelling is to plan for problems and obstacles <I>before</I>
 they occur. That way you can concentrate on the adventure and know that you
have tried to cover your tail feathers to the best of your ability in case a
problem should arise.
</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Before going on a trip and especially when traveling to
third-world nations and to locales off-the-beaten-track, we advise you to check
over your personal health insurance policy to see what you are covered for while
on your trip. </STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>If you plan to drive, you should check to see whether your
driver's insurance policy covers you when traveling outside the United States.
It is almost a certainty that if you intend to drive, you should obtain car
insurance in the country (or countries) you are visiting as your U.S. insurance
may not be recognized.</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Read over your homeowners policy to determine what is covered
while you are traveling. Your policy might cover lost or stolen possessions.
</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Never be afraid to ask questions. What you may consider a &quot;dumb
question&quot; now, could save you more than money in the future.</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Armchair World feels, that if for no other reasons, travel
insurance possibly supplemented with major medical coverage should be considered
for the following:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> the possibility of tour company, cruise company, hotel and/or
airline bankruptcy. You should be aware that bankruptcy insurance has many
technicalities and loopholes. So ask detailed questions and read the coverage
and exclusions carefully.</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> the possibility that you will get ill or injured and need
emergency medical evacuation: Remember that if you need to be evacuated and
don't have insurance, you will have to pay for the evacuation. This can run U.S.
$10,000 and up. 
</STRONG></LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> the availability of call-in services such as emergency medical
referral, emergency cash advance, emergency message relay, and medication
replacement: Having one number that you can call to  arrange emergency services
can give tremendous peace of mind. Make sure that if you are going
off-the-beaten-track,  that these services will be available in the particular
country you are visiting. </STRONG></LI></UL>
