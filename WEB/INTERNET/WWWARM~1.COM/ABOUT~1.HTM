<H3>About Our Site Design</H3>
<P>At the present time we have chosen to stay as close to the HTML 2.0 standard
as possible so that we can reach the largest possible audience. We have recently
begun using the 'table' extension. If our tables appear garbled, consider
upgrading your browser. The 'table' tag greatly enhances menuing without eating
bandwidth. We highly recommend that you use the Netscape Browser (at least
version 2.0); the latest version can be downloaded directly from

<H3>About our Services</H3>
<P>If you are a private individual, we can design and host a  home page for
you. If you are a business, we can design, program and host a complete internet
site for your company. We have in-house html programming and graphics design
capability and over fifteen years of computer software experience.</P>
<P>If you have goods or services that you think would be of interest to
Armchair Worlders, please get in touch with us; we can help make you known to
the internet community.
