<P>Your trip to Africa will be an adventure off the beaten path. The estimated
325,000 U.S. citizens who travel to Africa each year are only a fraction of the
more than 44 million Americans who go overseas annually. Conditions and customs
in sub-Saharan Africa can contrast sharply with what you are accustomed. Take
the advise below seriously but do not let it keep you at home.</P>
<P>The tips to follow cover all of Africa except the five nations bordering the
Mediterranean. Sub-Saharan Africa includes 48 nations. Forty two of these
nations are on the mainland. In addition, four island nations in the southwest
Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Comoros, Mauritius, and Seychelles) and two island
nations in the Atlantic Ocean (Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe) are
considered part of Africa. For convenience, we will often use the word &quot;Africa&quot;
to refer to the sub-Saharan region. For travel tips for the five northern
African nations of Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Egypt please see &quot;<A

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Consular">Consular Information Program</A></H4>
<P>Before traveling, obtain the Consular Information Sheet for the country or
countries you plan to visit. You should also check to see if the Department of 
State has issued a Travel Warning for the country or countries you will be
visiting. Warnings are issued when the State Department decides, based n all
relevant information, to recommend that Americans avoid travel to a certain
country.</P>
<P>Consular Information Sheets are available for every country of the world.
They include such information as the location of the U.S. embassy or consulate
in the subject country, unusual immigration practices, health conditions, minor
political disturbances, unusual currency and entry regulations, crime and
security information, and drug penalties. If an unstable condition exists in a 
country that is not severe enough to warrant a Warning, a description of the
condition(s) may be included under an optional section entitled &quot;Areas of
Instability.&quot; On limited occasions, we also restate in document any U.S.
embassy advice given to official employees. </P>
<P>Consular Information Sheets generally do not include advice, but present
information on factual matters so travelers can make knowledgeable decisions
concerning travel to a particular country. Countries where avoidance of travel
is recommended will have Travel Warnings as well as Consular Information Sheets.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#consindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Health">Health</A></H4>
<P>Health problems affect more visitors to Africa than any other difficulty.
Information on health precautions can be obtained from local health departments,
private doctors, or travel clinics. Depending on your destination, immunization
may be recommended against cholera, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis, meningitis,
polio, typhoid, and yellow fever. These diseases are transmitted by insects,
contaminated food and water, or close contact with infected people. </P>
<P>Travelers should take the proper precautions before leaving for sub-Saharan 
Africa to reduce the risk of infection. </P>
<P><A HREF="#healthindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="insects">Diseases transmitted by insects</A></H5>
<P>Many diseases are transmitted through the bite of infected insects such as
mosquitoes, flies, fleas, ticks, and lice. Travelers must protect themselves
from insect bites by wearing proper clothing, using bed nets, and applying the
proper insect repellent. Mosquito activity is most prominent during the hours
between dusk and dawn. </P>
<P><B>Malaria</B> is a serious parasitic infection transmitted to humans by
the mosquito. Symptoms range from fever and flu-like symptoms, to chills,
general achiness, and tiredness. Travelers at risk for malaria should take
Mefloquine to prevent malaria. This drug should be taken one week before
leaving, while in the malarious area, and for a period of four weeks after
leaving the area. Travelers are advised to consult their personal physicians on
the possible side effects of the malaria medication they choose. </P>
<P><B>Yellow Fever </B>is a viral disease transmitted to human by a mosquito
bite. Symptoms range from fever, chills, headache, and vomiting to jaundice,
internal bleeding, and kidney failure. Some sub-Saharan countries require yellow
fever vaccination for entry. </P>
<P><B>Dengue Fever </B>is primarily an urban viral infection transmitted by
mosquito bites. The illness is flu-like and characterized by the sudden onset of
a high fever, severe headaches, joint and muscle pain, and rash. Prevention is
important since no vaccine or specific treatment exists.</P>
<P><A HREF="#insectindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="food">Diseases Transmitted through Food and Water</A></H5>
<P>Food and waterborne diseases are one of the major causes of illness to
travelers, the most frequent being diarrhea. It can be caused by viruses,
bacteria, or parasites which are found universally throughout the region. </P>
<P><B>Typhoid Fever </B>is a bacterial infection transmitted throughout
contaminated feed and/or water, or directly between people. Symptoms of typhoid
include fever, headaches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and constipation more
often then diarrhea. Typhoid fever can be treated effectively with antibiotics.
Drinking only bottled or boiled water and eating only thoroughly cooked feed
reduces the risk of infection. </P>
<P><B>Cholera </B>is an acute intestinal infection caused by a bacterium.
Infection is acquired by ingesting contaminated water or food. Symptoms include
an abrupt onset of voluminous watery diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and muscle
cramps. The best method of prevention is to follow the standard food and water
precautions. Individuals with severe cases should receive medical attention
immediately. </P>
<P><B>Hepatitis A</B> is a viral infection of the liver transmitted by the
fecal oral; through direct person to person contact; from contaminated water,
ice or shellfish; or from fruits or uncooked vegetables contaminated through
handling. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, dark urine,
jaundice, vomiting, aches and pains, and light stools. No specific therapy is
available. The virus is inactivated by boiling or cooking to 85 degrees
centigrade for one minute. Travelers should eat thoroughly cooked foods and
drink only-treated water as a precaution.</P>
<P><A HREF="#foodindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="contact">Diseases Transmitted through Intimate Contact with
People</A></H5>
<P><B>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)</B> which causes acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS is found primarily in blood, semen, and
vaginal secretions of an infected person. HIV is spread by contact with an
infected person, by needle sharing among injecting drug users, and through
transfusions of infected blood and blood clotting factors.</P>
<P>Treatment has prolonged the survival of some HlV infected persons, but there
is no known cure or vaccine available. International travelers should be aware
that some countries serologically screen incoming travelers (primarily those
with extended visits, such as for work or study) and deny entry to persons with
AIDS and those whose test results indicate infection with HIV. Persons who are
intending to visit a country for substantial periods or to work or study may
wish to consult the embassy of that country concerning the policies and
requirements on HlV testing. </P>
<P><B>Hepatitis B</B> is a viral infection of the liver. Primarily, Hepatitis
B is transmitted through activities which result in the exchange of blood or
blood derived fluids and/or through sexual activity with an infected person. The
primary prevention consists of either vaccination and/or reducing intimate
contact with those suspected of being infected. </P>
<P><B>Meningococeal Disease (bacterial meningitis) </B>is a bacterial
infection in the lining of the brain or spinal cord. Early symptoms are
headache, stiff neck, a rash, and fever. This is spread by repository droplets
when an infected person sneezes or coughs on you. A one dose vaccine called
Menomune (TM) is available.</P>
<P><A HREF="#contactindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Other">Other Diseases</A></H5>
<P><B>Schistosomiasis</B> is an infection that develops after the larvae of a
flatworm have penetrated the skin. Water treated with chlorine or iodine is
virtually safe, and salt water poses no risk. The risk is a function of the
frequency and degree of contact with contaminated fresh water for bathing,
wading, or swimming. It is often difficult to distinguish between infested and
non-infested water; therefore, swimming in fresh water in rural areas should be
avoided. </P>
<P><B>Rabies</B> is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system.
The virus is introduced by an animal bite. The best prevention is not to handle
animals. Any animal bite should receive prompt attention.</P>
<P>Some countries have shortages of medicines; bring an adequate supply of any
prescription and over-the-counter medicines that you are accustomed to taking.
Keep all prescriptions in their original, labeled containers.</P>
<P>Medical facilities may be limited, particularly in rural areas. Should you
become seriously ill or injured abroad, contact the nearest US. embassy or
consulate. A U.S. consular officer can furnish you with a list of recommended
local hospitals and English-speaking doctors. Consular officers can also inform
your family or friends in the United States of your condition. Because medical
coverage overseas can be quite expensive, prospective travelers should review
their health insurance policies. Doctors and hospitals expect immediate payment
in full for health services in many sub-Saharan countries. If your policy does
not provide medical coverage overseas, consider buying supplemental insurance.
It is also advisable to obtain insurance to cover the exorbitant cost of medical
evacuation in the event of a medical emergency.</P>
<P>Except in first-class hotels, drink only boiled water or bottled beverages.
Avoid ice cubes. Unless you are certain they are pasteurized, avoid dairy
products. Vegetables and fruits should be peeled or washed in a purifying
solution. A good rule of thumb is, &quot;if you can't peel it or cook it, don't
eat it.&quot;</P>
<P><A HREF="#otherindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Crime">Crime</A></H4>
<P>Crime is a worldwide problem, particularly in urban populated areas. In
places where crime is especially acute, we have noted this problem under the
specific geographic country section. Travelers should, however, be alert to the
increasing crime problem throughout sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
<P><A HREF="#crindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Weather">Weather</A></H4>
<P>Sub-Saharan Africa is tropical, except for the high inland plateaus and the
southern part of South Africa. Within 10 degrees of the Equator, the climate
seldom varies and is generally hot and rainy. Further from the Equator, the
seasons become more apparent, and if possible, you should plan your trip in the
cooler months. If traveling to rural areas, avoid the rainy months which
generally run from May through October north of the equator and November through
April south of the equator. Roads may be washed out during these times.</P>
<P><A HREF="#weaindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Visa">Visa and Other Entry Requirements</A></H4>
<P>A U.S. passport is required for travel to all countries in Africa. In
addition, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa require U.S. citizens to have a
visa. If visas are required, obtain them before you leave home. If you decide to
visit additional countries en route, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain
visas. In most African countries, you will not be admitted into the country and
will have to depart on the next plane, if you arrive without a visa. This can be
inconvenient if the next plane does not arrive for several days, the airport
hotel is full, and the airport has no other sleeping accommodations.</P>
<P>The best authority on a country's visa and other entry requirements is its
embassy or consulate. Allow plenty of time to apply for visas. An average of two
weeks for each visa is recommended. When you inquire, check the following:</P>
<UL><LI><P>visa price, length of validity, and number of entries;</P></LI>
</UL>
<UL><LI><P>financial data required - proof of sufficient funds, proof of
onward/return ticket;</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>immunizations required;</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>currency regulations;</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>import/export restrictions; and</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>departure tax. If required, be sure to keep sufficient hard
currency so that you may leave the country on schedule.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>HIV clearance certification. Some countries require travelers to
submit certification or be tested upon arrival for HIV.</P></LI></UL>
<P>In the past, some African countries refused to admit travelers who had South
African visas or entry and exit stamps in their passports. The situation has
improved.</P>
<P><A HREF="#visaindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Restricted">Restricted Areas</A></H4>
<P>A visa is good only for those parts of a country that are open to
foreigners. Several countries in Africa have areas of civil unrest or war zones
that are off-limits to visitors without special permits. Others have similar
areas that are open but surrounded by security checkpoints where travelers must
show their passport, complete with valid visa. When traveling in such a country,
keep your passport with you at all times. No matter where you travel in Africa,
do not overstay the validity of your visa; renew it if necessary.</P>
<P>If stopped at a roadblock, be courteous and responsive to questions asked by
persons in authority. In areas of instability, however, try to avoid travel at
night. If you must travel at night, turn on the interior light of the car. For
information on restricted or risky areas, consult Department of State Consular
Information Sheets or, if you are already in Africa, the nearest U.S. embassy 
or consulate.</P>
<P>In some areas, when U.S. citizens are arrested or detained, police or prison
officials have failed to inform the U.S. embassy or consulate. If you are ever
detained for any reason, it is your right to speak with a U.S. consular officer
immediately.</P>
<P><A HREF="#resindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="cit">U.S. Citizens Married to Foreign Nationals</A></H4>
<P>Women who travel to Africa should be aware that in some countries, either by
law or by custom, a woman and her children need the permission of her husband to
leave the country. If you or your children travel, be aware of the laws and
customs of the places you visit. Do not visit or allow your children to visit
unless you are confident that you will be permitted to leave. Once overseas, you
are subject to the laws of the country you visit; U.S. law cannot protect you.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#citindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Currency">Currency Regulations</A></H4>
<P>The amount of money, including traveler's checks, which may be taken into or
out of African countries varies. In general, visitors must declare all currency
and travelers checks upon arrival. Do not exchange money on the black market.
Use only banks and other authorized foreign exchange offices and retain
receipts. You may need to present the receipts as well as your original currency
declaration when you depart. Currency not accounted for may be confiscated, and
you may be fined or detained. Many countries require that hotel bills be paid in
hard currency. Some require that a minimum amount of hard currency be changed
into the local currency upon arrival. Some countries prohibit the import or
export of local currency. Also, some countries prohibit the destruction of local
currency, no matter how small the denomination.</P>
<P><A HREF="#currindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="wild">U.S. Wildlife Regulations</A></H4>
<P>The United States prohibits the import of products from endangered species,
including the furs of any spotted cats. Most African countries have enacted laws
protecting wildlife, but poaching and illegal trafficking in wildlife are still
commonplace. Importing products made from endangered species, may result in the
seizure of the product and a possible fine. African ivory cannot generally be
imported legally into the United States. </P>
<P>The import of most types of parrots and other wild birds from Africa is now
restricted and subject to licensing and other controls. There are also
restrictions which require the birds to be placed in quarantine upon arrival to
ensure they are free from disease. For further information on the import of
wildlife and related products, consult the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or
TRAFFIC U.S.A., World Wildlife Fund - U.S., 1250 24th Street, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20037.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Air">Air Travel</A></H4>
<P>If you are flying to places in Africa other than the major tourist
destinations, you may have difficulty securing and retaining reservations and
experience long waits at airports for customs and immigration processing. If
stranded, you may need proof of a confirmed reservation in order to obtain feed
and lodging vouchers from some airlines. flights are often overbooked, delayed,
or cancelled and, when competing for space on a plane, you may be dealing with a
surging crowd rather than a line. Traveling with a packaged tour may insulate
you from some of these difficulties. All problems cannot be avoided, but you
can:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Learn the reputation of the airline and the airports you will use to
forestall problems and avoid any unpleasant surprises.
</LI>
<LI> Reserve your return passage before you go;reconfirm immediately upon
arrival.
</LI>
<LI> Ask for confirmation in writing, complete with file number or locator
code, when you make or confirm a reservation.
</LI>
<LI> Arrive at the airport earlier than required in order to put yourself at
the front of the line - or the crowd, as the case may be.
</LI>
<LI> Travel with funds sufficient for an extra week's subsistence in case you
are stranded.

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Photography">Photography</A></H4>
<P>Africa is filled with photogenic scenery, and photography is generally
encouraged. However, most governments prohibit photography of military
installations or locations having military significance, including airports,
bridges, tunnels, port facilities, and public buildings. Visitors can seek
guidance on restrictions from local tourist offices or from the nearest U.S.
embassy or consulate. Taking such photographs without prior permission can
result in your arrest or the confiscation of your film and/or equipment.</P>
<P><A HREF="#photoindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="short">Shortages, High Prices, and Other Problems</A></H4>
<P>Consumer goods, gas, and food are in short supply in some African countries
and prices for these commodities may be high by U.S. standards. Shortages of
hotel accommodations can exist so confirm reservations well in advance. Some
countries experience disruptions in electricity and water supply or in services
such as mail and telecommunications.</P>
<P><A HREF="#shortindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Local">Local Transportation</A></H4>
<P>Rental cars, where available, may be expensive. Hiring a taxi is often the
easiest way to go sightseeing. Taxi fares should be negotiated in advance.
Travel on rural roads can be slow and difficult in the dry season and disrupted
by floods in the rainy season.</P>
<P><A HREF="#locindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="COUNTRY">COUNTRY INFORMATION</A></H4>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Angola">Angola</A></H5>
<P>Angola is a developing country which has experienced war and civil strife
since before independence from Portugal in 1975. In 1993, the U.S. recognized
the Angolan government and a U.S. Embassy was established in Luanda. Facilities
for tourism are virtually nonexistent. Visas are required. Persons arriving

Persons seeking to trade at lower rates on the black market could be arrested or
shaken down. To avoid problems, dollars should be exchanged for naira (Nigerian
currency) only at the official rate and at approved exchange facilities,
including many major hotels. Credit cards are rarely accepted, and their use is
generally ill advised because of the prevalence of credit card fraud in Nigeria
and perpetrated by Nigerians in the United States. It is often necessary to
bring travelers checks or currency in sufficient amounts to cover the trip.

<H5><A NAME="Rwanda">Rwanda</A></H5>
<P>Rwanda is a central East African country torn by ethnic and political
strife. A four year civil war resumed in April and ended in mid-July of 1994.
Much of the country's basic infrastructure, telephones, water distribution,
electricity, etc. was destroyed in the war. Medical facilities are severely
limited and extremely overburdened. Almost all medical facilities in the
capital, Kigali, were destroyed during the civil war. Looting and street crime
are common. Civilian law enforcement authorities may be limited or nonexistant.
Clean water and food are unavailable on a regular basis, and only rudimentary
lodging can be found. As of October 1994, the Department of State warned U.S.
citizens to avoid travel due to the unsettled conditions following the aftermath
of the civil war.</P>

<P>Senegal is a French speaking West African country. Facilities for tourists
are widely available although of varying quality. Visas are not required for
stays of less than 90 days. Medical facilities are limited, particularly in
areas outside the capital, Dakar. Street crime in Senegal poses moderate risks
for visitors. Most reported incidents involve pickpockets, purse snatchers and 
street scam artists.</P>

<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Sey">Seychelles</A></H5>
<P>Seychelles is a tropical island nation in the Indian Ocean off the east
coast of Africa. The principle island of Mahe has a population of about 50,000.
The two other islands with significant permanent populations are Praslin and La
Digue. Facilities for tourism are generally well developed. A visa is required
and may be issued on arrival for a stay of up to one month. There is no charge.
The visa may be extended for a period of up to one year. Medical facilities in
Seychelles are limited, especially in the isolated outer islands, where doctors
are often unavailable. Petty crime occurs, although violent crime against
tourists is considered to be rare. Keep valuables in hotel safes; close and lock
hotel windows at night, even while the room is occupied to minimize the risk of
crime.</P>
<P><A HREF="#seyindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Sierra">Sierra Leone</A></H5>
<P>Sierra Leone is a developing country which has few facilities for tourism
and poses considerable risks for travelers. Military activity and banditry
affect large parts of the country outside Freetown. Telephone service is
unreliable. A visa is required. Airport visas are not available upon arrival in
Sierra Leone. Yellow fever immunizatIons are required. Malaria suppressants are
recommended. Travelers must declare foreign currency being brought into Sierra
Leone. Declaration is made on an exchange control form which must be certified
and stamped at the port of entry. Medical facilities are limited and medicines
are in short supply. Sterility of equipment is questionable, and treatment is
often unreliable. Petty crime and theft of wallets and passports are common.
Requests for payments at military roadblocks are common. Permission is required
to photograph government buildings, airports, bridges or official-looking
buildings. Areas forbidding photography are not marked or defined. </P>

<H5><A NAME="Somalia">Somalia</A></H5>
<P>As of October 1994, U.S. citizens were warned not to travel to Somalia. The
Liaison Office in Mogodishu ceased operations in September 1994. No visas are
required because there is no functioning government. Anyone entering Somalia
must receive immunization against cholera, typhoid, and yellow fever, and obtain
a doctor's advice regarding any other immunizations that might be necessary.
There are virtually no health facilities or medicines available in Somalia.
Looting, banditry, and all forms of violent crime are common in Somalia,
particularly in the capital city of Mogodishu. Electricity, water, food, and
lodging are unobtainable on a regular basis.</P>

<H5><A NAME="South">South Africa</A></H5>
<P>Although South Africa is in many respects a developed country, much of its
population, particularly in rural areas, lives in poverty. The political
situation in South Africa remains unsettled as the country continues its
transition to a non-racial democracy. There are adequate facilities in all urban
centers, game parks and areas most commonly visited by tourists. Food and water
are generally safe, and a wide variety of consumer goods and pharmaceuticals are
readily available. Road conditions are generally good, but there is a very high
incidence of highway casualties, especially over holiday weekends. A passport 
valid for at least six months is required, but a visa is not required for visits
for holiday, business or transit purposes. Visas are required, however, for
extended stays, employment, study and for diplomatic and official passport
holders. Evidence of a yellow fever vaccination is necessary if arriving from an
infected area. Medical facilities are good in urban areas and in the vicinity of
game parks and beaches, but may be limited elsewhere. There is continuing and
significant street crime such as muggings, pickpocketing, and random street
violence, which affects foreigners as well as local residents, especially in the
center of major cities such as Johannesburg. </P>
<P><A HREF="#souindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Sudan">Sudan</A></H5>
<P>Sudan is a large underdeveloped country in northeastern Africa. Tourism
facilities are minimal. A visa is required to enter Sudan. The Sudanese
government recommends that malarial suppressants be taken, and that yellow
fever, cholera and meningitis vaccinations be in order. Visas are not granted in
passports showing Israeli visas. Travelers are required to register with police
headquarters within three days of arrival. Travelers must obtain police
permission before moving to another location in Sudan and must register with
police within 24 hours of arrival at the new location. The exchange of money at
other than an authorized banking institution may result in arrest and loss of
funds though unscrupulous black marketeers. A permit must be obtained before
taking photographs anywhere in Khartoum, as well as in the interior of the
country. Photographing military areas, bridges, drainage stations, broadcast
stations, public utilities, and slum areas or beggars is prohibited. Disruption
of water and electricity is frequent. Telecommunications are slow and often not
possible. Unforeseen circumstances such as sandstorms and electrical outages may
cause flight delays.</P>
<P><A HREF="#sudindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Swazi">Swaziland</A></H5>
<P>Swaziland is a small developing nation in southern Africa. Facilities for
tourism are available. Visas are not required of tourists planning to stay less
than 60 days. Temporary residence permits are issued in Mbabane, the capital.
For longer stays, visitors must report to immigration authorities or to a police
station within 48 hours of arrival, if they are not lodged in a hotel. Yellow
fever and cholera immunizations are required for visitors arriving from an
infected area. Anti-malarial treatment is recommended. Medical facilities are
limited. Petty street crime, primarily theft of money and personal property
occurs with some frequency. </P>
<P><A HREF="#swaindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Tanz">Tanzania</A></H5>
<P>Tanzania is an East African nation. Tourist facilities are adequate in major
cities, but limited in remote areas. A visa is required for entrance into the
country. Visas for mainland Tanzania are also valid for Zanzibar. Airport visas
may be obtained only in Zanzibar; they are not available at mainland airports.
Yellow fever and cholera immunizations are required if arriving from an affected
 area. Airport officials often require current immunizations records from
travelers arriving from non-infected areas as well. Medical facilities are
limited. Some medicines are in short supply or unavailable. Malaria is endemic
in Tanzania and anti-malarial prophylaxis are advisable. Numerous cases of
meningococcal meningitis and cholera have been reported throughout the country.
Crime is a concern in both urban and rural areas of Tanzania. Incidents include
muggings, vehicle thefts and residential break-ins. Valuables such as passports,
travelers checks, cameras and jewelry are particular targets for thieves, and
are easily stolen if left in luggage at airline check-ins or hotel lobbies.
Photography of military installations is forbidden. Individuals have been
detained and/or had their cameras and film confiscated for taking pictures of
hospitals, schools, bridges, industrial sites and airports.</P>
<P><A HREF="#tanindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Togo">Togo</A></H5>
<P>Togo is a small West African nation with a developing economy. Tourism
facilities are limited, especially outside the capital city. No visa is required
for a stay of less than three months. Yellow fever immunizations are required.
Medical facilities in Togo are limited under normal conditions and have degraded
because of a long general strike, the departure of medical personnel and the
closure or reduction of service in clinics and hospitals. Some medicines are
available through local pharmacies. Petty crime, including pickpocketing, has
increased.</P>
<P><A HREF="#togindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Uganda">Uganda</A></H5>
<P>Uganda is an East African nation. Tourism facilities are adequate in
Kampala; they are limited, but are improving in other areas. A visa is not
required for U.S. citizens. Evidence of immunization for yellow fever, cholera
and typhoid is often requested. Medical facilities in Uganda are limited.
Medical supplies, equipment and medication are often in short supply or not
available. Incidents of armed vehicle hijacking and armed highway robbery occur
throughout the country with varying frequency. Many roads in Uganda are poor,
and bandit activity in some areas is both frequent and unpredictable. Insurgent
activities have made travel to the northern area of the country risky. Highway
travel at night is particularly dangerous. Photographing security forces or
government installations is prohibited.</P>
<P><A HREF="#ugindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Zaire">Zaire</A></H5>
<P>Zaire is the largest sub-Saharan African country. Although Zaire has
substantial human and natural resources, in recent years, the country has
suffered a profound political and economic crisis. This has resulted in the
dramatic deterioration of the physical infrastructure of the country, insecurity
and an increase in crime in urban areas (including occasional episodes of
looting and murder in Kinshasa's streets). There have also been occasional
official hostility to U.S. citizens and nationals of European countries,
periodic shortages of basic needs such as gasoline, chronic shortages of
medicine and supplies for some basic medical care, hyperinflation, and
corruption. In some urban areas, malnutrition and starvation are acute. Tourism
facilities are minimal. A visa and vaccination certificate showing valid yellow
fever and cholera immunizations are required for entry. Medical facilities are
extremely limited. Medicine is in short supply. Most intercity roads are
difficult or impassable in the rainy season. While the U.S. dollar and travelers
checks can, in theory, be exchanged for local currency (zaires) at banks in
Kinshasa, banks often do not have sufficient new Zaire cash on hand to make
transactions. Credit cards are generally not accepted, except by a few major
hotels and restaurants. Photography of public buildings and/or military
installations is forbidden, including photography of the banks of the Congo
River. Offenders may to be arrested, held for a minimum of several hours, fined
and the film and camera may also be confiscated. </P>

<H5><A NAME="Zambia">Zambia</A></H5>
<P>Zambia is a developing African country. Tourist facilities outside of
well-known game parks are not fully developed. Visa are required prior to
entering the country. Medical facilities are limited. Cholera and yellow fever
are endemic. Crime is prevalent in Zambia. Muggings and petty theft are
commonplace, especially in Lusaka in the vicinity of Cairo Road and in other
commercial areas.</P>
<P><A HREF="#zamindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Zim">Zimbabwe</A></H5>
<P>Zimbabwe is a landlocked southern African nation with extensive tourist
facilities. Although no visa is required to enter Zimbabwe, immigration
authorities require a firm itinerary, sufficient funds for the visit, and a
return ticket to the United States. Onward tickets to non-U.S. destinations may
not suffice. If these requirements are not met, immigration authorities may
order departure by the next available flight. Medical facilities in Zimbabwe are
limited. Some medicine is in short supply. Muggings, purse snatching and
break-ins are an increasing problem in Harare, Bulawayo and tourist resorts
areas. Thieves often operate in downtown Harare, especially in crowded areas,
and on public transportation. Bus travel can be dangerous due to overloaded
buses, inadequate maintenance, unskilled drivers and occasional cases of drivers
operating buses while intoxicated. Zimbabwean authorities are extremely
sensitive about photographing certain locations and buildings, including
government offices, airports, military installations, official residences and
embassies.</P>
