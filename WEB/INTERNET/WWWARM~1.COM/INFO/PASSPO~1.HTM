<H4>PROTECT YOUR PASSPORT</H4>
<P>Your passport is the most valuable document you will carry abroad. It
confirms your U.S. citizenship. Guard it carefully. Do not use it as collateral
for a loan or lend it to anyone. It is your best form of identification.  You
will need it when you pick up mail or check into hotels, embassies or
consulates.</P>
<P>When entering some countries or registering at hotels, you may be asked to
fill out a police card listing your name, passport number, destination, local
address, and reason for traveling. You may be required to leave your passport at
the hotel reception desk overnight so it may be checked by local police
officials. These are normal procedures required by local laws. If your passport
is not returned the following morning, immediately report the impoundment to
local police authorities and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>PASSPORT FRAUD</H4>
<P>Law enforcement records show that U.S. passports are sometimes used for
illegal entry into the United States or by criminals abroad seeking to establish
another identity.  This can cause embarrassment to innocent citizens whose names
become associated with illegal activities.  To protect the integrity of the U.S.
passport and the security of the person bearing it, consular officers overseas
have found it necessary to take precautions in processing lost passport cases. 
These precautions may involve some delay before a new passport is issued.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>SAFEGUARD YOUR PASSPORT</H4>
<P>Carelessness is the main cause for losing a passport or having it stolen. 
You may find that you have to carry your passport with you because either you
need to show it when you cash travelers checks or the country you are in
requires you to carry it as an identity document.  When you must carry your
passport, hide it securely on your person.  Do not leave it in a handbag or an
exposed pocket.  Whenever possible, leave your passport in the hotel safe, not
in an empty hotel room or packed in your luggage.  One family member should not
carry all the passports for the entire family.</P>

&quot; Make two copies of the important information in your passport. Leave one
copy with a responsible friend or family member. Pack the other copy in another
piece of luggage. If your passport is lost or stolen this will make it easier to
obtain a replacement.&quot;</STRONG></P>
