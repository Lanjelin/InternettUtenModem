<CENTER><H1>Driving Abroad</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Obtain an International Drivers Permit (IDP).  This can be purchased through
your AAA club.  Have your passport photos and a completed application. There
will be a fee involved. Carry both your IDP and your state driver's license with
you at all times. Some things to keep in mind:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Some countries have a minimum and maximum driving age.  Check the
laws before you drive in any country.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Always &quot;buckle up&quot;.  Some countries have penalties for
people who violate this law.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If you rent a car, always purchase the liability insurance.  If
you do not, this could lead to financial disaster.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>As many countries have different driving rules, obtain a copy of
them before you begin driving in that country.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If the drivers in the country you are visiting drive on the
opposite side of the road than in the U.S., practice driving in a less populated
area before attempting to drive during the heavy traffic part of the day.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Be aware of the countryside you will be driving in.  Many
countries require you to honk your horn before going around a sharp corner or to
flash your lights before passing.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Find out before you start your journey who has the right of way in
a traffic circle.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Always know the route you will be traveling.  Have a copy of a
good road map, and chart your course before beginning.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Do not pick up hitchhikers or strangers.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>When entering your vehicle, be aware of your surroundings.</P>
