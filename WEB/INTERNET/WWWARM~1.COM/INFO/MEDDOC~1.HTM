<P></P> 
<P>If you go abroad with pre-existing medical problems, carry a letter from
your doctor describing your condition, including information on any prescription
medicines you must take.  You should also have the generic names of the drugs.
Leave medicines in their original, labeled containers.  These precautions make
customs processing easier.  A doctor's certificate, however, may not suffice as
authorization to transport all prescription drugs to all foreign countries. 
Travelers have innocently been arrested for drug violations when carrying items
not considered to be narcotics in the United States.  To ensure you do not
violate the drug laws of the countries you visit, consult the embassy or
consulate of those countries for precise information before leaving the United
States.</P>
<P>If you have allergies, reactions to certain medicines, or other unique
medical problems, consider wearing a medical alert bracelet or carrying a
similar warning.</P>
<P>Several private organizations provide listings of physicians to
international travelers.  Membership in these organizations is gemnerally free,
although a donation may be requested.  Membership entitles the traveler to a
number of traveler's medical aids, including a directory of physicians with
their overseas locations, telephone numbers and doctors' fee schedules.  The
physicians are generally English-speaking and provide medical assistance 24
hours a day.  The addresses of these medical organizations are in travel
magazines or may be available from your travel agent.</P>
