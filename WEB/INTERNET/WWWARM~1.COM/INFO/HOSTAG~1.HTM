<CENTER><H1>How to Survive If You Are Taken Hostage</H1>
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Any traveler could become a hostage. The odds of that happening are
extremely low when the number of travelers is compared to the number of people
that have actually become hostages. However, there is always that slim chance
that a traveller could end up being at the wrong place at the wrong time. With
this in mind, the traveler should make sure that his/her affairs are in order
before they travel abroad.  Items of particular importance to an individual in a
hostage situation are the currentness of an up-to-date will, an insurance policy
and a power of attorney for the spouse. If these items have been taken care of
before departure, the traveller will not have to worry about his family's
welfare; the hostage can then focus all of his/her efforts on the one thing of
paramount importance - SURVIVAL. </P>
<P>To survive, travelers should realize that there are certain dynamics
involved in a hijacking or a kidnapping, and, to increase their ability to
survive, they must understand how these interacting forces affect the end
result. Fear can trigger a disaster, and it does not take much for some
individuals to set off a defensive round of violence. Whether it is a
demonstration of violence to reinforce a demand or to incite fear in the minds
of the hostages, the violence will be motivated by fanaticism and/or fear and
that violence will be directed at the person(s) who are perceived to be a threat
or a nuisance to the hijackers.</P>
<P>To minimize the possibility of being selected for special attention by the
perpetrators and to maximize your ability to survive a hostage situation, here
are some guidelines to remember:</P>
<UL><LI><P>The physical takeover of an aircraft by the hijackers may be
characterized by noise, commotion, and possibly shooting and yelling, or it may
be quiet and methodical with little more than an announcement by a crew member. 
These first few minutes of the hijacking are crucial:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Stay calm, and encourage others around you to do the same.</LI></UL><BR><UL>

<LI><P>Remember that the hijackers are extremely nervous and are possibly
scared.</P></LI></UL><UL>
<LI><P>Comply with your captor(s) directions.</P></LI></UL><UL>
<LI><P>If shooting occurs, keep your head down and drop to the floor.</P>
</LI></UL><UL>
<LI><P>Remain alert.</P></LI></UL></LI></UL>   
<P>Once the takeover has occurred, you may be separated by citizenship, sex,
race, etc.  Your passport may be confiscated and your carry-on luggage
ransacked. The aircraft may be diverted to another country.  The hijackers may
enter into a negotiation phase which could last indefinitely and/or the crew may
be forced to fly the aircraft to yet another destination.  During this phase
passengers may be used as a bargaining tool in negotiations, lives may be
threatened, or a number of passengers may be released in exchange for fuel,
landing/departure rights, food, etc..  This will be the longest phase of the
hijacking:</P>
<UL><LI><P>If you are told to keep your head down or maintain another body
position, talk yourself into relaxing into the position; you may need to stay
that way for some time.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Prepare yourself mentally and emotionally for the long ordeal.
</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Do not attempt to hide your passport or belongings.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If addressed by the hijackers, respond in a regulated tone of
voice.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Use your time wisely by observing the characteristics and behavior
of the hijackers, mentally attach nicknames to each one and notice their dress,
facial features and temperaments.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If you or a nearby passenger are in need of assistance due to
illness or discomfort, solicit the assistance of a crew member first -- do not
attempt to approach a hijacker unless similar assistance has been rendered by
them for other passengers.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If you are singled out by the hijackers, be responsive but do not
volunteer information.</P></LI></UL>
<P>The last phase of the hijacking is resolution, be it by use of a hostage
rescue team or resolution through negotiation.  In the latter instance, the
hijackers may simply surrender to authorities or abandon the aircraft, crew and
passengers.  In the case of a hostage rescue operation to resolve the hijacking:
</P>
<UL><LI><P>The characteristics of a rescue entry into the aircraft will be
similar to the hijacker's takeover -- noise, chaos, possibly shooting.</P></LI>
</UL>
<UL><LI><P>If you hear shots fired inside or outside the aircraft,
immediately take a protective position -- put your head down or drop to the
floor.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If instructed by a rescue force to move, do so quickly, putting
your hands up in the air or behind your head; make no sudden movements.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If fire or smoke appears, attempt to get emergency exits open, and
use the inflatable slides or exit onto the wing.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Once you are on the tarmac, follow the instructions of the rescue
force or local authorities; if neither are there to guide you, move as quickly
as possible away from the aircraft and eventually move towards the terminal or
control tower area.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Expect to be treated as a hijacker or co-conspirator by the rescue
force;  initially you will be treated roughly until it is determined by the
rescue force that you are not part of the hijacking team.</P></LI></UL>
