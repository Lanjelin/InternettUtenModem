<P></P>
<P>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a severe, often
life-threatening, illness caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The
incubation period for AIDS is very long and variable, ranging from a few months
to many years. Some individuals infected with HIV have remained asymptomatic for
more than a decade. Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against infection
with HIV. Although there is no cure for AIDS, treatment for HIV infection and
prophylaxis for several opportunistic diseases that characterize AIDS are
available as a result of intense international research efforts.</P>
<P>HIV infection and AIDS have been reported worldwide. Comprehensive
surveillance systems are lacking in many countries, so that the true number of
cases is likely to be far greater than the numbers officially reported from
some, particularly the non-industrialized nations. The number of persons
infected with HIV is estimated by the World Health Organization to be in the
range of 13-14 million worldwide. Because HIV infection and AIDS are globally
distributed, the risk to international travelers is determined less by their
geographic destination than by their individual behavior. </P>
<P>HIV infection is preventable. HIV is transmitted through sexual intercourse,
needlesharing, by medical use of blood or blood components, and perinatally from
an infected woman. HIV is not transmitted through casual contact; air, food, or
water routes; contact with inanimate objects; or thorough mosquitoes or other
arthropod vectors. The use of any public conveyance (e.g., airplane, automobile,
boat, bus, train) by persons AIDS or HIV infection does not pose a risk of
infection for the crew other passengers.</P>
<UL><LI><P>Travelers are at risk if they:</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>have sexual intercourse (heterosexual or homosexual) with an
infected person;</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>use or allow the use of contaminated, unsterilized syringes, or
needles for any injections or other skin-piercing procedures including
acupuncture, use of illicit drugs, steroid injections, medical/dental
procedures, ear piercing, or tattooing;</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>use infected blood, blood components, or clotting factor
concentrates. HIV infection by this routes is a rare occurrence in those
countries or cities where donated blood/plasma is screened for the HIV antibody.
