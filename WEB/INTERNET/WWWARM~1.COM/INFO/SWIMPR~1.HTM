<P></P> 
<P>Swimming in contaminated water may result in skin, eye, ear, and certain
intestinal infections, particularly if the swimmer's head is submerged. 
Generally, only pools that contain chlorinated water can be considered safe
places to swim.  In certain areas, fatal primary amoebic meningoencephalitis has
occurred following swimming in warm dirty water.  Swimmers should avoid beaches
that might be contaminated with human sewage, or with dog feces.  Wading or
swimming should be avoided in freshwater streams, canals, and lakes liable to be
infested with the snail hosts of schistosomiasis (bilharziasis) or contaminated
with urine from animals infected with <B>Leptospira</B>.  Biting or stinging
fish and corals and jelly fish may provide a hazard to the swimmer.  Never swim
alone or when under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and never dive head first
into an unfamiliar body of water.</P>
