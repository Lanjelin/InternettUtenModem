<CENTER><H1>Obtaining a Visa</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>A visa is an endorsement or stamp placed in your passport by a foreign
government that permits you to visit that country for a specified purpose and a
limited time -- for example, a 3-month tourist visa.  It is advisable to obtain
visas before you leave the United States because you will not be able to obtain
visas for some countries once you have departed.  Apply directly to the embassy
or nearest consulate of each country you plan to visit, or consult a travel
agent.  <B>Passport agencies cannot help you obtain visas.</B></P>
<P>&quot;Foreign Entry Requirements&quot; (Department of State publication
M-264)  gives entry requirements for every country and tells where and how to
apply for visas and tourist cards.  It can be ordered for $0.50 from the
Consumer Information Center, Pueblo, Colorado 81009.  Note:  The publication is
updated annually but may not reflect the most current requirements.  It is
advisable to verify the latest visa requirements with the embassy or consulate
of each country you plan to visit.</P>
<P>Because a visa is stamped directly onto a blank page in your passport, you
will need to give your passport to an official of each foreign embassy or
consulate.  You will also need to fill out a form, and you may need one or more
photographs.  Many visas require a fee.  The process may take several weeks for
each visa, so apply well in advance of your trip.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Tourist Card</STRONG></P>
<P>If the country you plan to visit only requires a tourist card, obtain one
from the country's embassy or consulate, from an airline serving the country, or
at the port of entry.  There is a fee for some tourist cards.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Proof of Citizenship</STRONG></P>
<P>Check with the embassy or consulate of each country you plan to visit to
learn what proof of citizenship is required of visitors.  Even if a country does
not require a visitor to have a passport, it will require some proof of
citizenship and identity.  Remember that no matter what proof of citizenship a
foreign country requires, U.S. Immigration has strict requirements for your
reentry into the United States.</P>
