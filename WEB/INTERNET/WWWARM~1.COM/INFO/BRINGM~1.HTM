<CENTER><H1>How to Bring Money When Traveling Abroad</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>TRAVELERS CHECKS</STRONG></P>
<P>Do not carry large amounts of cash.  Take most of your money in travelers
checks and remember to record the serial number, denomination and the date and
location of the issuing bank or agency.  Keep this information in a safe and
separate place so if you lose your travelers checks you can get replacements
quickly.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>CREDIT CARDS</STRONG></P>
<P>Some credit cards can be used worldwide, even for cash advances.  <STRONG>Keep
track of your credit card purchases so as not to exceed your limit.  Travelers
have been arrested overseas for mistakenly exceeding their credit limit!
</STRONG>  Leave all unnecessary credit cards at home.  Record the numbers of
the credit cards that you do bring and keep a list in a separate place from the
cards.</P>
<P>Always report the loss or theft of your credit cards or travelers checks
immediately to the companies and notify the local police.  If you will stay in
one place for some time, consider opening an account for check cashing and other
transactions at a U.S. bank that has an overseas affiliate.  U.S. embassies and
consulates cannot cash checks for you.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>PREPARE FOR EMERGENCY FUNDS</STRONG></P>
<P>Keep the telephone number for your bank in the United States with you in the
event you run out of cash and need to transfer money.  In some countries, major
banks and certain travel agencies can help you arrange a transfer of funds from
your account to a foreign bank.  If you do not have a bank account from which
you can obtain emergency funds, make arrangements in advance with a relative or
friend to send you emergency funds should it become necessary.  If you find
yourself destitute, contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate for assistance
in arranging a money wire transfer from a relative or friend in the United
States.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>FOREIGN CURRENCY</STRONG></P>
<P>Before departing, you may wish to purchase small amounts of foreign currency
to use for buses, taxis, phones, or tips when you first arrive.  Foreign
exchange facilities at airports may be closed when your flight arrives.  You can
purchase foreign currency at some U.S. banks, at foreign exchange firms, or at
foreign exchange windows or even vending machines at many international airports
in the United States.</P>
<P>Some countries regulate the amount of local currency you can bring into or
take out of the country; others require that you exchange a minimum amount of
currency.  For currency regulations, check with a bank, foreign exchange firm,
your travel agent, or the embassy or consulate of the countries you plan to
visit.</P>
<P>If you leave or enter the United States with more than $10,000 in monetary
instruments of any kind, you must file a report, Customs Form 4790, with U.S.
Customs at the time.  Failure to comply can result in civil and criminal
proceedings.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>VALUABLES--DON'T BRING THEM!</STRONG></P>
<P>Do not bring anything on your trip that you would hate to lose such as
expensive jewelry, family photographs, or objects of sentimental value.  If you
bring jewelry, wear it discreetly to help avoid grab-and-run robbery.   </P>
