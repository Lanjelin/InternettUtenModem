<CENTER><H1>Guidelines to Survive a Kidnapping</H1>  
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Kidnappings can take place in public areas where someone may quietly force
you, by gunpoint, into a vehicle.  They can also take place at a hotel or
residence, again by using a weapon to force your cooperation in leaving the
premises and entering a vehicle.  The initial phase of kidnapping is a critical
one because it provides one of the best opportunities to escape. If you are
abducted:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Do not struggle in your confined state; calm yourself mentally,
concentrate on surviving.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Employ your mind by attempting to visualize the route being taken,
take note of turns, street noise, smells, etc.  Try to keep track of the amount
of time spent between points.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Once you have arrived at your destination, you may be placed in a
temporary holding area before being moved again to a more permanent detention
site.  If you are interrogated:</P><UL>
<LI><P>Retain a sense of pride but be cooperative.</P></LI></UL><UL>
<LI><P>Divulge only information that cannot be used against you</P></LI></UL><UL>

<LI>Do not antagonize your interrogator with obstinate behavior.</LI></UL><BR><UL>

<LI>Concentrate on surviving; if you are to be used as a bargaining tool or to
obtain ransom, you will be kept alive.</LI></UL></LI></UL>  
<P>After reaching what you may presume to be your permanent detention site (you
may be moved several more times), quickly settle into the situation:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Be observant -- Notice the details of the room, the sounds of
activity in the building and determine the layout of the building by studying
what is visible to you.  Listen for sounds through the walls, windows or out in
the streets, and try to distinguish between smells.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Stay mentally active by memorizing the aforementioned details. 
Exercise your memory and practice retention.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Keep track of time.  Devise a way to track the day, date and the
time, and use it to devise a daily schedule of activities for yourself.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Know your captors.  Memorize their schedule, look for patterns of
behavior to be used to your advantage, and identify weaknesses or
vulnerabilities.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Use all of the above information to seek opportunities to escape.
</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Remain cooperative.  Attempt to establish rapport with your
captors or guards.  Once a level of communication is achieved, try asking for
items which will increase your personal comfort.  Make them aware of your needs.
</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Stay physically active, even if your movement is extremely
limited.  Use isometric and flexing exercises to keep your muscles toned.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>DO NOT</B> be uncooperative, antagonistic, or hostile towards
your captors.  It is a fact that hostages who display this type of behavior are
kept captive longer or are singled out for torture or punishment.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Watch for signs of Stockholm Syndrome which occurs when the
captive, due to the close proximity and the constant pressures involved, begins
to relate to, and empathize with, the captors.  In some cases, this relationship
has resulted in the hostage becoming empathetic to the point that he/she
actively participates in the activities of the group.  You should attempt to
establish a friendly rapport with your captors, but maintain your personal
dignity and do not compromise your integrity.</P>
</LI></UL>
<P>If you are able to escape, attempt to get first to a U.S. Embassy or
Consulate to seek protection.  If you cannot reach either, go to a host
government or friendly government entity.</P>
