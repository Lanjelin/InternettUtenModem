<P></P>
<P>The locks on your luggage are not that secure when it comes to the
professional thief or manipulator and are really no more than a deterrent.  But,
if time is of the essence to the perpetrator, and it usually is when a crime is
involved, there are a couple of suggestions that might deter surreptitious entry
and/or theft:</P>
<UL><LI><P>For added security on all luggage, run a strip of nylon filament
tape around the suitcase to preclude its opening accidentally if dropped or
mistreated by baggage handlers.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>For luggage and briefcases with two combination locks, reset the
combination locks from the factory combination (000) to different combinations
on each of the right and left locks.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>For luggage with single locks, set the lock on each piece of
luggage with a different combination.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>DO NOT pack extra glasses or necessary daily medication in your
luggage.  Carry it in your briefcase, purse or pocket.  If you are the victim of
a hijacking you may need these items -- if they are in your luggage, you
probably will not be able to get to them.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>On your luggage use your business address and telephone number. 
If possible, use a closed name tag with a cover.  Do not use a laminated
business card on your luggage, and avoid putting the company name or any logos
on your luggage.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Check with the airline and/or your personal insurance company
regarding any lost luggage coverage.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Make sure you use sturdy luggage.  Do not over pack as the luggage
could open if dropped.  Bind the luggage with strapping so that it will remain
intact.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Never place your valuables (jewelry, money and travelers checks)
in your checked luggage.  Never leave your bags unattended.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Consider obtaining a modest amount of foreign currency before you
leave your home country.  Criminals often watch for and target international
travelers purchasing large amounts of foreign currency at airport banks and
currency exchange windows.</P>
