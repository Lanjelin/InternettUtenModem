<P></P>
<P>Learn about U.S. Customs regulations.  Foreign-made personal articles taken
abroad are subject to duty and tax unless you have proof of prior possession
such as a receipt, bill of sale, an insurance policy, or a jeweler's appraisal.
If you do not have proof of prior possession, items such as foreign-made
watches, cameras, or tape recorders that can be identified by serial number or
permanent markings may be taken to the Customs office nearest you or at the port
of departure for registration before departing the United States.  The
certificate of registration provided can expedite free entry of these items when
you return. </P>
