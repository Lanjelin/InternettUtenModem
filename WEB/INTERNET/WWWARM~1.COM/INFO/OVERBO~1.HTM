<H1>Overbooking Flights</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Overbooking is not illegal, and most airlines overbook their scheduled
flights to a certain extent in order to compensate for &quot;no-shows&quot;. 
Passengers are sometimes left behind or &quot;bumped&quot; as a result.  When an
oversale occurs, the U. S. Department of Transportation  requires airlines to
ask people who aren't in a hurry to give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange
for compensation.  Those  passengers bumped against their will are, with a few
exceptions, entitled to compensation.</P>
<P><STRONG>VOLUNTARY BUMPING</STRONG></P>
<P>Almost any group of airline passengers includes some people with urgent
travel needs and others who may be more concerned about the cost of their
tickets than about getting to their destination on time.  The rules require
airlines to seek out people who are willing to give up their seats for some
compensation before bumping anyone involuntarily.  Here's how this works. </P>
<P>At the check-in or boarding area, airline employees will look for volunteers
when it appears that the flight has been oversold.  If you're not in a rush to
arrive at your next destination, you can give your reservation back to the
airline in exchange for compensation and a later flight.</P>
<P>The Department of Transportation has not said how much the airline has to
give volunteers.  This means carriers may negotiate with their passengers for a
mutually acceptable amount of money-or maybe a free trip or other benefits. 
Airlines give employees guidelines for bargaining with passengers, and they may
select those volunteers willing to sell back their reservations for the lowest
price.</P>
<P>If the airline offers you a free ticket, ask about restrictions.  How long
is the ticket good for?  Is it &quot;blacked out&quot; during holiday periods
when you might want to use it?  Can it be used for international flights?  Most
importantly, can you make a reservation, and if so, how far before departure are
you permitted to make it?</P>
<P><STRONG>INVOLUNTARY BUMPING</STRONG></P>
<P>The U.S. Department of Transportation requires each airline to give all
passengers who are bumped involuntarily a written statement describing their
rights and explaining how the carrier decides who gets on an oversold flight and
who doesn't.  Those travelers who don't get to fly are frequently entitled to an
on-the-spot payment of denied boarding compensation.  The amount depends on the
price of their ticket and the length of the delay.</P>
<P>The most effective way to reduce the risk of being bumped is to get to the
airport early.  On oversold flights the last passengers to check in are usually
the first to be bumped, even if they have met the check-in deadline.  Allow
extra time: assume that the airport access road is backed up, the parking lot is
full, and there is a long line at the check-in counter.  However, if you arrive
so early that your airline has another flight to your destination leaving before
the one that you are booked on, either switch to the earlier flight or don't
check your bag until after the first flight leaves.  If you check your bag right
away, it might get put on the earlier flight and remain unattended at your
destination airport for hours.</P>
<P>Airlines may offer free transportation on future flights in place of a check
for denied boarding compensation.  However, if you are bumped involuntarily you
have the right to insist on a check if that is your preference. Once you cash
the check (or accept the free flight), you will probably lose the right to
demand more money from the airline later on.  However, if being bumped costs you
more money than the airline will pay you at the airport, you can try to
negotiate a higher settlement with their complaint department.  If this doesn't
work, you usually have 30 days from the date on the check to decide if you want
to accept the amount of the check.  You are always free to decline the check and
take the airline to court to try to obtain more compensation.  The government's
denied-boarding regulation spells out the airlines' minimum obligation to people
they bump involuntarily.</P>
<P>Finally, don't be a &quot;no-show&quot;.  If you are holding confirmed
reservations you don't plan to use, notify the airline.  If you don't, they will
cancel all onward or return reservations on your trip.</P>
