<P></P> 
<P>Animals in general tend to avoid human beings, but they can attack,
particularly if they are with young.  In areas of endemic rabies, domestic dogs,
cats, or other animals should not be petted.  Wild animals should be avoided.
</P>
<P>The bites, stings and contact of some insects cause unpleasant reactions. 
Medical attention should be sought if an insect bite or sting causes redness,
swelling, bruising, or persistent pain.  Many insects also transmit communicable
diseases.  Some insects can bite and transmit disease without the person being
aware of the bite, particularly when camping or staying in rustic or primitive
accomodations.  Insect repellents, protective clothing, and mosquito netting are
advisable in many parts of the world.</P>
<P>Poisonous snakes are hazards in many parts of the world, although deaths
from snake bites are relatively rare.  The Australian brown snake, Russell's
viper and cobras in southern Asia, carpet vipers in the Middle East, and coral
and rattlesnakes in the Americas are particularly dangerous.  Most snakebites
are a direct result of handling or harassing snakes, which bite as a defensive
reaction.  Attempts to kill snakes are dangerous, often leading to bites on the
fingers.  The venom of a small or immature snakes may be even more concentrated
than that of a larger individual, therefore, all snakes should be left strictly
alone.</P>
<P>Less than half of all snake bite wounds actually contain venom, but medical
attention should be sought anytime a bite wound breaks the skin.  A pressure
bandage, ice (if available), and immobilization of the affected limp are
recommended first aid measures while the victim is moved as quickly as possible
to a medical facility.  Specific therapy for snakebite is controversial, and
should be left to the judgement of local emergency medical personnel.  Snakes
tend to be active at night and in warm weather.  As a precaution, boots and long
pants may be worn when walking outdoors at night in snake infested regions. 
</P>
<P>Bites from scorpions may be painful but seldom are dangerous except possibly
in infants.  In general, exposure to bites can be avoided by sleeping under
mosquito nets and by shaking clothing and shoes before putting them on,
particularly in the morning. Snakes and scorpions tend to rest in shoes and
clothing.</P>
