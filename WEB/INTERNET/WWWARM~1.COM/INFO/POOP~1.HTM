<CENTER><H1>Traveler's Diarrhea</H1>
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<H4>Epidemiology</H4>
<P>Traveler's diarrhea (TD) is a syndrome characterized by a twofold or greater
increase in the frequency of unformed bowel movements. Commonly associate
symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea, bloating, urgency, fever, and
malaise. Episodes of TD usually begin abruptly, occur during travel or soon
after returning home, and are generally self-limited. The most important
determinate of risk is the destination of the traveler. Attack rates in the
range of 20 to 50 percent are commonly reported. High risk destinations include
most of the developing countries of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia. Intermediate risk destinations include most of the Southern European
countries and a few Caribbean islands. Low risk destinations include Canada,
Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and a number of the
Caribbean islands.</P>
<P>TD is slightly more common in young adults than in older people. The reasons
for this difference are unclear, but may include a lack of acquired immunity,
more adventurous travel styles and different eating habits. Attack rate are
similar in men and women. The onset of TD is usually within the first week, but
may occur at any time during the visit, and even after returning home.</P>
<P>TD is acquired through ingestion of fecally contaminated food and or water.
Both cooked land uncooked foods may implicated if improperly handled. Especially
risky foods include raw meat, raw seafood, and raw fruits and vegetables. Tap
water, ice, and unpasteurized milk and dairy products may be associated with
increased risk of TD; safe beverages include bottled carbonated beverages
(especially flavored beverage), beer, wine, hot coffee or tea, or water boiled
or appropriately treated with iodine or chlorine. </P>
<P></P>
<H4>Etiology</H4>
<P>Infectious agents are the primary cause of TD. Travelers from industrialized
countries to developing countries frequently develop a rapid, dramatic change in
the type of organisms in their gastrointestinal tract. These new organisms often
include potential enteric pathogens. Those who develop diarrhea have ingested an
inoculum of virulent organisms sufficiently large to overcome individual defense
mechanism, resulting in symptoms.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>Prevention</H4>
<P>There are four possible approaches to prevention of TD. They include
instruction regarding food and beverage consumption, immunization, use of
non-antimicrobial medications, and prophylactic antimicrobial drugs.</P>
<P>Data indicate that meticulous attention to food and beverage consumption can
decrease the likelihood of developing TD. Most travel ers, however, encounter
difficulty in observing the requisite dietary restrictions.</P>
<P>No available vaccines and none that are expected to be available in the next
5 years are effective against TD.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>Treatment</H4>
<P>Individuals with TD have two major complaints for which they desire relief
-- abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Many agents have been proposed to control
these symptoms, but few have been demonstrated to be effective by rigorous
clinical trials.</P>
<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Nonspecific Agents: </STRONG>A variety of &quot;adsorbents&quot;
have been used in treating diarrhea. For example, activated charcoal has been
found to be ineffective in the treatment of diarrhea. Kaolin and pectin have
been widely used for diarrhea. The combination appears to give the stools more
consistency but has often shown to decrease cramps and frequency of stools nor
to shorten the course of infectious diarrhea.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Antimicrobial Treatment:</STRONG>Travelers should consult
a physician, rather than attempt self-medication, if the diarrhea is severe or
does not resolve within several days; if there is blood and/or mucus in the
stool; if fever occurs with shaking chills; or if there is dehydration with
persistent diarrhea.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Oral Fluids: </STRONG>Most cases of diarrhea are
self-limited and require only simple replacement of fluids and salts lost in
diarrheal stools. This is best achieved by use of an oral rehydration solution
such a World Health Organization Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) solution. This
solution is appropriate for treating as well as preventing dehydration. ORS
packets are available at stores or pharmacies in almost all developing
countries. ORS is prepared by adding one packet to boiled or treated water.
Packet instructions should be checked carefully to ensure the salts are added to
the correct volume of water. ORS solution should be consumed or discarded within
12 hours if held at room temperature, or 24 hours if held refrigerated.</P>
