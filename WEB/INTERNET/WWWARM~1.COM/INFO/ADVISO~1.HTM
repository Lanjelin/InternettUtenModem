<P>The Department of State issues travel advisories to alert U.S. citizens to
conditions overseas that may affect them adversely.  There are three types of
travel advisories:</P>
<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: recommends deferral of travel to all or
part of a country.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Caution</STRONG>: advises about unusual security
conditions, including the potential for unexpected detention, unstable political
conditions, or serious health problems.  It is not intended to deter travel to a
country.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Notice</STRONG>: provides information on situations that
do not present a broad scale risk, but which could result in inconvenience or
difficulty for traveling Americans.</P>
</LI></UL>
<P>Travel advisories are posted at U.S. passport agencies, Department of
Commerce field offices, and at U.S. embassies and consulates around the world.
They are distributed to the travel and airline industry and can be found through
airline computer reservation systems.  If you plan travel to an area or country
where there is some concern about existing conditions, find out if there is a
travel advisory by contacting the nearest passport agency or your travel agent
or airline.  You may also listen to recorded travel advisories, 24-hours a day. 
Call the Department of State's Citizens Emergency Center on 202-647-5225.</P>
