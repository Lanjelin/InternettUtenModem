<H4><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H4>
<P>Travelers to Central and South America are usually welcomed with courtesy
and warmth. There is great diversity in the region - you can  visit some of the
largest cities in the world as well as some of the most unspoiled primitive
environments. You can have a wonderful trip; however, there are some precautions
to take.</P>
<P><A HREF="#introindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="advis">Travel Advisories</A></H4>
<P>The Department of State issues travel advisories concerning serious health
or security conditions that may affect U.S. citizens. Current advisories are
available at the 13 regional passport agencies in the United States and from the
Citizens Emergency Center, Room 4811, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520,
(202) 647-5225. Advisories are also available at U.S. embassies and consulates
abroad. Some of the dangers covered in these advisories are guerrilla or
terrorist activity, banditry, and areas under control of narcotics producers.
</P>
<P>As you travel, keep abreast of local news coverage. If you plan more than a
short stay in one place, expect to travel to an area where communications are
poor, or if you are in an area experiencing civil unrest or natural disaster,
you are encouraged to register with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.
Registration takes only a few moments, and it may be invaluable in case of an
emergency. Remember also to leave a detailed itinerary and the number of your
passport with a friend or relative in the United States.</P>
<P><A HREF="#advisindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Getting">Getting In and Out</A></H4>
<P>U.S. citizens must have a valid U.S. passport to travel to all countries in
Central or South America, except for Costa Rica. (Costa Rica requires proof of
U.S. citizenship, such as a birth certificate, and proof of identity.) Visa
requirements for U.S. citizens vary from country to country: some countries do
not require a visa for a tourist stay of 9O days or less; for some you need to
obtain a tourist card from the airline office or the destination airport; for
other countries you must obtain a visa in advance from the country's embassy or 
consulate. Some countries have additional entry requirements such as proof of
sufficient funds or proof of onward or return tickets.</P>
<P>In addition, all South American countries and most Central American
countries require a departure tax. If you are departing to a neighboring
country, the tax may be small, but, if you are returning to the U.S., the tax
could be as high as $50 per person. <B>Be sure to have enough money at the end
of your trip to be able to get on the plane.</B></P>
<P>For authoritative information on a country's entry and exit requirements,
contact its embassy or consulate  When you make your inquiries, ask about;</P>

<P>Review your health insurance policy. If it does not cover you abroad,
consider purchasing insurance that does. Also consider obtaining insurance to
cover the very high cost of medical evacuation in event of accident or serious
illness.</P>
<P>Depending on your destination, immunization may be recommended against
diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis, polio, rabies, typhoid, and yellow fever. </P>
<P>Malaria is found in rural areas of every country in the region, except Chile
and Uruguay. Malaria prophylaxis and mosquito avoidance measures are
recommended. When possible, avoid contact with mosquitoes from dusk to dawn by
wearing long clothing and using insect repellent on exposed skin. Use a flying
insect spray and a bed net in living quarters. Prophylaxis should begin 2 weeks
before going to an area where malaria is endemic and should continue for at
least 4 weeks after leaving. Chloroquine is the malaria prophylaxis most easily
tolerated by the body. However, malaria resistant to chloroquine has been
reported in an area beginning east of the Panama Canal and extending through
northern South America as far south as the Amazon Basin. If you plan to visit
this area, consult a medical expert to work out an additional prophylaxis. At
times, however, malaria may break through any drug or drug combination. </P>
<P>If you develop chills, fever, and headaches while taking a malaria
prophylaxis, seek medical attention promptly. Early treatment of malaria can be
effective, but delaying therapy could have serious consequences. </P>
<P>Mosquito avoidance measures, if used day and night, may also help prevent
other less prevalent insect-borne diseases found in parts of Central and South
America such as Chagas' disease, dengue fever, leishmaniasis, and yellow fever.
</P>
<P>Throughout most of Central and South America, fruits and vegetables should
be washed with care and meats and fish thoroughly cooked. Problems of food
contamination are less prevalent in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, and tap water
is potable in those countries. Elsewhere water is generally not potable and
should be boiled or chemically treated. Diarrhea caused by contaminated food is
potentially serious. If it persists, seek medical attention.</P>
<P>Certain beaches in the region, including some at or near Lima, Montevideo,
Rio de Janeiro, and Valparaiso are dangerously polluted. Avoid swimming at
beaches that might be contaminated with human sewage or dog feces. Avoid
swimming in fresh water in areas where schistosomiasis is found: Brazil,
Suriname, and north-central Venezuela.</P>
<P>Visitors in the Andes may experience symptoms of altitude sickness such as
insomnia, headache, and nausea. If you become sick, wait until your symptoms
disappear before you attempt to go higher. Mountaineers should learn about the
symptoms of high altitude pulmonary edema, a condition that is fatal unless
remedied by immediate descent.</P>
<P>Another hazard of high altitudes is sunburn. Exposure to ultraviolet
radiation increases not only as you approach the equator, but also as you ascend
in altitude. Sunscreens may help prevent this.</P>

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="crime">Safety Tips-Crime</A></H4>
<P>Like many large cities throughout the world, major cities in Central and
South America experience assaults, robberies, and thefts. Visitors should take
common sense precautions:</P>
<UL><LI><P><B>Safety begins when you pack.</B> Leave expensive jewelry
behind. Dress conservatively; a flashy wardrobe or one that is too casual can
mark you as a tourist. Use travelers checks, not cash. Leave photocopies of your
passport personal information page and of your airline tickets with someone at
home and carry an extra set of copies with you.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>Use a money belt</B> or a concealed money pouch for passports,
cash, and other valuables. In a car, keep doors locked, windows rolled up, and
valuables  out of sight. A common trick is for a thief to reach through a car
window and grab a watch from a person's wrist or a purse or package from the
seat while you are driving slowly or stopped in traffic.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>When you leave your car</B>, try to find a guarded parking
lot, lock the car, and keep valuables out of sight.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>When walking</B>, avoid dark alleys, crowds, and marginal
areas of cities. Do not stop if you are approached on the street by strangers,
including street vendors and beggars. Be aware that women and small children, as
well as men, can be pickpockets or purse snatchers. Keep your billfold in an
inner front pocket, carry your purse tucked securely under your arm, and wear
the shoulder strap of your camera or bag across your chest. To guard against
thieves on motorcycles, walk away from the curb, carrying your purse away from
the street.
</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>Whenever possible, do not travel alone.</B> If you travel in
isolated areas, go with a group or a reputable guide.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>Avoid travel at night.</B></P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>Do not take valuables to the beach.</B></P></LI></UL>
<P>Any U.S. citizen who is criminally assaulted should report the incident to
the local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.</P>
<P><A HREF="#crimindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="unrest">Safety Tips - Civil Unrest</A></H4>
<P>Several countries in Central and South America have areas of instability or
war zones that are off-limits to visitors without special permits. Others have
similar areas that are open but surrounded by security check points where
travelers must show their passport or tourist card. Always carry your papers
with you, and do not overstay the validity of your visa or tourist card.</P>
<P>Avoid public demonstrations. American citizens have been arrested when local
authorities have thought they were participating in civil demonstrations. If you
are detained or arrested for this or any reason, ask to speak with a U. S.
consular officer.</P>
<P><A HREF="#unrestindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Drug">Drug Offenses</A></H4>
<P>Most Central and South American countries strictly enforce laws against the
use, possession, and sale of narcotics. Foreigners arrested for possession of
even small amounts of narcotics are generally charged and tried as
inter-national traffickers. There is no bail, judicial delays are lengthy, and
you can spend 2 to 4 years in prison awaiting trial and sentencing. If you carry
prescription drugs, keep them in their original container, clearly labeled with
the doctor's name, pharmacy, and contents. You may wish to check with the
embassy of the country you plan to visit for specific customs requirements for
prescription drugs.</P>
<P><A HREF="#drugindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="photo">Photography</A></H4>
<P>Be cautious when taking pictures. Local authorities in Central and South
American countries consider all airports, police stations, military locations,
oil installations, harbors, mines, and bridges to be security-related.
Photography of demonstrations or civil disturbances is also usually prohibited.
Tourists have had their film confiscated and have been detained for trying to
take these types of pictures. When in doubt about whether you can take a
picture, ask first.</P>
<P><A HREF="#photoindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="wild">U.S. Wildlife Regulations</A></H4>
<P>Endangered species and products made from them may not be brought into the
United States. The penalty is confiscation and a possible fine. These items are
prohibited from import: virtually all birds originating in Brazil, Ecuador,
Paraguay, and Venezuela; furs from spotted cats; most lizard-skin products from
Brazil and Paraguay; many snakeskin products from Brazil, Ecuador, and Paraguay;
skins from the Orinoco crocodile; and all sea turtle products.</P>
<P><A HREF="#wildindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Shopping">Shopping for Antiques</A></H4>
<P>Most countries in Central and South America control the export of objects
from their pre-Columbian and colonial heritage. Some countries claim ownership
of all such material and consider the export of antiques, without the permission
of the government, to be an act of theft. In addition, under U.S. law, importers
of all pre-Columbian monumental and architectural sculpture, murals, and certain
archaeological and ethnological materials are required to provide proof to the
U.S. Customs Service that these artifacts are legally exported from the country
of origin. Beware of purchasing artifacts unless they are accompanied by an
export permit issued by the government of origin.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Additional">Additional Country Information </A></H4>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="Belize">Belize</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Belize enforces a strict policy of refusing admittance to persons who an
immigration officer suspects of drug use.</P>
<P><A HREF="#belindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="Brazil">Brazil</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Obtain your visa in advance. Brazilian immigration authorities do not
hesitate to require a traveler without a visa to leave on the next available
flight. Street crime can be a major problem in large cities in Brazil. In Sao
Paulo, if you encounter difficulties or need emergency assistance, dial 190,
radio police patrol, from any public telephone. No coin or token is needed for
the call.</P>
<P><A HREF="#braindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="Chile">Chile</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Anyone considering scientific, technical, or mountaineering expeditions to
regions in Chile classified as frontier areas or to Antarctica must apply for
authorization to a Chilean embassy or consulate a minimum of 90 days prior to
the beginning of the expedition. The application will be forwarded to the
Chilean government for decision. Chilean authorities reserve the right to
request Chilean participation in foreign expeditions and require the submission
of a post-expedition report on the activities undertaken and the results
obtained.</P>
<P><A HREF="#chindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="Costa">Costa Rica</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Although U.S. citizens do not need a passport to enter Costa Rica, it is a
good idea that you have one, particularly if you plan to stay more than 30 days.
Some Americans have experienced difficulties in cashing travelers checks without
a passport. Costa Rica strictly enforces immigration rules. If you need to
extend your visa, do so promptly with local authorities.</P>
<P><A HREF="#coindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="Ecuador">Ecuador</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Travelers to the Galapagos islands should be aware that there are few
medical facilities on the islands and cruise ships may also offer only limited
medical care. Moving about the islands in the equatorial heat requires physical
exertion and may be debilitating to someone in poor health. Before traveling,
you may wish to consult the U.S. Consulate General in Guayaquil for more
information.</P>
<P>To travel to the Galapagos by private yacht, you must have a license from
the Ecuadorian Ministry of Defense. You may apply through an Ecuadorian embassy
or consulate, but do so well in advance because approval can take from 1 to 3
months.</P>
<P><A HREF="#ecuindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="El">El Salvador</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Pre-Hispanic artifacts from the Cara Sucia archaeological region are
prohibited entry into the United States unless accompanied by proof that they
were exported with the permission of the government of El Salvador.</P>
<P><A HREF="#elindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</A></STRONG></P>
<P>Upon entry, tourists may need to show $200 as proof of sufficient funds for
their stay. They must exchange $60 upon arrival at the airport.</P>
<P><A HREF="#nicindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG><A NAME="Panama">Panama</A></STRONG></P>
<P>U.S. citizen are encouraged to obtain a U.S. passport before travelling to
Panama. Although (<I>in an emergency</I>, A.W.) entry into Panama is permitted
with any proof of U.S. citizenship (such as a certified birth certificate or a
naturalization certificate) and official photo identification (such as a
driver's licence), some travelers have experienced difficulties returning to the
U.S. when not in possession of a valid U.S. passport. Travelers must either
purchase a tourist card from the airline serving Panama ($5.00) or obtain a visa
from a Panamanian embassy or consulate before traveling to Panama. Further
information may be obtained from the Embassy of Panama, 2862 McGill Terrace,
N.W., Washington D.C. 20008, telephone (202)483-1407. [<I>Panama - Consular
