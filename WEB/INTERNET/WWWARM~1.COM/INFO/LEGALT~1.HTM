<CENTER><H1>Legal Tips When Traveling Abroad</H1></CENTER>
<P></P> 
<P><STRONG>OBEY FOREIGN LAWS</STRONG></P>
<P>When you are in a foreign country, you are subject to its laws.  Learn about
local laws and regulations and obey them.  Avoid areas of unrest and
disturbance.  Deal only with authorized outlets when exchanging money or buying
airline tickets and travelers checks.  Do not deliver a package for anyone
unless you know the person well and are certain the package does not contain
drugs or other contraband.</P>
<P>Before you sell personal effects, such as clothing, cameras, or jewelry,
learn the local regulations regarding such sales.  Adhere strictly to local laws
because the penalties you risk are severe.</P>
<P>Some countries are particularly sensitive about photographs.  In general,
refrain from photographing police and military installations and personnel;
industrial structures including harbor, rail, and airport facilities; border
areas; and scenes of civil disorder or other public disturbance.  Taking such
photographs may result in your detention, in the confiscation of your camera and
films, and the imposition of fines.  For information on photography
restrictions, check with the country's tourist office or its embassy or
consulate in the United States.  Once abroad, check with local authorities or at
the Consular section of the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>DRUG ARRESTS</STRONG></P>
<P>About 3,000 Americans are arrested abroad each year.  Of these,
approximately one-third are held on drug charges.  Despite repeated warnings,
drug arrests and convictions are still a common occurrence.  Many countries have
stiff penalties for drug violations and strictly enforce drug laws.  You are
subject to foreign, not U.S. laws overseas, and you will find, if arrested,
that:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Few countries provide a jury trial.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Most countries do not accept bail.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Pre-trial detention, often in solitary confinement, may last
months.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Prisons may lack even minimal comforts--bed, toilet, wash basin.
</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Diets are often inadequate and require supplements from relatives
and friends.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Officials may not speak English.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Physical abuse, confiscation of personal property, degrading or
inhumane treatment, and extortion are possible.</P>
</LI></UL>
<P>If you are convicted, you face a possible sentence of:</P>
<UL><LI><P>2-10 years in many countries.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>A minimum of 6 years hard labor and a stiff fine in some
countries.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>The death penalty in some countries.</P>
</LI></UL>
<P>Do not get involved with illegal drugs overseas.  It can spoil more than
your vacation.  It can ruin your life!</P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>LEGAL AID</STRONG> </P>
<P>Because you are subject to local laws abroad, there is little that a U.S.
consul can do for you if you encounter legal difficulties.  For example, a
consular officer cannot get you out of jail.  What American officials can do is
limited by both foreign and U.S. laws.  The U.S. Government has neither funds
nor authority to pay your legal fees or related expenses.</P>
<P>Although U.S. consular officers cannot serve as attorneys or give legal
advice, they can provide a list of local attorneys and help you find adequate
legal representation.  The lists of attorneys are carefully compiled from local
bar association lists and responses to questionnaires, but neither the
Department of State nor U.S. embassies or consulates abroad can assume
responsibility for the caliber, competence, or professional integrity of the
attorneys.</P>
<P>If you are arrested, ask the authorities to notify a consular officer at the
nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  <B>Under international agreements and
practice, you have the right to talk to the U.S. consul.</B>  If you are denied
this right, be persistent and try to have someone get in touch for you.</P>
<P>When alerted, U.S. officials will visit you, advise you of your rights
according to local laws, and contact your family and friends if you wish.  They
will do whatever they can to protect your legitimate interests and to ensure you
are not discriminated against under local law.  Consuls can transfer money,
food, and clothing to the prison authorities from your family and friends.  They
will try to get relief if you are held under inhumane or unhealthy conditions or
treated less favorably than others in the same situation.</P>
