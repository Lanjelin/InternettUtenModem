<H4><A NAME="intro"></A>INTRODUCTION</H4>
<P>Originally named the West Indies by explorers seeking a sea route to India,
the Caribbean is the region of tropical islands in the Caribbean Sea situated
between North and South America and east of Central America.  The islands extend
for nearly 1,700 miles from Cuba in the west to Barbados in the east.</P>
<P>If you plan to visit the most popular islands during high tourist season
(from mid-December to mid-April) confirm your hotel reservations two to three
months in advance.  There are, however, lesser-known islands where you may be
able to book first class accomodations on short notice.  In addition, you can
usually book reservations with ease during the off-season, but be aware of
hurricane season which runs from June to November.</P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="entry"></A><A NAME="entry"></A>ENTRY AND EXIT REQUIREMENTS</H4>
<P>Every island in the Caribbean has entry requirements.  Most countries allow
you to visit for up to two or three months if you show proof of citizenship and
a return or onward ticket.  Some countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago, require
that you have a valid passport.  Haiti requires children under 18 to have a
valid passport.  If you are arriving from an area infected with yellow fever,
many Caribbean countries require you to have a certificate of vaccination
against yellow fever.  Some countries have an airport departure tax of up to
$25.  For authoritative information on a country's entry and exit requirements
and on its customs and currency regulations, contact its embassy, consulate, or
tourist office in the United States.</P>
<P><A HREF="#entryindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P> 
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="health"></A>HEALTH</H4>
<P>Information on health precautions for travelers can be obtained from local
health departments, private doctors, or travel clinics.  You may also call the
Centers for Disease Control's 24-hour hotline on (404) 332-4559 for information
on immunizations and health risks worldwide.  Immunizations are recommended
against diphtheria, hepatitis A, polio, and tetanus.  Typhoid immunization is
also recommended if you go to remote areas of Haiti or Jamaica.  Polio is
endemic in Haiti and in the Dominican Republic.  </P>
<P>Malaria is prevalent in Haiti and in the rural, non-tourist areas of the
Dominican Republic that border Haiti.  If you are going to a malaria area, take
a weekly dose of chloroquine, beginning two weeks before your trip.  In
addition, take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes because malaria
can break through any preventative drug.</P>
<P>Review your health insurance policy.  U.S. medical insurance is often <B>not
</B> valid outside the United States.  Social Security Medicare does not provide
payment for medical services obtained outside the U.S. In addition to medical
insurance, consider obtaining insurance to cover evacuation in the event of an
accident or serious illness.  Air evacuation to the United States can easily
cost $15,000 if you are not insured.</P>
<P>The most prevalent health hazard in the Caribbean is one you can avoid --
overexposure to the sun.  Use sunscreen and bring a shirt to wear over your
bathing suit, especially if you plan to snorkel.</P>

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="country"></A>COUNTRY INFORMATION</H4>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="baham"></A>BAHAMAS</H4>
<P>Criminal penalties for possession of or trafficking in drugs in the Bahamas
are severe.  The Bahamian court system has a heavy volume of pending cases, and
the U.S. citizens arrested for drugs or other offenses are often held in prison
for months while awaiting trial.</P>
<P>In the Bahamas, be sure to budget for a hotel room tax, an energy surtax, a
15% obligatory gratuity in restaurants, and a departure tax of up to $15.</P>
<P><I><A HREF="#bahamindx">&lt;index&gt;</A></I></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="cay"></A>CAYMAN ISLANDS</H4>
<P>Persons wearing their hair in dreadlocks have occasionally been refused
entry to the Cayman Islands.  Cayman authorities say they may &quot;refuse entry
to any person whose mode of dress or behavior, or unkempt appearance, may cause
offense to the Caymanian community.&quot;  The authorities emphasize that &quot;this
policy does not automatically exclude from entry persons wearing their hair in
any particular manner.  However, if such persons are also unkempt and slovenly
in their attire and behavior, it is possible they could then be refused entry.&quot;
</P>
<P><A HREF="#cayindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P> 
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="cuba"></A>CUBA</H4>
<P>The Cuban Assets Control Regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
require that transactions incident to the travel to and within Cuba of U.S.
citizens or residents be licensed.  A general license needs no application.</P>
<P>Street crime, including purse snatching, is a growing problem in Havana. 
Authorized visitors should exercise caution and keep a close eye on personal
belongings while in tourist areas.  Credit cards issued by U.S. financial
institutions are not valid in Cuba.  Hotels will not accept American express and
other U.S. travelers checks regardless of where they are issued.</P>
<P>U.S. travelers in Cuba should register in person, in writing, or by
telephone during business hours at the U.S. Interests Section which is part of
the Embassy of Switzerland.</P> 
<P><A HREF="#cubaindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="dom">	</A>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</H4>
<P>Drug laws are severe and strictly enforced in the Dominican Republic. 
Penalties for possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana or 20 milligrams of
cocaine range from six months to two years imprisonment, plus fines.  For
quantities of narcotic substances that meet the definition of trafficker, the
penalty is a five to 20-year prison term, plus fines.</P>
<P>No more than $5,000 may be taken from the Dominican Republic upon departure.
 The peso is the only legal currency in the Dominican Republic, and it should be
purchased only at authorized hotels and banks.  In crackdowns on black market
activity, U.S. tourists have sometimes been arrested for even minor illegal
currency transactions.</P>
<P>The Dominican Republic is among the places where U.S. passports and other
identity documents are frequently stolen.</P>
<P>There may be restrictions on minor children being allowed to leave the
Dominican Republic without their parent(s).  A child without a U.S. passport may
be particularly vulnerable to being denied permission to travel alone or with
only one parent.  If this applies to you, check with the Embassy of the
Dominican Republic about their requirements for the travel of unaccompanied
children.</P> 
<P><A HREF="#domindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>  
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="haiti"></A>HAITI</H4>
<P>Visitors to Haiti should exercise caution.  While there does not appear to
be a specific threat to American citizens, the potential exists for civil
disturbances and isolated serious criminal acts.  Avoid crowds and areas of
unrest.</P>
<P>Although U.S. dollars can be used as currency in Haiti, it is usually to the
traveler's advantage to use Haitian dollars.  Haiti's $25 airport departure tax
must be paid in cash in U.S. currency.  It cannot be paid as part of the airline
ticket.</P>
<P><A HREF="#haitiback"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="jam"></A>JAMAICA</H4>
<P>Crime is a serious problem in and around Kingston, Jamaica's capital. 
Visitors should exercise prudence, not walk around at night, and should use
licensed taxis or hotel-recommended transportation. In the north coast tourist
areas, care should be taken at isolated villas and small establishments.</P>
<P><A HREF="#jamindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P> 
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="trin"></A>TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO</H4>
<P>Drug laws are severe and strictly enforced in Trinidad and Tobago. 
Possession of even small amounts of narcotics can result in lengthy jail
sentences and expensive fines.  The penalty for carrying narcotics into or out
of the country is five (5) to 15 years with no possibility of parole.</P>
