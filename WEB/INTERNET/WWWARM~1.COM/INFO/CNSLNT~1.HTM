<CENTER><H1>What U.S. Consulates Can't Do</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Consular officers will do their best to assist U.S. nationals abroad. 
However, they must devote priority time and energies to those Americans who find
themselves in the most serious legal, medical, or financial difficulties.</P>
<P>Because of limited resources, consuls cannot provide routine or
commercial-type services.  They cannot act as travel agents, information
bureaus, banks, or law enforcement officers.  U.S. federal law forbids a
consular officer from acting as your lawyer.  Consular officers cannot: find you
employment; get you visas, residence permits or driving permits; act as
interpreters; search for missing luggage; call your credit card company or bank;
replace stolen travelers checks; or settle disputes with hotel managers.  They
can, however, tell you how to get assistance on these and other matters.</P>
