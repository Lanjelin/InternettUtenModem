<CENTER><H1>What To Do If You Are ARRESTED! </H1></CENTER>
<P>Foreign police and intelligence agencies detain persons for a myriad of
reasons or for no other reason than suspicion or curiosity.  The best advice is
to exercise good judgement, be professional in your demeanor and remember the
suggestions and hints in this section. If you are detained or arrested for some
reason, here are some points to remember:</P>
<UL><LI><P><B>DO</B> ask to contact the nearest embassy or consulate
representing your country.  As a citizen of another country, you have this
right; but that does not mean that your hosts will allow you to exercise that
right.  If you are refused or just ignored, continue to make a request
periodically until they accede and let you contact your embassy or consulate.
</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>DO </B> stay calm, maintain your dignity and do not do
anything to provoke the arresting officer(s).</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>DO NOT</B> admit anything or volunteer any information.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>DO NOT</B> sign anything.  Often, part of the detention
procedure is to ask or tell the detainee to sign a written report.  Decline
politely until such time as the document is examined by an attorney or an
embassy/consulate representative.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>DO NOT</B> accept anyone on face value.  When the
representative from the embassy or consulate arrives, request some
identification before discussing your situation.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>DO NOT</B> fall for the ruse of helping the ones who are
detaining you in return for your release.  They can be very imaginative in their
proposals on how you can be of assistance to them.  Do not sell yourself out by
agreeing to anything.  If they will not take no for an answer, do not make a
firm commitment or sign anything.  Tell them that you will think it over and let
them know.  Once out of their hands, contact the affiliate or your embassy for
protection and assistance in getting out of the country.</P></LI></UL>
