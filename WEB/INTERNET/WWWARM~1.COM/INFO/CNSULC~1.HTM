<CENTER><H1>What U.S. Consulates Can Do</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>U.S. consular officers are located at U.S. embassies and consulates in most
countries overseas.  They are available to advise and help you if you are in any
serious trouble.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>DESTITUTION</H4>
<P>If you become destitute abroad, the U.S. consul can help you get in touch
with your family, friends, bank, or employer and tell you how to arrange for
them to send funds for you.  These funds can sometimes be wired to you through
the Department of State.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>IF ILL OR INJURED</H4>
<P>Should you become ill while abroad, contact the nearest U.S. embassy or
consulate for a list of local doctors, dentists, medical specialists, clinics
and hospitals.  If your illness or injury is serious, the consul can help you
find medical assistance from that list and, at your request, will inform your
family or friends of your condition.  If necessary, a consul can assist in the
transfer of funds from the United States. Payment of hospital and other expenses
is your responsibility. Consular officers cannot supply you with medication.
</P>
<P>In an emergency when you are unable to communicate, the consul will check
your passport for the name and address of any relative, friend, or legal
representative whom you wish to have notified.  Because the U.S. Government
cannot pay for medical evacuations, it is advisable to have private medical
insurance to cover this.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>MARRIAGE ABROAD</H4>
<P>U.S. diplomatic and consular officials do not have the authority to perform
marriages overseas.  Marriage abroad must be performed in accordance with local
law.  There are always documentary requirements, and in some countries, there is
a lengthy residence requirement before a marriage may take place.</P>
<P>Before traveling, ask the embassy or consulate of the country in which you
plan to marry about their regulations and how to prepare to marry abroad.  Once
abroad, the Consular Section of the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate may be
able to answer some of your questions, but it is your responsibility to deal
with local civil authorities.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>BIRTH ABROAD</H4>
<P>A child born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent or parents generally acquires
U.S. citizenship at birth.  The U.S. parent or parents should contact the
nearest U.S. embassy or consulate to have a <B>Report of Birth Abroad of a
Citizen of the United States of America</B> prepared.  This document serves as
proof of acquisition of U.S. citizenship and is acceptable evidence for
obtaining a U.S. passport and for most other purposes where one must show a
birth certificate or proof of citizenship.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>DEATH ABROAD</H4>
<P>When a U.S. citizen dies abroad, the consular officer reports the death to
the next of kin or legal representative and arranges to obtain from them the
necessary private funds for local burial or return of the body to the United
States.  Before you begin your trip, complete the address page in the front of
your passport.  Provide the name, address and telephone number of someone to be
contacted in an emergency.  Do not give the names of your traveling companions
in case the entire party is involved in the same accident.</P>
<P>Because the U.S. Government cannot pay for local burial or shipment of
remains to the United States, it is worthwhile to have insurance to cover this. 
Following a death, a <B>Report of the Death of An American Citizen </B>(Optional
Form 180) is prepared by the consular officer to provide the facts concerning
the death and the custody of the personal estate of the deceased.  Under certain
circumstances, a consular officer becomes the provisional conservator of a
deceased American's estate and arranges for the disposition of those effects.
</P>
<P></P>
<H4>A VARIETY OF NON-EMERGENCY SERVICES</H4>
<P>Consular employees provide non-emergency services as well.  These include
information on Selective Service registration, travel advisories, absentee
voting, and the acquisition or loss of U.S. citizenship.  They arrange for the
transfer of Social Security and other federal benefits to beneficiaries residing
abroad, provide U.S. tax forms, and notarize documents.  Consuls can also
provide information on how to obtain foreign public documents. </P>
