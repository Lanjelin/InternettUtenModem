<P></P>  
<P>Some diseases may not manifest themselves immediately.  If travelers become
ill after they return home, they should tell their physician where they have
traveled. </P> 
<P>Most persons who acquire viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections abroad
become ill within 6 weeks after returning from international travel.  However,
some diseases may not manifest themselves immediately, e.g., malaria may not
cause symptoms for as long as 6 months to a year after the traveler returns to
the United States.  </P>
<P>It is recommended that a traveler always advise a physician of the countries
visited within the 12 months preceding onset of an illness.  Knowledge of such
travel and the possibility the patient may be ill with a disease the physician
rarely encounters will help the physician arrive at a correct diagnosis.</P>
