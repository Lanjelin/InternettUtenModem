<CENTER><H1>Health Insurance</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>  
<P>For travelers who become seriously ill or injured overseas, obtaining
medical treatment and hospital care can be costly.  The Social Security Medicare
program does not cover hospital and medical services outside the United States. 
Before you leave the United States, learn what medical services your health
insurance will cover abroad.</P>
<P>If your health insurance policy does not cover you abroad, you are urged to
purchase a temporary health policy that does.  There are short-term health and
emergency assistance policies designed for travelers.</P>
<P>You can find the names of such companies from your travel agent, your health
insurance company, or from advertisements in travel publications.  In addition
to health insurance, many policies include trip cancellation, baggage loss, and
travel accident insurance in the same package.  Some travelers-check companies
have protection policies available for those who purchase travelers checks.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>MEDICAL EVACUATION</H4>
<P>One of the chief advantages of health and emergency assistance policies is
that they often include coverage for medical evacuation to the United States. 
Medical evacuation can easily cost $5,000 depending upon your location and
medical condition.  Even if your regular health insurance covers you for
emergencies abroad, consider purchasing a supplemental insurance policy to cover
medical evacuation.</P>
<P>Whichever health insurance coverage you choose for overseas, remember to
bring your policy identity card and claim forms with you.</P>
