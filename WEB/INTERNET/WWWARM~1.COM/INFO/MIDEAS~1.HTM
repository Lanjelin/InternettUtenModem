<H4><A NAME="safe"></A>HOW TO PREPARE FOR A SAFE TRIP</H4>
<P>The policies of the countries in the Middle East and North Africa toward
foreign visitors vary greatly from country to country.  Some countries encourage
tourism and put very few restrictions on visitors.  Other countries do not allow
tourism and carefully regulate business travel.  Some areas in the region have
experienced military conflict over an extended period of time.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#safeindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="reg"></A>REGISTRATION</H4>
<P>As you travel, keep abreast of local news coverage.  If you plan more than a
short in one place, or if you are in an area experiencing civil unrest or a
natural disaster, you are encouraged to register with the nearest U.S. embassy
or consulate.  Remember to leave a detailed itinerary with a friend or relative
in case of an emergency.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#regindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="pass"></A>YOUR U.S. PASSPORT</H4>
<P>Make a record or photocopy of the data from your passport's identification
page and from your visas.  Also make a copy of the addresses and telephone
numbers of the U.S. embassy and consulates in the countries you will visit.  Put
this information along with two passport photos in a place separate from your
passport to be available in case of loss or theft of your passport.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#passindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="visa"></A>VISA AND OTHER ENTRY REQUIREMENTS</H4>
<P>A U.S. passport is required for travel to all countries in the region.  U.S.
citizens are not required to have visas for tourist or business travel to
Israel, Morocco, or Tunisia, but may need to supply proof of sufficient funds
for the trip and proof of onward or round trip travel arrangements.  All other
countries in the Middle East and North Africa require U.S. citizens to have
visas.
</P>
<P>If you plan to travel extensively in the region, entry and exit stamps could
quickly fill the pages of your passport.  Before you go, you may wish to ask the
nearest passport agency to add extra pages to your passport.  Or, if applying
for a new passport, you can request one with 48 pages instead of the usual 24.
</P>
<P>Each country has its own set of entry requirements.  For authoritative visa
information, contact the embassy or consulate of the country you plan to visit.
</P>
<UL><LI><P>When you make inquiries, ask about the following:</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Visa price, length of validity, number of entries.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Financial requirements -- proof of sufficient funds and proof of
onward/return ticket.
</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Immunization requirements.  Yellow fever immunization is often
required if arriving from a yellow-fever-infected area.
</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Currency regulations.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Import/export restrictions and limitations.  Several countries
prohibit the import and consumption of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Departure tax.  Be sure to keep enough local currency to be able
to depart as planned.
</P>
</LI></UL>
<P>Some Arab countries will not allow travelers to enter if their passports
show any evidence of previous or expected travel to Israel. Other Arab countries
apply the ban inconsistently, sometimes refusing and at other times allowing
entry when a passport shows evidence of travel to Israel.  The U.S. government
has informed the members of the Arab League that it objects to restrictive
policies regarding U.S. passports containing Israeli markings.  If passport
restrictions imposed by other countries may be a problem for you, contact the
nearest U.S. passport agency, embassy, or consulate for guidance.
</P>
<P>Several Arab countries ask visa applicants to state their religious
affiliation.  The U.S. government is opposed to the use of this information to
discriminate against visa applicants, and has made its views known to the
governments concerned.  In turn, the United States has received assurances that
visa applications are not denied on the basis of religious affiliation.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#visaindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="spe"></A>SPECIAL ENTRY REQUIREMENTS FOR COUNTRIES THAT PERMIT NO
TOURISTS</H4>
<P>Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia do not permit tourism.  All business
visitors must be sponsored by a company in the country to be visited.  Private
visitors must be sponsored by a relative or friend native to the country.  To
visit a foreigner working in a country where tourism is not permitted, you must
be sponsored by the same local company that sponsors the person you are
visiting.  Entry is by visa or the non-objection certificate (NOC) system.  A
NOC is obtained by a visitor's sponsor and filed with the appropriate foreign
government authorities before the planned visit. 
</P>
<P><A HREF="#speindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="health"></A>HEALTH</H4>
<P>In the hot and dry climates that prevail in the Middle East and North
Africa, it is important to avoid water depletion and heat stroke.  Safe tap
water is available in many areas.  In some places, however, it is highly saline
and should be avoided by persons on sodium-restricted diets.  In many rural and
some urban areas, tap water is not potable, and travelers should drink only
boiled or chemically treated water or bottled carbonated drinks.  In these
areas, avoid fresh vegetables and fruits unless they are washed in a purifying
solution and peeled.  Diarrhea is potentially serious.  If it persists, seek
medical attention.
</P>
<P>Schistosomiasis (or bilharzia) is present in the area of the Nile and in
several other areas in North Africa and the Middle East.  These parasites are
best avoided by not swimming or wading in fresh water in endemic areas.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#healthindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="drug"></A>DRUG OFFENSES</H4>
<P>Drug enforcement policies in the region are strict.  Possession of even
small amounts of narcotics, including substances such as marijuana, LSD, or
amphetamines, can lead to arrest.  If found guilty, drug offenders are subject
to lengthy prison sentences.  Because what is considered to be 'narcotics'
varies from country to country, learn and obey the laws in the places you will
visit.  Keep all prescription drugs in their original containers clearly labeled
with the doctor's name, pharmacy and contents.  In addition, if you take an
unusual prescription drug, carry a letter from your doctor explaining your need
for the drug and a copy of the prescription.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#drugindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="dress"></A>DRESS AND LOCAL CUSTOMS</H4>
<P>Islam is the pre-eminent influence on local laws and customs in much of the
Middle East and North Africa.  The extent of this influence varies.  Some Arab
countries have secular governments, but in certain other countries, particularly
those in the Arabian peninsula, Islam dictates a total way of life.  It
prescribes the behavior for individuals and society, codifying law, family
relations, business etiquette, dress, food, personal hygiene, and much more. In
traditional societies, Muslims believe open social relations between the sexes
result in the breakdown of family life.  Contact between men and women,
therefore, is rigidly controlled in traditional societies.
</P>
<P>Travel during Ramadan, the holiest time in the Islamic year, can prove to be
very difficult.  Business is rarely conducted during this time and
non-observance of the Ramadan tradition of fasting during daylight hours can
carry penalties in some countries.
</P>
<P>In the traditional societies of the region, it is considered rude to face
the soles of one's feet toward other people.  At traditional meals, the left
hand is not used for eating.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#dressindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>

<H3><A NAME="count"></A>COUNTRY INFORMATION</H3>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="alg"></A>ALGERIA</H4>
<P>Travelers to Algeria are warned that due to political, social, and economic
problems a climate of violent unrest has occurred.  A number of terrorist
attacks have been carried out against foreigners.  Terrorists have also
threatened to kill all foreigners who are in Algeria.  A state of emergency has
been in effect since early 1992.
</P>
<P>Crime is also a major problem in Algeria.  Crimes include car break-ins,
theft of auto parts from parked cars, theft of items (even those of moderate
value) left in hotel rooms, home bur glary, and pickpocketing and purse
snatching near hotels and on trains and buses.  Some tactics that residents of
Algeria use to avoid being victimized include carrying only a minimum amount of
cash and concealing it well and parking only in guarded locations.  The police
can be reached in Algerian cities by dialing 17.  In rural areas, contact the
gendarmerie nationale.
</P>
<P>Algeria does not give visas to persons whose passports indicate travel to
Israel.  Some hotels accept some credit cards.  Before traveling, ask your
credit card company if your card will be accepted in Algeria, and if not, bring
travelers checks to cover your expenses.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#algindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="bah"></A>BAHRAIN</H4>
<P>Business representatives, conference and exhibition delegates, and holders
of diplomatic and official passports may obtain a visitors visa, valid for up to
three months, from the Bahrain Embassy in Washington D.C., or the UN Mission for
Bahrain in New York.  Persons in the above categories may also be able to obtain
either a 7-day visa or a 72-hour transit visa at the Bahrain airport upon
arrival if they present a confirmed return or onward air ticket.  Single women
who have no sponsor or family ties in Bahrain may have difficulty in obtaining
an airport visa.  In addition to an onward ticket, they may wish to secure in
advance a sponsorship from a hotel that will arrange to have an airport visa
waiting for them.  The 72-hour airport visa can be extended, on a case by case
basis, for up to one week if a Bahraini sponsor applies to the Immigration
Director stating the purpose for the extension.
</P>
<P>A 7-day visa is possible for members of tourist groups, provided
arrangements are made with the Directorate of Tourism and Archaeology in the
Ministry of Information or through a private agency in Bahrain, such as a hotel,
travel agent, or tour group organizer.
</P>
<P>Water is drinkable though often highly saline.  Conservative dress is
recommended.  Bahrain prohibits the import of pornography, firearms, ammunition,
or of items such as knives, swords, or daggers that are capable of being used as
weapons.  Videotapes may be screened by customs in Bahrain and either
confiscated or held until the traveler departs the country.
</P>
<P>Consumption of alcohol is allowed in most bars and restaurants, except
during the month of Ramadan. If there is <B>any</B> indication that a driver
has consumed alcohol, authorities will regard that as evidence of driving under
the influence of alcohol.  The penalty for drunken driving may be incarceration
or a fine of 500 Bahraini dinars, the equivalent of $1,300.  This fine can be
increased to up to double that amount, depending on the circumstances of the
case and the judge's decision.  Under Bahraini law, convicted drug traffickers
may receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#bahindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="egypt"></A>EGYPT</H4>
<P>There are no currency declaration requirements for travelers.  Travelers may
carry a maximum of 100 Egyptian pounds into and out of Egypt.  Excess Egyptian
currency found on a traveler entering Egypt will be confiscated.                
          
</P>
<P>There are strict duties on the importation of expensive photographic and
video equipment.  This includes most types of equipment typically carried by
tourists to Egypt, including all video and autofocus cameras.  Travelers who
wish to take such equipment with them on a temporary visit have the following
options with customs authorities:  (A) They may have it by model and serial
number in their passports, so that the equipment can be cross-checked upon the
traveler's departure from Egypt.  In this instance no duty will be collected. 
(B) They have the equipment placed in storage for the duration of stay, in which
case a storage fee may be collected.  (C) Long term visitors or residents will
pay a standard duty fee for importing the items and be issued a receipt (at the
time of departure, the fee will be refunded upon presentation of the receipt).
</P>
<P>All persons entering Egypt from cholera or yellow fever areas must produce
evidence of up-to-date immunizations.  Immunization must have been administered
before arrival -- cholera at least 6 days before arrival and yellow fever at
least 10 days.  Travelers without evidence of required immunizations may not
enter unless they are vaccinated and detained in quarantine for 6 or 10 days,
respectively.
</P>
<P>All travelers to Egypt should be aware that Egyptian authorities strictly
enforce drug laws.  The death penalty may be imposed on anyone convicted of
smuggling or selling marijuana, hashish, opium, or other narcotics.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#egyptindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="iran"></A>IRAN</H4>
<P>U.S. citizens are advised to avoid all travel to Iran.  Travel to Iran
continues to be dangerous because of the generally anti-American atmosphere and
Iranian government hostility to the U.S. government.  U.S. citizens traveling to
Iran have been detained without charge, arrested, and harassed by Iranian
authorities.  Persons who violate Iranian laws such as those concerning proper
dress, may face penalties that are, at times, severe.
</P>
<P>The United States does not have diplomatic relations with Iran.  U.S.
interests in Iran are currently served by the Embassy of Switzerland.  Iranian
officials have often prevented Swiss officials from providing even minimal
protective services to U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#iranindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="iraq"></A>IRAQ</H4>
<P>U.S. citizens are warned to avoid all travel to Iraq.  Conditions in Iraq
remain unsettled and dangerous and travel is extremely hazardous, particularly
for U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>Travelers granted exceptions to travel to Iraq should be aware that normal
protection by U.S. diplomatic and consular representatives cannot be provided. 
U.S. interests in Iraq are represented by the government of Poland which can
provide only limited emergency services to U.S. citizens.  All travelers to Iraq
are required to submit certification or be tested upon arrival for AIDS.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#iraqindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="israel"></A>ISRAEL, THE GAZA STRIP, JERICHO AREA, AND THE
TERRITORIES OCCUPIED AND ADMINISTERED BY ISRAEL
</H4>
<P>U.S. citizens do not need a visa to visit Israel, the West Bank, the Golan
Heights, or the Gaza Strip and Jericho area.  In the Gaza Strip and Jericho
area, a transfer of certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian
Authority has taken place pursuant to the September 13, 1993 Israel-PLO
Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Governing Arrangements and the May 4,
1994 Cairo Agreement.  Upon arrival in Israel, a U.S. citizen is issued a
tourist visa that is valid for 3 months and is renewable.  Anyone, however, who
has been refused entry to Israel or experienced difficulties with their visa
status during a previous visit should contact the nearest Israeli embassy or
consulate before attempting to return to Israel.  At ports of entry, Israeli
officials determine a U.S. citizen's eligibility to enter Israel.  Applications
may be questioned in detail and/or required to post a departure bond.
</P>
<P>Visitors to Israel will experience strict security screening.  They may be
subject to prolonged questioning, detailed searches of their personal effects
and, in some cases, body searches.  Anything that cannot be readily examined,
such as tubes of toothpaste, cans of shaving cream, computers, cameras, and
other electronic or video equipment may be refused entry and may be confiscated
and destroyed.  If you plan to bring electronic, video, or other high-tech
equipment to Israel, check with an Israeli embassy or consulate as to whether it
could pass through security.  Cameras should be empty when going through
security so they can be opened for inspection.  American citizens with Arab
surnames, and in particular those seeking to enter Israel at the Allenby Bridge
from Jordan, may encounter extra delays, including greater difficulty in
bringing cameras and electronic equipment into the country.
</P>
<P>Western dress is appropriate in Israel.  At religious sites, attire should
be modest.  Religious holidays in Israel and Jerusalem are determined according
to the Hebrew calendar and fall on different dates each year.  It is likely that
religious holidays in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area will be determined by the
Moslem calendar, and also will fall on different dates each year.  Because
hotels are usually heavily booked before and during religious holidays, tourists
should check holiday schedules with their travel agent or with the Embassy of
Israel in Washington D.C.  Travelers should make reservations for holiday
periods well in advance.

<UL><LI><P><STRONG><A NAME="dan"></A>DANGEROUS AREAS</STRONG></P>
</LI></UL>
<DL><DD><P>On June 22, 1994, the Department of State issued a public
announcement advising U.S. citizens to avoid travel to the Gaza Strip and West
Bank, except for daylight visits to Bethlehem, Jericho, Highway 1 from Jerusalem
to the Dead Sea, Route 90 through the Jordan Valley, and tourist sites along
these routes, because of continuing disturbances in those areas.  Should you
decide to travel to the West Bank despite the public announcement, register with
the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem.  In the case of travel to Gaza or the
Golan Heights, register with the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.  The situation in
East Jerusalem, including the old city, is unpredictable and Americans should
check with the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem for an update on conditions. 
Avoid demonstrations and other situations that have the potential to lead to
violence and remember to carry your U.S. passport with you at all times.
</P>
<P>Travelers wishing to cross via the Allenby Bridge need a bridge crossing
permit and a visa.  Neither of these is obtainable in Israel.  Some travelers
arrange the papers through contacts in Jordan or use travel agents in East
Jerusalem who specialize in this service.  It takes several weeks to get the
crossing permits and visas in order.  Visas are not available at the bridge. 
They must be obtained ahead of time.  The Allenby Bridge is open from 0800 to
1200 Sunday through Thursday and from 0800 to 1000 on Friday.  It is closed on
Saturday and on many holidays.
</P>
<P>A few areas in Israel are off-limits to unauthorized persons for military
reasons.  American visitors are expected to observe those off-limits
restrictions.  Conditions along Israel's cease-fire lines, including the
Lebanese border, change frequently.  U.S. travelers planning a visit close to
the lines should first consult the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv.

<H4><A NAME="jordan"></A>JORDAN</H4>
<P>Travelers wishing to cross the Allenby-King Hussein Bridge from Jordan into
the West Bank territories occupied by Israel must obtain written authorization
by submitting their passport and one photo, in person, to the Jordanian Ministry
of Interior three working days before the crossing date.  The permit allows you
to cross the bridge and to make a return crossing within 30 days.
</P>
<P>Conservative dress is recommended for Jordan.  Travelers with dual U.S. and
Jordanian nationality should be aware that the Jordanian government may require
them to enter and leave Jordan on a Jordanian passport.  Males between the ages
of 18 and 40 who possess dual nationality may need to prove that they have met
their military service obligation.

<H4><A NAME="kuwait"></A>KUWAIT</H4>
<P>Those traveling on a temporary or visitor visa to kuwait must observe the
length of stay permitted in their visas.  Currently, most visitor visas are
valid for one year, multiple entries, and stays of up to one month.  Fines are
charged for each day overstayed; the fine is currently 10 kuwait dinars per day,
per person (approximately $34 U.S.).
</P>
<P>Visitors to Kuwait should be aware of the danger of unexploded land mines,
bombs, and shells throughout the country.  Stay on main roads, do not travel on
unpaved roads, and avoid open areas and beaches.
</P>
<P>Conservative dress is recommended for both men and women.  Garments should
fit loosely and cover elbows and knees.
</P>
<P>No alcohol, pork products, or pornographic materials may be imported into or
used in Kuwait.  If customs officials discover prohibited items in a traveler's
effects, he or she may be arrested and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>U.S. citizens should not go near the border with Iraq, and should be very
careful when traveling north or west of Kuwait City.  In recent years, a number
of foreigners traveling near the border have been taken into custody by Iraqi
officials and some have received lengthy prison sentences.  Anyone who must
travel or work near the demilitarized zone is strongly advised to contact the
U.S. Embassy for further advice before their travel begins.

<H4><A NAME="leb"></A>LEBANON</H4>
<P>As of January 31, 1987, U.S. passports became invalid for travel to, in, or
through Lebanon.  U.S. citizens are advised to avoid all travel to Lebanon.  The
situation in the country is so dangerous that no U.S. citizen can be considered
safe from terrorist acts.  To avoid the possibility of transiting Lebanon, U.S.
citizens should make certain that any international flight they book in the
region does not make an interme diate stop in Beirut.  Such stops are not always
announced.
</P>
<P>Travelers who are granted passport exceptions to travel to Lebanon should be
aware that normal protection of U.S. diplomatic and consular representatives
cannot be provided.  The U.S. Embassy in Beirut is not fully staffed and its
personnel operate under exceptionally tight security conditions.  Local
telephone service is unreliable, and it is extremely difficult to contact the
U.S. Embassy or place a local call from most of the country.

<H4><A NAME="lib"></A>LIBYA</H4>
<P>On December 10, 1981, U.S. passports ceased to be valid for travel to, in,
or through Libya unless a special validation has been  obtained, and on January
8, 1986, U.S. economic sanctions were imposed on Libya.  In addition, on March
31, 1992, United Nations sanctions were imposed.  These sanctions include an air
embargo which took effect April 15, 1992.  The categories of individuals
eligible for consideration for special passport validation are professional
journalists, representatives of the American or International Red Cross, persons
with compelling humanitarian considerations, or persons whose travel is
determined to be in the national interest.
</P>
<P>Those persons granted exceptions to travel to Libya should be aware that
there is no U.S. mission in Libya and U.S. interests are represented by the

<H4><A NAME="oman"></A>OMAN</H4>
<P>There are no tourist visas to Oman, and visa requirements for business
travelers are stringent.  <B>Anyone arriving in Oman without a visa is subject
to arrest</B>.  A business visitor must contact an Omani sponsor, either a
businessman or firm, for assistance in procuring a non-objection certificate
(NOC).  The sponsor should begin application procedures several weeks ahead of
expected travel.  American firms new to Oman may receive guidance on Omani
sponsorship from the commercial office of the U.S. Embassy in Muscat.  They
should send a telex (TLX 3785 AMEMBMUSON) describing their company's activities
and what they expect to accomplish in Oman.

<H4><A NAME="qat"></A>QATAR</H4>
<P>U.S. citizens must have a visa to enter Qatar.  To receive a visa, an
applicant must be sponsored by a resident of Qatar, a local business, or by the
hotel at which he or she will be staying.  After obtaining a sponsor, travelers
may apply for visas at a Qatari embassy or consulate.
</P>
<P>Qatar is a traditional Muslim country.  Conservative dress and behavior are
strongly recommended for all visitors.  Travelers to Qatar may not bring in
narcotics, weapons, items deemed pornographic, or pork products.  Luggage is
subject to careful inspection by customs officials.
</P>
<P>Qatar's population is approximately 400,000, of whom an estimated 100,000
are Qataris.  Serious crime is virtually unknown and medical facilities are
adequate.  Although Arabic is the official language, English is widely spoken.

<H4><A NAME="saud"></A>SAUDI ARABIA</H4>
<P>Nearly 36% of the inhabitants of Saudi arabia are resident foreigners.  This
includes approximately 30,000 American citizens.  English is acknowledged as a
second language and is taught in the secondary schools.
</P>
<P>Islam dominates all aspects of life in Saudi arabia -- government policy,
cultural norms, and social behavior.  Islam is the only official religion of the
country, and public observance of any other religion is forbidden.  The Saudi
government considers it a sacred duty to safeguard two of the greatest shrines
of Islam, the holy mosques located in the cities of Mecca and Medina.  Travel to
Mecca and Medina is forbidden to non-Muslims.  Muslims throughout the world turn
to Mecca five times a day for prayer.  Restaurants, stores, and other public
places close for approximately a half-hour upon hearing the call to prayer, and
Muslims stop their activities to pray during that time.  Government and business
activities are noticeably curtailed during the month of Ramadan, during the
celebrations at the end of Ramadan, and during the time of the annual pilgrimage
to Mecca, the Hajj.  Travel facilities into, out of, and within Saudi Arabia are
crowded during these periods.

<DL><DD><P>U.S. citizens are advised that Saudi Arabia is a conservative
country with a rigorous code of public behavior that everyone, including
foreigners, is fully expected to observe.  In particular, Westerners need to be
aware of the standards of appropriate attire and the prohibition of mingling of
the sexes in public places.

<DL><DD><P>Although Westerners have some leeway in dress and social contacts
within company residential compounds, both men and women should dress
conservatively in public.  Women's clothing should be loose fitting and
concealing, with high necks, skirts worn well below the knee, and sleeves below
the elbow.  It is recommended that women <B>NOT</B> wear pants.</P></DD></DL>

</P></LI></UL>
<DL><DD><P>Females are prohibited from driving vehicles or riding bicycles on
public roads, or in places where they might be observed.  Males and females
beyond childhood are not free to congregate together in most public places, and
a man may be arrested for being seen with, walking with, traveling with, or
driving a woman other than his wife or immediate relative.  In Saudi Arabia,
playing of music or dancing in public, mixed bathing, public showing of movies,
and consumption of alcoholic beverages are forbidden.
</P>
<P>Saudi religious police, known as Mutawwa, have been empowered to enforce the
conservative interpretation of Islamic codes of dress and behavior for women,
and may rebuke or harass women who do not cover their heads or whose clothing is
insufficiently concealing.  In addition, in more conservative areas, there have
been incidents of private Saudi citizens stoning, accosting, or pursuing
foreigners, including U.S. citizens, for perceived dress code or other
infractions.  While most such incidents have resulted in little more than
inconvenience or embarrassment for the individual targeted, there have been
incidents where Westerners were physically harmed.
</P>
<P>U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia should be aware of Saudi social practices, and
that any infractions may be dealt with aggressively.  If you are accosted by
Saudi authorities, cooperate fully in accordance with local customs and
regulations.  U.S. citizens who are harassed by private Saudi citizens or Saudi
authorities should report the incidents immediately to the U.S. Embassy in
Riyadh or the U.S. Consulate General either in Dhahran or in Jeddah.

<H4><A NAME="syria"></A>SYRIA</H4>
<P>All visitors to Syria must have a valid Syrian visa on arrival in the
country.  Although airport visas are technically available, they are virtually
unattainable.
</P>
<P>Travelers may bring any amount of currency into Syria.  Syrian law does not
require currency to be declared unless the total is more than $5,000.  It is
wise, however, to declare any currency you have, because you cannot take
currency out of Syria unless it has been declared upon arrival.  There are two
rates of exchange in Syria.  In addition to the official rate, Syrian pounds may
be purchased at the more favorable 'neighboring country rate' at the Syrian
Commercial Bank or at a major hotel if you have convertible currency in cash or
travelers checks.  Hotel bills must be paid in convertible currency or with
Syrian pounds obtained at the official rate from the Commercial Bank of Syria
(receipt required).  Meals and all other purchases can be paid for with Syrian
pounds and do not require official rate certification.  Credit card charges may
be figured at either the official rate or the neighboring country rate. 
Travelers should check which rate will apply before making any credit card
purchase.
</P>
<P>Conservative dress is recommended for Syria.  Travelers should exercise
caution when photographing historic sites.  Photographs may be taken of regular
tourist attractions, such as ancient ruins and temples, but warnings are issued
against photographing government buildings, government property, and anything
other than tourist sites.

four months, but must possess return or onward tickets.  No local currency may
be imported or exported.
</P>
<P>As of August 1991, naturalized U.S. citizens of Tunisian origin are no
longer required to have a Tunisian travel document in order to depart from
Tunisia.  They may enter and depart Tunisia on their U.S. passport.

<H4><A NAME="united"></A>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</H4>
<P>The United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) is a federation of seven independent
emirates.  Visitors to the U.A.E. must obtain a visa before arrival.  Some of
the Emirates allow hotels or airlines to sponsor persons entering for short
visits.  Persons who overstay their visas are subject to fines and/or
imprisonment.  Both penalties have been imposed on U.S. citi zens.
</P>
<P>The U.A.E. prohibits the import of pornography, controlled substances,
firearms, ammunition, or items capable of being used as weapons.  Video-tapes
will be screened by customs officials, an often lengthy process, and may be
confiscated.  Non-Muslims may consume alcohol at licensed bars or restaurants.
</P>
<P>Visitors may apply for a temporary U.A.E. driver's license upon presentation
of a valid U.S. license.  There are strict penalties for persons involved in
traffic accidents while under the influence of alcohol, including lashings for
Muslims.

<H4><A NAME="yemin"></A>YEMEN</H4>
<P>Conditions in Yemen remain unsettled due to the recent end of Yemen's civil
war.  Ordnance such as mines, left over from the war, may pose a hazard to
travelers.  U.S. citizens should exercise caution in Yemen and avoid travel in
remote areas.  Local tribal disputes have occasionally led to violence. 
Westerners, including U.S. citizens, have been kidnaped as a result of such
local disputes, and vehicles have been hijacked.  Urban violence and crime is a
growing problem in Yemen, including within the capital, Sanaa.
</P>
<P>Visitor visas, which are usually valid for entry for up to one month, are
required.  Entry to Yemen may be denied to persons with passports showing
Israeli visas or entry/exit stamps.
</P>
<P>Because of the 7,200 feet altitude of Sanaa and the lack of adequate medical
facilities, travelers may wish to consult their physicians before visiting
Yemen.  Independent travel in Yemen is difficult; it is advisable to arrange
your trip through a travel agent.  Photography of military installations,
equipment, or troops is forbidden.
