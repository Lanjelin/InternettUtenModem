<P><STRONG>Thirty million Americans travel or live abroad annually for
business or pleasure. A rapidly increasing proportion of these people travel to
regions where health and environmental conditions can be far less than we are
used to in the USA and these can endanger the health and welfare of travelers.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Traditionally, as a group, Americans have not been adventurous
travelers; however, this is now changing with people seeking more and more
exotic locales to visit. Humid tropical jungles, parched deserts, the frozen
poles, and the highest mountains are all fair game for Americans hunting new
thrills and pleasure. With a tradition of traveling to safe areas, we tend to
follow old habits of preparation that may have served well for Europe, but can
fail us when heading to the Amazon. Conditions differ widely around the world;
diseases and lack of resources can test even experienced travelers, and proper
preparation is essential.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Different parts of the world have different environments and
differing socioeconomic conditions. These factors are intimately tied-in to the
health and well-being of local populations, which  will naturally affect
visitors to these regions. Factors to consider are the temperature, humidity,
pollution level (air, water, etc.), altitude, rainfall, season, poverty,
warfare, crime, epidemics, and societal infrastructure. These vary from country
to country and even within countries -- but this is hardly limited to the
tropics. For example, the former Soviet republics have disintegrating
infrastructures, with the result that violent crime, motor vehicle accidents and
diseases such as diphtheria are on the rise. The medical establishment can no
longer cope adequately with these problems and the level of care is plummeting.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>To put this picture in perspective, in reality the greatest threats
to the health and welfare of travelers are motor vehicle accidents followed by
the same diseases that would affect people if they were home. For example, a
person with angina has as much or possibly more of a risk of a heart attack as
back home. Lower in risk are diseases of travel and injuries resulting from
crime or combat-related violence, even through these get the greatest press.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Diseases often change faster than governments. Indeed, it is most
difficult even for most doctors to stay abreast of rapidly changing disease
patterns and epidemics, which may change from month to month, week to week, even
day to day. Many of these diseases have for the most part been eliminated from
industrial nations, some are newly emerging diseases which we know little about,
and many of these are serious.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>There are several ways to deal with these issues. First, and the
most extreme, is to stay home. I mention this option first because it is absurd
and should be dispensed with as quickly as possible. Few activities in life
offer as much as travel: it is the best teacher, the best destroyer of bigotry,
and  the finest way to put life in perspective and show all the richness that
life offers. Second, you could &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; your way through your
travels, blithely ignoring all risks and threats, either pretending they don't
exist or not taking the effort to prepare for them. This is as bad as not
leaving home, perhaps even worse. Many people gamble on their health in this
way, and too many lose. The Muslim sage, Mushariff-ud-Din, said almost a
thousand year ago &quot;A traveler without knowledge is like a bird without
wings.&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>A beautiful and apt sentiment which leads us to the third option
for the traveler is to intelligently prepare for a journey by reading about the
culture, the environment and the health situations present in the lands to be
visited. By reading and talking to travelers and qualified consultants -- i.e. a
travel agent, a travel medicine physician -- you can gain an understanding of
what may face you and how to prepare for your journey. This knowledge improves
the chances of  you being able to fully appreciate what you will experience on
your journey by staying safe and healthy throughout the way. Preparation shows
responsibility -- an indispensable asset for traveling.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Preparation requires certain foresight and decisions on your part.
Of course, there is the primary decision of where to go. Next, how to get there,
followed by where you will stay and how you will travel. Preparing for
unforeseen obstacles and staying flexible are vital for enjoyment of the journey
and for  insuring one's health and safety while abroad. In terms of  health
preparation it is wise to be fit before you leave -- this reduces your chances
of illness while traveling. Before your trip, see a doctor who specializes in
and has been trained in tropical medicine and travel diseases and who stays
up-to-date on the ever changing disease courses around the world. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Routine vaccines need to be brought up to date and specific travel
vaccines should be administered as needed.  Any current illness should be
brought under control. You should also  be sure to take enough of your
medications on the trip. It is a good idea to take &quot;just in case&quot;
medicines for certain ailments, like dysentery, which may occur while abroad
when your are far from medical help. Since, the risks of these ailments vary
with the the type of travel and the area, you should discuss these potential
illnesses with your travel medicine specialist who will also advise you on the
types of exotic diseases you might encounter and how to avoid them. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Take a first aid kit, and some additional travel health essentials
-- such as insect protections and sunscreen. Take care of dental problems before
you leave and carry extra eyeglasses if you wear them. Make sure you have health
and evacuation  insurance that will cover you while abroad: you would  be
shocked at how much emergency evacuation can cost you if you don't have
insurance coverage. Before your trip it pays to  travel learn where you can seek
help if you get ill or injured while abroad.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Be warned that few American doctors know much about the fields of
travel and tropical medicine -- for most doctors, the last time they heard of
tropical or travel-related diseases was when they were in medical school! The
American Society of Tropical Medicine &amp; Hygiene has a list of recommended
specialists around the country who meet their standards; the Society also issues
a Certificate of Knowledge in Clinical Tropical Medicine and Traveler's Health
for physicians which serves as a basic standard by which you can judge the
reliability of the physician you are seeing. Ask if your doctor has it.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>With education, vaccinations, travel counseling, and common sense (
THE most important piece of luggage you need to carry) you will have taken the
most important steps to ensure a healthy, safe trip. As with all thing in life,
nothing is certain; but you will have the peace of mind knowing that you are as
ready and safe as possible -- so enjoy your travels!</STRONG></P>
