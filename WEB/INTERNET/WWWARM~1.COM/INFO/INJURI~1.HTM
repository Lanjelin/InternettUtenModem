<P>The major cause of serious disability or loss of life is not infections. 
Trauma caused by injuries, principally that suffered in motor vehicle crashes,
is the leading cause of death and disability in both developed and developing
countries worldwide.  Motor vehicle crashes result from a variety of factors,
including inadequate roadway design, inattention to pedestrians and
pedal-cyclists, or impairment due to alcohol or drug use; all these factors are
preventable or can be abated.  Defensive driving is an important preventive
measure.  When driving or riding, insist on a vehicle equipped with safety belts
and where available, use them.  When available, also insist on a vehicle
equipped with air bags and anti-lock brakes.  As a high proportion of crashes
occur at night when returning from &quot;social events&quot;, avoid
non-essential night driving, alcohol, and riding with persons who are under the
influence of alcohol or drugs.  Pedestrian, bicycle, and motorcycle travel are
often dangerous and helmet use is imperative for bicycle and motorcycle travel.
</P>
<P>Fire injuries are also a significant cause of injuries and death -- inquire
about whether hotels have smoke detectors and sprinkler systems, and do not
smoke in bed.  Travelers may wish to bring their own smoke detectors with them.
Always look for a primary and alternative escape route in rooms in which you are
meeting or staying.  Look for improperly vented heating devices which may cause
carbon monoxide poisoning.  Remember to escape a fire by crawling low under
smoke.</P>
<P>Other major causes of injury trauma include drowning and drug reactions. 
Protection against potentially hazardous drugs is nonexistent in some countries.
 Do not buy medications &quot;over the counter&quot; unless you are familiar
with the product.</P>
<P>Travelers should also be aware of the potential for violence-related
injuries.  Risk for assault or terrorist attack varies from country to country;
heed advice from residents and tour guides about areas to be avoided, going out
at night, and going out alone.  Do not fight attackers.  </P>
