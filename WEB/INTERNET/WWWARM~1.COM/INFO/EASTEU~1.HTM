<H4><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A></H4>
<P>This information covers the seven countries of East Central Europe: Albania,
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Eastern
Europe also includes the western part Russia.</P>
<P>The countries of Eastern Europe are rich in history with civilizations and
traditions dating back to the beginning of recorded European history. These
countries are in a period of transition, and their rules for visitors are
changing. Before you go, contact the embassy of each country you plan to visit 
for the latest information on visa requirements, customs and currency
regulations.</P>
<P>Although tourist facilities are expanding to meet the rapid increase in
tourism to Eastern Europe, in most of the region they are quite limited. In many
places, you will have to be patient with scarce or inadequate hotels, rental
cars, and other facilities. To be certain of accomodations, make reservations
for hotels and transportation, and make them well in advance. If you cannot get
a hotel reservation, check with the country's tourist office, because many
cities have a bureau that arranges accommodations in small hotels or private
homes.
</P>
<P>The Department of State issues travel advisories concerning serious health
or security conditions that may affect U.S. citizens.Travel advisories are
available  by calling (202) 647-5225.</P>
<P><A HREF="#introindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Entry">Entry Requirements</A></H4>
<P>U.S. citizens should travel to Eastern Europe with a valid U.S. passport and
with appropriate visas when necessary. Visa regulations change, so check with
each embassy's consular section for current information.</P>
<P>Remember to leave a detailed itinerary and your passport information with a
friend or relative in the United States in case of an emergency. </P>
<P><A HREF="#entryindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Customs">Customs</A></H4>
<P>Customs regulations in some Eastern European countries are strict. U.S.
citizens should comply fully. Generally, you should carry only those articles
that you need for your trip and personal use.</P>
<P>When obtaining your visa, declare to the country's embassy in the United
States anything manufactured before 1945 (considered antique in some countries)
and any precious metals, including gold jewelry, that you plan to bring with
you. Ask for customs information when you apply for your visa.</P>
<P>If you are asked to declare valuables and currency when you enter a country,
include pocket calculators, digital watches, or other electronic devices that
may be rare or more expensive in Eastern European than at home. Failure to
declare items could result in their confiscation upon departure. Carry a copy of
your declaration with you. You may need it when you depart the country.</P>
<P><B>Do not carry parcels or letters on behalf of third persons. It is highly
dangerous to carry something if you do not know its contents.</B></P>
<P><A HREF="#cusindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Currency">Currency</A></H4>
<P>Some Eastern European governments restrict the import and export of their
currencies. In general, do not transport these currencies across international
borders. Currency regulations in Eastern Europe change frequently. Some
countries have a dual exchange rate. For example, hotel bills and credit card
purchases may have to be paid at a rate that is higher than a &quot;tourist&quot;
rate. Before you go, learn the most advantageous way to handle your purchases by
inquiring about exchange rates and currency regulations from your travel agent
or the embassies of the countries you plan to visit.</P>
<P>Unlimited amounts of U.S. dollars and other freely convertible or &quot;hard&quot;
currencies usually may be carried into and out of Eastern European countries.
Travelers may be asked to declare the amount and kind of currency they carry.
</P>
<P>Purchase currencies only at officially authorized exchange facilities in the
country of issue and retain your receipts. Do not engage in private currency
transactions or sell personal property. While U.S. dollars may be exchanged for
Eastern European currencies, it is difficult or impossible to reconvert those
currencies to dollars or another hard currency. Therefore, do not exchange more
money than you plan to spend.</P>
<P>Western travelers are frequently required to settle hotel, auto rental,
train, airplane, medical, and other bills in hard currency. Keep sufficient hard
currency for this purpose.</P>
<P><A HREF="#currindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Credit">Credit Cards</A></H4>
<P>Most major credit cards may be used in place of hard currency to cover
purchases at major hotels or stores in Eastern Europe. However, in general,
credit cards, travelers checks, and personal checks cannot be used to obtain
hard currency in the region. </P>
<P>A few major credit card companies offer services, such as cash advances in
local currency and card replacement, to travelers in a few places in Eastern
Europe, most notably in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. In addition, some travelers
check companies offer replacement for lost or stolen travelers checks in some
places in the region. Check with your credit card company and with the company
that sells you travelers checks to learn what services they now offer in the
cities you plan to visit.</P>
<P><A HREF="#creditindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Driving">Driving</A></H4>
<P>Except in major cities and on super highways, avoid driving at night in
Eastern Europe. Night driving can be hazardous because some roads are narrow and
winding, and horse-drawn vehicles and bicycles may be encountered at any time on
any road.</P>
<P>Traffic regulations, especially those related to driving under the influence
of alcohol, are very strict. An international driver's license is usually
accepted and, in some cases, required by Eastern European governments. You may
obtain an international driver's license from an automobile association.</P>
<P><A HREF="#drindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Political">Political Statements or Acts</A></H4>
<P>In countries where there is political unrest, refrain from political
comments and activities that might be construed as interference in the internal
affairs of the host country. Avoid photographing or otherwise becoming involved
in demonstrations.</P>
<P>There are restrictions on photography in Eastern Europe. In general, refrain
from photographing military and police installations and personnel as well as
scene of civil disorder or other public disturbances. In some countries, also
avoid photographing border areas and industrial structures, including harbors,
bridges, rail and airport facilities. For detailed information, consult local
authorities or the U.S. embassy or consulate in the country concerned.</P>
<P><A HREF="#polindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Crime">Crime</A></H4>
<P>One result of the changes taking place in Eastern Europe is an increase in
street crime in almost every major city in the region. Car break-ins have become
a problem. Some cities have groups of pickpockets that use various gimmicks to
distract their victims. Be especially careful on public transportation, in
crowded shopping areas, and in all places frequented by tourists. Watch your 
purse, passport, wallet, travel documents, and other valuables. </P>
<P>Loss of a passport in some locations can mean a wait of a day or more while
local authorities process a new exit permit, without which it is impossible to
leave the country. It is therefore strongly recommended that you make every
effort to safeguard your U.S. passport from loss or theft. Carry a copy of your
passport data page with you in a location separate from your passport.</P>
<P><A HREF="#crimeindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Registration">Registration</A></H4>
<P>Foreigners are required by the authorities in some Eastern European
countries to register with the local police. This is usually taken care of by
your hotel. You may have to turn your passport over to the hotel for a period of
up to 24 hours. If you stay with relatives or a private family, ask your hosts
or consult the U.S. embassy or consulate about how to meet the registration
requirement.</P>
<P>If you plan more than a short stay in one place, or if you are in an area
experiencing civil unrest or some natural disaster, you are strongly encouraged
to register with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. </P>
<P><A HREF="#regindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Country">Country Information</A></H4>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Albania">Albania</A></H5>
<P>The United States and Albania reestablished diplomatic relations on March
15, 1991. It is expected that a U.S. Embassy will be established in Tirana
sometime in 1991. Until there is, however, the Department of State cannot extend
normal consular protective services to U.S. citizens in Albania.</P>
<P>According to recent travelers to Albania, visitors should bring toiletries,
paper products, medicines, film, and batteries with them and are advised to
drink only bottled water. Credit cards are rarely accepted. Change may be
scarce, so bring small denomination U.S. currency with you. Except for personal
use, it is forbidden to bring religious items, such as Bibles or Korans, into
the country. Conservative dress is recommended.</P>
<P><A HREF="#albindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</A></H5>
<P>Americans with regular U.S. passports who wish to enter Bulgaria for up to
30 days, regardless of the purpose, do not need a visa. There is no limit on the
number of entries as long as the traveler departs within 30 days. If you wish to
stay longer than 30 days, you may obtain a visa at a Bulgarian diplomatic
mission. Travelers who have items to declare when entering Bulgaria are
cautioned to make an oral customs declaration before their baggage is inspected.
Printed customs forms are not distributed.</P>
<P>According to a treaty between the United States and Bulgaria that was signed
in 1928 and reconfirmed in 1947, a Bulgarian citizen naturalized in the United
States automatically loses his or her Bulgarian citizenship upon becoming a U.S.
citizen. The U.S. Bulgarian consular convention signed in 1974 provides that if
a former Bulgarian citizen enters Bulgaria on a U.S. passport with a Bulgarian
visa and &quot;entry cachet,&quot; that individual is considered an American
citizen by the government of Bulgaria.</P>
<P>A recent amendment of the Bulgarian nationality act recognizes dual
nationality for Bulgarian citizens. U.S. citizens of Bulgarian birth who are
naturalized as U.S. citizens may still, under some circumstances, be considered
Bulgarian citizens by the government of Bulgaria. </P>
<P>If you are an American of Bulgarian birth, it is recommended that you travel
to Bulgaria only on a U.S. passport. This will help ensure your right of U.S.
consular protection while you are in Bulgaria. </P>
<P>Foreigners visiting Bulgaria must register their address with local
authorities within 24 hours of arrival, unless staying at a hotel where
registration is done automatically. If you intend to remain in Bulgaria longer
than three months, you must apply for a residence permit from the local police.
</P>
<P><A HREF="#bulindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Czech">Czechoslovakia</A></H5>
<P>No visa is required for American citizens visiting Czechoslovakia for up to
30 days. After entering Czechoslovakia, but before the original 30 days are
finished, you may obtain an extension of stay for up to six months for a small
fee. In Prague, you can apply at the police station for foreigners. Outside the
capital city, apply at local police offices that handle visa and passport
administration.</P>
<P>Foreigners are required to pay many expenses in hard currency, including
hotels, medical treatment, and gasoline coupons. Make certain that you retain
sufficient hard currency to meet these expenses.</P>
<P>Most major credit cards and travelers checks can be used in place of hard
currency to cover purchases at major hotels, stores, and some restaurants.
Credit cards and travelers checks are not, however, accepted at smaller
enterprises. It may be possible to obtain hard currency at the Zivnotenska Bank
in Prague with a major credit card. Check with your credit card company before
you travel to see if it can be used to obtain hard currency in Czechoslovakia or
if it can be replaced if lost or stolen. Most credit cards and travelers checks
cannot be replaced in Czechoslovakia.</P>
<P>Most items purchased, except at duty-free Tuzex stores, are subject to
export duty. Duties may be higher than the purchase price. Approximately 40
types of items, ranging from antiques to bed linens to leather goods, may not be
exported or may require export licenses. Before you buy, find out what it will
cost to take your purchase out of the country.</P>
<P>According to a bilateral treaty between the United States and
Czechoslovakia, signed in 1928, a Czechoslovak citizen naturalized in the United
States automatically loses his or her Czechoslovak citizenship. This is not
true, however, for Czechoslovak nationals naturalized in the U.S. between
September 17, 1938 and May 7, 1957, a period during which Czechoslovakia
considers itself to have been at war, and which, therefore, is not covered by
the treaty. Czechoslovak nationals naturalized during that period are dual
nationals.</P>
<P>Today, dual nationality has little practical effect on travelers to
Czechoslovakia because there are no longer restrictions on travel abroad by
Czechoslovak citizens.</P>
<P><A HREF="#czindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Hungary">Hungary</A></H5>
<P>Holders of U.S. passports no longer need a visa to visit Hungary for tourism
or business for up to 90 days. Visitors staying for longer than 30 days must
register with the local police.</P>
<P>Under a new Hungarian law, persons who were deprived of their Hungarian
citizenship between 1947 and 1981 may regain their Hungarian citizenship by
addressing a statement of intent to the President of the Hungarian Republic.
U.S. citizens who regain their Hungarian citizenship, as well as those who never
lost it, may wish to obtain a Hungarian passport if they plan to travel to
Hungary frequently. A dual national who obtains a Hungarian passport does not
endanger his or her U.S. citizenship. However, it is important to remember that,
under U.S. law, a U.S. citizen must use his or her U.S. passport to enter or
leave the United States.</P>
<P>Most art and antiques, even if they are family possessions, cannot be
exported without a permit.</P>
<P>Personal checks and travelers checks can be cashed for local currency, but
not for hard currency. Generally, no cash advances of any kind can be obtained
with a credit card, although some major credit cards may offer this service in
the near future.</P>
<P>Do not attempt to assist Hungarian friends or relatives to evade currency
regulations by taking their currency to the United States. Be aware that
undercover police may offer to exchange money on the black market. Americans
have been arrested in Hungary for attempting such transactions.</P>
<P><A HREF="#huindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Poland">Poland</A></H5>
<P>U.S. citizens no longer need a visa to visit Poland for up to 90 days.
Polish law is currently in flux on a number of issues that are important to
travelers. Therefore, when you visit Poland, check with the U.S. Embassy in
Warsaw or the consulates in Krakow or Poznan to determine the current status of 
currency, citizenship, and other regulations. </P>
<P><A HREF="#poindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Romania">Romania</A></H5>
<P>American citizens may obtain a Romanian visa at the airport or at border
points. The $30 fee must be paid in hard currency. </P>
<P>U.S. citizens of Romanian origin who were naturalized after January 14, 1952
are still considered Romanian citizens by the Romanian government unless they
have renounced their citizenship and their renunciation has been approved. Most
Romanians who have renounced their citizenship are eligible to have it restored.
Questions concerning the legal status of dual nationals in Romania should be
discussed fully with a Romanian consul when you apply for a visa.</P>
<P>Romanian customs regulations are strict. All electronic devices and all
items of personal jewelry must be declared at the point of entry. Failure to do
so could result in confiscation upon departure. Customs duties on items not for
personal use are extremely high. Upon departure, tourists must show receipts for
all goods purchased in Romania. Receipts for certain goods must show that they
were purchased for hard currency or at an approved shop.</P>
<P>Visitors are required to change money at official rates and only at approved
locations, such as banks, hotels, and tourist offices. Currency obtained this
way can be reconverted upon departure. Foreigners are usually required to pay
for hotels, air and rail tickets, and some meals in hard currency. Gasoline and
diesel fuel may only be purchased with coupons sold at the border and at hotels
and tourist offices.</P>
<P>Outside of Bucharest, gasoline availability is sometimes a problem,
especially on weekends. Unleaded gasoline is sold in major cities, but is not
always available.</P>
<P>Supplies of basic consumables are very limited. Travelers should bring with
them all personal hygiene items and, if traveling by car, should consider
carrying food as well, especially during the winter. They should also be
prepared for hotel rooms without heat or hot water in the winter.</P>
<P>Most major hotels and tourist offices in large cities accept major
international credit cards and travelers checks. It is not yet possible,
however, to receive cash advances against a credit card in Romania.</P>
<P><A HREF="#romindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H5><A NAME="Yugo">Yugoslavia</A></H5>
<P>U.S. citizens need a visa to visit Yugoslavia. You may obtain a multiple
entry visa from the Yugoslav Embassy or a Yugoslav consulate. There is no fee. 
U.S. citizens with Yugoslavian dual nationality who travel to Yugoslavia should
do so only with a U.S. passport with a Yugoslav visa stamped in it.</P>
<P>Yugoslav law does not recognize dual nationality. This means that all
naturalized U.S. citizens of Yugoslav origin who have not renounced their
Yugoslav citizenship will be considered by Yugoslav authorities to be citizens
of Yugoslavia when returning as temporary visitors or as permanent residents.
Persons taken into custody by Yugoslav authorities may be denied the opportunity
to communicate with representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade or the
Consulate General in Zagreb.</P>
<P>U.S. citizens of Yugoslav origin who wish to renounce their Yugoslav
citizenship may obtain application forms from the Yugoslav Embassy in
Washington, D.C. or from a Yugoslav consulate in New York, Cleveland,
Pittsburgh, Chicago, or San Francisco. Yugoslav nationality is not considered
lost until formal approval is given to an application for renunciation of
citizenship. This process may take a year or longer.</P>
<P>All U.S. citizens who intend to remain in Yugoslavia for more than 90 days
are required to obtain permission to stay. Naturalized U.S. citizens of Yugoslav
origin who intend to remain in Yugoslavia for more than 90 days may also need to
obtain Yugoslav documents, such as a licna karta or a Yugoslav passport.</P>
<P>Prior to travel to Yugoslavia, dual national men 18 years and older should
find out from Yugoslav consular officials whether they will be subject to
conscription for military service or to arrest for failure to comply with
Yugoslav law on compulsory military service.</P>
