<P><I>The bottom line is to keep your eyes open,  be aware of your
surroundings, and don't get into a state of negative anticipation . Paranoia can
ruin a trip just as easily as stolen luggage. </I></P>
<P></P>
<P>As a general rule, when you arrive or depart from a hotel,don't linger or
wander unnecessarily in the parking lot, indoor garage or public space around
the hotel;  be alert for suspicious persons and behavior; and, watch for
distractions that are intentionally staged to set up a pickpocket, luggage theft
or purse snatch. Here are some tips to consider:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Stay with your luggage until it is brought into the lobby, or
placed into the taxi or limo.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Consider using the bellman.  Luggage in the &quot;care, custody
and control&quot; of the hotel causes the hotel to be liable for your property. 
Protect claim checks: they are your evidence!</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Keep in mind though that there are limits of liability created by
states and countries to protect hoteliers.  Personal travel documents, lap tops,
jewelry, and other valuables and sensitive documents in excess of $1,000 in
value should be hand carried and personally protected.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If you arrive by auto, park as close to the hotel access point as
possible, and park in a lighted area.  Remove all property from the car interior
and place it in the trunk. Avoid leaving valuables or personal documents in the
glove compartment.  Prior to leaving the security of the vehicle, note any
suspicious persons or behavior.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>If using valet service, leave only the ignition key, and take
trunk, house, or office keys with you. Often, valets are not employees of the
hotel and work for contract firms.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Parking garages are difficult to secure.  Avoid dimly lit garages
that are not patrolled and do not have security telephones or intercoms.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Female travelers should consider asking for an escort to their
vehicles whether parked in the lot or garage.</P>
</LI></UL>
