<P><STRONG> Malaria is a parasitic disease that kills between one to two
million people on the planet yearly.  Travelers off to exotic, tropical locales
may be at risk for contracting this terrible disease, which is transmitted by
the bite of a mosquito.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>For many years, people at risk of contracting malaria took
chloroquine prophylaxis--pills taken weekly to keep the disease at bay.
Unfortunately, in the last decade, resistance to this medication has developed
in the malaria organisms throughout the world.  As a result, alternative
medications have been developed to substitute for chloroquine in the prevention
of malaria.  The best of these is lariam, also known as mefloquine.  This is
also taken once a week, beginning two weeks before entering and finishing four
weeks after departing a malarious region.  As with all medications, lariam has
side effects: the most common are nausea, insomnia or vivid dreams, anxiety or
dizziness, which are considered mild.  It is contra-indicated in people who have
a history of seizures or psychiatric problems.  </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Certain magazines of late have sensationalized the side-effects of
lariam, in a careless manner that has done the public a great disservice by
causing undue alarm.  Reports of psychotic episodes, and irrational behavior
which have been reported have been exaggerated and have not been presented in a
fair and balanced manner.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>According to the CDC, the Center for Disease Control, and the WHO,
the World Health Organization, lariam is a safe and effective drug for
preventing malaria.  The risk of serious &quot;neuropsychiatric&quot;
side-effects are approximately 1 in 13,000--the same as that of chloroquine,
which has been used for decades without any disparaging comments by travel
magazines. Hundreds of thousands of people have been on lariam without serious
side-effects.  Studies of peace corps volunteers actually found less than 1 in
900,000 (as &quot;person-weeks-use&quot;) had any significant problems.  Over 18
scientific studies have been done on lariam and no statistical difference has
been found compared to chloroquine, or another anti-malarial, proguanil. 
Individual case reports do not prove any association between the drug and the
reaction--they only serve to raise a suspicion, which is good and necessary in
the world of medicine.  However, the magazines in question have taken poorly
designed and significantly flawed studies as the basis for their reporting,
which give the wrong impression and are unfair to the public.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The National Institute of Mental Health states that mental illness
has a prevalence of 28% in the whole population.  Anxiety is present in 13%;
insomnia in 50%; depression in 5% -- so how can a medication (lariam) which
causes less problems (approximately 0.001%) be the sole cause?!  Aspirin has a
7% rate of adverse drug reactions--which is above that of lariam, yet no one
sensationalizes the dangers of aspirin, which is one of the most useful
medications ever devised.  Could it be that the adverse reactions occur in a
population of people who may be at risk for having the very problems lariam is
blamed for?  In other words, does lariam just unmask hidden or undiagnosed
emotional or psychiatric problems?  Even with this aside, the stress of travel
is often enough to bring out such reactions in many people anyway, not to
mention the concurrent use of medications or drugs or even coexistent illness. 
A curious point to consider is that symptoms can persist after lariam is out of
the body--so how can the symptom be due to the medication with any certainty?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The CDC states that lariam prophylaxis is effective, well-tolerated
and has saved thousands of lives.  There are only a few absolute
contraindications to it (the main two contraindications are a history of
seizures or psychiatric illness), and, barring these, lariam should be given to
travelers at high risk for malaria.  It can be used in children and pregnant
women.  As with any medication, side-effects can occur; beginning prophylaxis
two weeks before departure provides ample time to observe for any reactions and
to make suitable modifications.</STRONG>
