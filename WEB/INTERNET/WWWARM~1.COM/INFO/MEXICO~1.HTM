<P>Health problems sometimes affect visitors to Mexico. Information on health
precautions can be obtained from local health departments or private doctors and
from other documents on this site. General guidance can also be found at the
Centers for Disease Control's international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.
</P>
<P>It is wise to review your health insurance policy before you travel. In some
places, particularly at resorts, medical costs can be as high or higher than in
the United States. If your insurance policy does not cover you in Mexico, it  is
strongly recommended that you purchase a policy that does. There are short-term
health insurance policies designed specifically to cover travel.</P>
<P>Medical facilities in Mexico differ from those in the United States.
Adequate medical care can be found in all major cities. There are some excellent
health facilities in Mexico City. Some remote areas or coastal islands may have
few or no medical facilities. For these reasons, in addition to medical
insurance that you can use in Mexico, consider obtaining insurance or joining a
medical assistance program to cover the exorbitant cost of medical evacuation in
the event of an accident or serious illness. As part of the coverage, these
programs usually offer emergency consultation by telephone. They may refer you
to the nearest hospital or call for help on your behalf; they may translate your
instructions to a health care worker on the scene. The cost of medical
evacuation coverage can be as low as $50.00 for a trip of 30 days. Without this
insurance, medical evacuation can cost thousands of dollars. The U.S. government
cannot pay to have you medically evacuated to the United States.
</P>
<P>Immunizations are normally recommended against diphtheria, tetanus, polio,
typhoid, and hepatitis A for travelers. Generally, these immunizations are
administered during childhood. For visitors coming directly from the United
States, no immunization certification is required to enter Mexico. If you are
traveling from an area known to be infected with yellow fever, a vaccination
certificate is required.</P>
<P>Malaria is found in some rural areas of Mexico, particularly those near the
southwest coast. Travelers to malarial areas should consult their physician or
the U.S. Public Health Service and take the recommended dosage of chloroquine.
Although chloroquine is not considered necessary for travelers to the major
resort areas on the Pacific and Gulf coasts, travelers to those areas should 
use insect repellent and take other personal protection measures to reduce
contact with mosquitoes, particularly from dusk to dawn when malaria
transmission is most likely.</P>
<P>Air pollution in Mexico City is severe. It is most dangerous during thermal
inversions which occur most often from December to May. Air pollution plus
Mexico City's high altitude are a particular health risk for the elderly and
persons with high blood pressure, anemia, or respiratory or cardiac problems. If
this applies to you, consult your doctor before traveling to Mexico City. </P>
<P>In high altitude areas, such as Mexico City, most people need a short
adjustment period. Spend the first few days in a leisurely manner, with a light
diet and reduced intake of alcohol. Avoid strenuous activity; this includes
everything from sports to rushing up the stairs. Reaction signs to high altitude
are lack of energy, a tendency to tire easily, shortness of breath, occasional
dizziness, and insomnia.</P>
<P>Drink only bottled water or water that has been boiled for 20 minutes. Be
aware of ice cubes that may not have been made with purified water Vegetables
and fruits should be peeled or washed in a purifying solution. A good rule to
follow is if you can't peel it or cook it, do not eat it. Diarrhea may benefit
from antimicrobial treatment which may be prescribed or purchased over the
counter. Travelers should consult a physician, rather than attempt
self-medication, if the diarrhea is severe or persists several days.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Safety">Safety Tips</A></H4>
<P>In an emergency, call [91] (5) 250-0123, the 24-hour hotline of the Mexican
Ministry of Tourism. They also have two toll free numbers: if calling within
Mexico [91] 800-90-392 and from the U.S. 1-800-482-9832. The hotline is for
immediate assistance, but it can give you general, nonemergency guidance as
well. It is an important number to keep with you. If necessary, in an emergency,
you may also call the U.S. Embassy or the nearest U.S. consulate or consular
agency. </P>
<P>As a visitor to Mexico, be alert to your new surroundings. Problem
situations in Mexico may be different from those you are used to, and safety
regulations and their enforcement are generally not equivalent to U.S.
standards.</P>
<P>In large cities, take the same precautions against assault, robbery, or
pickpockets that you would take in any large U.S. city. Be aware that women and
small children, as well as men, can be pickpockets or purse snatchers. Keep your
billfold in an inner front pocket; carry your purse tucked securely under your
arm; and wear the shoulder strap of your camera or bag across your chest. To
guard against thieves on motorcycles, walk away from the curb and carry your
purse away from the street.</P>
<P><B>At the Hotel.</B> Travelers to Mexico should leave valuables and
irreplaceable items in a safe place. All visitors are encouraged to make use of
hotel safes when available.</P>
<P><B>On Public Transport.</B> Be vigilant in bus and train stations and on
public  transport. Watch out for pickpockets in these areas.</P>
<P><B>On Streets and Highways.</B> Be aware of persons representing themselves
as Mexican police or other local officials. It is not uncommon for Americans to
become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion by Mexican law
enforcement and other officials. Mexican authorities are concerned about these
incidents and have cooperated in investigating such cases. <B>You must,
however, have the officer's name, badge number, and patrol car number to pursue
a complaint</B>. Make a note of this information if you are ever involved with
police or other officials. </P>
<P>Do not be surprised if you encounter several types of police in Mexico. The
Preventive Police, the Transit Police, and the Federal Highway Police all wear
uniforms. The Judicial Police who work for the public prosecutor are not
uniformed.</P>
<P><B>At the Pool or Beach.</B> Do not leave your belongings on the beach
while you are swimming. Keep your passport and other valuables in the hotel
safe.</P>
<P>Visitors to Mexican resorts should carefully assess the risk potential of
recreational activities. Sports and aquatic equipment that you rent may not meet
U.S. safety standards nor be covered by any accident insurance. For example,
unless you are certain that scuba diving equipment is up to standard, do not use
it. Inexperienced scuba divers should be aware of dive shops that promise to &quot;certify&quot;
you after a few hours instruction. Safe diving requires lengthy training. </P>
<P>Parasailing is offered at many Mexican beach resorts. Be aware that by
putting your name on the passenger list, you may be relieving the boat operator
and owner of responsibility for your safety. There have been cases in which
tourists have been dragged through palm trees or slammed into hotel walls while
participating in this activity.</P>
<P>Be extremely careful when renting jet-skis. Several tourists have been
killed or injured in jet-ski accidents, particularly when participating in group
tours. Often inexperienced tour guides allow their clients to follow too closely
or operate the jet-skis in other unsafe manners. In one case the jet-ski rental
company carried liability insurance limited to $2,500 U.S. dollars. Make sure
that the rental company has adequate medical/accident insurance, is staffed with
personnel on-site with water rescue training, and properly demonstrates safe
operation of the vehicle to you before you rent or operate such equipment.</P>
<P>Do not use pools or beaches without lifeguards, or, if you do, exercise
extreme caution. Do not dive into unknown bodies of water because hidden rocks
or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death. Some Mexican beaches,such
as those in Cancun, have warning signs about undertow; take them seriously. Be
aware that the newer resorts may lack comprehensive medical facilities.</P>

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="car">Travel by Car</A></H4>
<P>People are often surprised when inconveniences occur because they were
unaware of the laws regarding crossing the border. It is important for visitors
to remember the following steps when crossing the border between the United
States and Mexico by automobile. There are no procedures to comply with if you
are traveling within the Border Zone or Free Trade Zone (including the Baja
California Peninsula and the Sonora Free Trade Zone). If you wish to travel past
these zones, you will need to adhere to certain procedures. The first step to
take is to obtain the original and photocopies of the appropriate immigration
form, the vehicle state registration certificate or document certifying legal
ownership, and leasing contract. If the vehicle is leased or rented then it must
be in the person's name who is importing the car. If the vehicle belongs to a
company, proper documentation is necessary to show the individual works for the
company.</P>
<P>A valid driver's license and an international credit card (American Express,
Diner's Club, Mastercard or Visa) are needed in the name of the owner of the
vehicle. If you do not possess an international credit card, you will be asked
to post a bond, payable to the Federal Treasury, issued by an authorized bonding
company in Mexico. An alternative is to make a cash deposit at Banco del
Ejercito in an amount equal to the value of the vehicle according to the tables
of vehicle values for bonding companies. This is often a substantial percentage
of the vehicle's value. </P>
<P>The second step is to present the documents you have received to the
Vehicular Control Module located in Customs to process the importation permit.
Carry this document with you at all times! The permit is valid for periods up to
six months. The vehicle may be driven across the border multiple times during
the authorized period of the permit. Other persons may drive the car as long as
the owner is in the vehicle. Other foreigners with the same &quot;tourist&quot;
status as the vehicle owner may drive the vehicle without the owner present in
the car. If you wish to authorize another person to drive your car, record the
authorization with Mexican officials when you enter Mexico even if you expect to
be a passenger when the other person drives. Do not, under any circumstances,
allow an unauthorized person to drive the vehicle when the owner is not in it.
Such a person would have to pay a fine amounting to a substantial percentage of
the vehicles's value, and your vehicle would be confiscated. All documents and
the credit card must be in the name of the owner, who must be present upon
crossing the border. We caution American citizens not to loan their vehicles to
Mexican citizens resident in Mexico as those vehicles are subject to seizure by
Mexican authorities. If confiscated, they are not returned. </P>
<P>In the third step, your credit card will be charged an amount in national
currency equivalent to U.S. $10 at the Banco del Ejercito. If you do not have a
credit card, the bank will accept cash in an amount equal to the value of your
vehicle shown in the table of vehicle values for bonding companies. Your deposit
plus any interest it may earn will be returned upon departure from Mexico. You
may also, instead, obtain a bond through an authorized Mexican bonding company
located at all border crossings. The bonding companies require a refundable
deposit equal to a substantial percentage of the vehicle's value. The bonding
company will also assess taxes and processing costs for this service.
</P>
<P>Finally, upon your departure from Mexico, and if the vehicle will not be 
driven back into Mexico, the permit for temporary importation must be cancelled
at Customs. If these steps are carefully followed, there should be no problem
taking your car to Mexico. Remember, if your car is found in Mexico beyond the
authorized time or without the proper documents, it will be immediately
confiscated. Also, the sale, abandonment, or use of the vehicle for financial
gain will result in its confiscation. For more information, contact your nearest
office of the Mexican Consulate or call 1-800-446-8277.</P>
<P>If you bring spare auto parts to Mexico, declare them when you enter the
country. When you leave, be prepared to show that you are taking the unused
parts with you or that you have had them installed in Mexico. Save your repair
receipts for this purpose.</P>
<P>All vehicular traffic is restricted in the capital city of Mexico City in
order to reduce air pollution. The restriction is based on the last digit of the
vehicle license plate. (There is no specific provision regarding plates with 
letters only.) Driving of vehicles with temporary license plates or any other
plate not conforming with the above is not permitted.</P>
<P>Monday: no driving if license plate ends with 5 or 6</P>
<P>Tuesday: no driving if license plate ends with 7 or 8</P>
<P>Wednesday: no driving if license plate ends with 3 or 4</P>
<P>Thursday: no driving if license plate ends with 1 or 2</P>
<P>Friday: no driving if license plate ends with 9 or 0</P>
<P>Saturday and Sunday: all vehicles may be driven.</P>
<P>Avoid excessive speed and, if at all possible, do not drive at night. Loose
livestock can appear at any time. Construction sites or stranded vehicles are
often unmarked by flares or other warning signals. Sometimes cars have only one
headlight. Many cars lack brake lights. Bicycles seldom have lights or
reflectors. This makes for very dangerous driving conditions at night. Be
prepared for a sudden stop at any time. <B>Mexican driving conditions are such
that, for your safety, you must drive more slowly than you do at home.</B></P>
<P>Learn local driving signals. In Mexico, a blinking left turn signal on the
vehicle in front of you could mean that it is clear ahead and you may pass, or
it could mean the driver is making a left turn. An outstretched left arm may 
mean an invitation for you to pass. When in doubt, do not pass. </P>
<P>An oncoming vehicle flashing its headlights is a warning for you to slow
down or pull over because you are both approaching a narrow bridge or place in
the road. The custom is that the first vehicle to flash has the right of way 
and the other must yield.</P>
<P>When it begins to rain, immediately slow down to a crawl. Freshly wet roads
are dangerous because oil and road dust mix with water and form a lubricant.
Until this mixture washes away, driving is extremely hazardous. Beware of sudden
rains. Stop, or go extremely slow, until conditions improve.</P>
<P>To avoid highway crime, try not to drive at night and never drive alone
during this time. Never sleep in vehicles along the road. Do not, under any
circumstances, pick up hitchhikers who not only pose a threat to your physical
safety, but also put you in danger of being arrested for unwittingly
transporting narcotics or narcotics traffickers in your vehicle. Your vehicle
can be confiscated if you are transporting marijuana or other narcotics. There
are checkpoints and temporary roadblocks where vehicles are checked.</P>
<P>If you plan to drive, learn about your route from an auto club,guidebook,or
a Mexican government tourist office. Some routes have heavy truck and bus
traffic, others have poor or nonexistent shoulders, and many have animals on the
loose. Also, some of the newer roads have very few restaurants, motels, gas
stations, or auto repair shops. You may not be able to avoid all problems, but
at least you will know what to expect if you have done some research.</P>
<P>For your safety, have your vehicle serviced and in optimum condition before
you leave for Mexico. It is wise to bring an extra fan belt, fuses, and other
spare parts. Pack a basic first-aid kit and carry an emergency water supply in
your vehicle. Unleaded gasoline (magna sin) is generally available throughout
Mexico. Bring a flexible funnel to fill your gas tank because some gas stations
have nozzles too large to fit unleaded tanks.</P>
<P>If you have an emergency while driving, call the Ministry of Tourism's
hotline or (91)(5)25O-8221/8555 ext 130/297 to obtain help from the &quot;Green
Angels,&quot; a fleet of radio dispatched trucks with bilingual crews that
operate daily. Services include protection, medical first aid, mechanical aid
for your car, and basic supplies. You will not be charged for services, only for
parts, gas, and oil. The Green Angels patrol daily, from dawn until sunset If
you are unable to call them, pull off the road and lift the hood of your car;
chances are good they will find you.</P>

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Insurance">Insurance</A></H4>
<P> Mexican auto insurance is sold in most cities and towns on both sides of
the border. U.S. automobile liability insurance is not valid in Mexico nor is
most collision and comprehensive coverage issued by U.S. companies. Therefore,
when you cross the border, purchase auto insurance adequate for your needs in
Mexico. A good rule of thumb is to buy coverage equivalent to that which you
carry in the United States.</P>
<P>Motor vehicle insurance is invalid in Mexico if the driver is found to be
under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Regardless of whether you have
insurance, if you are involved in an accident you will be taken into police
custody until it can be determined who is liable and whether you have the
ability to pay any judgment If you do not have Mexican liability insurance, you
are almost</P>
<P>certain to spend some time in jail until all parties are satisfied that
responsibility has been assigned and adequate financial satisfaction received.
There may also be criminal liability assigned if the injuries or damages are
serious.</P>
<P><A HREF="#insindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Rental">Rental Cars</A></H4>
<UL><LI><P><B>Renting in the United States</B>. Many car rental companies in
the United States have clauses in their contracts prohibiting drivers from
traveling out of the country. The Mexican police are aware of these regulations,
and will sometimes impound rental vehicles driven from the United States. When
renting a vehicle in the United States, check with the company to see if your
contract allows you to drive it into Mexico. </P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>Renting a Car in Mexico.</B> The standard insurance included
with many car rental contracts in Mexico provides only nominal liability
coverage, often as little as the equivalent of $200. Because Mexican law permits
the jailing of drivers after an accident until they have met their obligations
to third parties and to the rental company, renters should read their contracts
carefully and purchase additional liability and comprehensive insurance if
necessary.</P>
</LI></UL>
<P><A HREF="#rentindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Crime">Crime</A></H4>
<P>Street crime is common, especially in urban areas. Persons driving on some
Mexican roads, particularly in isolated regions, have been targeted by bandits
who operate primarily after dark. Criminals, particularly in Sinaloa, sometimes
represent themselves as Mexican police or other local officials. The U.S.
Embassy advises its personnel not to travel on Mexican highways after dark.
Highway 15 and Express Highway I (limited access) in the state of Sinaloa are
particularly dangerous areas where criminal assaults and murders have occurred,
during the day and night.</P>
<UL><LI><P><B>If You Are in Danger.</B> Call the Mexican Ministry of
Tourism's emergency hotline, [91](5) 250-0123, for immediate assistance. Or, in
Mexico City, dial 06 for police assistance.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P><B>If You Have Been the Victim of a Crime.</B> Immediately
contact the U.S. Embassy or the nearest U.S. consulate or consular agency. You
should also report thecrime to the local police immediately.</P></LI></UL>
<P><A HREF="#crimindx"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="prob1">Avoiding Legal Problems</A></H4>
<P><B>While traveling in Mexico, you are subject to Mexican </B><B>laws and
not U.S. laws.</B> Tourists who commit illegal acts have <B>no
</B> special privileges and are subject to full prosecution under the Mexican
judicial system.</P>
<P><B>Avoid drug offenses.</B> Mexico rigorously prosecutes drug cases. Under
Mexican law, possession of and trafficking in illegal drugs are federal
offenses. For drug trafficking, bail does not exist. Convicted offenders can
expect lengthy jail sentences and fines. Sentences for possession of drugs in
Mexico can be as long as 25 years plus fines. Just as in the U.S., the purchase
of controlled  medication requires a doctor's prescription. The Mexican list of
controlled medications differs from the U.S.list, and Mexican public health laws
concerning controlled medication are unclear. Possession of excessive amounts of
a psychotropic drug such as valium can result in your arrest if the authorities
suspect abuse. Mexican law does not differentiate between types of narcotics:
heroin, marijuana, and amphetamines, for example, are treated the same. <B>Offenders
found guilty of possessing more than a token amount of any narcotic substance
are subject to a minimum sentence of 10 years, and it is not uncommon for
persons charged with drug offenses to be detained for up to 1 year before a
verdict is reached.</B></P>
<P>Remember, if narcotics are found in your vehicle, you are subject to arrest
and your vehicle can be confiscated.</P>
<P><B>Avoid public drunkenness.</B> It is against the law to be drunk in
public in Mexico. Certain border towns have become impatient with teenaged (and
older) Americans who cross the border to drink and carouse. This behavior can
lead to fights, arrests, traffic accidents, and even fatalities.</P>
<P><B>Do not bring firearms.</B> Possession of any gun or rifle without proper
authorization by the Mexican authorities is considered a &quot;Firearms Offense&quot;
in Mexico and carries stiff penalties. Possession of a single non-assault weapon
carries a penalty of up to five years in Mexican prison. Sentences for
possession of firearms in Mexico can be as long as 30 years. A permit from a
Mexican consulate in the U.S. is required to import firearms or ammunition into
Mexico, whether or not the firearm is legally registered in the U.S. The U.S.
Embassy has noted an increase of Americans being detained for illegally
smuggling arms into Mexico. U.S. citizens should comply with all Mexican laws on
arms, including any arms they may wish to bring in for hunting. Some Mexican
cities have ordinances prohibiting the possession of knives or anything that
might be construed as a weapon.</P>
<P>Be aware that, even when you enter Mexican waters on your private boat, you
are subject to the ban on importing firearms.</P>
<P>Some cities, such as Nuevo Laredo, have ordinances prohibiting the
possession of knives and similar weapons. Tourists have even been arrested for
possessing souvenir knives. Most arrests for knife possession occur in
connection with some other infraction, such as drunk and disorderly behavior.
</P>
<P><B>Failure to pay hotel bills</B> or for other services rendered is
considered fraud under Mexican law. Those accused of these offenses are subject
to arrest and conviction with stiff fines and jail sentences.</P>
<P><B>Be cautious when purchasing real estate.</B> U.S. citizens who become
involved in time-share or other real property purchases should be aware that
Mexican laws and practices regarding real estate are markedly different from
those in the United States. Foreigners purchasing real estate or time-shares in
Mexico have no protection under Mexican law and should be aware of the high
risks involved. Foreigners may be granted the right to own real property only
under very specific conditions and the purchase of real property in Mexico is
far more complicated than in the United States. For example no title insurance
is available in Mexico for the purchaser and the builders frequently go bankrupt
leaving the investors with little recourse to recoup their funds. The U.S.
Embassy strongly recommends the use of competent local legal assistance for any
significant real property or business purchase. A list of local attorneys can be
obtained from the U.S. Embassy or the nearest consulate in Mexico.</P>
<P><B>To Avoid Disputes With Merchants, Be a Careful Shopper.</B> Make sure
the goods you buy are in good condition and always get a receipt. There is a
federal consumer protection office, the Procuraduria Federal del Consumidor, to
assist you if you have a major problem with a faulty product or service.
However, if the problem is with a service of the tourist industry, you should
bring the matter to the Mexican Government Tourist Office (Secretaria de
Turismo).</P>

<P> If you find yourself in serious difficulty while in Mexico, contact a
consular officer at the U.S. Embassy or the nearest U.S. consulate for
assistance. U.S. consuls cannot serve as attorneys or give legal assistance.
They can, however, provide lists of local attorneys and advise you of your
rights under Mexican laws. </P>
<P>Worldwide, Mexico has the highest number of arrests of Americans abroad -
over 1,000 per year - and the highest prison population of U.S. citizens outside
of the United States - about 450 at any one time. If you are arrested, ask
permission to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. consulate. Under
international agreements and practice, you have the right to talk with an
American consul. Although U.S. consuls are limited in what they can do to assist
you in legal difficulties, they can monitor the status of detained U.S. citizens
and make sure they are treated fairly under local laws. They will also notify
your relatives or friends upon your request. </P>
<P>An individual is guaranteed certain rights under the Mexican constitution,
but those rights differ significantly from U.S. constitutional guarantees.The
Mexican judicial system is based on Roman and Napoleonic law and presumes a
person accused of a crime to be guilty until proven innocent. There is no trial
by jury nor writ of habeas corpus in the Anglo-American sense. Trial under the
Mexican system is a prolonged process based largely on documents examined on a
fixed date in court by prosecution and defense counsel. Sentencing usually takes
6 to 10 months. Bail can be granted after sentencing if the sentence is less
than 5 years. Pre-trial bail exists but  is never granted when the possible
sentence upon conviction is greater than 5 years.</P>

travel past the 25 kilometer border area of Mexico must be properly documented.
Those transiting Mexico to another country need a transit visa which costs a

<P><B><A NAME="Tourist">Tourist Cards</A></B></P>
<P> All U.S. citizens visiting Mexico for tourism or study for up to 180 days
need a document, called a tourist card in English or FMT in Spanish, to enter
and leave Mexico, The tourist card is free and may be obtained from Mexican
consulates, Mexican tourism offices, Mexican border crossing points, and from
most airlines serving Mexico. If you fly to Mexico, you must obtain your tourist
card before boarding your flight; it cannot be obtained upon arrival at an
airport in Mexico. The tourist card is issued upon presentation of proof of
citizenship, such as a U.S. passport or a U.S. birth certificate, plus a photo
I.D., such as a driver's license. Tourist cards are issued for up to 90 days
with a single entry, or if you present proof of sufficient funds, for 180-days
with multiple entries.</P>
<P>Upon entering Mexico, retain and safeguard the pink copy of your tourist
card so you may surrender it to Mexican immigration when you depart. You must
leave Mexico before your tourist card expires or you are subject to a fine. A
tourist card for less than 180 days may be revalidated in Mexico by the Mexican
immigration service (Direccion General de Servicios Migratorios).</P>

<P> If you wish to stay longer than 180 days, or if you wish to do business or
conduct religious work in Mexico, contact the Mexican Embassy or the nearest
Mexican consulate to obtain a visa or permit. Persons conducting religious work
on a tourist card are subject to arrest and deportation.</P>

<P>If you plan to live or retire in Mexico, consult a Mexican consulate on the
type of long-term visa you will need. As soon as possible after you arrive in
the place you will live, it is a good idea to register with the U.S. Embassy or
the nearest U.S. consulate or consular agent. Bring your passport or other
identification with you. Registration makes it easier to contact you in an
emergency. (Registration information is confidential and will not be released to
inquirers without your express authorization.)</P>

<P>A child under the age of 18 traveling with only one parent must have
written, notarized consent from the other parent to travel, or must carry, if
applicable, a decree of sole custody for the accompanying parent or a death
certificate for the other parent. Children traveling alone or in someone else's
custody must have notarized consent from both parents to travel, or if
applicable, notarized consent from a single parent plus documentation that the
parent is the only custodial parent.</P>

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="What">What You May Bring Into Mexico</A></H4>
<P></P>
<P><B>Customs Regulations.</B> Tourists should enter Mexico with only the
items needed for their trip. Entering with large quantities of an item a tourist
might not normally be expected to have, particularly expensive appliances, such
as televisions, stereos, or other items, may lead to suspicion of smuggling and
possible confiscation of the items and arrest of the individual.</P>
<P>Mexican regulations limit the value of goods brought into Mexico by U.S.
citizens arriving by air or sea to $300 U.S.per person and by land to $30 U.S.
per person. Other travel-related items may also be brought in duty-free. Amounts
exceeding the duty-free limit are subject to a 32.8 percent tax.</P>
<P>Unless you prepare ahead, you may have difficulty bringing computers or
other expensive electronic equipment into Mexico for your personal use. To
prevent being charged an import tax, write a statement about your intention to
use the equipment for personal use and to remove it from Mexico when you leave.
Have this statement signed and certified at a Mexican consulate in the United
States and present it to Mexican customs as you enter Mexico.</P>
<P>Land travelers should verify from Mexican customs at the border that all
items in their possession may be legally brought into Mexico. You will be
subject to a second immigration and customs inspection south of the Mexican
border where unlawful items may be seized, and you could be prosecuted
regardless of whether or not the items passed through the initial customs
inspection.</P>
<P><B>Currency.</B> The Mexican government permits tourists to exchange
dollars for pesos at the fluctuating free market rate. There are no restrictions
on the import or export of bank notes and none on the export of reasonable
quantities of ordinary Mexican coins. However, gold or silver Mexican coins may
not be exported.</P>
<P>Take travelers checks with you because personal U.S.checks are rarely
accepted by Mexican hotels or banks. Major credit cards are accepted in many
hotels, shops, and restaurants. An exchange office (casa de cambios) usually
gives a better rate of exchange than do stores, hotels, or restaurants.</P>
<P><B>Pets.</B> U.S. visitors to Mexico may bring a dog, cat, or up to four
canaries by presenting the following certificates at the border:</P>
<UL><LI><P> a pet health certificate signed by a registered veterinarian in
the United States and issued not more than 72 hours before the animal enters
Mexico and</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>a pet vaccination certificate showing that the animal has been
treated for rabies, hepatitis, pip, and leptospirosis.</P></LI></UL>
<P>Certification by Mexican consular authorities is not required for the health
or vaccination certificate. A permit fee is charged at the time of entry into
Mexico.</P>

<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Shopping">Shopping -- Some Things To Beware of Buying</A></H4>
<P></P>
<P><B>Wildlife and Wildlife Products.</B> Beware of purchasing souvenirs made
from endangered wildlife. Mexican markets and stores abound with wildlife, most
of it prohibited from international traffic. You risk confiscation and a
possible fine by U.S. Customs if you attempt to import virtually any wildlife
from Mexico. In particular, watch out for and avoid:</P>
<UL>
<LI> All products made from sea turtles, including such items as turtle leather
boots, tortoise-shell jewelry, and sea turtle oil cosmetics.
</LI>
<LI> Fur from spotted cats.
</LI>
<LI> Mexican birds, stuffed or alive, such as parrots, parakeets, or birds of
prey.
</LI>
<LI> Crocodile and caiman leather.
</LI>
<LI> Black coral jewelry.
</LI>
<LI> Wildlife curios, such as stuffed iguanas.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>When driving across state lines within Mexico, you can expect to be stopped
at agricultural livestock inspection stations.</P>
<P><B>Antiques.</B> Mexico considers all pre-Colombian objects to be the &quot;inalienable
property of the Nation&quot; and that the unauthorized export of such objects is
theft and is punishable by arrest, detention, and judicial prosecution. Under
U.S. law, to import pre-Colombian monumental and architectural sculpture and
murals, you must present proof that they were legally exported from the country
of origin. U.S. law does not prohibit the import of non-monumental or
non-architectural artifacts from Mexico.</P>
<P><B>Glazed Ceramics.</B> According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
it is possible to suffer lead poisoning if you consume food or beverages that
have been stored or served in improperly glazed ceramic ware. Analysis of many
ceramic pieces from Mexico has shown them to contain dangerous levels of lead.
Unless you have proof of their safety, use glazed ceramics purchased in Mexico
for decorative purposes only.</P>
<P><A HREF="#shop"><I>&lt;index&gt;</I></A></P>
<P></P>
<H4><A NAME="Returning">Returning to the United States</A></H4>
<P>You must present the pink copy of your tourist card at your point of
departure from Mexico. If you are returning by motor vehicle, you will need to
show your vehicle import permit when you cross the border. As of June, 1995, the
airport departure tax is $10 or the equivalent in Mexican currency for those
returning by commercial airline.</P>
<P>The U.S. Customs Service currently permits U.S. citizens returning from
international travel to bring back $400 worth of merchandise, including 1 liter
of alcohol, duty free. The next $1,000 worth of items brought back is subject to
a duty of 10%. In addition to U.S. Customs regulations, be aware that some U.S.
border states (most notably, Texas) have imposed state restrictions on liquor,
wine, and beer imports from Mexico. If you are planning to bring back alcoholic
beverages, inquire about these restrictions from the liquor control office of
the state through which you plan to return.</P>
