<CENTER><H1>Your Driver's Licence and Auto Insurance</H1>
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>If you intend to drive overseas, check with the embassy or consulate of the
countries you will visit to learn their driver's license, road permit, and auto
insurance requirements.  If possible, obtain road maps before you go.</P>
<P>Many countries do not recognize a U.S. driver's license.  Most, however,
accept an international driver's permit.  Before departure, obtain one at a
local office of an automobile association.  You must be at least age 18, and you
will need two passport-size photographs and your valid U.S. license.  Certain
countries require road permits instead of tolls to use their divided highways
and will fine drivers without a permit.</P>
<P>Car rental agencies overseas usually provide auto insurance, but in some
countries, the required coverage is minimal.  A good rule of thumb when renting
a car overseas is to purchase insurance coverage that is at least equivalent to
that which you carry at home.</P>
<P>In general, your U.S. auto insurance does not cover you abroad.  However,
your policy may apply when you drive to countries that neighbor the United
States.  Check with your insurer to see if your policy covers you in Canada,
Mexico, or in countries south of Mexico.  Even if your policy is valid in one of
these countries, it may not meet its minimum requirements.  For instance, in
most of Canada, you must carry at least $200,000 in liability insurance, and
Mexico requires that if vehicles do not carry theft, third party liability, and
comprehensive insurance, the owner must post a bond that could be as high as 50%
of the value of the vehicle.  If you are under-insured for a country, auto
insurance can usually be purchased on either side of the border.</P>
