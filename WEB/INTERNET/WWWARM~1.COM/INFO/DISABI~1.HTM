<CENTER><H1>Passengers with Disabilities</H1></CENTER>
<P></P> 
<P>Over 40 million Americans have disabilities.  The Air Carrier Access Act and
the DOT rule that implements it set out procedures designed to ensure that these
individuals have the same opportunity as anyone else to enjoy a pleasant flight.
 Here are some of the major provisions of the rule:</P>
<UL><LI><P>A person may not be refused transportation on the basis of
disability or be required to have an attendant or produce a medical certificate,
except in certain limited circumstances specified in the rule.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Airlines must provide enplaning, deplaning and connecting
assistance, including both personnel and equipment. (Some small commuter
aircraft may not be accessible to passengers with severe mobility impairments. 
When making plans to fly to small cities, such passengers should check on the
aircraft type and its accessibilities.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Airport terminals and airline reservations centers must have TDD
telephone devices for persons with hearing or speech impairments.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Passengers with vision or hearing impairments must have timely
access to the same information given to other passengers at the airport or on
the plane concerning gate assignments, delayed flights, safety, etc.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>New widebody aircraft must have a wheelchair-accessible lavatory
and an on-board wheelchair.  Airlines must put an on-board wheelchair on most
other flights upon a passenger's request (48 hour's notice required).</P></LI>
</UL>
<UL><LI><P>Air carriers must accept wheelchairs as checked baggage, and
cannot require passengers to sign liability waivers for them (except for
pre-existing damage).</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Most new airplanes must have movable armrests on half the aisle
seats, and on-board stowage for one folding passenger wheelchair.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Carriers must allow service animals to accompany passengers in the
cabin, as long as they don't block the aisle or other emergency evacuation
route.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>FAA safety rules establish standards for passengers allowed to sit
in emergency exit rows; such persons must be able to perform certain
evacuation-related functions.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>FAA rules also prohibit passengers from bringing their own oxygen.
 Most airlines will provide aircraft-approved oxygen for a fee, but aren't
required to.</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Airlines may not charge for services that are required by this
rule.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Airlines must make available a specially-trained Complaints
Resolution Official if a dispute arises.  There must be a copy of the DOT rule
at every airport.</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>It's wise to call the airline before your trip to reconfirm any
assistance that you have requested.</P></LI></UL>
