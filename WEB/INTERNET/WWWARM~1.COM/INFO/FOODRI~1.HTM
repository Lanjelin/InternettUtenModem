<CENTER><H1>HEALTH RISKS FROM FOOD AND DRINK</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Contaminated food and drink are common sources for the introduction of
infection into the body. Among the more common infections that travelers may
acquire from contaminated food and drink are <I>Escherichia coli</I>
infections, shigellosis or bacillary dysentery, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis,
and hepatitis A. Other less common infectious disease risks for travelers
include typhoid fever and other salmonelloses, cholera, infections caused by
rotaviruses and Norwalk-like viruses, and a variety of protozoan and helminth
parasites (other than those that cause giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis). Many
of the infectious diseases transmitted in food and water can also acquired
directly through the fecal-oral route.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>WATER</H4>
<P>Water that has been adequately chlorinated, using minimum recommended
waterworks standards as practiced in the United States, will afford significant
protection against viral and bacterial waterborne diseases. However, chlorine
treatment alone, as used in the routine disinfection of water, may not kill some
enteric viruses and the parasitic organisms that cause giardiasis and amebiasis.
In areas where chlorinated tap water is not available, or where hygiene and
sanitation are poor, travelers should be advised that only the following may be
safe to drink:</P>
<UL><LI><P>Beverages, such as tea and coffee, made with boiled water</P>
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Canned or bottled <I>carbonated</I> beverages, including <I>carbonated
</I>bottled water and soft drinks</P></LI></UL>
<UL><LI><P>Beer and wine</P>
</LI></UL>
<P>Where water may be contaminated, ice (or containers for drinking) also
should be considered contaminated. Thus, in these areas ice should not be used
in beverages. If ice has been in contact with containers used for drinking, the
containers should be thoroughly cleaned, preferably with soap and hot water,
after the ice has been discarded.</P>
<P>It is safer to drink directly from a can or bottle of a beverage than from a
questionable container. However, water on the outside of cans or bottles of
beverages might be contaminated. Therefore, wet cans or bottles should be dried
before being opened, and surfaces which are contacted directly by the mouth in
drinking should first be wiped clean. Where water may be contaminated, travelers
should avoid brushing their teeth with tap water.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>TREATMENT OF WATER</H4>
<P>Boiling is by far the most reliable method to make water of uncertain purity
safe for drinking. Water should be brought to a vigorous boil and allowed to
cool to room temperature -- do not add ice. At very high altitudes, for an extra
margin of safety, boil for several minutes or use chemical disinfection. Adding
a pinch of salt to each quart, or pouring the water several times from one
container to another will improve the taste. </P>
<P>Chemical disinfection with iodine is an alternative method of water
treatment when it is not feasible to boil water. Two well-tested methods for
disinfection with iodine are the use of tincture  of iodine (5 drops 2% tincture
per quart clear water {10 drops for cloudy water}), and the use of tetraglycine
hydroperiodide tablets (Globaline, Potable-Agua, Coghlan's, etc.). The tablets
are available from pharmacies and sporting goods. The manufacturer's
instructions should be followed.</P>
<P>There are a variety of portable filters currently on the market which
according to the manufacturer's data will provide safe drinking water. Although
the iodide-impregnated resins and microstrainer type filters will kill and/or
remove many microorganisms, very few published reports in the scientific
literature deal both with the methods used and the results of the tests employed
to evaluate the efficacy of these filters against water-borne pathogens. Until
there is sufficient independent verification of the efficacy of these filters,
the Center for Disease Control makes no recommendation regarding their use.</P>
<P>As a last resort, if no source of safe drinking water is available or can be
obtained, tap water that is uncomfortably hot to touch may be safer than cold
tap water, however proper disinfection or boiling is still advised.</P>
<P></P>
<H4>FOOD</H4>
<P>To avoid illness, food should be selected with care. All raw food is subject
to contamination. Particularly in areas where hygiene and sanitation are
inadequate, the traveler should be advised to avoid salads, uncooked vegetables,
unpasteurized milk and milk products such as cheese, and to eat only food that
has been cooked and is still hot, or fruit that has been peeled by the traveler.
Undercooked and raw meat, fish, and shellfish may carry various intestinal
pathogens. Cooked food that has been allowed to stand for several hours at
ambient temperature may provide a fertile medium for bacterial growth and should
be thoroughly reheated before serving. </P>
<P>Some species of fish and shellfish can contain poisonous biotoxins, even
when well cooked. The most common type of fish poisoning in travelers is
ciguatera fish poisoning. Barracuda is the most toxic fish and should always be
avoided. Red snapper, grouper, amberjack, sea bass, and a wide range of tropical
reef fish contain the toxin at unpredictable times. The potential for ciguatera
poisoning exists in all subtropical and tropical insular areas in the West
Indies, Pacific, and Indian Oceans where the implicated fish species are
consumed. </P>
<P>Recently, cholera cases have occurred among persons who ate crab brought
back from Latin America by travelers. Travelers should not bring perishable
seafoods with them when they return.</P>
