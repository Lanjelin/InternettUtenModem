<CENTER><H1>Guarding Against Thieves</H1></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>Coat pockets, handbags, and hip pockets are particularly susceptible to
theft.  Thieves will use all kinds of ploys to divert your attention just long
enough to pick your pocket and grab your purse or wallet.  These ploys include
creating a disturbance, spilling something on your clothing, or even handing you
a baby to hold!</P>
<P>Prevent theft by carrying your belongings in a secure manner.  Consider not
carrying a purse or wallet when going on crowded streets.  Women who carry a
shoulder bag should keep it tucked under the arm and held securely by the strap.
 Men should put their wallets in their front trouser pockets or use money belts
instead of hip pockets.  A wallet wrapped in rubber bands is more difficult to
remove undetected.</P>
<P>Be especially cautious in a large crowd--in the subway, marketplace, at a
festival, or if surrounded by groups of vagrant children.  Do not make it easy
for thieves!</P>
