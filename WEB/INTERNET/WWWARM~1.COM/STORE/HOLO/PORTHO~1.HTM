<P><STRONG>Imagine an old brass ship's porthole with a patina of oxidation
from years in the elements. Now marry the porthole with a state-of-the art
pulsed laser hologram of live fish against a reef-like backdrop. The image is
3-D, the porthole is solid, and you have the feeling that you are in a submarine
gazing out at a tropical reef.  Bring the feeling of the Great Barrier Reef into
your home or office!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Now for the specs: The PORTHOL frame is a hand-painted lightweight
resin casting and is 14-1/2&quot; in diameter and 1-1/2&quot; deep.  The master
hologram by Ron and Bernadette Olson was made with a pulsed laser from live fish
in a reef-like setting. The hologram in the PORTHOL was recorded in photopolyer
and has between six to eight inches of depth. The 2-D photo cannot show the
image quality and clarity of the hologram nor the realism of the PORTHOL.</STRONG></P>
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>This new and exciting product is ideal for room decoration in the
home and is perfect as a thematic element in restaurants and businesses with a
nautical focus. Also the perfect gift for the ichthyologist, scuba diver or fish
fancier in your life  who wants the beauty of an aquarium without the upkeep.</STRONG></P>
