<P><STRONG><B><I>In Transition</I></B> is a column that will appear every
two months in Armchair World. The column is written for anyone wanting greater
awareness about issues concerning mental health and mental illness. I will write
this column using the same philosophy that I use in treating patients: that is
to combine the known science of mental processes with the individuality of the
patient's needs. The result is sometimes biased and  sometimes ethereal.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>If after reading this column, readers have questions about
treatment, they should contact their local American Psychiatric Association or
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) chapter.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As with all medical illnesses, psychiatry traces its roots to the
Greeks. Around 400 B.C. both Hippocrates and later Aristotle spoke of mental
processes and their pathology in terms of a bodily process - not in terms of
magic or morality. This enlightenment continued until the early middle ages.
From that time until the 17th century, mental illness was attributed to demonic
influence or a moral malady. It was not until Emil Kraepelin in the late 1800's
and a little later with Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud that the tenets of modern
psychiatry were clearly articulated. Modern psychiatry views mental illness and
abnormal behavior as a result of brain function, not due to a sinful or amoral
life.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Even today, we in the modern era struggle with the concept that
mental illness is due to brain function and not to defects in moral character.
This problem still stigmatizes and ostracizes most mentally ill people. In later
columns I will discuss the premise that most people suffer from some form of
mental illness, however slight. Mental illness can range from mild anxiety to
moderate depression to severe forms of schizophrenia. Having a mental illness in
one's life time is probably normal. Those that have never had a mental illness
can be thought of as super-normal.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>What is normal? Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines normal as &quot;typical,
usual, healthy, according to the rule or standard.&quot;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>What is abnormal? What is a mental illness? <B>The Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV</B> (APA Press, 1994) uses the
following definition for mental illness; &quot;A clinically significant behavior
or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is
associated with present distress (e.g., painful syndrome) or disability (e.g.,
impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significant
increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of
freedom. In addition, this syndrome or pattern must not be merely an expected
and culturally sanctioned response to a particular event, for example, the death
of a loved one. Whatever its original cause, it must be considered a
manifestation of a behavioral, psychological, or biological dysfunction in the
individual. Neither deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) nor
conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are mental
disorders unless the deviance or conflict is a symptom of a dysfunction in the
individual, as described&quot;.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Both of the above definitions are arbitrary and relative. However
certain behaviors are consistent across cultures and times. Some are adaptive
and others are not. What counts on the individual level, and is hard to
describe, is that patients who seek treatment from a psychiatrist are in pain
and want relief. More about normality vs. mental illness next time.</STRONG></P>
