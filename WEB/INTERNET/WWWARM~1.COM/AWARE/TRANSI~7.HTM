<P><STRONG>I have been talking about mood disorders and now would like to
switch gears.  Mental disorders range from minor peccadilloes to total
dysfunction.  The next group of illnesses follows along this general pattern. 
This very diverse group is collectively and probably incorrectly called anxiety
disorders.  There are basically six disorders in this group and they are:  panic
disorder; generalized anxiety disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder;
obsessive-compulsive disorder; social phobia; and simply phobia.  They can be
minor irritants in one's life, like a cold, or they can be catastrophic leading
to death like cancer.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Let us spend a little time and talk about normality.  Most people
would say that anxiety is an inescapable aspect of life.  To those I say &quot;you're
absolutely correct.&quot;.  When we encounter different life situations we
become temporarily anxious, but for some people the anxiety never goes away and
the anxiety occurs when it should not.  Let me take a page out of a physiology
textbook.  When a person or animal is confronted or threatened by something, the
immediate reaction is fear.  This state is both emotional and physiological. 
You feel fear.  Your heart races.  You become more aware of your surroundings. 
Your senses are heightened.  You feel more, hear more, see more.  You are ready
to react -- to fight or have flight.  After the threat is removed your
heightened senses and reactions return to their usual state.  This is considered
normal and adaptive behavior.  In contrast, when one is in the anxious state
when there is no clear threat, the heightened emotional and physiological
reactions continue to occur for an extended period of time.  Since the body is
not prepared to sustain this heightened reaction, body systems begin
malfunctioning and wear down.  This is an abnormal non-adaptive behavior and
leads to pathology and/or a disease state that we are now calling collectively
the anxiety disorders.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Of historical note, these illnesses were called the classic
neuroses, specifically anxiety/phobic neurosis.  They were thought to arise from
the incomplete regression of a primary drive, e.g., libidinal.  A more current
concept is that these illnesses represent a very diverse group of illnesses
whose origins are unknown and that the final behavioral manifestation of them
are feelings of anxiety.  For example, obsessive-compulsive disorder has very
little to do with inappropriate anxiety.  Rather, it is a brain disorder where a
person has thoughts that recur repetitively and very destructively.  In
addition, these people often have rituals that they feel compelled to complete,
and if they do not complete the rituals they feel anxious.  So, is this disorder
the feeling of anxiety that you get when you don't complete the ritual or is it
the compulsion to do the ritual?  At this point most people believe it's the
compulsion to complete the ritual.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As we discovered with the mood disorders, there is a tremendous
amount of social stigma attached with having one of these disorders.  If you
were to tell someone that you had panic disorder, that is, you might suddenly
feel like you were having a heart attack and were going to die with no clear
reason, they would say, &quot;Well, it's in your head, and you should fix it.&quot;
 Well, if it was that easy you would have done it already.  And that's where the
role of the psychiatrist comes in.  There are multiple forms of treatment.  They
involve both medication and psychotherapy.  We shall talk in the next few
articles about the particular anxiety disorders, their treatments, and their
response rates to treatment which in general are very good.</STRONG></P>
