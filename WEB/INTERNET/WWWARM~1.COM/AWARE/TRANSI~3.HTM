<P><STRONG>In the previous column I wrote about normality and abnormality and
forwarded the notion that regardless of one's ideology there are people whose
behavior or mood is not normal. Who even cares what is normal and what is not?
From a physician's point of view, this distinction is very important as we have
treatments that can relieve the psychological torture associated with some
untreated mental illnesses.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Treatments for mental illness rarely cure a patient (neither do
most non-surgical treatments for non-infection based illnesses). Rather, they
reduce the symptoms to a tolerable level. This is of no small consequence. By
just reducing the symptom intensity, patients' and their families' lives can be
greatly enhanced. Indeed, one of the great advances in the treatment of the
medically ill (notice I use medically ill interchangeably with mentally ill)
after the  discovery of antibiotics has been the discovery of antidepressants.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>What makes depression an illness and treatable? Let's go back to
the normality discussion. Traumatic or disturbing events usually cause feelings
of sadness. These feelings can run the gamut from mild to extreme. For example,
extremely traumatic events can cause intense or overwhelming sadness (self
evident so far). For those without depression, the sad feelings are usually mild
and short lived. What happens when the sad feelings don't go away? I guess you
can try the old remedy of trying to pull yourself up by your boot straps. But
what if that fails? Well, now you're in the realm of clinical depression, which
can be broken down into major, minor and even a potentially new category,
sub-syndromal or very small depressions.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Bereavement is a natural place to begin in separating normal 
sadness from abnormal sadness (depression) . We all experience bereavement over
and over throughout our lives. I think that bereavement should be added to that
list of inescapable events, the others being, birth, death and taxes.
Bereavement is the state of grief that a person experiences with the death of a
loved one or with a major loss, e.g., relationship, job, etc. Depression is a
state where the predominant emotion one experiences is sadness and is often
accompanied by vegetative signs. How do both of these states where sadness is
found differ?</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>In depression there is often not a precipitating event or, if 
there is one, it is generally not of an extreme nature (this is especially true
in people with severe recurrent depression). In bereavement there is a death or
serious loss. Depression tends to foster unremitting thoughts of sadness, guilt,
and lack of a desire to live. The sadness of bereavement usually comes in waves
only when we think about our loss. Depression often produces a state in which
persons are unable to effectively perform their job or participate in their
family. Depressions tend to be long lasting, e.g., from months to years.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Bereavement on the other hand, does not interfere with one's life;
it may alter it but doesn't stop it. Finally bereavement is time limited. This
doesn't imply that thought about the loss will not sadden, but rather that we
are able to pick up our lives and move forward without impairment. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Just as you can be a little sad, you can also be a little
depressed. Big depressions have been recognized since recorded time. Recent
research is showing that people can have minor depressions that last for years.
One way to think about mood is that it lies along a spectrum. For depression the
spectrum can range from small to profound.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>A person with minor depression is sad more than half of the time,
with the sadness being accompanied by one or two vegetative signs. In major
depression one is depressed more days than not and the depression is also
accompanied by vegetative signs. Vegetative signs include poor sleep, low
energy, poor concentration, poor appetite, and being agitated or slowed down.
Other signs are loss of interest (this can range from loss of interest in sex,
to not enjoying usual hobbies), guilty ruminative thoughts and recurrent
thoughts that life is not worth living.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The form of depression a person has will determine what therapy is
offered. Just as in treating hypertension, where blood pressure can range from
normal to very high and the treatment offered is dependent on the level of
pressure, so is it with depression.</STRONG></P>
