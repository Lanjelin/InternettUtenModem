<H2>Manic Depression and the New Year</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3>by</H3></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H3> Dr. Peter Melgaard Thompson</H3></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>The new year is upon us and it seems a fitting metaphor for a
discussion of  Manic Depression, a.k.a. Bipolar illness. One can think of a New
Year's party.  Parties are fun until there is an excess of libation - then the
party can get out of control. With Manic Depression the hypomania or initial
stages of a mania are often periods of heightened energy and feeling. However as
the mania progresses, thoughts come faster and faster until they make no sense.
The grandiose plans become bizarre and thoughts can become psychotic -  that is
hearing and seeing things that other people cannot. If the energy stayed at a
controllable level, then there would be no need of treatment. In fact  most
people would refuse treatment, saying 'what is the problem?!' They would be
right; however in most cases the mania turns destructive. Patients with Bipolar
Illness can ruin both their life and their family's. This is usually done by
acting out  impulsive behaviors such as excessive spending, entering into new
relationships that they would not normally enter into, or acting out a variety
of agitated irrational behaviors. Manic Depression is usually a life long
illness with periods of mania, depression and normal behavior.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Most scientists studying Bipolar Illness agree that this is genetic
illness.  That is, it runs in families and is passed on though the genes. It has
an incidence of about 1%, or 1 out of 100 people in the general population. In
families with this genetic problem the incidence  is much higher. In identical
twins, if one twin has Bipolar Illness, then there is 70% chance that the other
identical twin will also have it.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>As in Major Depression there are very good treatments, in this case
not with antidepressants but with mood stabilizers. The oldest and most studied
is lithium. More recently, the anti-seizure medications have been shown to have
anti-manic properties. In most cases these medications eliminate manic behavior
within two weeks and greatly reduce the possibility of having another mania.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Lithium is a salt, and is usually taken 2-3 times a day. It is
generally a safe medication with little long-term side effects. On the
short-term side there are many side effects. The most life threatening is
overdose or dehydration. This is because high blood levels can be toxic to the
heart. Patients on lithium should have their blood levels checked weekly to
every other week. The most common side effects are nausea, weight gain, acne,
and thirst.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The other group of medicines that are effective in treating mania
are the anti-seizure medications. The best studied of this group are
carbamazepine (Tegretol) and valproate acid (Depakene or Depakote). These
medications seem to work best in patients that cannot tolerate the side effects
of lithium or where lithium is ineffective. This group tends to be a subgroup of
bipolar patients - the rapid cyclers and dysphoric manics. A rapid cycler is a
bipolar patient who goes through four  complete cycles a year (manic, depressed
and normal mood). The patient with dysphoric mania is characterized by having
symptoms of both mania and depression at the same time. As with lithium, weekly
or bimonthly monitoring of blood levels are required. The most common side
effects are nausea and weight gain.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>So what does all this technical information do for you or your
loved one who has Bipolar Illness. My intention is to make you aware that there
is hope, that this illness is treatable and that the untreated patient can and 
probably will do much better on treatment than without treatment. There is a
very active patient-run organization  <I>The Depressive and Manic Depressive
Association</I> that can provide more information;  check your local listings.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Best Wishes in the New Year.</STRONG></P>
