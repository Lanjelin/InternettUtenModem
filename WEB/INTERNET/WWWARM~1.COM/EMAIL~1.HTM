<P><STRONG>We've started a free mailing to let you know of late breaking news
and features on our site and new products we've decided to carry. We call it
<I>The Armchair Brief</I>.  To get it you've got to request it.  It's short,
sweet and informative.  It will come to you on a very infrequent basis so you
won't be inundated with lots of stuff to read. And BTW, it's called <I>The
Armchair Brief</I> because it's brief not because a lawyer writes it. <I>The
Armchair Brief</I> is another way for us to make our site more dynamic and
responsive to your needs.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>We won't sell, rent or exchange our email address list. We don't
ask you to fill out a questionnaire; we only ask you for your email address; you
can optionally tell us of any topics you'd like to see on our site or tell us of
special products you'd like to see us carry. In the unlikely event that you
don't find <I>The Armchair Brief</I>  informative, simply email us and we'll<I>
instantly</I> remove your name from our list. That's all there is to it!
