<P><STRONG>What are <I>Travel Specials!</I>? They can be a grand weekend
escape, a hotel, a tour, a discounted airfare,  a cruise, a sporting event
package... . All of the specials we choose have something that sets them apart
from the ordinary. Note that we are not necessarily equating 'special' with
'inexpensive'. Check back to this page; we add specials as they are announced.</STRONG></P>
