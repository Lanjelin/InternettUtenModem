<H1>The Wyndham Hotel at LAX</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<P><STRONG>The Wyndham Hotel has 591 guest rooms, numerous meeting/conference
rooms, an Olympic-size outdoor pool in a garden setting, workout facilities,
business center, guest center, coffee shop with expresso bar, cocktail lounge
and the Wyndsor Restaurant with Executive Chef David Wohrle.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>The Wyndham initiated  extensive renovations when they began
managing the hotel in May, 1995.  While not causing any disruption of service,
these renovations  will be completed in 1997. The hotel was formerly the Airport
Hyatt Hotel.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>All rooms and suites have the option of two views: an expansive 
view of the city and surrounding foothills or a view of the  airport.  Of all
hotels in the vicinity The Wyndham is the closest to the entry to LAX.  So if
you enjoy watching planes take off and land (which we do!) we recommend that you
request an airport view. Some of the airport view rooms have an oblique view of
the ocean -  a nice extra.  All the rooms are sound insulated and double
glass-paned.  The view of the city and foothills is also quite nice. If you are
lucky enough to stay at the Wyndham just  after a rain, you will realize why the
millions of people who live in Los Angeles have moved here.</STRONG></P>
<CENTER>
<H4><STRONG>Armchair World Recommendations</STRONG></H4></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>We recommend either the deluxe rooms or junior suite - depending on
your needs. We find these rooms to be an extremely good value for Los Angeles.
In making our recommendation we have taken into consideration hotel location,
size, look and feel and amenities. The deluxe rooms are newly renovated. While
not yet renovated,  the Junior Suites are comfortable and still in fairly good
condition.</STRONG></P>
<CENTER>

<H4>How to make Reservations:</H4></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>When you make your reservations, you must  mention Armchair World
to get our special rates.  At check in, the Wyndham at LAX will try and upgrade
your room to a higher category depending on availability. For instance if you
booked a deluxe room on floors 6 - 10, the management of the hotel will try to
upgrade your room - free of charge - to a deluxe room on the executive floors 11
or 12.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Occasionally there may be a short-lived or special  promotion where
the rates may even be lower than Armchair's rates when you book.  If so, and if
you still mention Armchair World they will both honor the special promotion and
try to upgrade your accommodations. Because of our specially-negotiated rates, 
other promotions giving lower rates should be a rarity. However, if you find a
rate discrepancy, please contact us immediately.</STRONG></P>
