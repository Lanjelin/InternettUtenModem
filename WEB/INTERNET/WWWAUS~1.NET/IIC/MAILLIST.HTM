	Mailinglists, like the <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/USENET.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/usenet.htm">Usenet Newsgroups</A>, 
	are for discussion. The only difference is, that you don't have to check the discussion to keep up to date. Mailinglists are totally e-mail based, 
	which means, that you send an article to the mailinglist and it automatically will be distributed to all other subscribed members. Also you will get all 
	articles of other members delivered to your mailbox.

	If you have your e-mail configured correctly, then there is nothing more to do. The requirements are the same as they are for E-Mail. See 
	<A HREF="MAIL.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/mail.htm">Electronic Mail</A> for details. The only thing that you have to know is the address of a mailinglist server. See the next chapter for details on
	this.

	Unlike other Internet services, where you connect to a server, transfer data and then disconnect again, a mailinglist uses e-mail addresses for discussion. 
	There are special e-mail addresses, where a special software is installed, which automatically handles all the commands and mails sent to a list. The most 
	popular software packages are <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/LISTSERV.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/listserv.htm">listserv</A> and 
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/MAJORD~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/majordomo.htm">majordomo</A>. This software is a kind of command processor, which handles 
	commands and automatically distributes all incoming mail. As you already know, an e-mail address is made up of a username and a host name. 
	When referring to a mailinglist, the username for the command processor usually is <I>listserv</I> or <I>majordomo</I>. 
	I have addresses of some servers hosting mailinglist available:

	<P>
	Originally we had a list of available lists at listserv@peach.ease.lsoft.com. But the number of lists known for that address has grown to more than 10.000, which would
	result in a file with a size of more than 1 MB. So they have set up an online List database, which you can use. This called the
	<A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs10.htm#1036" tppabs="http://www.lsoft.com/lists/listref.html">CataList</A>. Please use this service to see what lists are available.

	Mailinglists are controlled via e-mail. You first have to subbed to a mailinglist before you can receive mail from it. Generally, a command to a 
	mailinglist server has no subject line and a single line (the command) in its body. Be sure, that there is no signature or similar in such a mail, as it will 
	unnecessarily waste resources and only produce error messages.
	<P>
	<FONT COLOR="#FF5500"><FONT SIZE=3>A</FONT>VAILABLE <FONT SIZE=3>L</FONT>ISTS </FONT><BR>		
	The first thing, before you can take part in a discussion is to  get a list of available mailinglists. The following examples will refer to the 
	<I>listserv at peach.ease.lsoft.com</I>. Start your mail client and enter <I>listserv@peach.ease.lsoft.com</I> as the receiver of the mail. 
	Leave the subject line totally blank and type the command
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	lists global &lt;keyword&gt;
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	as the only text in the body of you mail. Please remove any <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;">
	<A HREF="GLOSSARY/SIGNAT~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/signature.htm">signature</A>, as it will only produce error messages. <I>&lt;Keyword&gt;</I> can be replaced by a 
	word of your choice, that will act like a filter. If you use keyword, then only the name of mailinglists containing the keyword will be returned. 
	Note that a complete list may have several hundred kilobytes. Now send your mail. 
	The response may not come at once. It might last as long as a day or two, until your command is processed. When you receive a response, 
	you will find two mails in your mailbox. One mail telling you, that your command has been processed and a list of used resources and the second 
	mail being the list you requested. You now can browse through the list to find a mailinglist you are interested in.

	<FONT COLOR="#FF5500"><FONT SIZE=3>S</FONT>UBSCRIBING <FONT SIZE=3>T</FONT>O <FONT SIZE=3>A</FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>L</FONT>IST</FONT><BR>
	The next thing to do is, to subscribe to a mailinglist. Therefore note two things in the list of mailinglists returned as the result from the example above: 
	<DL>
	<DT><IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> The name of the list (left column)
	<DT><IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> The mail address of the list
	</DL>
	<P>
	Then send mail to <I>listserv@peach.ease.lsoft.com</I> with no subject line and 
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	subscribe &lt;listname&gt; &lt;Your Name&gt;
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	as the only text in the body of your message. <I>&lt;listname&gt;</I> has to be replaced with the name of the list you want to subscribe to. 
	<I>&lt;Your Name&gt;</I> obviously has to be replaced with your real name. Then again, patience is required as listserv processes your request.
	Depending on the mailinglist, you will receive either a <I>command confirmation request</I> which you have to reply to in order to finally confirm 
	your subscription or a message indicating that you know are subscribed to the desired mailinglist. Most times, you will also receive a mail containing 
	some guidelines for discussion, like an outline about the discussion, and/or a list of commands the mail server understands. I suggest that you 
	keep this mail for later reference.

	Now you want to participate in the discussion. To send your own articles to the list, you have to use the list's mailinglist address.

	<P>
	So if you have subscribed to a list which is for MS Access development <I>(Access-L)</I>, which is hosted by 
	<I>peach.ease.lsoft.com</I>, then you have to send mail to
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	Access-L@peach.ease.lsoft.com
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	Note that a mailinglist needn't to be hosted by peach.ease.lsoft.com. They also can be hosted by any other server. In general it can be said, 
	that you need to remember two mail addresses in conjunction with a mailinglist. You have to know the mail address of the command processor 
	to send your commands to (normally begin with listserv or majordomo) and the mail address of the mailinglist (usually equal to the name of the list). When you send a
	message to the mailinglist it is automatically distributed to all other subscribers of the list.
	<P>
	<FONT COLOR="#FF5500"><FONT SIZE=3>R</FONT>ECEIVE <FONT SIZE=3>A</FONT> <FONT SIZE=3>D</FONT>IGEST</FONT><BR>
	If you don't want to receive all posted articles mail by mail, you can advise listserv to combine multiple mails into one large mail. This single large 
	mail is called a <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/DIGEST.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/digest.htm">digest</A>. To receive a digest, 
	end mail to the command processor <I>listserv@peach.ease.lsoft.com</I>, with no subject line and the following command as the only text 
	in the body of your message:
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	set &lt;listname&gt; digest
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	From now on you will receive all mails posted to the list in a digest form. Depending on the volume of the list, you will be receiving one or more 
	digests per day. The disadvantage from a digest form is, that you have to find the e-mail address of a person who posted an article, if you want 
	to reply directly to him. Furthermore, replying to a digest is not a good idea, you will have to remove any other mail in your reply. Also be sure to 
	edit the subject line, otherwise it will read something like <I>Re: Access-l digest #123</I>. So its a better idea to copy the mail you want to reply 
	to into a new mail (don't forget to <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/QUOTING.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/quoting.htm">quote</A> it and send it to the list).

	By default you will also receive your postings to the list. If you don't want this, then you can send the following command to the command processor:
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	set &lt;listname&gt; [Repro|NoRepro]
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	<I>&lt;listname&gt;</I> is the name of the mailinglist to set this option. Then use either the keyword <I>repro</I> to receive your own postings 
	or <I>norepro</I> to avoid getting back your own postings.

	I you are not interested in the mailinglist anymore, then you have to unsubscribe. An often made mistake is, that unsubscribe commands are sent to 
	the list, which is totally useless. An unsubscribe command must be sent to the command processor, which is, in our case, 
	<I>listserv@peach.ease.lsoft.com</I>. To unsubscribe send a mail to the mentioned address using a blank subject line and
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	unsubscribe &lt;listname&gt;

	<P>
