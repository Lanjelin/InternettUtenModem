	Leaving much mail over a long time on your mail server costs 
	unnecessary money. Don't think, that you are the only one, that can read mail addressed to you. There <I>are</I> other people who can. 
	So don't send mail, where contents could offend you when seen in the evening news.

	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/EMAIL.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/email.htm">E-Mails</A> are as permanent as paper. 
	Since an e-mail is written more quickly than a mail on a paper, you might be less formal than on a written mail. Keep in mind that your 
	mail might not only be read by the person to whom you sent it, but by other people. These people might know you only by what you tell 
	or how you tell it in your e-mails. You'll never know if someday you will have to deal with these people face to face. When writing mails, 
	take you time to ensure no mail embarrasses you later. Minimize spelling errors and make sure you mail is easy to read and to understand.
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Summarize what you're responding to</B></FONT><BR>
	Today's mail clients offer a technique called quoting. This means, that the original message (especially the parts you are responding to) is 
	included in your answer. These passages are usually marked using the character &quot;&gt;&quot;. This is done by the mail client automatically. 
	There is no need to add this character by hand. Don't quote the whole original mail message. Only the main parts you are responding to or 
	discussing. When requesting information from an information source you might get several different responses. You might want to post these 
	responses in order that others can benefit from it. When summarizing these responses, strip unnecessary mail headers, eliminate duplicate 
	information and credit the information to the person who sent it to you, where possible. If you don't credit or pretend that the posted information 
	is from you, you might easily get <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/FLAME.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/flame.htm">flamed</A>.

	The chance that your mails are read by busy people is much higher.

	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Format your messages clearly</B></FONT>.<BR>
	Don't write an endless queue and don't repeat yourself. Insert blank lines. Blank lines can improve the formatting and therefore
	the readability of you mail and empty lines only add one byte to the mail. 
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Use a descriptional subject line</B></FONT>.<BR>
	Keep the subject line short and if possible it should summarize the contents of the mail in 2-5 words. If you don't use a subject line, then it 
	might happen that your mail is considered unimportant and trashed without being read.
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Humor might be misinterpreted</B></FONT>.<BR>
	Because the receiver doesn't see, hear or even know you. People have different kinds of humor. Therefore expressions have been developed, 
	to indicate emotions such as humor or sadness. These expressions are called 
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/EMOTIC~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/emoticons.htm">emoticons</A>. 
	So use them to indicate humor in your mails.

	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Don't Shout</B></FONT>.<BR>
	Be careful with capital letters in mails. Sentences or words in capital letters are considered as shouting with a touch of anger. 
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Be careful with personal data</B></FONT>.<BR>
	You should never post personal data from any person or company without their permission. Also be careful with statements about other 
	persons. Such mails may circulate and you'll never know where they might end up. 
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Different machines</B></FONT>.<BR>
	Always keep in mind, that people might use a different machine or mail reader than you do. So, limit you lines to 80 characters, 72 when possible. 
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"> <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>Sending large files</B></FONT>.<BR>
	Many mail readers offer the opportunity to attach files to the mail. Don't do so, unless you have been asked to send a file. People might get 
	annoyed by large files (it raises their phone costs !!!) and flame you or trash them unread. So be sure to ask, if an attachment is desired 
	and in which format to send it !! 
	Note for <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/EXCHANGE.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/exchange.htm">Microsoft Exchange</A> users: 
	Exchange allows to send formatted e-mails (multiple fonts, colors, attachments, ...). To transmit this formatting data, the data is encoded 
	and sent as an attachment. People not using Exchange, can't use this 
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/ATTACH~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/attachment.htm">attachments</A>. It only floods their harddisk. So when mailing to a 
	person for the first time, be sure that the receiver also uses Exchange. If you're unsure turn off Exchange RTF formatting for the mail !

	When joining a discussion (e.g. <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/NEWSGR~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/newsgroup.htm">newsgroup</A>) 
	listen to the current discussion topics first. Don't start by posting mails. There might exist a <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/FAQ.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/faq.htm">FAQ</A> 
	for this group, so ask where you can find it, get it and you might find answers to your question.

	Don't post information of local interest to the world or people who might not be interested. Try to find a newsgroup, which is only read by local 
	persons. Also don't flood  <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/MAILIN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/mailinglist.htm">mailinglist</A> or 
	individual persons with unwanted (advertising) mail. This might result to the opposite - your product might be ignored. Also don't post something 
	like <I>Today is my birthday</I> to inappropriate newsgroups. You are wasting other peoples money !
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> <B>Respect Copyrights</B></FONT>.<BR>
	Be aware that you might post copyrighted material. It's perfectly all right to post short excerpts for critical discussion, but posting a whole article is 
	illegal. Also keep in mind, that each information posted is public domain, unless it is posted with an appropriate copyright notice. 
	<P>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/SQUARE.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/square.gif" ALT="*"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> <B>Responsibility</B></FONT>.<BR>
	You are responsible for the contents of your mail so don't go posting information on how to build and atomic bomb or whatsoever. 
	It's illegal. It's also dangerous to ask for such information.
	<P>

	usually the full name, address, phone and e-mail address of the sender of this mail. Keep them short! Don't use more than 3-5 lines for a signature.
