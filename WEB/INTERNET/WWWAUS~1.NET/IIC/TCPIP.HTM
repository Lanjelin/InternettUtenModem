	This is the protocol used to transfer data in the Internet. TCP is the abbreviation of <I><B>T</B>ransmission <B>C</B>ontrol <B>P</B>rotocol</I>.
	TCP is intended to be a reliable connection service between two computers. TCP manages data transfer between two computers in the following way: 
	<P>
	The stream of data being sent is packed into small packages (or segments), called a <I>datagramm</I>, for transmission. 
	Then TCP puts a header in each datagram. This header contains vital information like sequence number and a checksum. 
	The sequence number is used to reassemble the datagrams on the other end in correct order, as it can happen, that, let's say 
	datagram #20 arrives before datagram #19. The checksum is used to ensure correct receipt of the datagram. The checksum is a number, 
	created by summing up all the

	in a datagram.
	 <P>The sender and receiver are always sending receipts acknowledgements to ensure datagramms were received and processed correctly. 
	If the sender does not receive an acknowledgement within a certain time, then it sends the according datagramm again.
	<P>
	IP is the abbreviation of <I><B>I</B>nternet <B>P</B>rotocol</I>. Its basic functions are addressing and fragmentation. 
	TCP passes all the datagrams along with their

	 along to IP, which sends the datagram on its way. IP also adds a header with a checksum 
	and all that kind of stuff to ensure correct transmission. IP uses the addresses carried in the Internet header to transmit Internet datagrams 
	toward their destinations. The selection of a path for transmission is called <I>routing</I>. It also splits up (fragments) datagramms for 
	transmission through small package networks.
