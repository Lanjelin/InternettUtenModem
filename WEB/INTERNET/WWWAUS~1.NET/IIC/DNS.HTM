			As you have learned in the <A HREF="ADRESS~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/adressing.htm">internet addressing</A> section, unique computer names are mapped
			to unique 
			<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/IP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/ip.htm">IP-Addresses.</A>
			The most simple reason fort this was (and still is), that names are much easier to remember than
			a set of four numbers. In order for this to work, there has to be a simple database, where the information, which name
			is assigned to which number is stored. In the early years of the internet each system connected to the Internet had such
			a small file, giving the name and the assigned IP address.
			<P>
			Due to the large number of computers connected to the internet, this has become very unhandy. At this time, special computers
			have been connected to the Internet with the only purpose of carrying such a database and acting as a <I>name 
			<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/SERVER.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/server.htm">server</A></I>. 
			Please note that this isn't a single computer, rather than a set of computers, all connected together.
			<P>
			The name information is stored in a tree. Let's say you want to access a computer called <I>www.uni-linz.ac.at</I>. In order to find
			the corresponding IP address you would have to ask a name server, carrying IP addresses all the <I>AT</I> computers. First you
			might get the names and addresses of several servers for AT. Most of the time there is more than one server. One serves
			as a backup server, if the primary fails. Now you would ask the AT name server where the servers for AC is. Also there might
			be more than one addresses returned for the above reasons. Then you would ask the server for AC where UNI-LINZ is.
			And finally you would ask the server for UNI-LINZ about WWW. The result is an IP address used to make the desired connection.
			All the querying is done automatically and there is no interference required by the user. The only thing you have to do is,
			specify a name server for your internet connection. This setting often can be made in the TCP/IP profile. If this is not done and you
			want to access a computer by <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/DOMAIN.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/domain.htm">domain</A> name, then you will get an error message like <I>address not found</I>.
			<P>
			Each of the above levels (at, ac, ...) is called a domain. Of course the above description is a very simplified way, but I think it outlines
			how this system works. There are sophisticated mechanisms for remembering where a certain domain can be found and more. Such
			a query is processed in a matter of milliseconds (sometimes it might take a few seconds though).
			<P>
			A computer name is not just a few words separated by some points. Each single domain has a special meaning. Usually a
			name contains information about the service, the company name, the type of institution and the country. Let's have a look at the
			following address:
			<P ALIGN=CENTER>
			</FONT><SAMP>
			www.uni-linz.ac.at
			</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
			<P>
			The first domain <I>www</I> is short for <I><B>W</B>orld <B>W</B>ide <B>W</B>eb</I>. The second domain normally
			is the name of the company or institution running the computer. <I>Uni-Linz</I> is short for <I>University Linz</I>. The third
			domain specifies the type of organization. <I>AC</I> is short for <I><B>ac</B>ademic</I>. Other possible domains are
			<I>co</I>, which is short for <I><B>co</B>mercial</I>; <I>or</I>, which is short for <I><B>or</B>ganization (usually non-profit)</I>.
			The fourth domain defines the country the computer is located in. In this case <I>at</I> stands for <I><B>A</B>us<B>t</B>ria</B>.
			The above example is normally used for computers outside the U.S.A. Computers located in the U.S.A usually have only three
			domains, where the last domain specifies the type of organization. See <A HREF="DOMAINS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/domains.htm">domain list</A> for more
			details and examples.
