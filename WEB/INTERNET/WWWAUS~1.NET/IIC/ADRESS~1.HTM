	Unlike commercial computer networks, where the information is accessible from special

	having several menus, you have to <I>know</I>
	where the desired information is located when using the Internet. Each computer which is connected to the internet - no matter
	if permanent or temporarily - is assigned a unique address. This unique address is called an 
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/IP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/ip.htm"><I>IP-Address</I></A> 
	Such an IP address is made up of four numbers, ranging from 0 to 255 (8 bytes), separated by a point.  So the entire IP address consists of
	32 bytes (8 x 4 bytes).	An example of such an IP address would be:

	<P>
	To simplify administration of addresses, <I>netclasses</I> have been introduced. There
	currently are five classes (A thru E) defined. The Addresses from 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 are using the first number for the network number. The other
	three numbers are available for the host number. Such a network is defined as a class A network. Normally class A networks are used for general
	purposes like the <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/ARPANET.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/arpanet.htm">ARPAnet</A>
	itself. Large organizations normally are assigned a class B network. A class B network uses the
	first two numbers for the network number. Valid network numbers are 128.0.0.0 thru 191.255.255.255. Addresses beginning with
	127 are reserved for special use. A class B network can serve up to 65536 computers. The smallest, a class C network, uses
	the first three numbers for the network number, ranging from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255. A class C network can serve up to 255
	computers (hosts). Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use as a class E network, but are currently not defined. To illustrate this, have a look at the
	following graphic:
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/ILLUSTR/NETCLASS.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/illustr/netclass.gif" ALT="Netclasses">
	<P ALIGN=LEFT>
	The first bits are used for determination of the netclass. A class A network is determined by a zero in the first bit. A class B network by a one and a zero
	and a class C network by a one, one and zero.
	<P>
	The following table gives an overview of currently defined netclasses. Have a look at the image below, which shows how the addresses
	are organized.

	If haven't made any calculation mistakes, this results in a total of 857 3157 376 addressable computers on the internet. Don't be mislead 
	by this number. If the number of Internet users keeps growing in the current way, then in a few years there won't be sufficient
	addresses left.
	<P>
	If a company now requests a new IP address, then the company is not assigned a single IP number, but instead they are assigned a
	netclass due to their requirements. This assignment is handled by Network Information Centers. Normally each country has such a
	NIC, which is usually hosted by a university or a large ISP.
	<P>
	To make life easier for the Internet user - such an IP address is hard to remember - computers have been assigned a unique
	name. An example for such a name would be
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	www.yahoo.com
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	Each of such a unique address is mapped to an (also unique) IP address. The corresponding IP address for the above name would
	be
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	205.216.146.70
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	This mapping mechanism is called the <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/DNS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/dns.htm">domain name system.</A>
	How this mapping is done can be found in the <A HREF="DNS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/dns.htm">DNS</A> section.

	Due to the rapid growth of the Internet, there won't be sufficient IP addresses to address all computers in a few years time. To prevent this,
	the <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/IETF.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/ietf.htm">IETF</A> and other organizations and companies are
	working on a new standard for <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/TCPIP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/tcpip.htm">tcp/ip</A>. Apart from
	the technical improvements made, there will also be a new way to address computers on the Internet. The new address format will possibly look
	something like
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>

	<P>
	Instead of 4 numbers between 0 and 255 there will be eight <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="Pending_relink" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/hex.htm">hexadecimal </A>
	numbers, separated by a &quot;:&quot;. The result is, that there are 2<SUP>128</SUP> possible Internet addresses. That are around 
	300000000000000000000000000000000000 (should be 38 zeros) possible addresses. I do not know how to pronounce this number, but there are quite
	a few number of possible addresses. Some people have calculated, that using the new scheme, there can be around 1500 addresses per square meter
	(m<SUP>2</SUP>) on earth. There also has been put a lot of effort to stay compatible with the current addressing scheme. So an old style address would 
	look like
	<P ALIGN=CENTER>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	::134.245.74.43
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	But, there is no need to panic. Until the new scheme will be officially introduced, there are still some years to go (about 10). The new protocol will be
	called <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/IPV6.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/ipv6.htm">IPv6</A> or
