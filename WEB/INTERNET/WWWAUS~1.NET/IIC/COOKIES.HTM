	Cookies are a mechanism for client-server communication, mostly encountered with web-sites. A cookie allows a 
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/SERVER.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/server.htm">server</A>
	to store information on the client computer. Such a cookie can contain virtually every kind of information. If you visit a site again, 
	which already has set a cookie, then the server loads the cookie from your client. 
	George Orwell knew it ... but don't panic. This article illustrates, what a cookie is, how it works and how you can <I>prevent</I> a server from storing a cookie.

	If a user connects to a page (to illustrate the example, let's say a sex page) for the first time, then the server sets a cookie, which contains the
	information mentioned above. Now this sex page offers different services, like chat, etc. Each of the pages, sets a cookie. If the user connects
	to a site again, then the server checks to see, if there is already a cookie set. If a cookie is set, then it retrieves the cookie. Along with the
	information in the cookie, which can contain further information, like the users name, e-mail address and else, the web administrator can
	generate a user profile, which exactly shows your preferences. Currently this information is mostly used to place advertisements according to
	peoples preferences. There are already some companies, who have specialized in this market.
	<P>
	If you are using <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/NAVIGA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/navigator.htm">Netscape Navigator</A> 3.0, then you 
	are lucky, because this <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="*"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/WEBBRO~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/webbrowser.htm">browser</A>
	allows you to be warned if a cookie is going to be set
	and further gives you the option to prevent the cookie from being set. To enable this feature in Netscape Navigator 3, locate the <I>Options</I>
	menu and choose <I>Network Preferences</I>. In the appearing dialog select the <I>Protocols</I> tab and verify that the option <I>Show
	an alert before accepting a cookie</I> is checked (First option in the dialog). <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/IE.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/ie.htm"">Microsoft
	Internet Explorer 3.0</A> now also offers this feature. To enable it, locate the <I>View</I> menu and choose <I>Options</I>. Select
	the <I>Security</I> tab and verify that the option <I>Warn me before accepting cookies</I> is enabled. This option is located in the top third
	option group as the last option. For all other browsers, try to search your harddisk for files
	or directories named <I>cookie</I> (Extensions can vary) and delete them. Because then a server finds, that there is no cookie set and sets 
	a new one but can't retrieve any information. <P>

		Be careful when deleting files and especially

	Apart from the above negative usage of cookies, there also is an interesting new way, that cookies can be used. Have you already
	visited the <A HREF="../../TPPMSGS/MSGS10.HTM#1082" tppabs="http://www.msn.com/">Microsoft Network</A> or <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#21" tppabs="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape's Site</A> ?
	Both sites offer a customized start page you can create yourself. Just a few clicks and declaring your special interests and you have
	a customized start page. But how do those web servers know when you connect ? How do they know which start page to display ?
	The answer is easy. They can use cookies. Your user defined settings you specify are stored in such a cookie. When you reconnect
	to such a server, the cookie is read and your settings are restored. 
	<P>
	Cookies might also be used in the near future to exchange settings between more web pages. Microsoft's new Web scripting language,
	Visual Basic Script, makes use of this feature. If the user enters some settings on one page, then these settings are stored in a cookie
	and will be read when you browse to another page.
