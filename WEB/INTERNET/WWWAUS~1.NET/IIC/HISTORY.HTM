	During the time of the cold war in 1960, the demand for a computer network arose, which would be invulnerable to enemy attacks. In
	this time networks were client/server based, which means, that if the server fails, the entire network would go down. So a network
	architecture was needed, which still would be operational if one computer in this network fails. So the Department of Defense (DoD)
	initialized a project, which was realized and administered by the <I>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</I>, aimed at creating such a 
	network. This network was given the name <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;">
	<A HREF="GLOSSARY/ARPANET.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/arpanet.htm">ARPAnet</A>.
	<P>
	By the year of 1969 the first Interface Message Processor (today's <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;">
	<A HREF="GLOSSARY/ROUTER.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/router.htm">routers</A>) was installed
	in L.A at the University of California. By the end of the year, 4 sites were connected to the ARPAnet. In 1972 an International Conference on 
	Computer Communications was help, where the ARPAnet was demonstrated. At this time, approximately 40 machines were connected
	<P>
	In 1979 computer scientists from all over the world met to establish a Computer Science Department research computer network. 
	At this time the <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/USENET.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/usenet.htm" >Usenet</A> was introduced. Approximately
	at the same time the UUCPNET (<B>U</B>nix to <B>U</B>nix <B>C</B>o<B>p</B>y NET) was connected with the ARPAnet and the NSFnet.
	Also the BITNET (<B>B</B>ecause <B>i</B>t's <B>t</B>ime network), which was used mainly for inter-academic
	communication was connected with all the other networks. Like this, many countries had their own special networks. All these
	networks were connected together using one common <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/PROTOCOL.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/protocol.htm" >protocol</A>
	for communication, to form what we know as the Internet. This protocol was introduced in  1982 and is known as the 
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/TCPIP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/tcpip.htm" >TCP/IP</A> protocol.
	Its development reaches back to 1974. This protocol has the ability to decide, which way the data should be transmitted. So a failed computer 
	doesn't affect the whole network. 
	<P>
	Because of the success of the TCP/IP it was used in other networks as well. In 1987 the National Science Foundation created a TCP/IP network
	with the intention to connect supercomputing centers between Universities. This network became known as the NSFNnet. 
	When this network was opened to the public and to allies of the United States, 
	NSFNnet and local networks were combined to form what we today as the
	Internet. With the end of the cold war there was no need for such a defense network and the growth of the Internet began. Since
	this time the growth of the Internet is estimated to be about 10% per month.  
	<P>
	Since 1993 the Internet became more and more popular. More and more machines were connected to it and provided more and more
	information. Since the development of the <IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/WEB.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/web.htm" >World Wide Web</A>, 
	the Internet was noticed by commercial companies who wanted to present themselves and their products to the Internet public.  
	<P>
	Nowadays every big and lots of middle-sized and small companies offer their services via the Internet, exactly via the World  Wide
	Web. The ability to present text and graphics made the World Wide Web the most popular service in the Internet. 
	<P>
	Since a permanent connection to the Internet is very expensive, clever businessmen came up with the idea, of selling access to
	the Internet. These companies are known as Internet service providers (<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/ISP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/isp.htm" >ISP</A>). 
	They offer temporarily Internet access via the phone line and offer companies and private people to present themselves to the 
	continually growing Internet society on the World Wide Web by offering server hard disk space for rent. Also ISPs are investing for their little part
	of the internet. The Internet itself is not owned by a specific person or organization. Each ISP or person connected to it pays for the continous
	development and expansion. I Austria a main part of the Internet has been installed and is maintained by <A HREF="../../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#94" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/">EUnet</A>
	and the ACONET, which is the austrian academic network.
