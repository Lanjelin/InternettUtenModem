	The quick tips should provide valuable and useful information around the interent, that are too short for a separate article. The tips are provided in a kind
	of Q & A manner:
	<P>
	<FONT FACE="Arial"><B>Q: How should I react when receiving unwanted advertisement mail ?</B></FONT><BR>
	A: Unfortunately some companies think, that the Internet is their free marketplace. If you receive unwanted advertising e-mail, then this is
	illegal, if you really have not expressed your wish to receive such mails. If you get such advertisement mail, you should politely tell the sender, that
	you do not want this mail and to remove your address from every mailinglist or address database they are running. If you get advertisement mail again, then
	tell the sender, that you will notify the postmaster of their ISP about this. The e-mail address of the postmaster usually is <I>postmaster@somedomain.com</I>
	or <I>postoffice@somedomain.com</I>. In most cases, the ISP then will warn the sender about sending adveritisement mails and will shut down the
	account if any other complaints are being received. However, if this still does not help, send the following statement to the sender of the advertising mail:
	<P><I>
	By US Code Title 47, Sec. 227(a)(2)(B), a computer/modem/printer meets the definition of a telephone fax machine. By Sec. 227(b)(1)(C), it is unlawful
	to send any unsolicited advertisement to such equipment. By Sec.227(b)(3)(C), a violation of the aforementioned section is punishable by action to
	recover actual monetary loss, or $500, whichever is greater, for each violation.
	</I><P>
	In addition you can send a mail to the US Postoffice, using the following address <A HREF="mailto:abuse@postoffice.us">abuse@postoffice.us</A>. Of course
	this only applies if the sender is located in the US. For all other countries please consult an attorney.
