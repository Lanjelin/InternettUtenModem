	Well, I assume that everybody knows what a mail is (You know, that little paper you put in an envelope, affix a stamp and throw it into a mail box). 
	Internet also offers a mail service. Because this mail is sent electronically, it is called e-mail. E-Mail can be used nearly everywhere around the 
	Internet. The most simple way is sending a mail to another person. you also can use e-mail in conjunction with

	As mentioned above, if you are using mail from a Unix terminal, then you probably don't have to know any servers, etc.

	The SMTP server for sending mail often is accessibly freely, which means, that you don't have to have a

	from the POP mail server (where all mail for you is stored) you have to know a username and a password (You don't want your mail read by 
	someone else, do you ?). So this username and password also have to be told your mail client. Good mail clients somehow encrypt usernames 
	and your password, so they are not readable to unauthorized persons. Furthermore you have to tell the client your e-mail address and, depending 
	on the client you're using, your real name, company, etc. . Be sure to specify your e-mail address correctly, because otherwise responses won't 
	reach you!

	An e-mail address is made up of the following structure:
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	name@domain
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	where <I>name</I> is the name of the user you want to send mail to and <I>domain</I> is the address of the mail server, this person has an

	e-mail address on the same server. You can tell by looking at the domain. Name usually is an abbreviation or a short of the persons real name. 
	So if your name would be <I>Fred Flintstone</I>, your e-mail address could look something like
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	FredFlintstone@Stone-Valley.com or<BR>

	It is also possible to send mail to a commercial online service, like Compuserve or AOL. <A HREF="#MailGateway">See below</A> for details.

	Normally, a person you are sending an e-mail to is not always online. This means, that the mail has to be stored somewhere. This is done by the 
	POP server. On this server, there is some harddisk space reserved for your mail. The amount of space may vary between 512KB and 3 MB. 
	Normally it is around 1 MB. Depending on the amount of mail you are receiving per day, log into your POP server and get all your mails. The 
	procedure of connecting to your server and downloading your mail is an automated service, done by your mail client. You only have to tell your 
	client to <I>check for new mail</I>. Depending on the client you will see a status message during this process, saying how much mail there is 
	on your server and how many already has been downloaded.
	<P>
	When sending a mail, there normally is no delay. It is uploaded to the SMTP server, which sends it right away. With some mail clients you have 
	to tell the client explicitly to send the mail. 
	<P>
	Mail clients are designed to work offline; at least most of them do. This means, that you are downloading your mails, then disconnect. Then you 
	will read your mail and reply to some. After typing your replys, they are stored in a queue on your harddisk. Now you log on to the internet again 
	and tell your mail client to send the mails. Now they are sent on their way. 
	<P>
	As mentioned before, there is a fixed amount of harddisk space reserved for our mails. If you are receiving lots of mail, then you should check 
	your mail daily or twice a day download <I>and</I> remove your mail from the server. Note that most mail clients have an option wether to 
	remove the mail after it has been downloaded or leave it on the server. If you don't do so, your account will sooner or later run out of space and 
	every incoming mail is getting bounced back and you won't receive any new mail.
	<P>
	<FONT COLOR="#FF5500"><FONT SIZE=3>S</FONT>ENDING <FONT SIZE=3>A</FONT>ND <FONT SIZE=3>R</FONT>ECEIVING </FONT><BR>
	This section shows an example of how to send and receive mail. It assumes that you are having a POP Mail account running.
	<P>
	Lets say you want to send mail to Buggs Bunny (you know that little rabbit from Town Town). The first thing you have to do is, to tell you mail client 
	that you want to send new mail. This command is normally located somewhere in a <I>Message</I> menu or you will find it on a toolbar. Select the 
	appropriate command. Now a window will pop up.
	<P>
	First you have to enter the e-mail address of the receiver. In our case we are using the imaginary e-mail address <I>BuggsBunny@acme.com</I>. 
	As you might already have noticed, there is also a line which allows you to enter a subject. Use a short descriptive subject. It should tell the receiver 
	the contents of your mail in 1 to 5 words. Mails without topics easily might get overlooked and trashed unread. Imagine you want to know something 
	about Buggs Bunnies latest movie, then a suitable topic could be
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	Your new movie
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	Using <I>new movie</I> or <I>movie</I> alone could be a bit to less as it doesn't say which new movie. A topic like
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	Can you tell me something about your latest Movie ?
	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	would be a bit too long. <BR>
	Next you can define a <I><B>c</B>arbon <B>c</B>opy</I> (short: CC). This is a list of additional receivers of your mail. But be careful using CC. 
	People getting a mail as a CC could think, that they aren't important to you. A CC is a good idea, if your boss wants you to mail him a copy of each 
	outgoing mail. Then you would enter your boss's e-mail address in the CC field.<BR>
	Now type your message. Be aware, that your receiver might not be using the same client as you are and that some features might not be available 
	to him. It's always a good idea not to use more than 70 columns of text. Otherwise your receiver might get the text truncated or something else, that 
	makes it unreadable.<BR>
	Now you might want to add a signature. A signature are a few extra lines, that might contain your real name, voice phone and/or fax number or 
	some &quot;wise&quot; words. Your signature should not exceed about four lines.<BR>
	Now tell your client to send the mail. If you have a permanent connection to the 'Net, then your mail might start its journey right away. If you are 
	using a dial-up connection, then your mail will be stored in a queue and send when you are connecting the next time. Note that this behaviour 
	usually has to be defined in your client's options. Some mail clients will send mail currently queued, when checking for new mail (like Eudora and 
	Microsoft Exchange).<BR>
	<P>
	When communicating with others via an electronic medium, you might to express your feelings or simply use abbreviations to shorten you writing. 
	You can find some of them in the <A HREF="ACRONYMS.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/acronyms.htm">acronyms and abbreviations</A> section.
	<P>
	Well, there is nothing special about it. If you are not connected permanently to the 'Net, then connect and tell your client to check for new mail. 
	If you are using a new mail client for the first time, it will ask you probably a username and a password. Depending on the client's settings, it will 
	store them for later reuse. Your client will connect, download the mail onto your hard drive and then disconnect from the mail server. Depending 
	on the settings, it will send any queued mail. After the downloading has finished, disconnect from the Internet (only if you have a dial-up connection 
	of course).<BR>
	Now read your mail and reply to it. This is done by selecting a <I>Reply</I> command in your client. When replying to a mail, then a new 
	window will open with the original message in. Now note the &quot;&gt;&quot; character before each line. This is called 
	<IMG SRC="IMAGES/MISC/R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif"><A HREF="GLOSSARY/QUOTING.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/quoting.htm">quoting</A>. This will help the sender of the mail to keep track on what you are replying to. 
	Here is a little example. Let's say you have received the following message:
	<P>
	</FONT><SAMP>
	Hi !<BR>
	I was just wondering if you could send me details on your<BR>

	</SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>
	<P>
	As you might have noticed, the unnecessary parts of the mail has been deleted and the remaining pages do have the special character in front. With this reply the original sender of the mail can easily determine what you are referring to in your mail.

	Not only text can be sent via an e-mail. Certain encoding mechanisms allow the sending of binary data of the internet. Normally only characters of

	to a usenet newsgroup. Be sure to tell your client, which of the two encoding methods to use. When sending a binary file to a newsgroup it is a 
	good idea to use UUEncodeing. For general mail, MIME is a good choice. However be sure to check with your receiver before sending for the 
	capabilities of his mail client. Both of you need to have the same capabilities. After you have verified the correct settings, you can

	A note on sending files: Don't sent large files to people who didn't ask for it. You might be wasting their money. Let's say you are sending a 
	1 MB file to a person who doesn't want it. He has to download it and can't delete it from the server. So check with your receiver if he wants the file.

		There is also an encryption method called <I>BinHex</I>. This one is only used on the MacIntosh. It's no good idea to use this method (most mail clients
		don't even support it). We would recommend using MIME or UUEncoding, because these methods are available on many platforms.

	Each mail that has been  sent or received has got a header. This header contains information who has sent the mail, which address the reply should go to, 
	which time the mail was received and much more. Here is an example of such a mail header (Note that some lines have been wrapped for

	Here are a few words on such a mail header. The <I>X-POP3-RCPT</I> section shows the receiver of the mail. All the <I>Received</I> entries 
	are the paths, this mail was passed. I other words, these are all the major computers and routers, this mail has passed on its journey. <I>Date</I> 
	shows the date the message was received. The <I>-0500</I> shows the time difference between the sender and the receiver. <I>Reply-To</I>, 
	<I>Sender</I>, <I>From</I> and <I>Subject</I> are self explanatory I think. The <I>Content-Type</I> and <I>Content-Length</I> are used for 
	MIME encoding.
