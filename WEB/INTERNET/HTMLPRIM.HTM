<H1 align=center>A Beginner's Guide to HTML</H1>

<P>
This is a primer for producing documents in HTML, the hypertext markup language
used on the World Wide Web. This guide is intended to be an introduction
to using HTML and creating files for the Web. Links are provided to additional
information. You should also check your local bookstore; there are many
volumes about the Web and HTML that could be useful.

<H3><A NAME = "WT">What Isn't Covered</A></H3>
<P>
This primer assumes that you:

<UL>
<LI>know how to use NCSA Mosaic or some
    other Web browser 
<LI>have a general understanding of how Web servers and client browsers
    work 
<LI>have access to a Web server (or that you want to produce HTML documents 
    for personal use in local-viewing mode)
</UL>

<h3><A NAME = "HV">HTML Version</A></h3>
This guide reflects the most current specification--HTML Version 2.0--
plus some additional features that have been widely and consistently
implemented in browsers. Future versions and new features for HTML
are under development.





<H2 align=center><A NAME = "HD">HTML Documents</A></H2>
<h3><A NAME = "WI">What an HTML Document Is</A></h3>
HTML documents are plain-text (also known as ASCII) files that can
be created using any text editor (e.g., Emacs or vi on UNIX machines; BBEdit 
on a Macintosh; Notepad on a Windows machine). You can also use word-processing 
software if you remember 
to save your document as "text only with line breaks."

<h3><A NAME = "HE">HTML Editors</A></h3>
Some WYSIWYG editors are available
(e.g., HotMetal, which is available for several platforms or 
Adobe PageMill for Macintoshes).
You may wish to try one of them after you learn some of the basics of 
HTML tagging. It is useful to know enough HTML to code a document
before you determine the usefulness of a WYSIWYG editor.
<p>
If you haven't already selected your software, refer to an 
<a href="http://sdg.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~mag/work/HTMLEditors/">online listing of HTML 
editors</a> (organized by platform) 
to help you in your search for appropriate software.

<h3><A NAME = "GY">Getting Your Files on a Server</A></h3>
If you have access to a Web server at school or work,  
contact your <dfn>webmaster</dfn> (the individual who maintains the server) to see
how you can get your files on the Web. If you do not have access to a 
server at work or school,
check to see if your community operates a <dfn>FreeNet</dfn>, 
a community-based 
network that provides free access to the Internet. Lacking a FreeNet,
you may need to contact a local Internet provider that will 
post your files on a server for a fee. (Check your local newspaper for advertisements
or with your Chamber of Commerce for the names of companies.)

<h3><A NAME = "TEM">Tags Explained</A></h3>
An <dfn>element</dfn> is a fundamental component of the structure of a text 
document. Some examples of elements are heads, tables, paragraphs,
and lists. Think of it this way: you use HTML tags to mark the elements
of a file for your browser. Elements can contain plain text, other
elements, or both.
<p>
To denote the various elements in an HTML document, you use <dfn>tags</dfn>.
HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (<SAMP>&lt;</SAMP>),
a tag name, and a right angle bracket (<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>). 
Tags are usually paired (e.g., 
<SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;/H1&gt;</SAMP>) to start and end the 
tag instruction. The end
tag looks just like the start tag except a slash (/) precedes the
text within the brackets. HTML tags are <a href="#MT">listed below</a>.
<p>
Some elements may include an <dfn>attribute</dfn>, which is 
additional information that is included inside the start tag. 
For example, you can specify the alignment of images (top,
middle, or bottom) by including the 
appropriate attribute with the image source HTML code.
Tags that have optional attributes are <a href="#MT">noted below</a>.
<p>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG><I> HTML is not case sensitive. 
</I><SAMP>&lt;title&gt;</SAMP> is equivalent to 
<SAMP>&lt;TITLE&gt;</SAMP> or <SAMP>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</SAMP>. There are a
few exceptions noted in <A HREF = "#ES">Escape Sequences</a> below.
<P>
Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers. If a browser
does not support a tag, it (usually) just ignores it. 
 



<H3><A NAME="TM2">The Minimal HTML Document</A></H3>
Every HTML document should contain certain standard HTML tags. 
Each document consists of head and body text. The head contains
the title, and the body contains the actual text that is made
up of paragraphs, lists, and other elements. Browsers expect
specific information because they are programmed according to HTML
and SGML specifications. 
<p>
Required elements are shown in this 
sample bare-bones document:
<p>
<PRE>
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;A Simple HTML Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;H1&gt;HTML is Easy To Learn&lt;/H1&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML. 
    This is the first paragraph. While short it is 
    still a paragraph!&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;And this is the second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
</PRE>
The required elements are the &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;,
and &lt;body&gt; tags (and their corresponding end tags). Because you
should include these tags in each file, you might want to create a
template file with them. (Some browsers will format your HTML file correctly
even if these tags are not included. But some browsers won't! So make sure
to include them.)
<p>
Click to see the <A HREF=SimpleExample.html>formatted version</A>
of the example. A <a href="LongerCoded.html">longer example</a> is also 
available but you should read through the rest of the guide before
you take a look. This longer-example file contains tags explained 
in the next section.
<p>

<H3><a name="TeT">A Teaching Tool</a></h3>
To see a copy of the file that your browser reads to generate the 
information in your current window, select View Source (or the equivalent)
from the browser menu.
The file contents, with all the HTML tags, are displayed in a new window. 
<p>
This is an excellent way
to see how HTML is used and to learn tips and constructs. Of course, the HTML 
might not be technically correct. Once you become familiar with HTML
and check the many online and hard-copy references on the subject, you
will learn to distinguish between 
"good" and "bad" HTML. 
<p>
Remember that you can save
a source file with the HTML codes and use 
it as a template for one of your Web pages or modify
the format to suit your purposes.





<H2 align=center><A NAME="MT">Markup Tags</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="HT">HTML</A></H3>
This element tells your browser that the file contains HTML-coded information.
The file extension <samp>.html</samp> also indicates this an HTML
document and must be used. 
(If you are restricted to 8.3 filenames (e.g., <samp>LeeHome.htm</samp>, 
use only <samp>.htm</samp> for your extension.)


<H3><A NAME="HE2">HEAD</A></H3>
The head element identifies the first part of your HTML-coded document that 
contains the title. The title is shown as part of 
your browser's window (see below).

<H4><A NAME="TI">TITLE</A></H4>
The title element contains your document title and identifies
its content in a global context. The title is displayed somewhere on the 
browser window (usually at the top), but not within the text area. 
The title is also what is displayed on 
someone's hotlist or bookmark list, so choose something descriptive,
unique, and relatively short. A title is also used during a WAIS search of 
a server.
<p>
For example, you might include a shortened title of a book along with
the chapter contents: <cite>NCSA Mosaic Guide (Windows): Installation</cite>.
This tells the software name, the platform, and the chapter contents, which is 
more useful than simply calling the document <cite>Installation</cite>.
Generally you should keep your titles to 64 characters or fewer.


<H3><A NAME="BO">BODY</A></H3>
The second--and largest--part of your HTML document is the body, which contains the 
content of your document (displayed within the text area of your
browser window). The tags explained below are used within the body of your
HTML document.


<H4><A NAME="HE3">Headings</A></H4>
<P>
HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being
the most prominent. Headings are displayed in larger and/or bolder
fonts than normal body text. The first heading in each document should
be tagged <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP>. 
<p>
The syntax of the heading element is:
<br>
<SAMP>&lt;H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP><VAR>Text of heading</VAR><SAMP>
&lt;/H</SAMP><VAR>y</VAR><SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>
<br>
where <VAR>y</VAR> is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level
of the heading. 
<p>
Do not skip levels of headings in your document. For example, don't 
start with a level-one heading (&ltH1&gt;) and then next use a level-three (&lt;H3&gt;)
heading.


<H4><A NAME="PA">Paragraphs</A></H4>
<P>
Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in HTML
files aren't significant. So you don't have to worry about how long
your lines of text are (better to have them fewer than 72 characters long though). 
Word wrapping can occur at any point in your
source file, and multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space by
your browser. 
<p>
In the bare-bones example shown in the Minimal HTML Document section, 
the first paragraph is coded as 

<PRE>
    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML. 
    This is the first paragraph. 
    While short it is
    still a paragraph!&lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
In the source file there is a line break between the sentences. A
Web browser ignores this line break and starts a new paragraph only
when it encounters another <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tag. 

<P>
<STRONG>Important:</STRONG> 
You must indicate paragraphs with &lt;P&gt; elements. A browser
ignores any indentations or blank lines in the source text. Without
&lt;P&gt; elements, the document becomes one large paragraph. (One
exception is text tagged as "preformatted," which is explained below.)
For example, the following would produce identical output as the first 
bare-bones HTML example:

<PRE>
    &lt;H1&gt;Level-one heading&lt;/H1&gt; &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML. This is the 
    first paragraph. While short it is still a
    paragraph! &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;And this is the second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>

To preserve readability in HTML files, put headings 
on separate lines, use a blank line or two where it helps identify the 
start of a new section, and separate paragraphs with blank lines
(in addition to the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> tags). These extra spaces will help
you when you edit your files (but your browser will ignore the extra
spaces because it has its own set of rules on spacing that do not depend
on the spaces you put in your source file).

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</STRONG>
The <SAMP>&lt;/P&gt;</SAMP> closing tag can be omitted. 
This is because browsers understand that when they encounter a
&lt;P&gt; tag, it implies that there is an end to the previous
paragraph.

<P>
Using the &lt;P&gt; and &lt;/P&gt; as a paragraph container means that 
you can center a paragraph by including the <samp>ALIGN=</samp><var>alignment</var>
attribute in your source file.

<PRE>
    <SAMP>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</SAMP>
    This is a centered paragraph. [See the formatted version below.]
    &lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>
<p>
<P align=center>
This is a centered paragraph.
</p>
<p>


<H4><A NAME="LI">Lists</A></H4>
HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and definition lists. You can nest lists
too, but use this feature sparingly because too many 
nested items can get difficult to 
follow.
<p>
<b>Unnumbered Lists</b><p>
To make an unnumbered, bulleted list,
<OL>
<LI>start with an opening list <SAMP>&lt;UL&gt;</SAMP> (for unnumbered
list) tag
<LI>enter the <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> (list item) tag followed by the individual
    item; no 
    closing <SAMP>&lt;/LI&gt;</SAMP> tag is needed
<LI>end the entire list with a closing list <SAMP>&lt;/UL&gt;</SAMP> tag
</OL>

<P>
Below is a sample three-item list: 

<PRE>
    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; apples
    &lt;LI&gt; bananas
    &lt;LI&gt; grapefruit
    &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The output is:

<UL>
<LI>apples 
<LI>bananas 
<li>grapefruit
</UL>

<P>
The <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> items can contain multiple paragraphs.
Indicate the paragraphs with the <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph
tags.
<p>
<b>Numbered Lists</b>
<P>
A numbered list (also called an <dfn>ordered list</dfn>, from which the tag name
derives) is identical to an unnumbered list, except it uses <SAMP>&lt;OL&gt;</SAMP>
instead of <SAMP>&lt;UL&gt;</SAMP>. The items are tagged using the
same <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> tag. The following HTML code:

<PRE>
    &lt;OL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; oranges
    &lt;LI&gt; peaches
    &lt;LI&gt; grapes
    &lt;/OL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
produces this formatted output:

<OL>
<LI>oranges 
<LI>peaches 
<LI>grapes 
</OL>
<p>
<b>Definition Lists</b>
<P>
A definition list (coded as <samp>&lt;DL&gt;</samp>) usually 
consists of alternating a <dfn>definition term</dfn> (coded
as <SAMP>&lt;DT&gt;</SAMP>) and a definition definition 
(coded as <SAMP>&lt;DD&gt;</SAMP>).
Web browsers generally format the definition on a new line.

<P>
The following is an example of a definition list: 

<PRE>
    &lt;DL&gt;
    &lt;DT&gt; NCSA
    &lt;DD&gt; NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
         is located on the campus of the University of Illinois 
         at Urbana-Champaign. 
    &lt;DT&gt; Cornell Theory Center
    &lt;DD&gt; CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca,
         New York. 
    &lt;/DL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The output looks like: 

<DL>
<DT>NCSA
<DD>NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, is located
    on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
    
<DT>Cornell Theory Center 
<DD>CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New
    York.
</DL>

<P>
The <SAMP>&lt;DT&gt;</SAMP> and <SAMP>&lt;DD&gt;</SAMP> entries can
contain multiple paragraphs (indicated by <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP> paragraph
tags), lists, or other definition information.
<p>
The <samp>COMPACT</samp> attribute can be used routinely 
in case your definition
terms are very short. If, for example, you are showing some computer options, the 
options may fit on the same line as the start of the definition. 
<pre>
&lt;DL COMPACT&gt;
&lt;DT&gt; -i
&lt;DD&gt;invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows using the 
initialization file defined in the path
&lt;DT&gt; -k
&lt;DD&gt;invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows in kiosk mode
&lt;/DL&gt;
</pre>

The output looks like:
<dl compact>
<dt>-i
<dd>invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows using the 
initialization file defined in the path.
<dt>-k
<dd>invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows in kiosk mode.
</dl>

<p>
<b>Nested Lists</b>
<P>
Lists can be nested. You can also have a number
of paragraphs, each containing a nested list, in a single list item.

<P>
Here is a sample nested list: 

<PRE>
    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; A few New England states:
        &lt;UL&gt;
        &lt;LI&gt; Vermont
        &lt;LI&gt; New Hampshire
        &lt;LI&gt; Maine
        &lt;/UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; Two Midwestern states:
        &lt;UL&gt;
        &lt;LI&gt; Michigan
        &lt;LI&gt; Indiana
        &lt;/UL&gt;
    &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The nested list is displayed as 

<UL>
<LI>A few New England states: 
    <UL>
    <LI>Vermont 
    <LI>New Hampshire 
    <li>Maine
    </UL>
<LI>Two Midwestern states: 
    <UL>
    <LI>Michigan 
    <li>Indiana
    </UL>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="PT">Preformatted Text</A></H4>
<P>
Use the<SAMP> &lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> tag (which stands for "preformatted")
to generate text in a fixed-width font. This tag also makes spaces, new lines,
and tabs significant (multiple spaces are displayed
as multiple spaces, and lines break in the same locations as in the
source HTML file). This is useful for program listings, among other things. 
For example,
the following lines:

<PRE>
    &lt;PRE&gt;
      #!/bin/csh                           
      cd $SCR                             
      cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f   
      cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile   
      fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f           
      mya.out                              
      cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile 
      rm *                                
    &lt;/PRE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
display as:

<PRE>
      #!/bin/csh                           
      cd $SCR                             
      cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f   
      cfs get myinfile:mycfsdir/myinfile   
      fc -02 -o mya.out mysrc.f           
      mya.out                              
      cfs save myoutfile:mycfsdir/myoutfile 
      rm *
</PRE>

<P>
The <samp>&lt;PRE&gt;</samp> tag can be used with an optional <samp>WIDTH</samp> 
attribute that specifies
the maximum number of characters for a line. <samp>WIDTH</samp> 
also signals your browser
to choose an appropriate font and indentation for the text.
<p>
Hyperlinks can be used within <SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP> sections. You
should avoid using other HTML tags within <SAMP>&lt;PRE&gt;</SAMP>
sections, however.

<P>
Note that because &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meanings in HTML,
you must use their escape sequences (<SAMP>&amp;lt;</SAMP>, <SAMP>&amp;gt;</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>&amp;amp;</SAMP>, respectively) to enter these characters.
See the section <A HREF = "#ES">
Escape Sequences</A> for more information.

<H4><A NAME="EQ">Extended Quotations</A></H4>
<P>
Use the <SAMP>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</SAMP> tag to include lengthy quotations in
a separate block on the screen. Most browsers generally change the margins
for the quotation
to separate
it from surrounding text.

<P>
In the example:

<PRE>
    &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Omit needless words.&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no  
    unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the  
    same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a  
    machine no unnecessary parts.&lt;/P&gt;
    --William Strunk, Jr., 1918
    &lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
the result is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p>Omit needless words.</p>
    <p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, 
    a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing
    should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.</p>

<H4><A NAME="AD">Addresses</A></H4>
<P>
The <SAMP>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</SAMP> tag is generally used to specify the
author of a document, a way to contact the author (e.g., an
email address), and a revision date. It is usually the last item in a file. 

<P>
For example, the last line of the online version of this guide is: 

<PRE>
    &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
    A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu / revised April 96
    &lt;/ADDRESS&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The result is:
<ADDRESS>A Beginner's Guide to HTML / NCSA / pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu / revised April 96</ADDRESS>

<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> <SAMP>&lt;ADDRESS&gt;</SAMP> is <EM>not</EM>
used for postal addresses. See "Forced Line Breaks" below to
see how to format postal addresses.

<H4><A NAME="FL">Forced Line Breaks/Postal Addresses</A></H4>
<P>
The <SAMP>&lt;BR&gt;</SAMP> tag forces a line break with no extra 
(white) space
between lines. Using <samp>&lt;P&gt;</samp> elements
for short lines of text such as postal
addresses results in unwanted additional white space. 
For example, with &lt;BR&gt;:
<PRE>
    National Center for Supercomputing Applications&lt;BR&gt;
    605 East Springfield Avenue&lt;BR&gt;
    Champaign, Illinois 61820-5518&lt;BR&gt;
</PRE>
The output is:<p>
    National Center for Supercomputing Applications<br>
    605 East Springfield Avenue<br>
    Champaign, Illinois 61820-5518<br>
    <p>

<H4><A NAME="HR">Horizontal Rules</A></H4>
<P>
The <SAMP>&lt;HR&gt;</SAMP> tag produces a horizontal line the width
of the browser window. A horizontal rule is useful to separate
sections of your document. For example, many people add a rule
at the end of their text and before the  <SAMP>&lt;address&gt; </SAMP> information.
<p>
You can vary a rule's size (thickness) and width (the 
percentage of the window covered
by the rule). 
Experiment with the settings until you are satisfied with the presentation.
For example:
<pre>
&lt;HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="50%"&gt;
</pre>

displays as: <hr size=4 width=50%>



<H2 align=center><A NAME="CF">Character Formatting</A></H2>
HTML has two types of styles for individual words or sentences: 
logical and physical. <DFN>Logical styles</DFN>
tag text according to its meaning, while <DFN>physical styles</DFN>
indicate the specific appearance of a section. For example, in the preceding
sentence, the words "logical styles" was tagged as a "definition."
The same effect (formatting those words in italics) could have been
achieved via a different tag that tells your browser to "put these words
in italics."
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Some browsers don't attach any style to the
<samp>&lt;DFN&gt;</samp> tag, so you might not see the indicated phrases in the
previous paragraph in italics.

<H3><A NAME="PV">Logical Versus Physical Styles</A></H3>
<P>
If physical and logical styles produce the same result on the screen,
why are there both? 
<P>
In the ideal SGML universe, content is divorced from presentation.
Thus SGML tags a level-one heading as a level-one heading, but does
not specify that the level-one heading should be, for instance, 24-point
bold Times centered. The advantage of this approach
(it's similar in concept to style sheets in many word processors) is
that if you decide to change level-one headings to be 20-point left-justified
Helvetica, all you have to do is change the definition of the level-one
heading in your Web browser. Indeed many
browsers today let you define how you want the various 
HTML tags rendered on-screen.

<P>
Another advantage of logical tags is that they help enforce consistency
in your documents. It's easier to tag something as <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP>
than to remember that level-one headings are 24-point bold Times centered or
whatever. For example, consider
the <SAMP>&lt;STRONG&gt;</SAMP> tag. Most browsers render it in bold
text. However, it is possible that a reader would prefer that these
sections be displayed in red instead. Logical styles offer this flexibility.

<p>
Of course, if you want something to be displayed in italics 
(for example) and do not 
want a browser's setting to  display it differently, use 
physical styles. Physical
styles, therefore, offer consistency in that something you 
tag a certain way will always be
displayed that way for readers of your document.
<p>
Try to be consistent about which type of style you use. 
If you tag with physical 
styles, do so throughout a document. If you use logical styles, 
stick with them
within a document. Keep in mind that future releases of HTML might 
not support
physical styles, which could mean that browsers will not display 
physical 
style coding.

<H3><A NAME="ES">Escape Sequences</A> (a.k.a. Character Entities)</H3>
Character entities have two functions:
<ul>
<li>escaping special characters
<li>displaying other characters not available in the 
plain ASCII character set (primarily characters with
diacritical marks)
</ul>
Three ASCII characters--the left angle bracket
(&lt;), the right angle bracket (&gt;), and the 
ampersand (&amp;)--have special meanings in HTML and therefore
cannot be used "as is" in text. (The angle brackets are used to indicate
the beginning and end of HTML tags, and the ampersand is used to indicate
the beginning of an escape sequence.)
Double quote marks may be used as-is but a character entity
may also be used (&amp;quot;).
<P>
To use one of the three characters in an HTML document, you must enter
its <DFN>escape </DFN><DFN>sequence</DFN> instead:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>&amp;lt;</SAMP> 
<DD>the escape sequence for &lt; 
<DT><SAMP>&amp;gt;</SAMP>
<DD>the escape sequence for &gt; 
<DT><SAMP>&amp;amp;</SAMP>
<DD>the escape sequence for &amp;
</DL>

<P>
Additional escape sequences support accented characters, such as:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>&amp;ouml;</SAMP>
<DD>the escape sequence for a lowercase o with an umlaut: &ouml;
    
<DT><SAMP>&amp;ntilde;</SAMP>
<DD>the escape sequence for a lowercase n with an tilde: &ntilde; 
<DT><SAMP>&amp;Egrave;</SAMP>
<DD>the escape sequence for an uppercase E with a grave accent: &Egrave;
</DL>

You can substitute other letters for the 
<i>o</i>, <i>n</i>, and <i>E</i> shown above.
Check this online reference for a longer list of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_13.html#SEC106">
special characters</a>.
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Unlike the rest of HTML, the escape sequences
are case sensitive. You cannot, for instance, use <samp>&amp;LT;</samp> instead
of <samp>&amp;lt;</samp>.



<H2 align=center><A NAME="LI2">Linking</A></H2>
The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link text
and/or an image to another document or section of a document. A browser highlights the
identified text or image with color and/or underlines to indicate that it
is a <dfn>hypertext link</dfn> (often shortened to <DFN>hyperlink</DFN> or
<DFN>link</DFN>).

<P>
HTML's single hypertext-related tag is <SAMP>&lt;A&gt;</SAMP>, which
stands for <DFN>anchor</DFN>. To include an anchor in your document:

<OL>
<LI>start the anchor with <SAMP>&lt;A</SAMP>  (include a space after
    the <CODE>A</CODE>)
<LI>specify the document you're linking to by entering the parameter
    <SAMP>HREF=&quot;</SAMP><VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>&quot;</SAMP>
    followed by a closing right angle bracket (<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>)
<LI>enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the current
    document
<LI>enter the ending anchor tag: <SAMP>&lt;/A&gt;</SAMP> (no space
is needed before the end anchor tag)
</OL>

<P>
Here is a sample hypertext reference in a file called <SAMP>US.html</SAMP>: 

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;MaineStats.html&quot;&gt;Maine&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
This entry makes the word <i>Maine</i> the hyperlink to the 
document <SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>,
which is in the same directory as the first document. 

<H3><A NAME="RL">Relative Pathnames Versus Absolute Pathnames</A></H3>
<P>
You can link
to documents in other directories by specifying the <DFN>relative path</DFN>
from the current document to the linked document. For example, a link
to a file <SAMP>NYStats.html</SAMP> located in the subdirectory 
<SAMP>AtlanticStates</SAMP>
would be:

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;AtlanticStates/NYStats.html&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
These are called <dfn>relative links</dfn> because you are 
specifying the path to the linked file relative to the location of the current file. 
You can also use the absolute
pathname (the complete URL) of the file, but relative links are more efficient
in accessing a server. 
<p>
Pathnames use the standard UNIX syntax. The UNIX syntax for the parent directory
(the directory that contains the current directory) is "..".  (For
more information consult a beginning UNIX reference text such as 
<cite>Learning the UNIX Operating System</cite> from O'Reilly
and Associates, Inc.)
<p>

If you were in the <SAMP>NYStats.html</SAMP> file and were referring to the original 
document <SAMP>US.html</SAMP>, your link would look like this:

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;../US.html&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>


In general, you should use relative links because:

<OL>
<LI>it's easier to move a group of documents to another location (because
    the relative path names will still be valid)
<li>it's more efficient connecting to the server
<LI>there is less to type
</OL>

<P>
However use absolute pathnames when linking to documents that are
not directly related. For example, consider a group of documents that
comprise a user manual. Links within this group should be relative
links. Links to other documents (perhaps a reference to related software)
should use full path names. This way if you move the user manual to
a different directory, none of the links would have to be updated.




<H3><A NAME="UR">URLs</A></H3>
<P>
The World Wide Web uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to specify
the location of files on other servers. A URL includes the type of
resource being accessed (e.g., Web, gopher, WAIS), the address of the server,
and the location of the file. The syntax is:

<P>
<VAR>scheme</VAR><SAMP>://</SAMP><VAR>host.domain</VAR>
<SAMP>[:</SAMP><VAR>port</VAR><SAMP>]/</SAMP><VAR>path</VAR><SAMP>/</SAMP>
<VAR>filename</VAR>

<P>
where <VAR>scheme</VAR> is one of

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>file</SAMP>
<DD>a file on your local system
<dt><samp>ftp</samp>
<dd>a file on an anonymous FTP server
<DT><SAMP>http</SAMP>
<DD>a file on a World Wide Web server 
<DT><SAMP>gopher</SAMP>
<DD>a file on a Gopher server 
<DT><SAMP>WAIS</SAMP>
<DD>a file on a WAIS server 
<DT><SAMP>news</SAMP>
<DD>a Usenet newsgroup
<DT><SAMP>telnet</SAMP>
<DD>a connection to a Telnet-based service
</DL>

<P>
The <VAR>port</VAR> number can generally be omitted. (That means unless
someone tells you otherwise, leave it out.)

<P>
For example, to include a link to this primer in your document, enter: 
<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html&quot;&gt; 
    NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
This entry makes the text <cite>NCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML</cite> a hyperlink
to this document.

<P>
For more information on URLs, refer to:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF = "http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html">

<LI><A HREF = "http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html">
    <CITE>A Beginner's Guide to URLs</CITE></A>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="LTS">Links to Specific Sections</A></H3>
<P>
Anchors can also be used to move a reader to a <i>particular section</i> in a document (either
the same or a different document) rather than to the top, which is the default. This type
of an anchor is commonly called a <dfn>named anchor</dfn> because to create the links,
you insert HTML names within the document.
<p>
This guide is a good example of using named anchors in one document. 
The guide is constructed as one document to make
printing easier. But as one (long) document, it can be time-consuming
to move through when all you really want to know about is one bit of
information about HTML. 
Internal hyperlinks are used to create a "table of
contents" at the top of this document. These hyperlinks move you from
one location in the document to another location in the same document. 
(Go to the <a href="#top">top</a> of this document and then click on the <cite>
Links to Specific Sections</cite> hyperlink in the table of contents.
You will wind up back here.)
<p> 
You can also link to a specific section in another document. That information is
presented first because understanding that helps you understand linking within one 
document. 

<h4>Links Between Sections of Different Documents</h4>
Suppose you want to set a link from document A (<samp>documentA.html</samp>) 
to a specific section
in another document (<SAMP>MaineStats.html</SAMP>). 
<p>
Enter the HTML coding for a link to a 
named anchor:
<pre>
     <samp>documentA.html</samp>:
     
     In addition to the many state parks, Maine is also home to 
     &lt;a href="MaineStats.html#ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;.
</pre>

Think of the characters after the hash (#) mark as a tab within the
<samp>MaineStats.html</samp> file. This tab tells your browser
what should be displayed at the top of the window when the link is activated.
In other words, the first line in your browser window should be the 
Acadia National Park heading.
<p>
Next, create the <DFN>named anchor</DFN> (in this example "ANP") 
in <samp>MaineStats.html</samp>: 

<PRE>
    &lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME=&quot;ANP&quot;&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H2&GT;
</PRE>
With both of these elements in place, you can bring a reader directly to 
the Acadia reference in <samp>MaineStats.html</samp>.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You cannot make links to specific sections 
within a different document unless either
you have write permission to the coded source of that document or that document 
already contains
in-document named anchors. For example, you could include 
named anchors to this primer in a document you are writing because 
there are named anchors 
in this guide (use View Source in your browser to see the coding). 
But if this document did <i>not</i> have named 
anchors, you could
not make a link to a specific section because you cannot edit the original 
file on NCSA's server.


<H4>Links to Specific Sections within the Current Document</H4>
<P>
The technique is the same except the filename is <emphasis>omitted</emphasis>. 

<P>
For example, to link to the <samp>ANP</samp> anchor from 
within <samp>MaineStats</samp>, enter:

<PRE>
    ...More information about &lt;A HREF="#ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt; 
    is available elsewhere in this document.
    </pre> 

Be sure to include the <samp>&lt;A NAME=&gt;</samp> tag at the 
place in your document
where you want the link to jump to (<samp>&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A 
NAME=&quot;ANP&quot;&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;</samp>).
<p>
Named anchors are particularly useful when you think readers will print a document
in its entirety or when you have a lot of short information you want to place online
in one file.


<h3><A NAME="M2">Mailto</a></h3>
<p>
You can make it easy for a reader to send electronic mail to a specific
person or mail alias by including the <samp>mailto</samp> attribute in a hyperlink.
The format is:
<pre>
&lt;A HREF="mailto:<var>emailinfo@host</var>"&gt;<var>Name</var>&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

For example, enter:
<pre>
&lt;A HREF="mailto:<var>pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu</var>"&gt;<var>NCSA Publications Group</var>&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

to create a mail window that is already configured to open a mail window for the 
<a href="mailto:pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu">NCSA Publications
Group</a> alias. (You, of course, will enter another mail address!)



<H2 align=center><A NAME="II">Inline Images</A></H2>
Most Web browsers can display inline images (that is, images next
to text) that are in X Bitmap (XBM), GIF, or 
JPEG format. Other image formats
are being incorporated into Web browsers [e.g., the Portable
Network Graphic (PNG) format]. Each image takes
time to process and slows down the initial display of a document. 
Carefully select your images and the number of images in 
a document.
<P>
To include an inline image, enter:

<PRE>
    &lt;IMG SRC=<VAR>ImageName</VAR>&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>ImageName</VAR> is the URL of the image file. 
<p>
The syntax
for <samp>&lt;IMG SRC&gt;</samp> URLs is identical to that used in an anchor
<SAMP>HREF</SAMP>. If the image file is a GIF file, then the filename
part of <VAR>ImageName</VAR> must  end with <SAMP>.gif</SAMP>.
Filenames of X Bitmap images must end with <SAMP>.xbm</SAMP>;
JPEG image files must end with <samp>.jpg</samp> or <samp>.jpeg</samp>; 
and Portable Network Graphic files must end with <samp>.png</samp>.


<h3><A NAME="IS">Image Size Attributes</A></h3>
You should include two other attributes on
<samp>&lt;IMG&gt;</samp> tags to tell your browser the size 
of the images
it is downloading with the text. The <samp>HEIGHT</samp> 
and <samp>WIDTH</samp> attributes
let your browser set aside the appropriate space (in pixels) for
the images as it downloads the rest of the file. (Get the pixel size
from your image-processing software, such as Adobe Photoshop.)
<p>
For example, to include a self portrait image in a file along with the 
portrait's dimensions, enter:

<PRE>
    &lt;IMG SRC=SelfPortrait.gif HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=65&gt;
</PRE>
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Some browsers use the <samp>HEIGHT</samp> 
and <samp>WIDTH</samp> attributes to stretch or shrink an image to fit
into the allotted space when the image does not exactly match
the attribute numbers. Not all browser developers think stretching/shrinking
is a good idea. So don't plan on your readers having access to this
feature. Check your dimensions and use the correct ones.



<h3><A NAME="AI">Aligning Images</A></h3>
You have some flexibility when displaying images. You can have images
separated from text and aligned to the left or right or centered. Or you can have
an image aligned with text. Try several possibilities to see how your information
looks best.
<p>

<b>Aligning Text with an Image</b><br>
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "">
By default the bottom
of an image is aligned with the following text, as shown in this paragraph. 
You can align images to the top or center of a paragraph using 
the <samp>ALIGN=</samp> attributes <samp>TOP</samp> and <samp>CENTER</samp>.
<p>
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "" ALIGN=TOP> This text is aligned with 
the top of the image (<samp>&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" 
ALIGN=TOP&gt;</samp>). Notice how 
the browser aligns only one line and then jumps to the bottom of the image for 
the rest of the text.
<p>
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "" ALIGN=CENTER> And this text is centered on 
the image (<samp>&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</samp>). 
Again, only one line
of text is centered; the rest is below the image.
<p>


<p>
<b>Images without Text</b>
<br>
To display an image without any associated text (e.g., your organization's
logo), make it a separate paragraph. Use the paragraph 
<samp>ALIGN=</samp> attribute to center the image or 
adjust it to the right side of the window as shown below:
<pre>
&lt;p ALIGN=CENTER&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
which results in:
<p ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "">
</p>

The image is centered; this paragraph starts below it and left justified.
<p>





<H3><A NAME="AT2">Alternate Text for Images</A></H3>
<P>
Some World Wide Web browsers--primarily those that run on VT100 
terminals--cannot 
display images. Some users turn off image loading even if their
software can display images
(especially if they are using a modem or have a slow connection). 
HTML provides a 
mechanism to tell readers what they are missing on your pages.
<p>
The <SAMP>ALT</SAMP> attribute lets you specify
text to be displayed instead of an image. For example:

<PRE>
    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;UpArrow.gif&quot; ALT=&quot;Up&quot;&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
where <SAMP>UpArrow.gif </SAMP>is the picture of an upward pointing
arrow. With graphics-capable viewers that have image-loading turned on, you
see the up arrow graphic. With a VT100 browser or if image-loading is
turned off, the word <i>Up</i> is shown in your window.
<p>
You should try to include alternate text for each image you use 
in your document, which
is a courtesy for your readers.




<H3><A NAME="BG">Background Graphics</A></H3>
Newer versions of Web browsers can load an image and use it as a background 
when displaying a page. Some people like background images and some don't. In
general, if you want to include a background, make sure your text can be read easily
when displayed on top of the image.
<p>
Background images can be a texture (linen finished paper, for example) or an 
image of an object (a logo possibly). 
You create the background image
as you do any image. 
<p>
However you only 
have to create a small
piece of the image. Using a feature called tiling, a browser takes 
the image and repeats 
it across and down to fill 
your browser window. In sum you generate one image, and the browser
replicates it enough times to fill your window. This action is automatic when 
you use the background tag shown below.
<p>
The tag to include a background image is included in 
the <samp>&lt;BODY&gt;</samp> 
statement as an attribute:

<PRE>
&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="<var>filename</var>.gif"&gt;
</PRE>

<h3><A NAME="OC">Background Color</a></h3>
By default browsers display text in black on a gray background.
However, you can change both elements if you want. Some HTML authors select a 
background color and coordinate
it with a change in the color of the text. 
<p>
Always preview changes like 
this to make sure your
pages are readable. (For example, many people find red text on a black 
background difficult to read!)
<p>
You change the color of text, links, visited links, and active links
using attributes of the <samp>&lt;BODY&gt;</samp> tag. For example, enter:

<pre>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#FFFFFF" LINK="#9690CC"&gt;
</pre>
This creates a window with a black background (<samp>BGCOLOR</samp>), white text
(<samp>TEXT</samp>), and silvery hyperlinks (<samp>LINK</samp>).
<p> 
The six-digit number and letter combinations represent colors
by giving their RGB (red, green, blue) value. The six digits 
are actually three two-digit numbers in sequence, representing 
the amount of red, green, or blue as a hexadecimal value 
in the range 00-FF. For example, 000000 is black (no color 
at all), FF0000 is bright red, and FFFFFF is white (fully 
saturated with all three colors).  These number and letter combinations 
are cryptic. Fortunately an online resource is 
available to help you track down the combinations that map 
to specific colors and there is software available for you to do this on
your workstation:

<H3><A NAME="EI">External Images, Sounds, and Animations</A></H3>
<P>
You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a user
activates a link on either a word or a smaller, inline version of
the image included in your document. This is called an external
image, and it is useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading of
the main document with large inline images.

<P>
To include a reference to an external image, enter: 

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF="<VAR>MyImage.gif</VAR>"&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
You can also use a smaller image as a link to a larger image. Enter:
<pre>
     &lt;A HREF="<VAR>LargerImage.gif</VAR>"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="<VAR>SmallImage.gif</VAR>"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
The reader sees the <samp>SmallImage.gif</samp> image and clicks on it to 
open the <samp>LargerImage.gif</samp> file.
<P>
Use the same syntax for links to external animations and sounds.
The only difference is the file extension of the linked file. For example,

<P>
<SAMP>&lt;A HREF=&quot;AdamsRib.mov&quot;&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;</SAMP>

<P>
specifies a link to a QuickTime movie. Some common file types and their
extensions are:
<p>

Keep in mind your intended audience and their access to software. Most UNIX
workstations, for instance, cannot view QuickTime movies. 



<h2 align=center><A NAME="TA">Tables</A></h2>
Before HTML tags for tables were finalized, authors had to carefully 
format their tabular information
within <samp>&lt;PRE&gt;</samp> tags, counting spaces and previewing their output.  
Tables are very useful for presentation of tabular information as 
well as a boon to 
creative HTML authors who use the table tags to present their 
regular Web pages. (Check out the 
<a href="http://jean-luc.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA Relativity Group's pages</a> for an 
excellent, award-winning example.)
<p>
Think of your tabular information in light of the coding explained below. A
table has heads where you explain what the columns/rows include, rows for information, 
cells for each item. In the following table, the first column contains the 
header information, each row explains an HTML table tag, and each cell contains a 
paired tag or an explanation of the tag's function.

<H3><A NAME="GT">General Table Format</A></H3>
The general format of a table looks like this:
<PRE>
&lt;TABLE&gt;                                     &lt;== start of table definition

&lt;CAPTION&gt; caption contents &lt;/CAPTION&gt;       &lt;== caption definition

&lt;TR&gt;                                        &lt;== start of first row definition
&lt;TH&gt; cell contents &lt;/TH&gt;                    &lt;== first cell in row 1 (a head)
<p>
&lt;TH&gt; cell contents &lt;/TH&gt;                    &lt;== last cell in row 1 (a head)
&lt;/TR&gt;                                       &lt;== end of first row definition

&lt;TR&gt;                                        &lt;== start of second row definition
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;                    &lt;== first cell in row 2
<p>
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;                    &lt;== last cell in row 2
&lt;/TR&gt;                                       &lt;== end of second row definition
<p>
&lt;TR&gt;                                        &lt;== start of last row definition
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;                    &lt;== first cell in last row
...
&lt;TD&gt; cell contents &lt;/TD&gt;                    &lt;== last cell in last row
&lt;/TR&gt;                                       &lt;== end of last row definition

&lt;/TABLE&gt;                                    &lt;== end of table definition
</PRE>

The <samp>&lt;TABLE&gt;</samp> and <samp>&lt;/TABLE&gt;</samp> 
tags <b>must</b> surround the 
entire table definition.  The first item
inside the table is the <samp>CAPTION</samp>, which is optional.  
Then you can have any 
number of rows defined by the
<samp>&lt;TR&gt;</samp> and <samp>&lt;/TR&gt;</samp> tags.  
Within a row you can have any number of 
cells defined by the <samp>&lt;TD&gt;</samp>...<samp>&lt;/TD&gt;</samp> or 
<samp>&lt;TH&gt;</samp>...<samp>&lt;/TH&gt;</samp> tags. Each 
row of a table is, essentially, formatted independently of the rows above and below
it. This lets you easily display tables like the one above with a single
cell, such as Table Attributes, spanning columns of the table.
<p>


<h3><A NAME="TF">Tables for Nontabular Information</A></h3>
Some HTML authors use tables to present nontabular information. 
For example, because links
can be included in table cells, some authors use a table
with no borders to create "one" image from separate images.
Browsers that can display tables properly 
show the various
images seamlessly, making the created image seem like an 
<dfn>image map</dfn> (one image with hyperlinked 
quadrants). 
<p>
Using table borders
with images can create an impressive display as well. Experiment and see 
what you like.




<H2 align=center><A NAME="FF">Fill-out Forms</A></H2>
Web forms let a reader 
return information to a Web server for some action. 
For example, suppose you collect names and email addresses so you can email some
information to people who request it. For each person who enters his or her
name and address, you need
some information to be sent and the respondent's particulars added to a data base. 
<p>
This processing
of incoming data is usually handled by a script or program written in Perl or
another language that manipulates text, files, and information. If you cannot write a 
program or script for your incoming information, you need to find someone who can do 
this for you. 
<p>
The forms themselves are not hard to code. They follow the same constructs
as other HTML tags. What could be difficult is the program or script that takes
the information submitted in a form and processes it. Because of the need for
specialized scripts to handle the incoming form information,  
<A HREF = /SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html>fill-out forms</a>
are not discussed in this primer. Check the <a href="#AR">Additional Online Reference</a> 
section for more information.
<p>




<H2 align=center><A NAME="TR">Troubleshooting</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="AO">Avoid Overlapping Tags</A></H3>
<P>
Consider this example of HTML:

<PRE>
    &lt;B&gt;This is an example of &lt;DFN&gt;overlapping&lt;/B&gt; HTML tags.&lt;/DFN&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The word <i>overlapping</i> is contained within both the <SAMP>&lt;B&gt;</SAMP>
and <SAMP>&lt;DFN&gt;</SAMP> tags. A browser might be confused by this 
coding and might not display it the way you intend. The only way to know is to
check each popular browser (which is time-consuming and impractical).
<p>
In general, avoid overlapping tags. Look at your tags and try pairing them up.
Tags (with the obvious exceptions of elements whose end tags
may be omitted, such as paragraphs) 
should be paired without an intervening tag in between. Look again at the 
example above. You cannot pair the bold tags without another tag in the middle (the
first definition tag). Try matching your coding up like this to see if you 
have any problem areas that should be fixed before your release your  
files to a server.

<H3><A NAME="OE">Embed Only Anchors and Character Tags</A></H3>
<P>
HTML protocol allows you to embed links within other HTML tags:

<PRE>
    &lt;H1&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt;My heading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<EM>Do not</EM> embed HTML tags within an anchor:

<PRE>
    &lt;A HREF=&quot;Destination.html&quot;&gt;
    &lt;H1&gt;My heading&lt;/H1&gt;
    &lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Although most browsers currently handle this second example, the official HTML 
specifications do not support this construct and your file will probably not work with
future browsers. Remember that browsers can be forgiving when displaying improperly
coded files. But that forgiveness may not last to the next version of the software!
When in doubt, code your files according to the HTML specifications (see <a href=
"#FM">For More Information</a> below).

<P>
Character tags modify the appearance of the text within other elements:

<PRE>
    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bold list item&lt;/B&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;An italic list item&lt;/I&gt;
    &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
Avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For example,
you might be tempted to embed a heading within a list in order to make the
font size larger:

<PRE>
    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;A large heading&lt;/H1&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Something slightly smaller&lt;/H2&gt;
    &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>


<P>
Although some browsers handle this quite nicely, formatting of such
coding is unpredictable (because it
is undefined). For compatibility with all
browsers, avoid these kinds of constructs. (The Netscape &lt;FONT&gt; tag,
which lets you specify how large individual characters will be displayed
in your window, is not currently part of
the official HTML specifications.)

<P>
What's the difference between embedding a <SAMP>&lt;B&gt;</SAMP> within
a <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP> tag as opposed to embedding a <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP>
within a <SAMP>&lt;LI&gt;</SAMP>?
Within HTML the semantic meaning of <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP> is that it's the main
heading of a document and that it should be followed by the content
of the document. Therefore it doesn't make sense to find a <SAMP>&lt;H1&gt;</SAMP>
within a list.

<P>
Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. For example, you might
expect that:

<PRE>
    &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsers
interpret only the innermost tag.

<H3><A NAME="FS">Do the Final Steps </A></H3>
<h4>Validate Your Code</h4>
When you put a document on a Web server, be sure to 
check the formatting and each link (including named anchors). Ideally you will
have someone else read through and comment on 
your file(s) before you consider a document
finished. 
<p>
You can run your coded files through <a href="http://www.webtechs.com/html-val-svc/">
an HTML validation service</a> that will tell you if your code conforms 
to accepted HTML. If you are not sure your coding conforms to HTML specifications, this
can be a useful teaching tool. Fortunately the service lets you select the level
of conformance you want for your files (i.e., strict, level 2, level 3). If you
want to use some codes that are not officially part of the HTML specifications,
this latitude is helpful.
<p>
<h4>Dummy Images</h4>
When an <SAMP>&lt;IMG SRC&gt;</SAMP> tag points to an image that does not
exist, a dummy image is substituted by your browser software. 
When this happens during your final review of your files, make sure that
the referenced image does in fact exist, that the hyperlink has the
correct information in the URL, and that the file permission is set
appropriately (world-readable). Then check online again!
<p>
<h4>Update Your Files</h4>
If the contents of a file are static (such as a biography of George Washington),
no updating is probably needed. But for documents
that are time sensitive or covering a field that changes frequently,
<strong> remember to update your documents!</strong> 
<p>
Updating is particularly important when the
file contains information such as a weekly schedule or 
a deadline for a program funding announcement. 
Remove out-of-date files or note why something that
appears dated is still on a server (e.g., the program requirements will remain
the same for the next cycle so the file is still available as an interim reference).
<p>
<h4>Browsers Differ</h4>
Web browsers display HTML elements differently. 
Remember that not all codes used in HTML files are interpreted by all
browsers. Any code a browser does not understand is usually ignored though.
<p>
You could spend a lot of time making your file "look perfect" using your
current browser. If you check that file using another browser, it will likely
display (a little or a lot) differently. Hence these words of 
advice: code your files using 
correct HTML. Leave the interpreting to the browsers and hope for the best.


<h3><a Name="CO">Commenting Your Files</a></h3>
You might want to include comments in your HTML files. Comments in HTML are like
comments in a computer program--the text you enter is not used by the browser in
any formatting and is not directly viewable by the reader just as computer
program comments are not used and are not viewable. The comments are accessible
if a reader views the source file, however.
<p>
Comments such as the name of the person updating a file, the software
and version used in creating a file, or the date that a minor edit was 
made are the norm.
<p>
To include a comment, enter:
<pre>
    &lt;!-- <var>your comments here</var> --&gt;
</pre>
You must include the exclamation mark and the hyphens as shown.
