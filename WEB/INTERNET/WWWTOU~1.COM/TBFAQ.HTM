<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>FREQUENTLY&nbsp;ASKED&nbsp;QUESTIONS</H1>

<CENTER><P><I>Actually, people don't ask these questions. <BR>
But vain fellows that we are, we figured you should know all this stuff.
<BR>
So just read it.</I></P></CENTER>

<H3>WHAT *IS* TOURBUS?</H3>

<P>TOURBUS is a free, on-going, semi-weekly, text-based tour of some of
the neatest sites on the Internet. The TOURBUS posts are written by Bob
Rankin and Patrick Douglas Crispen, and are distributed via the LISTSERV
server at America Online. </P>

<P>What makes TOURBUS unique is that each TOURBUS post not only gives you
the addresses of neat Internet sites, it also gives you a really in-depth
look at how to fully use those sites. Surf the Net for any amount of time,
and you will soon discover that many of the Internet's most exciting sites
do not come with instruction manuals. TOURBUS helps you overcome that problem.
</P>

<P>We also try to make each TOURBUS post as conversational -- and humorous
-- as possible. Above everything else, the Internet is FUN ... and we try
to show that in our TOURBUS posts. :-) </P>

<H3>HOW MUCH DOES TOURBUS COST?</H3>

<P>Nothing. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. </P>

<P>TOURBUS is absolutely free. All of the costs associated with running
the TOURBUS list are paid by our sponsors (and by Bob and Patrick). </P>

<H3>IS THERE AN ARCHIVE OF PAST TOURBUS POSTS? </H3>

<P>Yep! You can find the TOURBUS archives and other TOURBUS stuff at the
TOURBUS homepage at <A HREF="INDEX.HTM" tppabs="http://www.tourbus.com/">http://www.TOURBUS.com.</A></P>

<H3>HEY! THAT'S A WEB ADDRESS! I DON'T HAVE A WEB BROWSER!!</H3>

<P>Don't panic! You can still access the TOURBUS homepage (and, for that
matter, ANY other Web page) through e-mail using the information contained
in Bob Rankin's free guide &quot;Accessing the Internet by E-mail.&quot;
To find out how to get this guide (and how you can still participate in
theROADMAP Internet training workshop), send an e-mail letter to <A HREF="mailto:LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU">LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU</A>
</P>

<P>(that's &quot;you-aye-won-vee-em&quot;) with the command </P>

<PRE>     GET NEWUSER PACKAGE F=MAIL
</PRE>

<P>in the body of your e-mail letter. </P>

<H3>WHEN ARE THE TOURBUS POSTS DISTRIBUTED?</H3>

<P>Its kind of hard to say. TOURBUS is, for the most part, distributed
every Tuesday-ish and Thursday-ish. </P>

<H3>ISH?</H3>

<P>Well, sometimes we are a little late in getting these posts out. If
you want to be technical (or at least &quot;statistical&quot;), I guess
you could say that TOURBUS has a probability distribution centered around
Tuesday and Thursday, with a standard deviation of a day or two. :) </P>

<H3>HOW CAN MY FRIENDS SUBSCRIBE TO TOURBUS? </H3>

<P>Just have them send an e-mail letter to <A HREF="mailto:LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM">LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM</A>
</P>

<P>with the command </P>

<PRE>     SUBSCRIBE TOURBUS YOURFIRSTNAME YOURLASTNAME
</PRE>

<P>in the body of their letter, replacing YOURFIRSTNAME and YOURLASTNAME
with their first and last names. </P>

<H3>WHERE DO YOU AND BOB GET YOUR IDEAS FOR THE TOURBUS STOPS? </H3>

<P>We do receive a lot of suggestions from the TOURBUS riders (like &quot;get
a life&quot;), but most of the sites that we write about are sites that
we accidentally find while surfing the Net. :) </P>

<H3>HOW DID PATRICK CRISPEN AND BOB RANKIN MEET? </H3>

<P>Well, actually, we've never met. </P>

<P>We knew each other from the NETTRAIN list, and have exchanged hundreds
of e-mails (and about five phone calls) over the past couple years. </P>

<P>Bob contacted Patrick shortly after the end of the last Roadmap workshop
with the idea of creating a sponsor-supported, two or three week workshop
of neat Internet sites. Patrick suggested that the workshop be an on-going
thing ... and the rest, as they say, is history. :) </P>

<H3>PATRICK KEEPS MENTIONING &quot;SQUIRRELS&quot; IN HIS POSTS - WHAT'S
THE STORY? </H3>

<P>The &quot;squirrel story&quot; comes from the fact that the squirrels
living in the trees on the campus of the University of Alabama have developed
quite a taste for power lines ... especially for the power lines leading
into the University's mainframe computer center (if you are not electrically
inclined, let's jusy say that energetic squirrels and power lines do not
mix well). </P>

<P>Back when Patrick was running the Roadmap workshop (that online Internet
training thingy in 1994), he was really concerned that if the University
of Alabama's mainframe was taken down by a squirrel (which was a regular
occurrence at the time) and he was not able to deliver that day's Roadmap
lesson to the 64,000 people in the workshop, the workshop participants
would panic and mailbomb him with 64,000 &quot;where is today's lesson?&quot;
messages. </P>

<P>By telling the subscribers up front to expect a squirrel attack, he
kept himself from being mailbombed, elevated Alabama's squirrels to Net-legend
status (people around the world were even rooting for the squirrels), and
gained a really neat &quot;trademark.&quot; </P>

<H3>WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR SOUTHERN WORDS OF THE DAY? </H3>

<P>The TOURBUS subscribers send them in to Patrick. </P>

<H3>IS THERE AN ARCHIVE WHEN I CAN FIND ALL OF THE OLD SOUTHERN WORDS OF
THE DAY? </H3>

<P>Yep! Just point your web browser to <A HREF="../TPPMSGS/MSGS15.HTM#1587" tppabs="http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/word.html">http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/word.html</A>
</P>

<P>A couple of alert TOURBUS readers have informed us that you can also
find a couple Southern Word dictionaries in your local bookstore: </P>
