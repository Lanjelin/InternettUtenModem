Your fearless bus driver is not so fearless any more.

Back on August 15th we pulled our little bus of Internet happiness into
"Mercury Mail," a free e-mail based news, sports, entertainment, and
weather service (to see any of my old TOURBUS posts just visit the TOURBUS
archives at http://www.worldvillage.com/tourbus.htm).  Well, I decided to
subscribe to Mercury Mail's "WeatherVane" service (weather@merc.com), and I
received the following weather forecast this morning:

Forecast for Tuscaloosa, AL
Conditions from Tuscaloosa, AL at 6:52 AM EDT
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOW:    68 F and Fog                      Pressure 757.94 mm Hg   |

Thunder sun?  THUNDER SUN?!  Folks, I have no idea what "thunder sun" is,
but I can tell you that the mere thought of thunder sun has convinced your
normally fearless bus driver to spend the next three days in bed, hiding
under my blanket. :)

Actually, before I dive for the safety of my blanket I need to tell y'all
that there has been a pretty major shake-up with the Web service at the
University of Alabama.  In particular, all of the addresses for my Web
pages have changed (from "www.ua.edu" to "ua1vm.ua.edu" -- that's
"you-ay-won-vee-em").  Here are the new Web addresses for some of my most
popular Web pages:

   My Personal Homepage      http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/
   The Southern Word Page    http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/word.html
   The Roadmap96 Homepage    http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/roadmap.html
   My Cookie Recipe Page     http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/cookie.html

With that said, let's pay some bills  ...

INSTANT WEATHER
---------------

If you are interested in seeing if the "thunder sun" phenomenon is headed
to your neck of the woods, you probably will want to take advantage of one
of the Net's free instant weather services.

For those of you in the US, you can get free, instant weather reports via
e-mail from Mercury Mail by sending an e-mail letter to

     instantwv@merc.com

with an airport code, zip code, or the city and state of a particular city
in the SUBJECT line of your e-mail letter.  (I tried to get the forecast
for Berlin -- airport code "BER" -- and Mercury Mail sent me a rather weird
looking error report).

If you are not in the US, however, I am happy to announce that the nice
folks at Yahoo! have an absolutely incredible instant weather service on
the Web at

     http://www.wni.com/yahoo/

You can get weather reports by entering the city name or airport code, and
Yahoo's weather service includes pretty much every major city in the world.
:)


NEWS.COM
--------

Keeping up with the latest technology news can be a full-time job.
Fortunately, the folks at CNet have created "news.com," the first online
service devoted entirely to technology news.

We're going to visit CNet in our next two tours (Bob is taking next week
off, so I will be writing both posts), but you can access CNet's "news.com"
site on the Web at

     http://www.news.com/

CNet's news.com site has 9 sections:

     Front Page (breaking news)
     The Net
     Computing
     Intranets
     Business
     Perspectives (Editorials)
     Newsmakers
     Rumor Mill

Remember, though, that news.com only covers technology.  If you are
interested in finding out things like the latest shake-up at Sybase or the
release date for Netscape Navigator 4.0 beta, this site is for you.

For those of you who only have e-mail access to the Net, I haven't
forgotten you.  The nice folks at news.com also publish a weekly, e-mail
based newsletter called "News-Dispatch" which gives you the latest
technology news.  To subscribe to News-Dispatch, just send an e-mail letter
to

     listserve@dispatch.cnet.com

with the command

     subscribe news-dispatch YOURFIRSTNAME YOURLASTNAME

in the body of your e-mail letter, replacing YOURFIRSTNAME and YOURLASTNAME
with your first and last names.

That's about it for today.  Have a safe and happy weekend, and watch out
for thunder sun!
