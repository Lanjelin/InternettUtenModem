           TODAY'S TOURBUS TOPIC: Be My (Virtual) Valentine

Welcome back to another week on the World's Largest Bus!  Today, we're
going to visit a couple of Valentine's Day hotspots on the Web, and be
sure to read my personal note at the close of this message.  But before
we begin, be sure to check out the great magazine deals offered by our
long-time sponsor Magazine Express.

The virtual proprietors at the Centre for the Easily Amused believe in
true love, destiny, & finding the perfect lifelong partner.  They'd
better - because Cathie and Brian are engaged to be married...

A few months ago, the Bus pulled into the C*E*A, which exists solely to
highlight all the fun and amusing ways to waste time on the Net while
you should probably be doing something else.  But there's something new
at the C*E*A that was fitting for this week, so let's pay a visit to:

Virtual Valentine at http://www.amused.com
------------------------------------------

In their annual tribute to love, hearts, flowers and all that sort of
stuff, the Virtual Valentine offers four musical selections for your
enjoyment.  Whether you're floating around in an endorphin-induced
stupor, or you've vowed never to fall in love again, you'll get a
hearty chortle out of this.

What makes it fun is that they've interspersed links to their favorite
amusing sites in the lyrics to these "classic" love songs.  And to
enhance your enjoyment of this site, just imagine our lovelorn co-driver
Patrick singing this little ditty to a Miss Piggy poster...

                  Why do birds suddenly appear
                    Every time you are near?
                 Just like me, they long to be
                         Close to you.

              Why do stars fall down from the sky
                     Every time you walk by?
                  Just like me, they long to be
                         Close to you.

...while you happily click on the word "birds" and find yourself
transported to York University's "Find The Duck" web page.  Or
click on "time" and get a chuckle at John's World Wide Waste of
Time page.

They've also got the lyrics to "Love Hurts", "I Love You (But You're
Boring)", and "When I'm Back On My Feet Again", replete with similarly
silly links.  It's a lot of fun - check it out.

Net Valentine - http://www.netvalentine.com/
--------------------------------------------

Here's a fun site devoted to electronic romance, where you can send a
multi-media greeting to your sweetheart in the form of a digital
Valentine's card.  You can preview the cards online and then send ask
Cupid to send his arrows straight to the intended's inbox by e-mail.

What the recipient actually gets is an e-mail saying that there is a
Net Valentine waiting for him or her at a certain web address.  Your
sweetie will have to launch a web browser to see it.

These digital card thingies are quite popular during holiday times, so
if you have trouble getting through to this site, go to www.Yahoo.com
and search for "valentine card" to get the address of similar sites.

Digital greetings cards are fun, but I'm still hoping for something
made of red construction paper, doilies and way too much glue from my
daughters this Friday.  :-)

A Personal Message From The Bus Driver
--------------------------------------

Ever hear the saying "Don't quit your day job?"  Well I've decided to
reject conventional wisdom and do exactly that.  Yesterday I turned in
my IBM badge and have officially joined the ranks of the "gainfully
unemployed" - or rather self-employed.

Thanks to a series of events over the last two years that I can only
attribute to Providential Intervention, I can now work at home in my
underwear.  I'll be keeping busy writing for a variety of Internet and
computer publications, working on three new books, and of course I'll
be driving the Bus!

Now that I'm on the outside, I realize what a Culture of Fear I lived
in for thirteen years.  So my words of advice: If you're in the corporate
jungle with a skill that can be marketed and a dream to fly solo - go
for it!  It might mean staying up late and having basically no life for
a while, but the rewards are worth it.

I'm thankful to all the TOURBUS riders who have supported our sponsors
and bought my book (see below) to help make this possible for me.  It's
a little scary, but certainly fun and exciting to be on my own.
