TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP:Happy New Year 1997!</h2>

<p>
Happy New Year to All!
<p>
Thanks for riding along with us.  Patrick and I have truly enjoyed
"driving the Bus" for the last 18 months, and I look forward to
another year with all of you.
<p>
<h3>Get A Friend on the Bus!</h3>
We now have over 80,000 riders in 120 countries all around the
world, from Albania to Zimbabwe.  Your mission for the new year is
to get three friends "on the Bus".  Tell 'em how much fun you're
having here and they'll beg you for the subscription info!  In case
you forgot, in order to join the list one must send e-mail to:
<p>
    LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM
<p>
and in the body of the message, enter this command:
<p>
    SUBSCRIBE TOURBUS Firstname Lastname
<p>
<h3>Ride The Bus, Get Stuff</h3>
Here's another reason to get your friends on the Bus...  They'll have
a chance to participate in fun contests and win geeky stuff - like
computer software, hardware and other cool gadgets.
<p>
I haven't decided whether you have to be smart, lucky or good-looking
to win, so just keep your seats and all will be revealed in good time.
<p>

<h3>Thanks to Our Supporters</h3>
It takes hours of research, writing and administrivia to keep TOURBUS
rolling through cyberspace twice each week.  So without our sponsors
it would be impossible to continue -- Patrick has tuition to pay, and
I've got to support my Snickers habit (and pay the mortgage).
<p>
