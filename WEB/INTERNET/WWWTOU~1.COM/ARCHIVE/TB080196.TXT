Howdy, y'all!  Seeing as how our little, 50,000 passenger bus of Internet
happiness recently celebrated its first birthday ("happy birthday to us
..."), I guess now would be as good a time as any to remind you of where
you can find the wonderful TOURBUS archives.  If you have lost any of the
TOURBUS posts that Bob and I have written during the past twelve months, or
if you just recently joined us and want to find a guide to a whole bunch of
neat Internet sites, pop on over to the TOURBUS archives at

     http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/hotel/tourbus/archives.htm

And, while your at it, you might also want to say hello to the folks who
are making today's TOURBUS possible (I wonder if they have any gourmet
ramen noodles?) ...

One of the things that Bob and I try to do every now and then is give you a
sneak peek at some really cool Internet sites before they become popular.
Today's TOURBUS stops are perfect examples of this.

If you are going to miss the Olympics when they end this weekend, just
remember that there are only 555 days until the opening ceremonies of 1998
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan; only 1506 days to the start of the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia; and only 2018 days until the start of
the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Now, doesn't that make
you feel better? :P

Before I get flooded with mail from TOURBUS riders begging me to "get a
life," I have to tell you that I did not actually figure out the "days
remaining" numbers myself.  They came from the International Olympic
Committee's homepage at

     http://www.olympic.org/

At the bottom of the IOC's page are "counters" which count down the number
of days before each city's games.  The counters are also links to pages
with more information about each upcoming Olympic game.  For example, if
you click on the "Sydney 2000" counter, you will be taken to a page that
gives you some more information about the Sydney games.

By the way, if you want to visit the "official" homepages for each of the
upcoming Olympic games, here are the addresses that you need to check out:

     Nagano 1998
     http://www.linc.or.jp/Nagano/
     (I think this is official -- it *looks* official -- but I am not
     sure)

     Sydney 2000
     http://www.sydney.olympic.org/
     (Did you know that Sydney's Games will be from *SEPTEMBER* 15 to
     October 1?  I think that's cool!)

     Salt Lake City 2002
     http://www.slc2002.org/

Most of these homepages are still in the larval stage -- all of the folks
associated with these games are still partying in Atlanta -- but you might
want to pay another visit to these sites in a few months just to see what
changes have been made.

The kind folks at Yahoo! have also set up a special page for all of the
upcoming Olympic Games at

     http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Sports/Olympic_Games/

This page is also in the larval stage -- there are 299 links on the page
for Atlanta 96 but only 3 for Sydney 2000 -- but there is still some really
cool information on this page.  For example, this page has links to Cape
Town's and Rio de Janeiro's bids for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games as well
as a link to Pittsburgh's bid for the 2012 Summer Games (YEA PITTSBURGH!
Although, to be honest, don't you think that the lines at Eat-N-Park are
long enough already?).

That's about it for this week.  Thank you for joining me on this tour, and
I will see you next week! :)
