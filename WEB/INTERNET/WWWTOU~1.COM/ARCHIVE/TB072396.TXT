TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP    : Internet Information Center
TODAY'S TOURBUS ADDRESS : http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/

Welcome back to another week, or should I say another year, of TOURBUS!
Can you believe the Bus first pulled out of that big garage in cyberspace
on July 20th, 1995?  We've grown from just 3000 riders to an audience of
over 50,000 in 110 countries worldwide.  Thanks for riding with us, and
also a special word of thanks to all of our sponsors!

You know, I get a couple of e-mails each time a Bus rolls out which if I
may paraphrase, go something like this:  "What the heck is all this
Internet stuff, anyway... And where's the bathroom???"

So a little bit of background seems in order from time to time.  With that
in mind, I've invited 23-year old Christian Feichtner, a computer science
student from Austria to tell us about the really cool site he's created for
Internet beginners.  So heeeeeeeere's Christian!

A Little Cookie With Your Chips, Sir?
-------------------------------------

"If you think a Backbone has something to do with your body or a Cookie
 is something to eat, then you should get onboard the Tourbus and let it
 take you to this week's stop, the Internet Information Center.

 While browsing the many documents at the IIC you will find out that the
 Internet has much more to offer than a point-and-click interface (you
 know the little constructions spiders make).

 You will find references and how to's for the most popular services.  If
 you want to chat with people all over the world about useful (or useless)
 topics, you'll find everything you need in the IRC guide (addiction
 guaranteed).


 Confused by mailing lists?  No problem - the IIC will show you how to
 use e-mail and how to participate in mailing lists (like the fantastic
 Tourbus). All these guides can be found in the "How To" section of the IIC.
     See http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/HowTo.html

 Beware The Torch
 ----------------

 If you've been wondering how all the data sent over the 'Net reaches it's
 destination, then the "Net Introduction" is your place to go.  This
 section also outlines the do's and don'ts of electronic communication
 and how to avoid being flamed.
     See http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/NetIntro.html

 "Flamed???  Does it hurt much?"  Find out in the IIC's rich glossary of
 Internet related terms.  If you still can't get enough then point your
 browser to the "Additional Information and Reference" section.  There's
 a smiley directory, a list of domains and selected starting points,
 Software, Search Engines, Parental Software and more!
     See http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/MoreInfo.html

 The IIC also has a mirror of an excellent guide, how to use the Internet
 using an e-mail only connection (that makes the IIC a real complete
 reference).  The site is updated continously with new information and new
 terms for the Internet glossary.  So come often and come early to the
 Internet Information Center!"
