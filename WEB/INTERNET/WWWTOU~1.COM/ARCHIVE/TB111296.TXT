           TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: Remind U-Mail

(--- A hiss comes on over the TOURBUS radio, and the Driver's  ---)
(--- face appears in the mirror of the World's Largest Bus...  ---)

      Hey you in the back of the bus... Yeah, that's right - I'm
     talking to you.  Your wife just called and said you forgot her
      birthday yesterday.  Major Blunder, report to the doghouse!!

As I use computers more and more in the course of my daily affairs, it
seems that my own brain is becoming incapable of simple tasks like
addition, subtraction and remembering where I left my hastily scribbled
to-do list.

So today the Bus will pull in to a truly useful site called Remind U-Mail
that combines the power of the web with e-mail to ensure that you'll
never again miss an appointment, birthday or other important event.

And speaking of birthdays, you should get the scoop from today's sponsor.
Magazine Express has special deals for TOURBUS riders that can solve your
gift giving problems in a totally digital fashion!

 +--------- WANT TO PICK FROM 40 FREE MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS? ----------+
   Then get the Fall & Holiday TOURBUS HOT SHEET from Magazine Express.
  The magazine deals are white-hot, with many under $12 per year.  Plus,
     Dr. Bob's "Internet Goodies" is still FREE.  Send e-mail now to:
 +--------------------- ( tourbus@magazines.com ) ----------------------+


REMIND U-MAIL at http://calendar.stwing.upenn.edu
-------------------------------------------------

...is a free on-line calendar.  Yup, you can actually enter all your
appointments on a personalized monthly calendar, right on the Web!

Your calendar is never more than a few clicks away if you keep it online
with Remind U-Mail.  Just pop in with your web browser and you can view,
update or modify your calendar.

No more little black book.  No more forgetting where you put that little
black book.  Just bookmark your digital Web-Calendar and it's accessible
whether you're at home or on the road.  You can even share a calendar
with family, friends, or co-workers.

"Wow, that's pretty cool.  It doesn't get any better than this!"
----------------------------------------------------------------

Bzzzt, wrong answer.  That's only half of the coolness.  A free e-mail
reminder sevice makes Remind U-Mail even better by sending you e-mail
messages on or before the scheduled events.

This little electronic poke in the ribs can be set up as a one-time
event or an annual reminder for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.

How Does It Work?
-----------------

Step 1: Visit REMIND U-MAIL at http://calendar.stwing.upenn.edu
Step 2: Click on the "Sign Me Up!" link, then enter your name,
        e-mail address and time zone on the form.
Step 3: Check your e-mail for your REMIND U-MAIL username & password.
Step 4: Back at the main page, click "Members", then enter your username
        and password to access your calendar.

Come back often to update or consult your calendar, because the system
will automatically delete any calendars that have not been accessed for
two weeks.

What Do I Need To Use the Web-Calendar?
---------------------------------------

1) A valid e-mail address
2) A tables-capable browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer, Mosaic, and
   AOL's Version 3 software will all work fine.)

Sorry, there's no apparent way to create or manage your calendar using
only e-mail.

Is It Really Free?
------------------

Yep, totally free.  The author, Blake David Mills IV is a student at the
University of Pennsylvania who says: "This is a free service I'm working
on in my spare time. I originally wrote it for my own personal use, but
decided others might find it useful as well."  What a guy!

 +----------------------------- DIGITIZE IT! -------------------------+
    Send your photos to PixPro for high-quality color scanning, and
  get an image to dress up your Web site or documents. Mention TOURBUS
  for 20% off first order.  Come visit the free Pixel Pop Art Gallery!

Remind U-Mail was a "Yahoo Pick of the Week" recently, so it's likely to
become a popular service.  Enjoy!  --Bob
