           TODAY'S TOURBUS TOPIC: SEARCHING LIST ARCHIVES

Howdy all - today we're going to cover the new SEARCH feature in the
LISTSERV software, which can help you locate individual postings
stored in the archives of mailing lists.  But first, a word from one
of the sponsors that keep the Bus rolling...

Desperately Seeking Something?
------------------------------

Maybe LISTSERV can help.  The new SEARCH feature in version 1.8c of the
LISTSERV software (the system that manages TOURBUS and hundreds of other
mailing lists) lets you search the archives of a mailing list using
keywords.

I get quite a few questions from TOURBUS riders asking "Can you please
resend me the TOURBUS where you mentioned <whatever> ?"  Now I can tell
them to send a message like this:

   SEARCH <keywords> IN <listname>

to LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM - and they'll be able to find it themselves.
Here's what you'll get back if you try "SEARCH BIRDS IN TOURBUS"

  > search birds in tourbus
  -> 2 matches.

  Item #   Date   Time  Recs   Subject
  ------   ----   ----  ----   -------
  000009 95/09/12 01:03  492   Wheelin' and Dealin'
  000149 97/01/14 01:45  139   TOURBUS - 14 Jan 1997 - Do Birds Have Lips?

  To order a copy of these postings, send the following command:

                      GETPOST TOURBUS 9 149

  >>> Item #9 (12 Sep 1995 01:03) - Wheelin' and Dealin'
  And so, without further ado, let's take a cruise through the wires and see
  what we can find about cats, dogs, gerbils, snakes, hampsters, birds, and
                                                                 ^^^^^
  just about any other pet you might have.

  rec.pets.birds          The culture and care of indoor birds.
           ^^^^^
  rec.pets.cats           Discussion about domestic cats.

  >>> Item #149 (14 Jan 1997 01:45) - TOURBUS - 14 Jan 1997 - Do Birds Have Lips?
  From:         Bob Rankin <bobrankin@MHV.NET>
  Subject:      TOURBUS - 14 Jan 1997 - Do Birds Have Lips?
                                           ^^^^^
You can see there were two postings that contained the word "birds", one
in September '95 and one in January '97.  LISTSERV gives you the matching
lines (with a little context) from those two postings and tells you how
to order the full text if you wish.  (The GETPOST command should be sent
to the same LISTSERV address as the SEARCH command.)


Can I Search Other List Archives?
---------------------------------

Of course you're not limited to searches in the TOURBUS list.  You can
search the archives of any LISTSERV-based list that is running on a
server using LISTSERV 1.8c (and some other LISTSERVs running on IBM
mainframes).

If you don't know where to start your search, I suggest you visit the
L-Soft site at http://www.lsoft.com, use CATALIST to search the
catalog of lists to find one or more that suit your needs, and then
send the SEARCH command to the LISTSERV site that hosts that list.

Another way to find lists is to send e-mail to "liszter@bluemarble.net"
with the command

   search "whatever"

in the BODY if the message.  (But don't confuse this "search" command
with the LISTSERV one - this one finds LISTS, the other finds postings.)

For example, if you find a mailing list called CLOWNS which is run by
LISTSERV@CIRCUS.COM, then you might want to send the command:

   SEARCH emmet kelly IN CLOWNS

to LISTSERV@CIRCUS.COM - but don't try this one, I just made it up.  Do
keep in mind that not all LISTSERV sites will accept the SEARCH command
yet, but over the course of time most will.


Stupid Computer Joke of the Week
--------------------------------

  * Remember, 640k is 4480k on FidoNet - they use dog bytes.

Okay, I can hear the groans.  Well send me some of YOUR stupid computer
jokes and I'll print them here!

See you next time.  --Bob
