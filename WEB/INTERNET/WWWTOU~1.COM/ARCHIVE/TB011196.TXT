TOURBUS - THURSDAY, JANUARY 11
TODAY'S STOP: SOME MORE NEAT E-MAIL LISTS

Before we get too far into today's TOURBUS stops, I have a
couple of quick "excursions" that you might also want to check
out.  If you are a fan of the Southern words of the day -- and
who isn't? -- I strongly recommend that you bop on over to the
Southern Word homepage at

     http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/word.html

This page is a HUGE archive of every Southern word that has
ever appeared on TOURBUS (thanks to the help of Hungarian
TOURBUS rider Valas Gyorgy).

Also, if you are interested in learning more about the
parental units that spawned me (and isn't THAT a graphic
image?), you should visit the Crispen family's homepage at

     http://hiwaay.net/~crispen/

... and I am not just saying this because my parents gave
me their bank card :)

Talking about neat stuff to check out, here is a quick message
from the folks that are making today's TOURBUS post possible:

A few weeks ago, Bob announced that TOURBUS is the fourth most
popular LISTSERV list in the world ("we're number 4! we're
number 4!").  If you aren't quite sure what a LISTSERV list
is, you probably should check out Roadmap lesson 5 (LISTSERVS)
by sending an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU

(that's "you-aye-won-vee-em") with the command

     GET MAP05 LESSON F=MAIL

in the body of your e-mail letter.

Anyway, back to being number 4.  Here is the list of the four
largest LISTSERV lists in the world (as of a few minutes ago):

     RANK  LISTNAME      SUBSCRIBERS

     1.    WSJ-ANNOUNCE  110,095
     2.    TOPTEN        96,744
     3.    TIDBITS       31,018
     4.    TOURBUS       23,363


Let's take a quick look at each of these lists, including how
you can subscribe to each of them (gee, just what you need ...
MORE e-mail!).


WSJ-ANNOUNCE
============

Explaining the WSJ-ANNOUNCE list is going to be a tad bit difficult.

The Wall Street Journal has an online service called "Money & Investing
Update."  According to their Web page, "Money & Investing update
features continually updated coverage of global markets and the
top stories in business and finance world-wide, drawing on news and
information from The Wall Street Journal, The Asian Wall Street
Journal, The Wall Street Journal Europe and Dow Jones newswires."

Money & Investing Update is a free subscription servive ... but here
is the bad news: the Update is only available through the Web,
and you have to have a forms-capable Web browser (like Netscape)
to access it.

So what is the WSJ-ANNOUNCE list for?  Well, it is a way for
the folks at the Wall Street Journal to tell the Money & Investing
Update subscribers about changes to the Update service.  The only
way that you can subscribe to WSJ-ANNOUNCE is to subscribe to the
Money & Investing Update by visiting the Update's homepage at

     http://update.wsj.com/

Once you are at this page, click on the words "Free Subscription"
in the bottom left-hand corner of the page.  This will take you
to the subscription page (whick is why I said that you need a
forms-capable Web browser).  As long as the "Yes, I want to receive
e-mail when new features are added" box on the subscription page
is checked, you will automatically be subscribed to WSJ-ANNOUNCE
when you subscribe to Money & Investing Update.


TOPTEN
======

This is probably my favorite e-mail list (when it is working).
TOPTEN is the e-mail distribution list for David Letterman's
Top Ten lists.

For those of you who may not be in the states, David Letterman
is the host of "The Late Show," a nightly, hour-long talk show
on CBS.  As a part of each of his shows, Letterman reads a
Top Ten list (like "Top Ten Signs You Bought a Bad Computer").
Each Top Ten list is made up of funny responses to that night's
list's topic (like "2. While running, it emits deafening
calliope music").

After each night's Late Show, the folks at the TOPTEN list
(with Mr. Letterman's permission, of course) copy that evening's
Top Ten list and email it to the people subscribed to the TOPTEN
list.  In other words, the volume of mail on this list is
pretty light ... just one letter each night.

There is some bad news, though.  Because of some problems at
the TOPTEN list's LISTSERV site, the TOPTEN list is not currently
sending out any new Top Ten lists.  I have been told, however, that
TOPTEN is still accepting subscriptions and hopes to be back delivering
Top Ten lists to its subscribers quite soon.

To subscribe to TOPTEN (for free, of course), just send an e-mail
letter to

     LISTSERV@LISTSERV.CLARK.NET

with the command

     SUBSCRIBE TOPTEN YOURFIRSTNAME YOURLASTNAME

in the body of your e-mail letter, replacing YOURFIRSTNAME and
YOURLASTNAME with your first and last names.


TidBITS
=======

As a Macintosh user, it does my heart proud to see that TidBITS
has so many subscribers.  "TidBITS is a free weekly electronic
publication that reports on interesting products and events in
the computer industry, currently with an emphasis on the world
of the Macintosh."

If you are a serious Web-head, you can visit the TidBITS homepage at

     http://www.dartmouth.edu/pages/TidBITS/TidBITS.html

or you can subscribe to TidBITS (for free) through e-mail by sending
an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@RICEVM1.RICE.EDU

with the command

     SUBSCRIBE TIDBITS YOURFIRSTNAME YOURLASTNAME

in the body of your e-mail letter, replacing YOURFIRSTNAME and
YOURLASTNAME with your first and last names.


TOURBUS
=======

That's us :)

By the way, some of you may have noticed that there is a difference
between the number of people who are subscribed to TOURBUS through
the LISTSERV (23,000) and the number of people that actually receive
each TOURBUS post (42,500).  This is because some of our subscribers
have asked for our permission to redistribute TOURBUS to their
friends and coworkers :)


SOME FINAL THOUGHTS
===================

While TOURBUS may not be the biggest LISTSERV list around,
I am willing to bet that our subscribers could beat up any
other list's subscribers ... and we're much better looking too
(except, of course, for Bob).

Oh ... one last thing: for those of you who have access to
CU-SEEME (Cornell University's audio/visual networking software),
you can probably find me lurking on CU-SEEME throughout the day
(8:00 AM to 4:45 PM CST) at either 158.36.33.3 or 128.171.171.10
