TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP    : @LANTA 96!
TODAY'S TOURBUS ADDRESS : http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/
                          http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/news/
                          http://www.olympic.nbc.com/

     "Which would you rather be -- a victor in the Olympic games,
                   or the announcer of the victor?"
               From Plutarch, Apothegems, Themistocles

I'd rather be the announcer.  At least the announcer's booth is air
conditioned.  :)

As millions of people descend upon @lanta (get it?) for tomorrow's start of
the Olympic games -- and as these millions of people suddenly realize that
Hot-lanta is only two inches away from the surface of the Sun -- smart
people like you and me are going to be sitting in our air-conditioned homes
watching the Olympics on TV.

Unfortunately, not everyone can afford to take 16 days off to watch every
minute of Olympic coverage.  That's where today's TOURBUS comes in.  Today
we are going to pull our little bus of Internet happiness over at a couple
of the best Olympic sites online.  These sites should help you get your
daily Olympics "fix" while you are at work or at school.

Before we start today's tour, however, let's pay a few bills ...

THE OLYMPICS ON THE WEB
-----------------------

Thanks to the kind folks at IBM, the Centennial Olympic Games has an
official homepage on the World Wide Web at

     http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/

This homepage is probably the first place you should look for the latest
information about, and results from, the Olympics.  During the Games, the
information on this page is going to be updated more times than you could
ever possible imagine!

My favorite part of the Olympic homepage is the "Hot News" section which
you can reach by clicking on the "Hot News" icon or by pointing your Web
browser directly to

     http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/news/

This page is *THE* source for official Olympic results, announcements,
press releases, and statements.  For example, I am sure that a couple of
you are wondering how the recent TWA incident (if you haven't heard, a TWA
747-100 bound for Paris exploded off the New York coast last night) affects
the security of the Games.  Well, thanks to the "news" page, I found the
official Olympic response:

     (Atlanta, GA) --The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
     (ACOG) has received several inquiries regarding whether
     security policies for the 1996 Olympic Games will be changed
     following last night's TWA accident.

     ACOG believes that its security team, along with the various
     federal, state and local law enforcement agencies has put in
     place a strong security program that will ensure the safety of
     Olympic visitors. However, ACOG will continue to monitor the
     situation.


NBC
---

Stateside television coverage of the Olympic games will be handled by the
NBC television network.  Accordingly, NBC has set up their own Olympics
site at

     http://www.olympic.nbc.com/

This is actually a *really* nice site.  The NBC Olympic site has a whole
bunch of neat sections, such as

     - Day-by-Day/ Hour-by-Hour -- Live daily reports from the front
       line of the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta.

     - The Latest -- Daily Olympic news summaries from wire services .

     - Interactive Poll  -- A daily, online poll on the most
       intriguing Olympic issues.

Again, once the Games start tomorrow, look for this page to be updated
several times a day.


F@n M@ail
---------

Want to drop a line to your favorite Olympians?  Check out IBM's "F@n
M@ail" service at

     http://www.fanmail.olympic.ibm.com/

This site lets you send messages to your favorite Olympic athlete, to your
favorite Olympic team, or even to every single Olympian in Hot-lanta.  The
F@n M@ail page also has links to several of the athletes' personal
homepages (just click on the words "Web pages that you can check out") and
new personal Web pages are appearing every hour!


Yahoo's Olympic Scorecard
-------------------------

If you have been on the bus for a while, you will have probably noticed my
strong bias towards Yahoo!  Well, not wanting to break a trend, one of the
best "news" pages devoted solely to the Olympics can be found at

     http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/

This page is set up a little like a "My Yahoo!" page with the news on the
right hand side of the page, but the page also has links to information
about every sport at the Olympics as well as to the medal counts and
schedules.

That's it for today!  Have a safe and happy weekend!
