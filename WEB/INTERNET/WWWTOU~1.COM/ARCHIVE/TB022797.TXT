DEBUNKING SOME MORE MYTHS AND URBAN LEGENDS
-------------------------------------------

With all of the chain letters and urban legends that are floating around
the Internet, most people's e-mail boxes are starting to look like war
zones.  Well, your fearless bus driver is about to give you some ammunition
to help you in this battle.

We've talked about this a lot recently, but today's TOURBUS post is going
to explain the *truth* behind a lot of the Internet's biggest urban legends
and hoaxes.  My hope is that today's post will give you enough information
to help you make an informed response the next time someone sends you an
urban legend.

In short, I hope that you will repost the information in this letter
whenever and wherever you feel it to be necessary and relevant.  If you do
repost any of this information, however, I have two small requests:

     1. Give credit where credit is due; and

     2. Please include TOURBUS' subscription information (the stuff at
        the bottom of today's post) at the bottom of the stuff that
        you redistribute.

With that said, let's start with the biggest urban legend of them all ...


THE FATHER OF ALL INTERNET URBAN LEGENDS
----------------------------------------

If you have been a TOURBUS rider for any amount of time, you'll know that
one of the worst urban legends floating around the Net is the story about
Craig Shergold:

     Craig Shergold is seven years old and suffering from terminal
     cancer. It is his ambition to be included in the Guinness Book of
     Records for the largest number of business cards ever collected
     by one person...

     [Quoted from http://www.legends.org.za/arthur/craig01b.htm]

What the "Craig letter" does not tell you is that Craig is alive and well,
he's cured, he's now well into his teens, he made it into the Guinness Book
of Records years ago, Guinness has retired the "most cards" category, and
HE DOESN'T WANT ANY MORE BLOODY CARDS!

A few years ago, someone thought it would be funny to change the Craig
letter a little so that the letter now requests that you send your cards to
the Make-A-Wish foundation (instead of to Craig's home in England).  Here
is what the Make-A-Wish foundation has to say about that:

     "The chain letter claims that Make-A-Wish is involved," stated
     James E. Gordon, Chairman of the Board of the Make-A-Wish
     Foundation of America. "That is not true. Our organization is
     not, and has never been associated with the letter. The Make-A-Wish
     Foundation requests that people please stop sending business cards
     or greeting cards to Craig Shergold."

     [Quoted from http://www.wish.org/wish/craig.html]

If that isn't bad enough, someone else thought it would be funny to
completely rewrite the Craig letter and change the name "Craig Shergold" to
"Jessica Mydek":

     LITTLE JESSICA MYDEK IS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND IS SUFFERING FROM AN
     ACUTE AND VERY RARE CASE OF CEREBRAL CARCINOMA. THIS CONDITION
     CAUSES SEVERE MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMORS AND IS A TERMINAL ILLNESS.
     THE DOCTORS HAVE GIVEN HER SIX MONTHS TO LIVE.

     AS PART OF HER DYING WISH, SHE WANTED TO START A CHAIN LETTER TO
     INFORM PEOPLE OF THIS CONDITION... FURTHERMORE, THE AMERICAN CANCER
     SOCIETY AND SEVERAL CORPORATE SPONSORS HAVE AGREED TO DONATE THREE CENTS
     TOWARD CONTINUING CANCER RESEARCH FOR EVERY NEW PERSON THAT GETS
     FORWARDED THIS MESSAGE. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, SEND THEM TO
     THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AT ACS@AOL.COM

     [Quoted from http://www.cancer.org/chain.html]

Here is the American Cancer Society's response:

     As far as the American Cancer Society can determine, the story of
     Jessica Mydek is completely unsubstantiated. No fundraising
     efforts are being made by the American Cancer Society in her name
     or by the use of chain letters. Furthermore, the email address
     ACS@AOL.COM is inactive. Any messages to the American Cancer
     Society should be instead sent through the American Cancer
     Society website at http://www.cancer.org.

     [Quoted from http://www.cancer.org/chain.html]

Our next urban legend of the day is this little letter, which has been
clogging up the Net recently:

     From: Anthony Parkin<Parkin@MayoHospital.health.com>
     Subject: My dying wish

     My name is Anthony Parkin, and you don't know me.  I'm 7 years
     old, and I have leukemia.  I found your name using gopher, and I
     would like for you to carry out my dying wish of starting a chain
     letter.  Please send this letter to five people you know so I can
     live forever.

Unfortunately, neither the "Mayo Hospital" nor the domain
"MayoHospital.health.com" exist.  There is a Mayo Clinic, however, and here
is what they have to say about the Anthony Parkin chain letter:

     [P]lease be advised that the letter did not originate from a
     valid source.  The address "Parkin@MayoHospital.Health.Com" is
     fictitious, as are the particular details of that letter.

     The plight of children or adults suffering from leukemia,
     however, certainly is not fictitious.  It is understandable that
     such a letter can generate a great deal of sympathy, but
     forwarding chain letters is not an appropriate response to the
     situation. If you would like further information about how you
     can help the real victims of this terrible disease, please take a
     look at the Leukemia Society of America world-wide-web server [at
     http://www.lukemia.org/].

     [quoted from http://www.mayo.edu/about/parkin.html]

By the way, one of the things that tipped me off that the Anthony Parkin
letter was a hoax was that he used a .COM address.  Most teaching hospitals
-- like Mayo, Hopkins, etc. -- are in the .EDU domain.

Folks, if you receive a letter telling you that Craig Shergold, Jessica
Mydek, Anthony Parkin, or ANY other sick/dying kid wants you to send them
business cards, get well cards, e-mail letters, or anything else, DON'T
BELIEVE IT!  These stories not only betray the public's confidence, they
cause damage to legitimate organizations like the American Cancer Society
and the Mayo Clinic.


IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN
-------------------------

This one comes from Peter Langston, the owner of the Fun-People list (which
we visited back on December 12th -- check out
http://www.tourbus.com/archives.htm if you want to see that post again).

You may remember that a couple of months ago, congress talked about
slashing funding for both National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public
Broadcasting System (PBS).  A petition was distributed across the Internet
urging congress to protect NPR and PBS.

Peter writes:

     Today, when I did a quick search on the WWW for "npr funding
     petition," I came up with the appended correspondence on the
     Bananafish Archives page at:
     http://slf.gweep.net/~sfoskett/jds/online/archive/9609/118.html>

     ... %< snip snip snip %< ...

     ****UPDATE FOR PBS/NEA/NPR PETITION****

     To all receivers of this petition,

     It has come to our attention, due to the overwhelming support of
     these programs, the movement to cut the funding for the NEA, NPR,
     and PBS has been dropped.  To repeat, thanks to your support of
     these programs, the danger of losing these programs has passed!!

     Unfortunately, the due date for this petition was deleted on most
     or all of these copies and the petition is still circulating.
     ***** PLEASE DELETE ALL COPIES OF THE CIRCULATING
     PETITION!!!*****  We greatly apologize for any inconvenience
     concerning this effort but MUST ASK FOR THE PETITIONS TO BE
     DELETED!!!  The overwhelming support we have received has kept us
     going, but the fight has been won and we thank you all!

     -Sincerely,
     The authors of the petition


KIDNEY HARVESTING AT HOME FOR FUN & PROFIT
------------------------------------------

The most grisly urban legend floating around the Net right now is the one
that says:

     I wish to warn you about a new crime ring that is targeting
     business travelers.

     This ring is well organized, well funded,  has very skilled
     personnel, and is currently in most major cities and recently
     very active in New Orleans [or Las Vegas or Houston].  The crime
     begins when a business traveler goes to a lounge for a drink at
     the end of the work day.  A person in the bar walks up as they
     sit alone and offers to buy them a drink.   The last thing the
     traveler remembers until they wake up in a hotel room bath tub,
     their body submerged to their neck in ice, is sipping that drink.
     There is a note taped to the wall instructing them not to move
     and to call 911. A phone is on a small table next to the bathtub
     for them to call.   The business traveler calls 911 who have
     become quite familiar with this crime.  The business traveler is
     instructed by the 911 operator to very slowly and carefully reach
     behind them and feel if there is a tube protruding from their
     lower back. The business traveler finds the tube and answers,
     "Yes."  The 911 operator tells them to remain still, having
     already sent paramedics to help.  The operator knows that both of
     the business traveler's kidneys have been harvested.

I received a copy of this letter a few weeks ago, and decided to do a
little investigating of my own.  So, I contacted the Police Department's
Public/Media Information offices in New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Houston.
All three police departments told me that the story is a hoax, and the New
Orleans police department denied the story so quickly that I never even
finished asking the question:

     Police>  Public Information
     Me>      Yeah, my name is Patrick Crispen, and I write an
              Internet newsletter.  I was just calling to confirm ...
     Police>  That the kidney story is not true.  It's not

By the way, my favorite part of the kidney harvesting story is the line in
the letter that says:

     My sister-in-law works with a lady that this happened to her
     son's neighbor who lives in Houston

Oh, yeah ... now *THERE'S* a reliable source.  :)
