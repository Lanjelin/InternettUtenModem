TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP    : The Internet Oracle
TODAY'S TOURBUS ADDRESS : http://www.pcnet.com/~stenor/oracle


Do dogs have lips?  I'll be darned if I know, but the Internet Oracle
could no doubt give you an answer to that or any of life's other little
mysteries.

But you don't need to ask the Oracle how to get a good deal on magazine
subscriptions.  Our sponsor Magazine Express has the answer...

*----------------*  BIG-TIME MAGAZINES FOR $10 A YEAR?  *----------------*
                       ONLY TOURBUS RIDERS KNOW HOW!
    Magazine Express has exclusive TOURBUS discounts others can only
   dream about. Plus, Dr. Bob's new "Internet Goodies" is FREE.  This
    is a limited time offer, so get details now by sending email to:
*-----------------------( tourbus@magazines.com )------------------------*

Oh, before we begin...  That noise you heard last Thursday afternoon was
the sound of my e-mail inbox exploding.  Over 140 messages that I was
planning to answer perished in the blast, so if you sent me something
and never got a reply, that's why.  (Moral of the story: Never write a
UNIX shell script to directly manipulate your mail queue - ouch!)

No Monocle On This Oracle
-------------------------

The Internet Oracle (formerly known as the Usenet Oracle) has nothing to
do with those one-eyed dispensers of wisdom from Greek mythology.  It's
an exercise in collaborative humor that involves asking silly questions
and receiving creative and humorous replies.

In order to ask the Oracle that burning question on your mind, you must
send e-mail to "oracle@cs.indiana.edu".  In the subject of your message,
put something like "Oracle Most Wise, please tell me ...".  (Any subject
will work as long as it contains "tell me".)

The Oracle will farm your question out to another participant, but you'll
have to answer a question from another "supplicant" before you get your
own reply!

The Jocular Oracle
------------------

When you get your question, put a little effort into making it fun for the
asker.  Be witty, be funny, be creative - it's all anonymous.  And if your
answer is particularly clever, it will be published in the Internet
Oracularities - a periodic posting of the best of the Oracle.

You can read the Internet Oracularities in the Usenet newsgroup called
"rec.humor.oracle".  If you don't have Usenet access, you can receive
the Oracularities by e-mail.  Send e-mail to oracle-request@cs.indiana.edu
with "subscribe" in the Subject line.

Even though the Internet Oracle operates in the e-mail realm, you can
submit a question or find out more about the Oracle on the Web at this
address:  http://www.pcnet.com/~stenor/oracle

Read The Help File First
------------------------

You can also get a copy of the Oracular Help File there (which you should
definitely read before trying the Oracle), or request it via e-mail by
sending a message to "oracle@cs.indiana.edu" with HELP in the Subject line.

The Internet Oracle has been in operation since 1989 at Indiana University.
You can view archived Oracularities on the Web at the address given above,
or send the word "help" in the body of a message to mailserv@cs.indiana.edu
for details on getting them by e-mail.
