     Today's TOURBUS Topic: Free Calendar Software
     Today's TOURBUS Site : http://www.visionx.com/ddmain.htm

I just came across an amazing site called DigiDay - The Free Theme
Calendar Super Site.  You can visit and download about a dozen freeware
programs that will pop up a nifty calendar page each day with something
witty, helpful or inspirational.

But before we go exploring, here's another freebie to check out from
our long-time sponsor Magazines.Com ...

+---- HUGE TOURBUS SAVINGS ON THE HOTTEST MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS! -----+
 Time, Newsweek, Money, PC Magazine, ZD Internet, Net, Yahoo, and tons
   more!  Plus, pick from 50 FREE subscriptions.  Send email now to:
+--------------------- ( tourbus@magazines.com ) ----------------------+

These calendars are just like those "365 Days of Whatever" doodads where
you rip off a page each day.  But since this is software, you don't have
to rip anything off, and you won't get ripped off either - it's free!

Right now, the software will run on Windows 3.1, Win95 or WinNT.  So Mac
users, instead of beating on me, send your true feelings by e-mail to
"comments@visionx.com" and see what comes of it.  The calendars you can
choose from include:

 * 365 Days of the Classic Quotes - A collection inspirational,
      provocative, and humorous quotes.

 * How to Avoid Work at Work - A new time-tested trick for "looking
      busy" each day!

(Drats, I can't use THAT one anymore!  By the way, there's a rumor
floating around the University of Alabama that Patrick quit his job
there.  Just to clarify, I was the one who left my day job.  Patrick
is still "looking busy" at the U. of A.)

 * 365 Days of BibleBits - An inspirational bible verse each day.
      "Guaranteed to keep you on the straight and narrow."

 * 365 Days of Off-the-WallPaper - A new Windows background each day,
      from subtle to psychedelic.

 * 365 Days of StarDate - A daily dose of astronomical facts and figures.

 * Conk! - Strange but true stories, real-life headlines, and The Great
      Kielbasa Oracle.

Of course, the people behind DigiDay can't serve up digital kielbasa for
nothing. So sometimes a sponsor's message may pop up along with your
calendar entry, and they also offer a couple of great shareware titles for
under $10.

The DigiDay Clock shows you the date, time, and available system resources,
and it acts as a front-end to all your DigiDay programs.  And the DigiDay
reminder is a powerful personal information manager that will help you manage
your day-to-day activities.

I think DigiDay has discovered the essence of having an online presence:
You have to give away some really cool stuff for free in order to earn the
right to sell anything in the online world.  Spammers, take note.
