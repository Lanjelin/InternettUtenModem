TODAY'S TOURBUS SITE   : The Pizza Server
TODAY'S TOURBUS ADDRESS: http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~pizza


The Internet is full is wild and wacky people.  Brian Hall, also known
as "beej", is one of them.  While a student at California State University
Hall and some friends felt a burning need to create a mechanism to enable
the delivery of free pizza over the Internet.  Why?  Just because!

The service originally started out as a text-based mail server that
would take requests and make pizza deliveries by e-mail.  Although the
e-mail portion of The Pizza Server still functions, it's also available
on the Web, and has been rated as one of the "Top 5%" of web sites by
Point Communications.

Ever wonder what a pizza with kittens and green M&M's would be like?  Or
how about pepperoni and legos?  The Pizza Server has been delivering these
and a host of other "make your own" pizza creations since April of 1994.

Wanna try your own?

  * Pop on over to http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~pizza
  * Select "Order and view a pizza over the Web!"
  * Choose from a list of toppings that includes bacon, beetles, eyeballs,
    kittens, pepperoni, sausage, Garlick (funny!), mushrooms, olives,
    baseballs, footballs, bolts, green M&M's, floppy disks and Legos
  * Press "Order Pizza" and watch your pizza appear on the screen

If you're limited to e-mail access, don't worry -- you still get a pizza.
Just send e-mail to pizza@ecst.csuchico.edu with "pizza help" in the SUBJECT
line (ditch the quotes, though).  You will need software to decode and view
the returned image if that functionality is not built into your e-mail
program.  If you need help with decoders or viewers, please refer to the
"alt.binaries.pictures" FAQ, available by anonymous FTP at RTFM.MIT.EDU as

  pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1
  pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2
  pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part3

There are lots of fun little tidbits scattered around the Pizza Server web
site, so poke around and find out why the denizens of digital dough have
declared war on Pizza Hut, and find out who Garlick really is!
