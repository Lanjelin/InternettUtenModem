TOURBUS: Thursday, January 23, 1997<br>
DRIVER: Patrick Crispin<br>
TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: Some Really Cool Audio Sites</h2>
</center>
<p>
Remember back on January 9th when I said that "TOURBUS is, for the most
part, distributed every Tuesday-ish and Thursday-ish?"  Well, today's
TOURBUS post is quite "ish."  :)
<p>
Actually, one of the reasons why today's TOURBUS post is so "ish" is that
your fearless bus driver had to go out of town the other day to do an
in-service at Houston Academy in Dothan, Alabama (which is, by the way, a
*really* cool place).  I thoroughly enjoyed the trip, but I am just now
getting caught up with all the stuff that I should have done before I left
(I still have 380 e-mail messages waiting for me in my in-box!).
<p>
Your fearless bus driver is going to be on the road again soon, and if you
want to see if I am as goofy-looking in person as I seem on the Net, feel
free to visit me during my presentations at any of the following
conferences:
<pre>
     Tuesday, January 28th       Mississippi Educational Technology
                                 Conference -- Biloxi, MS

     Saturday, February 8th      Southeastern Business Education
                                 Conference -- Athens, GA

     Wednesday, April 16th to    Georgia Educational Technology
     Friday, April 18th          Conference -- Macon, GA
</pre>
Since I am driving to each of these conferences (it's a long story), you
can bet that I am going to stock up on some "road music" before I go.
Fortunately, I have a pretty good idea where I can find *EVERY* CD that I
am looking for:

Occasionally, we pull our little bus of Internet happiness into sites that
are guaranteed to be "time sponges," soaking up hours of what would
otherwise be productive time (remember our two visits to cnet back in
September?).  I'm not saying that these sites are not worthwhile (cnet, in
fact, is *still* one of my favorite resources on the Net).  What I am
saying is that, from time to time, we visit sites or tools on the Net that
are so absolutely wonderful that they are guaranteed to keep everyone happy
-- and busy -- for DAYS!
<p>
Today's TOURBUS stop is dedicated to just such a tool: Real Audio.
<p>
You may have heard Bob and me talk about Real Audio from time to time, but
I'm not sure we ever explained what it is.  Real Audio is a program (and
Web browser plug-in) that allows you to listen to live and on-demand audio
on the Internet over standard modems.  What makes Real Audio so
mind-numbingly cool is that, thanks to something called "streaming," you
can actually listen to the sound files AS YOU DOWNLOAD THEM!
<p>
Wait, it gets better.  The software that you need to be able to do this is
... brace yourself ... FREE!  (Actually, if you really like to spend money,
you can purchase an enhanced version of the Real Audio software in your
local computer store or on the Net for about $20 to $30 (US), but the
basic, free version of the software is just fine for those of us who are
just starting out).
<p>
Okay, now for the technical stuff.  The Real Audio software is currently
available for Microsoft Windows 95, Windows NT, Windows 3.1, Macintosh
PowerPC and Macintosh 68040 (the software is also available for Linux,
Solaris 2.5, Irix 5.3, FreeBSD, SunOS 4.1.4, Solaris 2.4, and DEC Alpha
NT).  To use the Real Audio software, you'll need either
<ol>
<li>A 14.4 Kbps modem or greater (I'd strongly recommend using at
        least a 28.8 Kbps modem for the best sound quality) and a SLIP
        or PPP connection through your local Internet Service
        Provider, or

    <li>An Ethernet or LAN connection through your work or school.
</ol>
<p>
If you don't have either of these types of connections, or if you aren't
sure exactly *how* you are connected to the Internet, contact your local
Internet Service Provider or network manager and ask them "how can I use
Real Audio on my computer?"  (Real Audio is so universally popular that
almost every Internet Service Provider or network administrator should be
able to help you.)
<p>
Okay, with that out of the way, let's go get the software.  You can
download the free Real Audio software at <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/products/player/download.html">http://www.realaudio.com/products/player/download.html</a>
<p>
Downloading and installing the software is actually pretty easy.  In fact,
the folks at Real Audio really have done a great job of making this whole
process as simple as possible.  :)
<p>
<h3>NOW WHAT?</h3>
Okay, you've downloaded and installed the Real Audio software.  Now what?
Well, now that you can listen to Real Audio sound files, I have a couple of
Real Audio-enhanced Web pages that you have *GOT* to visit.  Our first stop
is "cnet Radio."
<p>
Back in my September 10th TOURBUS post (which you can find on the Web at
<a href="http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/hotel/tourbus/091096.htm">http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/hotel/tourbus/091096.htm</a>), I mentioned that
cnet Radio "offers three new technology-based ... "radio" [broadcasts] each
day that you can play on your browser."  Let's go take a look at today's
broadcast!
<p>
You can find the cnet Radio page on the Web at <a href="http://news.com/Radio/">http://news.com/Radio/</a>
<p>
cnet Radio produces three news broadcasts a day: one at 10:00 A.M. (PST),
one at 1:00 P.M. (PST), and the final one at 4:00 P.M. (PST).  By the way,
"PST" stands for "Pacific Standard Time" -- cnet is based in San Francisco.
:)
<p>
To listen to the latest cnet Radio broadcast, click on the words "click to
listen" to the right of Brian Cooley's picture.  Unless something goes
wrong, within a few seconds your computer should say something like "live
from San Francisco" and start playing the latest cnet Radio broadcast.
<p>
If you are looking for a good way to keep abreast of the latest technology
news, cnet Radio is probably *THE* best place to find it!  I personally
visit this page at least once a day (Monday through Friday), usually in the
mid-morning (that way I get to hear the previous day's final update).
<p>
<h3>25,500 FEET PER SECOND?</h3>
Back on April 26th, we'll pulled the bus into the "Car Talk" Web page at <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/">http://www.cartalk.com/</a>
<p>
(You can find the April 26th TOURBUS post on the Web at
<a href="http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/hotel/tourbus/042596.htm">http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/hotel/tourbus/042596.htm</a>).
<p>
Car Talk is both a public radio show hosted by, and a newspaper column
written by, Click and Clack, two Boston-area auto mechanics (who both also
happen to have engineering degrees from MIT). The premise of both their
show and their column is that Click and Clack answer car-related questions
sent in or called in by their audience.
<p>
Well, now that you have Real Audio running on your computer, you can hear
snippets from the Car Talk radio show on the Web at <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/Radio/replay.html">http://www.cartalk.com/Radio/replay.html</a>
<p>
Even if you are not a Car Talk fan, I *strongly* recommend that you
download and listen to <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/Radio/RAfiles/shuttle1.ram">http://www.cartalk.com/Radio/RAfiles/shuttle1.ram</a>
<p>
This file is HILARIOUS ... and it will take you a few minutes to actually
figure out what is going on!
<p>
<h3>NEW STUFF</h3>
I have one last place that you have *GOT* to check out: <a href="http://www.thedj.com/Main/thedjfull.com">http://www.thedj.com/Main/thedjfull.com</A>
<p>
This site is dedicated to the purpose of letting you sample music from
different genres that you might not otherwise experience.  Just click on a
music category from "punk" to "Chicago blues," and your Real Audio player
will start playing music from that category!  Neat, huh?
<p>
By the way, if you find an artist or song on this site that is so cool that
you *must* find a copy, make sure that you keep today's TOURBUS sponsor in
mind (<a href="http://www.Mass-Music.com">http://www.Mass-Music.com</a>).  :)
<p>
That's about it for this week.  There are HUNDREDS of Real Audio sites out
there, and in the weeks to come we may drop in on a few of the best.  In
the interim, take a look at what today's TOURBUS sites have to offer ...
and have a safe and happy weekend!
