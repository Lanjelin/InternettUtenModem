TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP      : EXPO
TODAY'S TOURBUS ADDRESSES : http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/
                            http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/expo/overview.html

As hard as this is to believe, today's TOURBUS post is late because your
fearless bus driver got incredibly lost last night.  I was at the Alabama
state capitol in Montgomery yesterday giving a speech about the Internet.
Unfortunately, due to a minor directional mistake on my part, on my return
trip from Montgomery to Tuscaloosa I sort of ended up in the town of Union
Springs.  (For those of you who, like me, know nothing about Alabama
geography, let me just add that this is equivalent to traveling from Paris
to London and accidentally ending up in Rome)  So, what should have been a
90 minute drive from Montgomery to Tuscaloosa turned into a 3 and a half
hour trek.  Whoops! :)

On a less embarrassing note, I recently heard from the folks who are
running the CYBERSPACE LAW workshop (TOURBUS, 29 Feb. 96), and they told me
that their workshop will start in the next couple of weeks.  Also, for
those of you who are interested in the Roadmap96 workshop (TOURBUS, 2 May
96), the beta testing started today, and the first workshop will begin on
June 13 instead of June 6 (I had to push the start back seven days so I
could have time to solve a pretty weird UNIX LISTSERV problem).

Today's TOURBUS stop is EXPO, an online series of exhibits collected from
material at the Library of Congress.  You'll need a graphical Web browser
like Mosaic, Netscape, or Internet Explorer to see all of the art and
graphics at EXPO, and the EXPO homepage is on the Web at

     http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/

EXPO has been around for as long as I can remember, and EXPO remains one of
my favorite Internet resources anywhere!  When someone asks me to show them
some neat stuff on the  Internet, I almost always point them to EXPO.  Why
is EXPO so cool?  Well, EXPO allows you to view images and documents from
the following Library of Congress exhibits on your own computer screen:

        * Rome Reborn: The Vatican Library and Renaissance Culture
        * The Soviet Archive Exhibit
        * The 1492 Exhibit (Columbus "discovered" America in 1492)
        * Scrolls from the Dead Sea: The Ancient Library of Qumran and
          Modern Scholarship

ROME REBORN: THE VATICAN LIBRARY AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE presents some 200
of the Vatican Library's most precious manuscripts, books, and maps.  The
SOVIET ARCHIVE EXHIBIT is the first public display of the hitherto highly
secret internal record of Soviet Communist rule.  1492: AN ONGOING VOYAGE
examines the first sustained contacts between American people and European
explorers, conquerors and settlers from 1492 to 1600.  The exhibition
SCROLLS FROM THE DEAD SEA: THE ANCIENT LIBRARY OF QUMRAN AND MODERN
SCHOLARSHIP brings a selection from the scrolls which have been the subject
of intense public interest.

Cool, huh?

There are two ways to "tour" EXPO.  The first way
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/) is pretty hokey, with pretend ticket offices
and shuttle busses.  Since EXPO is free, and the tours are self-guided, you
can avoid the hokiness by going directly to

     http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/expo/overview.html

This will give you an overview of each of EXPO's main exhibits.  Once you
enter an exhibit you will be shown a list of every item available in that
exhibit.  This allows you to directly view the  items that you want to look
at, without forcing you to download and view a whole bunch of other images
that don't interest you.  By the way, if you ever want to leave an
exhibit's "overview mode" and take the "grand tour," just click on the
words "introduction" or "exhibit's introduction."

If you are looking for one of the best resources on the Net, EXPO is for
you.  EXPO's link is sometimes slow, but the information available in
EXPO's exhibits is well worth the wait :)

Have a safe and happy weekend!
