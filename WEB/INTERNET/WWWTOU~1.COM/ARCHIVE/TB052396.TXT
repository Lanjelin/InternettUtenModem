I want to warn you up front that the next couple of paragraphs are
blatantly self-promotional (even more so than usual). I really do feel bad
about this, so to make up for my blatant self-promotion I am going to
devote my next four TOURBUS posts to visiting the sites that I have
promised to visit but never have.  In particular, here is the schedule for
my "sorry for being so blatantly self-promotional" tour:

     DATE       SITE
     ----       ----
     TODAY      INFOSEEK
     MAY 30     EXPO
     JUNE 6     NEWSPAPERS ON THE WEB
     JUNE 13    HOMR

With that said, I have some good news: your fearless bus driver has written
an Internet training textbook!  The book's title is "Atlas for the
Information Superhighway" (not to be confused with my often-postponed Atlas
Web workshop), and the book is available through bookstores everywhere.

My goal was to create a textbook that would be a wonderful Internet
training guide for the general public and would also be a good ancillary
text for teachers who want to add Internet training to their curriculum.
As such, each chapter in Atlas (the book) uses hands-on activities and end
of chapter reviews to reinforce Internet knowledge and break down the
material in the chapters so they are not so ominous to the reader :)

Anyway, if you are interested in Atlas (the book), here is some information
about the book (which is soft cover with a concealed spiral and 15 tabbed
chapter dividers):

        Crispen, Patrick Douglas.
        Atlas for the information superhighway
        South-Western Educational Publishing
        ISBN 0-538-65864-9
        $23.95

There is also an Instructor's Manual available (ISBN 0-538-65865-7).  If
you have any additional questions about Atlas (the book) -- especially if
you are an educator or book buyer -- please feel free to call an
International Thompson Publishing sales representative in the States at
(800) 824-5179 (South-Western is a division of ITP).

As I said earlier, I am sorry for being so blatantly self-promotional.
However, it is not every day that an undergraduate publishes a textbook!
... I think a celebration with some DELUXE ramen noodles in store!

*---------------------*  THE NOODLES ARE COMING!  *--------------------*
  The Flying Noodle has a cool collection of gourmet pastas and sauces
 on-line. Mention The Tourbus and we'll take $5 off any order over $20.

Back on September 27 (TOURBUS - "NEW LIST"), I mentioned that my five
favorite Internet resources are (in no particular order):

        1. NEW-LIST,
        2. Yahoo!
        3. NandO
        4. U Mich Libraries Gopher Site, and
        5. INFOSEEK

Well, a lot has changed since then -- I'll tell you what my NEW top five
resources are when TOURBUS celebrates its first birthday in July -- but I
just realized that while TOURBUS has visited the first four of these
resources, we never actually got around to visiting INFOSEEK.

So, today's TOURBUS stop is INFOSEEK. By the way, if you ever want to read
any of the old TOURBUS posts, just drop on in at the TOURBUS archives at
either

     http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/hotel/tourbus/archives.htm

or

     http://csbh.mhv.net/~bobrankin/tourbus/archive.html

INFOSEEK is, according to their press releases, the "most popular
information search [service] available on the Internet, processing over 7.5
million information requests a day."  You can find INFOSEEK on the World
Wide Web at

     http://www.infoseek.com/

INFOSEEK is a little like a cross between a search engine like Lycos or
Alta Vista and a subject-oriented guide like Yahoo!  What makes INFOSEEK
different from other search engines, however, is the vast wealth of
resources that you can search using INFOSEEK. From the INFOSEEK homepage
you can search the World Wide Web, or Usenet newsgroups, or e-mail
addresses, or Reuters news, or Web FAQs!.

One of the neatest things about INFOSEEK, however, is all of the neat stuff
that is available "behind" the INFOSEEK homepage.  If you click on the "Big
Yellow" icon, for example, you are taken to a form that lets you search
through over 16 million business yellow pages entries.  If you click on the
"Fast Facts" icon, you are taken to a page with references on how to find
e-mail addresses, stock quotes, company information, and street maps.

One of my favorite parts of INFOSEEK, however, is the "Infoseek Personal"
news service at

        http://personal.infoseek.com/

Infoseek personal is a free, personal news service.  Once you fill out a
questionnaire (you'll need a forms-capable browser and a lot of time to do
this -- you have to go through seven pages to set up your own free
"account"), the folks at Infoseek will use the information that you give
them to create an online "newspaper" geared specifically for you! Once you
have completed the questionnaire, INFOSEEK will display your own personal
news page.  BOOKMARK THIS PAGE!

Your Infoseek Personal news page will have two sections:

     1. General news.  This includes the latest headlines from
        around the world.  The general news section is the same for
        everyone.

     2. Your personal news.  Based on what you put on your
        questionnaire, INFOSEEK will show you the latest news,
        sports scores, local weather, and other information
        tailored just for you!

Cool, huh?  That's about it for today.  Take a look at INFOSEEK, play
around, and have a safe and happy weekend :)
