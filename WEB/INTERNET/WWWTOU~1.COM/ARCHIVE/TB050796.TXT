TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP    : The Internet Research Pointer
TODAY'S TOURBUS ADDRESS : http://csbh.mhv.net/~rpproctor/IRP.html


Back in my long ago college days, my friend Ken wanted me to teach him
how to play the guitar.  I figured what the hey - I'll give him a few
pointers and maybe someday he'll catch up with me - vain fellow that I
was.

Well as soon as I showed Ken the difference between a fret and a tuning
fork, he was well on his way to winning first prize at the talent show
in Mother's Foosball Emporium.  I'm still working on the refrain to
Kum-Ba-Yah...

Deja Vu All Over Again
----------------------

So I should've known that when my buddy Roger asked me to show him the
basics of slinging HTML, that he would show me up in a big way.  He did,
and the fruit of his labors are an excellent example of the gift economy
that makes the Net go 'round.

If you do online research of any kind, you're sure to find The Internet
Research Pointer a valuable resource.  Grab the URL (see above) and
bookmark it now, before we go over the highlights of Roger Proctor's
Most Excellent IRP.  But before we start, why not zip off a quick query
to see what our sponsor Magazine Express can do for you?

*----------------*  BIG-TIME MAGAZINES FOR $10 A YEAR?  *----------------*
    Magazine Express has exclusive TOURBUS discounts others can only
   dream about. Plus, Dr. Bob's new "Internet Goodies" is FREE.  This
    is a limited time offer, so get details now by sending email to:
*-----------------------( tourbus@magazines.com )------------------------*


The IRP provides a well-organized and annotated set of links to dozens
of Internet sites that will help you in any research task.  Not only
does it offer a big list of search engines (with all the search forms
on one page), you'll also find help on writing research papers and
properly citing online references.


The Search Engines page - http://csbh.mhv.net/~rpproctor/IRP.html#I
-------------------------------------------------------------------

...at the IRP highlights Search.Com, a service that helps you choose from
over 250 search engines, depending on the subject of your quest.

If you don't find what you're looking for there, you can submit your
queries to Alta Vista, DejaNews, Excite, InfoSeek, Inktomi, Magellan,
WebCrawler, WhoWhere, Yahoo and a few others, right from the IRP page.


Ibid, Ubu - http://csbh.mhv.net/~rpproctor/IRP.html#II
------------------------------------------------------

Other IRP pages offer assistance in citing both hardcopy and electronic
media, pointing you to the American Psychological Association (APA), the
Modern Language Association (MLA), and other helpful sites.

You'll also find links to university libraries, home pages, and research
tools like Libweb - http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Libweb - listing over 900
libraries in over 45 countries.


Commercial Sources
------------------

Being an unabashed capitalist myself, I think it's great that purveyors
and publishers of magazines, newspapers & books are finding ways to
squeeze green out of the ether while contributing something valuable to
the online world.  Some examples that IRP will hook you up with are:

  * Amazon.Com Books - http://www.amazon.com - Search Amazon.com's million
title catalog by author, subject, title, keyword.

  * Newsweek Media Research Index - http://www.vmr.com/research - A
directory of major studies and reports spanning four decades.


Internet Application Archives
-----------------------------

This IRP link will help you find Internet software.  I still haven't cured
Roger of his affinity for the Mac, so you'll see lots of Mac FTP sites
listed here along with some other good archives including these:

  * Internet Tool Box - http://www.aldea.com/bluepages/tool.html
  * Mac FTP Sites - http://rever.nmsu.edu/~bgrubb/ftp-list.html


State and Federal Government Sources
------------------------------------

If you're into politics, IRP recommends you try these sites:

  * CapWeb - http://policy.net/capweb - A Guide to the U.S. Congress
  * Federal Web Locator - http://www.law.vill.edu/Fed-Agency/fedwebloc.html


Other Stuff
-----------

Too much to cover here, the Topics section takes you to research sites
for Business, Education, Health Issues, The Humanities, Law, and Science.

Pop in to the IRP and check out "Starting a Small Business", "The Internet
Legal Resource Guide" and a long list of others!
