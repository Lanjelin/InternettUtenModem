As I mentioned last week, here is the TOURBUS Rider Survey.  I hope
you can take just a few minutes to answers these 10 questions.  Since
we have about 75,000 readers from 115 countries "on the Bus", the
results should give us quite a good picture of who is using the Net
and why.  We'll share the results here in about a week, so please send
in your survey as soon as possible - thanks!

A special thanks go to Beach Tech for processing this survey.
For more information about their service, contact SALES@BEACHTECH.COM
or HTTP://WWW.BEACHTECH.COM


HOW TO RESPOND TO THE SURVEY
----------------------------

All survey responses MUST be sent to TOURBUS@BEACHTECH.COM  If your
e-mail program is well-behaved, just using your "Reply" feature will
start a new message to that address with the survey questions in the
message body, ready for you to type your answers.

Note: If your software does not automatically include a copy of the old
   message in the reply message, you can use a "cut & paste" operation
   to get the survey text into your outgoing message.  Another idea is
   to save the survey text to a file, then copy it into your reply
   message.  Every e-mail program works differently, and I can't possibly
   provide 75,000 people with individual assistance, so please try to
   figure it out yourself or ask someone who uses the same software!

In any case, your message MUST be addressed to TOURBUS@BEACHTECH.COM
Check the "To:" line in your message to ensure that is the case.  If your
message is sent to me, or to the LISTSERV address it will be ignored.
