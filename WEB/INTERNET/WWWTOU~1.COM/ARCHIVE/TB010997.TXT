TODAY'S STOP:       VIRTUAL "TICKLE ME ELMO" AND THE TOURBUS FAQ FILE

Hi, kids!  I hope that y'all had a safe and happy holiday season.

For those of our bus riders who are not in the United States or who may
have (thankfully) missed it, the hottest toy this holiday season was Tyco's
"Tickle Me Elmo" doll.  The doll is pretty much a $30, red, stuffed Sesame
Street character that laughs and vibrates when you tickle it.

Well, if you were unable to find a Tickle Me Elmo doll in the stores or if
you were unwilling to pay up to $1,500 (US) for a doll that pretty much
just twitches when you poke it, I have some incredible news for you: you
can now find a Virtual Tickle Me Elmo on the Web at

     http://www.clark.net/elmo/elmo.html

Wait ... it gets better.  If you click on the Virtual Elmo's tummy, you can
download a 273 K wav file of Elmo giggling and twitching!  [I was just
wondering: is this the 4th or the 5th sign of the apocalypse?]  I have also
noticed that *my* Tickle Me Elmo (yes, I actually bought one) rotates
clockwise when it is laid on a table.  I wonder if South American Tickle Me
Elmos rotate counter-clockwise?  :)

Seriously, before we start today's tour, I want to thank one of our
long-time sponsors for making today's TOURBUS possible.  While Aardwulf
doesn't have any Tickle Me Elmos, they do have some of the best-priced
men's apparel I have ever seen.  If you are looking for a good place to
spend this year's holiday bonus, look no further!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
   FREE Coupons on great apparel brands like Timberland, Duck Head,
  Woolrich, and Calvin Klein. Just sign up at Aardwulf Apparel's web
 store. Since they're electronic, they'll never clutter your drawers!

Today, our little bus of Internet happiness won't be visiting a particular
Internet site or tool.  Instead, we're going to take a quick peek at the
second "First Annual TOURBUS Frequently Asked Questions" file.  :)

------------------
WHAT *IS* TOURBUS?
------------------

TOURBUS is a free, on-going, semi-weekly, text-based tour of some of the
neatest sites on the Internet.  TOURBUS' posts are written by Bob Rankin
(author of "Accessing the Internet by E-mail") and me (Patrick Douglas
Crispen, author of the ROADMAP workshop), and are distributed via a
LISTSERV e-mail distribution list at America Online.

What makes TOURBUS unique is that each TOURBUS post not only gives you the
addresses of neat Internet sites, it also gives you a really in-depth look
at how to fully use those sites.  Surf the Net for any amount of time, and
you will soon discover that many of the Internet's most exciting sites do
not come with instruction manuals.  TOURBUS helps you overcome that problem.

Bob and I also try to make each TOURBUS post as conversational -- and
humorous -- as possible.  Above everything else, the Internet is FUN ...
and Bob and I try to show that in our TOURBUS posts.  :)

---------------------------
HOW MUCH DOES TOURBUS COST?
---------------------------

Nothing.  Zero.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.

TOURBUS is absolutely free.  All of the costs associated with running the
TOURBUS list are paid by our sponsors (and by Bob and me).

------------------------------------------
IS THERE AN ARCHIVE OF PAST TOURBUS POSTS?
------------------------------------------

Yep!  You can find the TOURBUS archives and other TOURBUS stuff at the
TOURBUS homepage at

     http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/hotel/tourbus/

--------------------------------------------------------
HEY! THAT'S A WEB ADDRESS!  I DON'T HAVE A WEB BROWSER!!
--------------------------------------------------------

Don't panic!  You can still access the TOURBUS homepage (and, for that
matter, ANY other Web page) through e-mail using the information contained
in Bob Rankin's free guide "Accessing the Internet by E-mail."  To find out
how to get this guide (and how you can still participate in my ROADMAP
Internet training workshop), send an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU

(that's "you-aye-won-vee-em") with the command

     GET NEWUSER PACKAGE F=MAIL

in the body of your e-mail letter.

---------------------------------------
WHEN ARE THE TOURBUS POSTS DISTRIBUTED?
---------------------------------------

Its kind of hard to say.  TOURBUS is, for the most part, distributed every
Tuesday-ish and Thursday-ish.

----
ISH?
----

Well, sometimes we are a little late in getting these posts out.  If you
want to be technical (or at least "statistical"), I guess you could say
that TOURBUS has a probability distribution centered around Tuesday and
Thursday, with a standard deviation of a day or two.  :)

----------------------------------------
HOW CAN MY FRIENDS SUBSCRIBE TO TOURBUS?
----------------------------------------

Just have them send an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM

with the command

     SUBSCRIBE TOURBUS YOURFIRSTNAME YOURLASTNAME

in the body of their letter, replacing YOURFIRSTNAME and YOURLASTNAME with
their first and last names.

----------------------------------------------------------
WHERE DO YOU AND BOB GET YOUR IDEAS FOR THE TOURBUS STOPS?
----------------------------------------------------------

Bob and I receive a lot of suggestions from the TOURBUS riders (like "get a
life"), but most of the sites that we write about are sites that we
accidentally find while surfing the Net.  :)

--------------------------------
HOW DID YOU AND BOB RANKIN MEET?
--------------------------------

Well, actually, we've never met.

I know Bob from the NETTRAIN list, and Bob and I have exchanged hundreds of
e-mails (and about five phone calls) over the past couple years, but I have
no idea what Bob looks like ... and, from what I hear, that's a good thing!
:)

Bob e-mailed me shortly after the end of my last Roadmap workshop with the
idea of creating a sponsor-supported, two or three week workshop of neat
Internet sites.  I suggested that we make the workshop on-going ... and the
rest, as they say, is history.  :)

-----------------------------------
ARE YOU *REALLY* A COLLEGE STUDENT?
-----------------------------------

Unfortunately, yes.  I am an 11th-year senior at the University of Alabama
majoring in Economics ... but, in light of the success of my Southern Word
collection, I'm thinking about changing my major to "Ala-bonics." :)

-------------------------------
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GRADUATE?
-------------------------------

I dunno, mom ... soon (August, I think).  :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
YOU KEEP MENTIONING "SQUIRRELS" IN YOUR POSTS AND IN YOUR SIGNATURE.
WHAT'S THE STORY?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The "squirrel story" comes from the fact that the squirrels living in the
trees on the campus of the University of Alabama have developed quite a
taste for power lines ... especially for the power lines leading into the
University's mainframe computer center (if you are not electrically
inclined, let me just add that energetic squirrels and power lines do not
mix well).

Back when I was running the Roadmap workshop (that online Internet training
thingy that I did in 1994), I was really concerned that if the University
of Alabama's mainframe was taken down by a squirrel (which was a regular
occurrence at the time) and I was not able to deliver that day's Roadmap
lesson to the 64,000 people in the workshop, the workshop participants
would panic and mailbomb me with 64,000 "where is today's lesson?" messages.

By telling the subscribers up front to expect a squirrel attack, I kept
myself from being mailbombed, I elevated Alabama's squirrels to Net-legend
status (people around the world were even rooting for the squirrels), and I
gained a really neat "trademark." :)

------------------------------------------------
WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR SOUTHERN WORDS OF THE DAY?
------------------------------------------------

The TOURBUS subscribers send them in to me.  I may not be able to respond
to everyone who has sent me a submission, but I have saved every Southern
Word that I have received.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
IS THERE AN ARCHIVE WHEN I CAN FIND ALL OF THE OLD SOUTHERN WORDS OF THE DAY?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep!  Just point your web browser to

     http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/word.html

If that doesn't work, try going to Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com/) and do a
keyword search for "Crispen."  Yahoo has two links to the Southern Word
archive.

A couple of alert TOURBUS readers have informed me that you can also find a
couple Southern Word dictionaries in your local bookstore:

     How to Speak Southern
     by Steve Mitchell
     ISBN 0-553-27519-4
     Price: $3.99 (US)

     More How to Speak Southern
     by Steve Mitchell
     ISBN 0-553-27392-2
     Price: $3.99 (US)

-----------------------------------------------------
AND FINALLY, WHAT'S TODAY'S SOUTHERN WORD OF THE DAY?
-----------------------------------------------------

Actually, in honor of Ruth Parker, a TOURBUS rider who begged me to put a
whole bunch of Southern Words in today's post, here are a whole bunch of
Southern Words:

     Duitcher (pronounced "DOOT-cher").  The command form in Southern.
     Usage: "Duitcher momma tells ya to do."

     Utcha Doon? -- The traditional Southern greeting.

     Meerfuraminit! -- Mandating a person's immediate presence.

     Jauntsamore? -- Asking if one wants seconds at mealtimes.

     Wongo? -- A query of companionship.

     Ahsposo -- The affirmative response to "Wongo?"

     Preshadit (pronounced "PRE-shay-diht") -- A way to give thanks.

(An extremely special thanks goes to Adam Joshua Smargon of the University
of Florida -- the SEC and National Collegiate Football Champions -- for
today's Southern Words).
