     TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: Survey, Screech, FAQ


TOURBUS RIDER SURVEY

  Ever curious as to just what kind of people are riding on the
  world's largest bus, I've decided a survey is in order.  So next
  Tuesday, you'll be receiving a short, voluntary survey which will
  undoubtedly confirm my suspicion that you're all very smart and
  good-looking.  :-)

  The survey will be confidential and anonymous.  We're not looking
  for information on specific people, just stats on the group as a
  whole.  When the survey arrives next week, you'll find complete
  instructions.

THAT AWFUL SCREECHING SOUND

  Did you hear it...  last night around 11:45 PM?  That was me -
  agonizing over the Great And Uncoverable Hard Disk Crash.
  Fortunately, I am a Trained Computer Professional, and would never
  think of using an 850 megabyte disk without installing a tape backup
  unit.  Unfortunately, my most recent backup was done May 10th.  Ooops.

  The reason I share this little bit of personal trivia is that I lost
  a couple of orders for my "Painless" book in the Crash.  So if you
  sent me an order (via Web or E-mail) in the last week, please resend
  it - thanks!
