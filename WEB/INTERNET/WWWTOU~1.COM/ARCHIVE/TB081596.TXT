Hi, kids!  Last week I told you that you can find all of the previous
TOURBUS posts at

     http://www.worldvillage.com/tourbus.htm/

Well, it looks like your fearless bus driver went a little "slash happy"
and added an unnecessary "/" at the end of that URL.  The *correct* address
for the TOURBUS archives is

     http://www.worldvillage.com/tourbus.htm

(notice that there is no "/" at the end of the URL).  Sorry about that.  To
make up for my little slash incident, I am happy to announce that I have
updated the Southern Word homepage at

     http://www.ua.edu/~crispen/word.html

This page contains every Southern Word that has appeared in my TOURBUS
posts over the past year, and is required reading if you ever want to be
able to converse with a "suddener."  :)

Of course, if you want to be a TRUE Southerner, you'll have to know how to
make gourmet grits ...

Last week we pulled our little bus of Internet happiness into Mercury Mail,
a *free*, advertiser-supported service (sort of like TOURBUS) that delivers
only the news and information that you want, when you want it.  You may
remember that I wrote that

     [Y]ou have to have a forms-capable Web browser to be able to
     "configure" Mercury Mail to send you what you want, when you want
     it.  (Actually, I think you can do this through e-mail too, but I
     could not find any directions on their web page ... I'll keep
     looking, though.).

Well, I am happy to announce that I have found a way that you can subscribe
to, and configure, all of Mercury Mail's services using nothing but e-mail!
Am I a great guy or what?!

As a review, Mercury Mail offers 8 services: News; Weather; Snow; Stocks;
Sports; Entertainment; Reminders; and Calendars.  All of the services, with
the exception of "Calendars," are absolutely free.  Mercury Mail is able to
fund these "free" services by placing small ads in the e-mail letters that
they send you (sort of like what Bob and I do to be able to pay for
TOURBUS).

Let's take a look at how to subscribe to Mercury Mail's free news service,
NEWSpot.  NEWSpot offers briefs of headline news in 14 categories with web
links to the full story.  To subscribe to NEWSpot, just send an e-mail
letter to

     NEWS@MERC.COM

All of Mercury Mail's subscription addresses will "autorespond" to your
letters, so it does not matter what you put in the subject line or the body
of your letters.

Shortly after you send off your letter to NEWS@MERC.COM, you will receive a
letter that looks something like this:

     Welcome to NEWSpot, a new free service from Mercury Mail! NEWSpot
     delivers a daily e-mail summary of news topics, including U.S.
     news, international news, and special events.
     ... %< snip snip snip ... %<

     By replying to this message, we can get you set-up with NEWSpot
     today! Place an X between the brackets if you want that feature
     enabled.

     General News
      [ ] U.S.
      [ ] International
      [ ] Science & Medicine
      [ ] Technology
     ... %< snip snip snip %<

All you need to do to subscribe to NEWSpot is reply to the e-mail letter
from NEWSpot and put an X between the brackets next to any and all of the
particular features that you are interested in!

Simple, huh?  Here's some information on how to subscribe to *ALL* of
Mercury Mail's services via e-mail.

     NEWSpot
     -------

     NEWSpot offers briefs of headline news in 14 categories with web
     links to the full story.   To subscribe to NEWSpot, send an e-
     mail letter to NEWS@MERC.COM

     WeatherVane
     -----------

     WeatherVane brings The Weather Channel to the desktop, offering
     customized coverage of weather in your choice of cities and
     regions.  To subscribe to WeatherVane, send an e-mail letter to
     WEATHER@MERC.COM

     SnowBytes
     ---------

     SnowBytes provides snow conditions and mountain reports on a
     subscriber's selected resorts.  SnowBytes also includes events
     and happenings in those locations.  Since it is 100 degrees in
     the shade right now, SnowBytes has taken a little vacation ...
     but SnowBytes will start up again in September (Mercury Mail will
     send you a notice through their other services telling you how to
     subscribe to SnowBytes).

     CLOSING BELL
     -------------

     CLOSING BELL offers the daily closing prices and related news on
     the stock/companies that you are following.  CLOSING BELL
     includes several options such as morning news, inter-day news
     alerts, mid-day stock reports and weekend reports.  To subscribe
     to CLOSING BELL, send an e-mail letter to STOCKS@MERC.COM

     Sports Wrap
     -----------

     Sports Wrap delivers personalized coverage of the Olympics,
     baseball, basketball, golf, tennis, hockey and other sports as
     they come into season.  To subscribe to Sports Wrap, send an e-
     mail letter to SPORTS@MERC.COM

     SpotLite
     --------

     SpotLite personalizes the latest information on movies, rentals,
     theater, television, music releases, horoscope, lottery, gossip,
     etc.  To subscribe to SpotLite, send an e-mail letter to
     ENTERTAINMENT@MERC.COM


The reminders service (ConsoliDate) is only accessible through the Mercury
Mail homepage at

     http://www.merc.com/

and the calendar service (Quotes & Anecdotes) actually costs money (because
of licensing agreements) so I'm just going to detour our bus around that
service.

Also, for those of you who are big NFL (National Football League) fans, you
might want to check out Mercury Mail's NFL service at NFL@MERC.COM

That's it for this week. Have a safe weekend ... and watch out for them
squirrels!
