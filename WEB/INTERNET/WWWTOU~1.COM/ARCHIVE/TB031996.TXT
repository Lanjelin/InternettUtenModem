TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP    : RVL S.C.O.R.E.

Imagine if your life was suddenly interrupted by a freak accident which
left you paralyzed - with no movement or feeling from your shoulders to
your toes?  It happened to Robbie Vierra-Lambert...

In 1990, Robbie had plans to be an Olympic hockey player.  But what he's
doing lately is even more heroic. Robbie beat the odds through a lot of
faith and hard work, and he's walking today - even though he is still a
quadriplegic.  In June of 1991, Robbie did make it to the Olympics,
walking 900 feet with braces and a walker as the torch bearer in the
1991 U.S. Olympic Festival torch run.

But that wasn't enough for Robbie...

In March of 1991, RVL S.C.O.R.E. (Robbie Vierra-Lambert Spinal Cord
Organization for Regaining Excellence) was founded to assist paralyzed
individuals in their quest of regaining excellence and maintaining the
highest level of independence.

So what does all this have to do with the Internet?  Well, Robbie sent
me e-mail yesterday.  He's got his own web page that tells his story,
how others can be helped by RVL S.C.O.R.E. and how YOU can help them.
But Robbie tells me that lack of support could cause the plug to be
pulled soon...

I was fascinated as I read through the pages.  I had no idea that
advanced therapy could enable a quadriplegic to actually walk without
assistance, or that paralyzed people are routinely consigned to nursing
homes by insurance companies who don't understand that it costs more to
keep them there than to help them achieve independence.

RVL S.C.O.R.E is making a big difference in the lives of many paralyzed
people - but you have to go to this web site to fully understand.  I
hope you'll read the story, see the pictures and be moved to help in
some way - I sure was.

So pop on over... the address to feed into your Web browser is:

        http://www.loop.com/~rvl

That funny "~" thing is a "tilde".  If you can't find it on your
keyboard, substitute "%7E" instead - either form will work.  And if you
don't have direct Web access, you can get the info by sending the line:

        send http://www.loop.com/~rvl

in an e-mail message to "agora@dna.affrc.go.jp" - that's a special web-
mail server so folks who are limited to e-mail can still experience the
wonders of the Web.

If you prefer to contact RVL S.C.O.R.E by e-mail, send a message to

        rvl@loop.com

to find out more or get details on how you can help.  And when you're
done, pay a visit to today's TOURBUS sponsors - they make it happen!
