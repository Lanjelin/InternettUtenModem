           TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP:  http://www.answers.com

There are lots of search engines on the Net.  You type in a word or
phrase, the computer ponders for a few seconds and then delivers the
inevitable result: "38,400 Documents Found."  Now it's up to you to
refine your search or wade through endless links in search of the
real answer to your question.

But there's a new search engine now with a significant difference...
At Answers.com, your questions are answered by humans, not computers.

Answers.com is a unique information service that delivers answers by
e-mail to personal, business or academic questions.  In most cases,
their "Answer Advisors" will be able to provide a citation from a
reference text or from an Internet site.

Sounds Cool!  Is it Free?
-------------------------

Sort of...  When you first sign up, you get $8.00 worth of questions
answered for free.  After that, you have to provide either a snail
mail address for billing or a credit card number.

How Much Will My Answer Cost?
-----------------------------

That'll be 5 cents, please.  (Just kidding -- remember Lucy from the
Peanuts cartoon?)  When you arrive at Answers.com, there's a box to
enter your question and then you have to decide whether your question
is "easy", "medium", or "hard".  The answer fee is $1.79, $5.00, or
$11.99, respectively.

So What's A Hard Question?
--------------------------

According to the Answers.com help page, a "hard question" is one that
requires extended research or a compound answer, like this:

   - How many modems were sold in 1995?
   - What are the diameters of balls used in the following sports: golf,
     handball, billiards, tennis, lacrosse, hurling, and volley ball?

A "medium question" requires a bit less research, or an informed opinion:

    - What is the principle behind the linear aerospike engine?
    - What is the best restaurant in Nashua, NH?

And an "easy question" is one that requires only straightforward lookup of
factual data in a reference book or Internet address:

    - What is the chemical formula for caffeine?
    - Where can I find an SGML viewer for Linux?

How Does It Work?
-----------------

Gimme a quarter and I'll explain it.  It's pretty simple -- you submit
your question at the web site, and a real person at Answers.com sends
the answers within 24 hours by e-mail.  You can ask questions by e-mail
(questions@answers.com) if you have opened an account first.

You can choose expedited (5-hour) delivery for an additional $5 if you
like.  And if they don't agree with your opinion of the degree of
difficulty, they'll ask for permission to charge a different fee or
give you the option to cancel the request.

The Answer Advisors use published information sources, proprietary
databases, personal knowledge, and undoubtedly those cold impersonal
search engines on the Internet to find an answer to your question.
If you have other questions about Answers.com, please submit them to
me with a certified check for $100 or send them to comments@answers.com
and you'll get the answer for free.

Is It Worth It?
---------------

It might seem anathema to shell out money when there are free search
engines like AltaVista that have indexed a large percentage of
cyberspace.  But let's face it -- the sum of all human knowledge is
not found on Web pages.

If your answer isn't available online, in a public domain database
or you don't have time do the research yourself, it could make a lot
of sense to spend a couple bucks -- for an answer.
