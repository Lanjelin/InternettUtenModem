Today's TOURBUS Theme: Valentine's Day
Today's TOURBUS Sites: http://holiday.ritech.com
                       http://www.match.com

Greetings!  We're now about 45,000 strong with Riders in 97 countries. And
today the TourBus is going to roll on through some Valentine's Day sites
in the hope that Patrick may actually pick up some love tips.  ;-)

But first, a little prose to get us rolling...

   O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
   As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
   As is a winged messenger of heaven
   Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
   Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
   When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
   And sails upon the bosom of the air.
   -- From ROMEO AND JULIET Act 2, Scene 2

There are scads of Valentine's Day sites on the Net where you can buy
anything from chocolates to lace underwear, but here's one that actually
says something about the holiday, and offers some creative ideas for
adding a spark of romance to your life.

Simply Valentine's - http://holiday.ritech.com
----------------------------------------------

 - Find out how to proclaim your passion
 - Brush up on classic romantic prose
 - Post a Valentine for your sweetheart
 - Visit other Valentine's related sites
 - Read the story of Valentine's Day


Single And Looking?  Try http://www.match.com
---------------------------------------------

Match.Com is a place where professional single adults can meet and
establish new relationships.  You can browse member profiles to see
if anyone interests you or grab a copy of the special V-Day issue
of their 'zine.

Match.Com offers free 10-day memberships so you can check things out
before signing up.  Hey, was that Mr. Crispen over there ducking behind
the home page?  (Sorry, PDC - but you *did* set yourself up for this!)


Ah Awesome Valentine! - http://www.marlo.com/val.htm
----------------------------------------------------

Don't even try to find a decent Valentine's Day card at the corner
drugstore - I got the last one.  But there's still hope if your amour
will accept an electronic equivalent.

Create a valentine with cartoon cat Marlo Marmalade, dog JJ Jamm, other
fun cartoon characters, or whip up something more traditional.  It's a
free service, but the site is extremely busy.

"Your card, honey?  Uh, well... it's upstairs on the computer screen.
What's that?  You've got something for me too?  Hey, this is just your
mother's phone number!"  On second thought, maybe you'd better look
for a piece of red construction paper and a doily...


A Special Offer...
------------------

All this electronic stuff is fine and dandy, but unless you have a laptop,
it's kind of hard to take it into the bathroom.  That's why I still keep
a stack of good old-fashioned magazines on hand.  I only wish I knew about
Magazines.Com a few months ago when I renewed my subscriptions...
