Welcome back to another week of TOURBUS!  Boy, did I get in trouble
for last week's post about Answers.com...  Hordes of indignant
librarians came down on me for recommending a fee-based service when
you can get free advice from a local library.

I'll share some of those comments and point you to a place where you
can actually MAKE money on the web, but first a message from one of
our sponsors:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
   FREE Coupons on great apparel brands like Timberland, Duck Head,
  Woolrich, and Calvin Klein. Just sign up at Aardwulf Apparel's web
 store. Since they're electronic, they'll never clutter your drawers!

Margaret Devereaux, a college librarian in New York state said:

  I think it is a shame to steer people away from the social
  institutions that exist to serve them.  Your local library should
  be your first stop when you have a research question.  We don't know
  everything, but we know where to look it up!

  In this age of information overload and sterile technology, isn't
  it a comfort to know that you can still interact with another human
  being, who genuinely enjoys helping you?  I appreciate and enjoy your
  postings, and continue to look forward to your wit and wisdom.

Of course that little bit of flattery at the end had nothing to do with
my selecting Margaret's comments for publication here...  ;-)

Other librarians wrote to say that they accept research questions by
phone and e-mail, and that any self-respecting librarian should do the
same.  (I should invite them to come to my small town library and see
the perplexed look on the librarian's face when you ask for the Reader's
Guide to Periodical Literature...)

Lynn Bry, from Washington University Medical School, wrote:

  I help run The MAD Scientist Network which fields science questions.
  We have close to 400 volunteer scientists who answer questions.
  We can't guarantee an answer within 24 hours, but then we don't
  charge for the service.

  The MAD Scientist Network is online at
  http://medicine.wustl.edu/~ysp/MSN/MAD.SCI.html

If you're lucky enough to have a local librarian who will happily run
off and find the answers you seek, or you can find an online volunteer
to do your bidding, then by all means save your money!

But I think there is still a place for paid researchers like those at
Answers.com who are available round the clock for use by anyone in the
world.  It depends on the nature of your question and how fast you need
an answer.

Okay, here's one that won't cost you a penny - you could even come away
a few dollars richer after leaving this fun web site.  Bingo Zone is a
live online bingo game that you can join and compete for cash prizes.

It's free to play (advertisers support the site) and it's just like a
real bingo game.  B-7, I-22, N-38, G-52, O-66 and all that stuff.  I
played a round this evening but "pmcox" beat me out for the $4 prize.
It's a lot of fun to play, give it a try some time!

Hey, I said they were stupid, okay?  And at least a dozen people wrote
to tell me they really HAVE seen that "Keyboard not attached, press F1
to continue" message.  Sometimes I'm embarrassed to be a programmer...

See you next time!  --Bob
