TOURBUS - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1996
TODAY'S STOP: ANTHROPOLOGY/ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE WEB

Greetings from the frozen South!  Since the recent winter storm that hit
Dixie has left Alabama covered with a thick sheet of ice, and since almost
every road in the entire state of Alabama is closed (which means that your
fearless bus driver can not drive to the computer center to play on the
Net), I have asked Anita Cohen-Williams in sunny Arizona (where is NEVER
snows) to guest write today's TOURBUS for me.

I have been a big archaeology fan since I was a kid -- when I read every
book in my elementary school library (Roy Clark elementary, Tulsa, OK)
about ancient Egypt -- so today's TOURBUS post has a special meaning for
me.

I'll be back behind the wheel next week ... as soon as I thaw out :)

ANTHROPOLOGY/ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE WEB & DISCUSSION LISTS
======================================================

In this edition, I am presenting sites that link to lots of anthropology and
archaeology web pages. There seem to be more archaeology pages out there than
anything else. I have included two sites for museums as well.

ANTHROPOLOGY ON THE INTERNET
http://dizzy.library.arizona.edu/users/jlcox/first.html

This is a web site that I have set up (with the help of Jennifer Cox at the
University of Arizona). The pages are in the following sections: cultural
anthropology; archaeology; linguistics; physical & biological anthropology;
electronic journals; institutes, labs, associations, societies, directories,
etc.; and museums.

ALLEN H. LUTINS' ANTHROPOLOGY RESOURCES ON THE INTERNET
http://www.nitehawk.com/alleycat/anth-faq.html

This is an extensive site which includes web pages, discussion lists,
newsgroups, gophers, and FTP sites.

UVa ANTHRONET http://darwin.clas.virginia.EDU/~dew7e/anthronet

David Wheeler's site has a section that allows one to directly subscribe to
discussion lists.

SOUTHWESTERN ARCHAEOLOGY http://seamonkey.ed.asu.edu/swa/

The "type site" for information and links to archaeology sites in the
Southwestern U.S. and Northern Mexico. It also has an Anti-archaeology
section. Take a look at the Pelli People.

ARCHAEOLOGY MAGAZINE http://www.he.net/~archaeol/index.html

This is the web page for the popular magazine, published by the Archaeological
Institute of America. Nice graphics.

GUIDE TO MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL RESOURCES ON THE WEB
http://www.lam.mus.ca.us/webmuseums

IMHO, the best place to start when looking at museum web pages. The links are
to both national and international museums. Jim Angus keeps this page as
current as possible.

THE LOST MUSEUM OF SCIENCES http://www.netaxas.com/people/aca3/ATRIUM.HTM

A really neat site for people who enjoy getting lost in museums. You can
wander its halls and links for hours. There is also an ongoing hunt for
special museum exhibits (a contest).

YIDDISH WORD OF THE DAY

Since I am not from the South, I figured that I would pick a word from a
language that is dying out (unfortunately).

Chutzpah: the classic definition of this word is the man who murders both his
parents and then throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an
orphan. To pronounce it, you need to do a hard ch (like clearing your throat),
and the z is a ts sound.
