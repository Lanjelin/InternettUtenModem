DRIVER: Patrick Crispin<br>
TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP:<br>Olympic Park Bombing</h2>

<p>
Due to an unexpected calculus test, you fearless, professional college
student/bus driver was unable to write a TOURBUS post on July 25th.  I was
planning to write my post on Saturday, but events in Atlanta sort of
changed those plans rather quickly.
<p>
Anyway, Bob is letting me take his place today so that I can share with you
the latest information on the Atlanta bombing ...

Gee, where do I start?  I guess by now everyone knows that a pipe bomb
exploded early Saturday morning in the Centennial Olympic Park in the heart
of Atlanta.  Two people were killed, and 110 were injured.
<p>
The latest news from ACOG (the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games) is 
that
<pre>
     On Tuesday morning, 30 July 1996, Centennial Olympic Park will be
     reopened to the public. All activities within and around the Park
     which have been suspended pending completion of law enforcement's
     work will be resumed. Additional security measures will be
     employed in the area consistent with its status as a place of
     public access. --A.D. FRAZIER, Chief Operating Officer, ACOG

Within hours of the explosion early Saturday morning, dozens of Web sites
popped up offering the latest information on the bombing and the ongoing
search for the terrorist who planted the bomb.  The "official" Olympic site
for information about the bombing is at <a href="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/news/d-explosion.html">http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/news/d-explosion.html</a>
<p>
This page has links to ACOG's and the IOC's (International Olympic
Committee's) official press statements, as well as to pictures of the bomb
site provided by Agence France-Presse.  This "official" site also has the
complete transcript of Tom Brokaw's Interview of Billy Payne (Tom Brokaw is
the anchor of the NBC Nightly News in the United States, and Billy Payne is
the President of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games).
<p>
The folks at Yahoo were also quick to set up a special Web page for the
latest news about the bombing at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/special/bomb/">http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/special/bomb/</a>
<p>
This page is updated several times a day with the latest news from the
Reuters news service, so you may want to visit this page often.  You can
also find links to other Olympic Park bomb information Web sites by going
to <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/">http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/</a> and then clicking on the words "Pipe Bomb Explodes in Olympic Park" at the top of the page, or by jumping directly to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/News/Current_Events/Pipe_Bomb_Explodes_in_Olympic_Park/">http://www.yahoo.com/News/Current_Events/Pipe_Bomb_Explodes_in_Olympic_Park/</a>
<p>
The most comprehensive Web page on the explosion, however, is at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/27/olympic.bomb.main/index.html</a>

<p>
CNN's global headquarters is only a couple hundred yards from the edge of
the Centennial Olympic Park, so it is not surprising that CNN has the most
comprehensive Web site about the bombing.  CNN's page has Quicktime movies
of the explosion (courtesy of amateur photographer Robert Gee), maps of
Atlanta showing you where the explosion occurred in relation to the other
Olympic venues, information about the investigation, reaction from around
the world, a look at how security at the games has changed, and links to
other related sites and newsgroups.
<p>
Instead, I hope that we all can remember the victims of the bombing in our
prayers tonight.
