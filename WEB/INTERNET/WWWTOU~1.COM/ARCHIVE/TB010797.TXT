    TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: Yoyodyne

Welcome back to another year of TOURBUS!  Let's start things off with
a little fun & games...

Yoyodyne is on a mission -- to make the most popular games ever.
Hordes of netizens are flocking to Yoyodyne game sites in hopes of
pointing, clicking and winning in a Dilbert or Dave Barry trivia
contest, to name a few.

Yoyodyne runs free Internet games for prizes, and they're giving away
cool stuff like cars, Caribbean vacations, and hard cash.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
   FREE Coupons on great apparel brands like Timberland, Duck Head,
  Woolrich, and Calvin Klein. Just sign up at Aardwulf Apparel's web
 store. Since they're electronic, they'll never clutter your drawers!

Equal Access
------------

Yoyodyne runs most of their games over e-mail, although they do have
some games which are Web-only.  The Yoyodyne philosophy is that "all
net.citizens are created equal".  Whether you're coming in through a
heavy-duty T3 line or a creaking 2400 bps modem, you have more or less
the same chances of winning the big prize.

All of the Yoyodyne games require you to provide an e-mail address to
play.  Hey, they need some way to get in touch when you win the Big
One, right?  But they do have one iron- clad rule: No unsolicited mail
will clog your inbox as a result.

Visit to HQ
-----------

I recently visited Yoyodyne HQ, located in a recycled warehouse just a
stone's throw from the Big Apple.  Lucy the Wonderdog (Director of
Office Security) greeted me while a dozen or so people busily tapped
away at terminals in a bullpen filled with wires.  An atmosphere of
fun prevailed, with board games from years gone by adorning the walls.

Seth Godin, President and "Resident Mad Scientist" of Yoyodyne
Entertainment, says that while he's not inventing new games or working
on his Master's in Horticulture, he schemes for ways to patent water.
He's also the creator of GUTS, the most popular online game of all
time with 2 million players.

Letters and photos from thankful winners hang on the walls at
Yoyodyne, so they really do give away stuff.  Ray Burns, a 53 year old
fork lift operator, is the biggest winner so far.  Ray was looking for
a date on the Web, and found a button that said "Click Here to Win a
Million Dollars" -- turns out he did!  I'll bet he got quite a few
dates too.  :-)

The Games
---------

and a bunch more:

   * The Dave Barry in Cyberspace Game
   Enter and you'll get e- mails enhanced by wisecracks from Dave,

   You could win a signed Gibson guitar by picking up a few pointers
   about your online rights!

   Dilbert prizes.

Many of the games can be played by e-mail, too!  To find out what

Stupid Computer Joke of the Day
-------------------------------

  * Mac Error Message: "Like, dude, something went wrong, OK?"

See you next time, I'm ducking for cover.  -- Bob
