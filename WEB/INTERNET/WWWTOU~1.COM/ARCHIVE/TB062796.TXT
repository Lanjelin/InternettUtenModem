Hi, kids. :)

In light of my near Mac-death experience, Bob and I are going to pull our
little bus of Internet happiness over next week and take the week off.
Actually, there are three reasons why Bob and I won't be sending out
TOURBUS posts on July 2nd and July 4th:

     1. I have finals in both my Management and my Marketing classes
        next week, and it might help my grades a little if I study for
        these finals (I need all the help I can get),

     2. Next Thursday is July 4th, the day that Americans celebrate
        our independence by blowing stuff up, and

     3. I *really* like blowing stuff up.

So, don't panic if you don't see a TOURBUS post on July 2nd or July 4th.
Bob is going to be taking a much-deserved break next week, and I am going
to spend next week dreaming of the day that I no longer have to cram for
finals.

TOP5 IS ON THE WEB!
-------------------

You may remember that in my May 16 TOURBUS post (TOP5) I said that the TOP5
list is one of my favorite e-mail lists ever.  According to the TOP5 FAQ,
"[t]he Top Five List is a list created daily by a scattered few comedy
writers and wannabees scattered all across the Internet.  We pick a topic
and come up with a list of applicable items.  The list is then posted to
our web site, "topfive.com," and e-mailed out to the members of our mailing
list."

"TO OUR WEB SITE??"  Yes, fellow bus riders, I am happy to announce that
TOP5 now has a Web site:

     http://www.topfive.com/

Actually, the real address is <http://www.zdnet.com/wsources/topfive/
topfive.html>, but <http://www.topfive.com/> is easier to remember and
works just as well.

The TOP5 web site has a whole bunch of neat stuff, including:

     1. Today's TOP 5 list,

     2. An archive of *EVERY* TOP5 list ever sent out (if you are
        looking for some of the funniest stuff on the Net, look no
        further!),

     3. A form that you can fill out to subscribe to the TOP5 e-mail
        list, and

     4. An online version of the "Hideously Unfair and Completely
        Biased Top Five Contributor Test."

Even though the TOP5 listowner, Chris White, has NEVER accepted any of my
contributions to TOP5, TOP5 -- both the list and the Web site -- is one of
my favorite online resources. :)


THE COMPENDIUM OF HTML ELEMENTS
-------------------------------

This next stop is for the techno dudes and dudettes on the Bus who code
their own Web pages by hand.  If you ever get confused about what a
particular HTML tag does, or about how a particular tag should be used, you
really should check out Ron Woodall's compendium of HTML elements.  The
compendium can be found in the States at

     http://www.synapse.net/~woodall/html.htm

or in Europe at

     http://www.highway57.co.uk/html_ref/html.htm

The compendium will show you how to use every tag from <A> to <WBR>, and it
also has links to Sandia's and W3's HTML resounces.

Again, the compendium is kind of technical, but if you are confused about
some of the newer HTML tags, this may be just the thing that you have been
looking for!
