TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP    : Free E-Mail Around the World

Wow, I got quite a response to my last posting on free e-mail services!
TourBus riders from around the world(*) sent me info on free Internet and
e-mail services in their area.

(*) We now have subscribers from 110 countries.  I'm convinced that some
of you are starting your own countries and then subscribing to TOURBUS
just to inflate the numbers.  Don't stop!  ;-)

*--------------------------*  ONLINE COURSES  *----------------------*
 Do you want to keep your job AND take courses?  Univ. of Wisconsin-
  Stout provides facilitated & self-paced courses online.  For info
   visit "http://major.uwstout.edu" or e-mail "conted@uwstout.edu".
*--------------------------------------------------------------------*

OK, I've boiled it down just a little, but here is what eight of your
fellow riders sent to me on the subject...

Jean-Francois Fortin (jf@Mlink.NET) from Montreal, Canada, says:

> There are about 365 BBSs here in Montreal, and *many* of them are free
> and offer free e-mail to their subscribers.  Here are the numbers:
>
> NAME OF BBS                  PHONE     (all are area code 514)
> ---------------------------- --------
>
> Flash! BBS                   768-5476
> Juxtaposition BBS Line 1     364-2937
> Juxtaposition BBS Line 2     367-1505
> Juxtaposition BBS Line 3     364-9940
> Marcus BBS                   642-3186


Jan van Bruggen (Jan.vanBruggen@nym.sc.philips.com) from the "land of
windmills, tulips, wooden shoes and semiconductor factories", says:

> Over here in The Netherlands, we also have free email acces.
> We have these projects called "digital cities". Some of the bigger cities
> have installed a server on which you can get a free account.
>
> These digital cities have a coule of features, like MOO's, usenet
> groups, IRC channels etc.  On DDS (Amsterdam) you can Email to the whole
> world, but on others you can only mail to the .nl domain.
>
> URL's :  HTTP://www.dds.nl/   (Digitale stad Amsterdam)
>          HTTP://www.dse.nl/   (Digitale stad Eindhoven)


Pete Juds (pandaman@twics.com) from Tokyo, Japan, says:

> There is a server in Japan called IAC Online which has offered free email
> since (as far as I know) it's establishment.
>
> Users in Japan have to pay fairly high prices. I myself pay =A55,000 (that's
> yen - don't know if you can read the sign?) which is just short of $50 per
> month. This gives unlimited access and 5MB of disk space for web pages but
> local phone calls cost a fortune - 20 hours is about another $50.


Rudo Prager (rudo.prager@magnet.at) from Vienna, Austria, says:

> There is a free e-mail service in Austria. It is called BlackBox.
> Anybody who registers after dialling into their Vienna node gets an
> e-mail address (real.name@blackbox.at). The catch: none if you are happy
> with e-mail only. But they hope that you eventually subscribe to their other
> services for a basic fee of $ 8 per month.


Raul Schlegel (schlegr2@uni2a.unige.ch) from Geneva, Switzerland says:

> A friend of a friend of mine uses Freenet in Finland for free-mail.
> I don't know what you do to have an account, but their URL is
> http://www.freenet.hut.fi/


Ariella Bayer (aribayer@netvision.net.il) from Tel Aviv, Israel, says:

> Hi bob,
> There's another free-email sevices within the web:
> http://www.hotmail.com


Pat Drummond (pat@freenet.carleton.ca) form Ontario, Canada, says:

> Ottawa, Ontario has a free ISP with e-mail supported by advertising called
> Ottawa.public.net. The service is funded completely by advertising -- the
> one-time registration fee of $20 (about $15 U.S.) was to appease the
> advertisers.
>
> Free full Internet access is available.  E-mail is available as an option
> (added recently because the advertisers want people to contact them!).
> URL: http://www.ottawa.public.net/


And Orrin Kerr (orrin@FDPD-agcan.org), also from Ottawa, adds:

> There is another reason for a Freenet address other than the cost.  And
> that is a reasonably steady e-mail address.  In the past year, my
> brother's e-mail address has changed once and another friend's address
> has changed twice as ISPs come and go.  I urge my friends to get a Freenet
> membership where ever they are and no matter which ISP they are using.
> Then they can set the mail forwarding address to the ISP/mail server/
> address that they are currently using.
