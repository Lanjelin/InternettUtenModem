TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: The World Wide Web Broadcaster</h2>

<p>
Hi, kids!  :)
<p>
Your fearless bus driver is back from the MECA conference in Mississippi
with yet another installment from our continuing journey around the
Internet.  Before we get today's tour underway, however, I want to give a
special thank you to the ultra cool folks at Mass Music who are making
today's TOURBUS post possible:

Okay, you've finally written your own World Wide Web homepage (if you
haven't, just pretend that you have).  Now how do you tell everyone that
your page exists?  You can visit all of the search engines like Yahoo and
Alta Vista and enter your information by hand, but that could take hundreds
of hours.  You could pay some company to add your information to all of the
search engines, but who can afford to do that?
<p>
Well, kids, today we are going to drive our little bus of Internet
happiness "across the pond" to visit a Web service that just may be able to
help you get a little more traffic on those wonderful Web pages of yours!
<p>
The World Wide Web Broadcaster is a totally *FREE* service that enables you
to submit your Web page addresses to over 235 search engines at once.  All
you have to do is visit the Broadcaster's homepage at <a href="http://www.broadcaster.co.uk/">http://www.broadcaster.co.uk/</a>
and fill in all of the blanks.  There are a couple of things that you need
to remember, though:
<ol>
<li>The Broadcaster's Web server is located in the United Kingdom.
        If you are in the United States, it may take a little while
        for their page to load (it takes a couple of seconds for all
        of those IP packets to make their journey across the Atlantic
        ocean).  Be patient ... The Broadcaster is well worth the
        wait.
<li>You need to fill out *ALL* of the fields on the page in order
        for your submission to work.  If you leave a field blank, the
        Broadcaster's web server will retaliate by sending you a whole
        bunch of bland English food.  (I'm kidding about the food, by
        the way.  English food is much too bland to be sent by
        computer).

    <li>You can only submit one URL (a URL is a Web page address) at a
        time.
</ol>
<p>
With that said, let's take a look at how you can use the Broadcaster to
actually submit the address of one of your Web pages to over 235 search
engines at once.  First, point your Web browser to: <a href="http://www.broadcaster.co.uk/">http://www.broadcaster.co.uk/</a>
<p>
Remember, this page may take a little while to load, so please be patient.
Once this page has loaded, click on the "Start" button over on the
right-hand side of the page.
<p>
This will take you to a page that shows you the Broadcaster's "User
Guidance and Terms of Use."  Make sure that you read this (it is pretty
much just a repeat of those three points that I made a moment ago).  Do
notice that at the bottom of the page is a check box that says
<pre>
     We want to keep our users up to date with future developments.
     If you do NOT wish to be kept up-to-date please untick this box.
</pre>
If you do not want to receive e-mail updates from the folks at the
Broadcaster, make sure that you uncheck the check box.  Then, click on the
"I Agree" button at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
<p>
The rest of the process is pretty easy.  There are 8 pages that you have to
fill out in order to submit your Web page address.  The first page asks you
for your e-mail address, your name, the title of your Web page, your page's
address.  You are also asked if your page has any "adult content."
<p>
Notice that at the bottom of this page are a bunch of words (like "E-Mail,"
"Maintainer," "Title," etc.) followed by red Xs.  Ignore this for now.
I'll show you what all this means in a moment.
<p>
Once you have completed the first page, click on the "Next" button at the
bottom right-hand corner of the page.
<p>
The next page that appears (page 2 of 8) asks you for some more information
about yourself, including your address and phone number.  Fortunately, you
don't have to give this information if you don't want to.  Instead, just
type "NA" (without the quotes, and note that there is no slash between the
letters N and A) in the fields that you would rather not divulge.
<p>
Also take a look at those words and Xs that we saw at the bottom of the
first page.  Notice how some of the red Xs have changed to green check
marks?  As you fill in the blanks on each of the pages, the Broadcaster
keeps track by changing the red Xs to green check marks.  It's just a way
to help you ensure that you fill in all of the blanks.  :)
<p>
The next four pages are pretty much self-explanatory.  Just fill in the
blanks.  :)
<p>
The 7th page gives you a preview of the information that you have submitted
on the previous 6 pages.  DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING because once you approve
this information, there is no way for you to correct it.  If you need to
change something, click on the "Back" button located on the right-hand side
of the page (it's in the *middle* of the page).  If everything looks good,
click on the "Broadcast" button, which is right under the "Back" button.
<p>
That's it!  The folks at the broadcaster will confirm your submission by
e-mail, which may take a few days.  In the interim, if you want to submit
another URL, you can go back to the Broadcaster's main homepage by clicking
either the words "Click Here" or on the "Start" button.
<p>
Neat, huh?
