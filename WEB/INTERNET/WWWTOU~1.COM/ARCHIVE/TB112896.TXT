Happy Turkey Day, y'all! (For those bus riders who may not be in the
States, every fourth Thursday in November is Thanksgiving, a holiday where
we celebrate the one day in history that we were nice to the Native
Americans.  People in the United States celebrate Thanksgiving by consuming
vast quantities of turkey (my parents are currently cooking a 20 pound bird
to feed our family of four), followed by the ritualistic watching of
football (by the men) and the final approval of tactical war plans for the
Christmas shopping season (by the women))

It is customary for the turkey growers of America to give the President of
the United States a free, live turkey.  It is also customary for the
President to grant the turkey a Presidential pardon and to place the turkey
in a petting zoo.  This year, however, while President Clinton was making
up his mind about the pardon and the Republicans in the House were debating
a continuing resolution to override the President's pardon and to condemn
the President for being soft on poultry, the turkey died of old age.

All kidding aside, its time for us to pay some bills ...

Since today is "turkey day," I figured it would be appropriate if we talked
about the *REAL* turkeys of the Internet: the "spammers."  On the Internet,
the word "spam" has two meanings:

     1. A canned luncheon meat with the shelf life of gravel, and

     2. Inappropriate e-mail letters, oftentimes advertisements, that
        are sent to hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet.

If you want a good overview of the second definition, I recommend that you
take a look at ROADMAP workshop lesson 9 (Spamming and Urban Legends).  You
can retrieve this lesson for free by sending an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU

(that's "you-ay-won-vee-em") with the command

     GET MAP09 LESSON F=MAIL

in the body of your e-mail letter.  Lesson 9 gives you a little longer
definition of what a spam is, and it also tells you what you should do if
you ever see a spam.

There are two types of "spams": deliberate spams which are mostly
advertisements that are posted to thousands of LISTSERV lists and Usenet
newsgroups, and inadvertent spams which are e-mail letters that sound true
and which readers decide to forward to all of their friends.

The inadvertent spams are the hardest to spot, because they seem to be
legitimate.  Here are some of the most prevalent inadvertent spams on the
Net today:

     THE BRAIN TUMOR BOY

          MYTH: A child dying of a brain tumor wants to get into the
                Guiness Book of World Records for having the most
                business cards/ post cards/ get well cards sent to
                him.

          TRUTH: The boy's name is Craig Shergold, he is alive and
                well (the tumor is gone), he made it into the Book of
                World Records years ago, and he DOESN'T WANT ANY MORE
                DARNED CARDS!!

                This would be an innocent story, but a while back
                someone decided to change the story so that instead of
                asking that the cards be sent directly to Craig (in
                England) they should instead be sent to the
                Make-a-Wish foundation.  So now, Make-a-Wish (an
                organization that grants the dying wish of children
                with terminal diseases) is being flooded with cards
                for a child that is no longer sick and who doesn't
                need or want any more cards.

                Even if you do not agree with some of the things that
                Make-a-Wish has done in the past, considering the
                damage that this spam is causing to the mailroom at
                Make-a-Wish, I think that everyone will admit that the
                BRAIN TUMOR BOY is the cruelest, sickest, spam/urban
                legend on the Internet today.

     THE GOOD TIMES VIRUS

          MYTH: E-mail letters that have the words "GOOD TIMES" (or
                "DEEYENDA" or any of a host of other words) in their
                subject lines actually contain viruses or trojan
                horses that destroy your hard drive once you open the
                e-mail letter.

          TRUTH: It's a lie.  You CAN'T get a virus or a trojan horse
                by reading an e-mail message.  It is flat out
                impossible.

                You can, however, get a virus or a trojan horse from
                launching an executable file that has been attached to
                an e-mail letter.  How can you protect yourself from
                virused attachments?  Simple.  NEVER launch a program
                or file (especially a Microsoft Word file) that you
                receive from ANYONE without first checking that
                program or file with an up-to-date virus checker.

     THE $250 COOKIE RECIPE

          MYTH: A person is charged "two-fifty" for a cookie recipe,
                he thinks that "two-fifty" is $2.50, and he decides to
                get revenge by sending the recipe to everyone he can.

          TRUTH: Its a lie, and the cookies suck.  You can find a MUCH
                 better cookie recipe at http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/
                 cookie.html

     MAKE.MONEY.FAST/WITH FAITH (OR SEX) ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE

          MYTH: By forwarding an e-mail letter to 5, 10, or 20 of your
                closest friends within 96 hours, you will make $50,000
                a month, become really lucky, or "become REALLY
                lucky."

          TRUTH: #1) These are the Internet's version of chain
                letters.  They are not legitimate, and their claims
                are totally false.
                #2) Most Internet service providers have explicit
                rules prohibiting chain letters.  If you decide to
                forward a chain letter to your friends and someone
                complains to your service provider's postmaster, there
                is a pretty good chance that your service provider may
                limit or even cancel your Internet account.
                #3) Most Net "gurus" (including me) respond to chain
                letters by forwarding the letters (along with really
                angry replies) to the sender's postmaster.
                #4) Forwarding a chain letter to a LISTSERV list or
                Usenet newsgroup under the assumption that "the chain
                letter said that if I forward the letter to 10 people
                I will become lucky -- so sending the letter to a list
                with 2,000 subscribers will make me REALLY lucky" is
                foolish, and is a really great way to get yourself
                banned from that list for the remainder of your life.

With that said, if you want to see what each of these spams actually
looks like, you should check out

     http://www.suck.com/dynasuck/95/11/15/

This page gives you links to everything you could ever want to know about
spam (both the "meat" and the net abuse), and it also has a special feature
that allows you to spam yourself. :)

You might also want to check out Yahoo's urban legends page at

     http://www.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/
     Mythology_and_Folklore/Urban_Legends/

Finally, to protect yourself against accidentally spamming the Net,
remember this one simple rule: if you receive an e-mail letter that asks
you to forward the letter to others, the only person that you should
forward it to is the sender's postmaster.
