TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP      : SUBMIT-IT/STYLE GUIDE/ADV-HTML

If you heard a very loud scream coming from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, at about
7:30 PM (CST) on Wednesday night, that was me.  Due to a minor technical
glitch, my ISP accidentally deleted my entire e-mail account.  For a period
of about 6 hours -- and, might I add, for the first time since January 22,
1992 -- your fearless bus driver did not have an e-mail account :(

Anyway, since staring at a blank computer screen for six hours, whimpering,
took a lot out of me, today's TOURBUS is going to be a little on the short
side :)
Actually, today's TOURBUS is also going to be a little different from what
you may be used to.  Instead of visiting just one site, today we are going
to take a mini-trip to THREE different Internet sites: SUBMIT-IT, the
Walker/ACW Style Sheet, and the ADV-HTML archives.

Oh, by the way, if you have not visited the "Yahoo! Internet Life" Web page
recently (TOURBUS, 4 April 1996), they now have a new address:

     http://www.yil.com/

"Yahoo! Internet Life" just published another edition, so there is a whole
bunch of new Web site reveiews on the YIL homepage.  You can also get the
latest editon of the "Yahoo! Internet Life" magazine at most newstands, or
from today's TOURBUS sponsor ...

*----------------*  BIG-TIME MAGAZINES FOR $10 A YEAR?  *----------------*
    Magazine Express has exclusive TOURBUS discounts others can only
   dream about. Plus, Dr. Bob's new "Internet Goodies" is FREE.  This
    is a limited time offer, so get details now by sending email to:
*-----------------------( tourbus@magazines.com )------------------------*

SUBMIT-IT
---------

Okay.  You have your own Web page ... and NO ONE is visiting it!  How do
you tell the world that your Web page exists?

Well, I guess you could always just pay a visit to, and fill out submission
forms at, Alta Vista, Apollo, BizWiz, ComFind, Galaxy, Infoseek, LinkStar,
Lycos, METROSCOPE, Nerd World Media, New Rider's WWW YP, Open Text,
Starting Point, WebCrawler, What's New Too!, and Yahoo!

Or, better yet, you can just visit SUBMIT-IT at

     http://www.submit-it.com/

fill out one form, and send your Web page information to ALL of these
search engines!  You'll have to have a forms-capable Web browser like
Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer to be able to use
SUBMIT-IT (the form that you have to fill out is WAY down at the bottom of
the SUBMIT-IT page), but this one page alone is reason enough to get your
own forms-capable browser!

The Walker/ACW Style Sheet
--------------------------

If you are a professional college student like me ("college has been the
best eleven years of my life"), you have probably noticed that the
venerable "MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers" is sadly lacking
when it comes to telling you how to cite stuff that you find online.  Now,
before I get mailbombed by a whole bunch of angry English teachers, I will
certainly admit that the MLA does indeed mention citing material accessed
through a computer network.  What I am saying is that the MLA style for
citing material found on the Internet is both dated and incomplete.

Fortunately, Janice Walker, an English professor at the University of South
Florida, has created an MLA-style guide for citations of electronic
sources.  If you are a student or a teacher who uses the Internet for
research, you really should check out Walker's style guide at

     http://www.cas.usf.edu/english/walker/mla.html

ADV-HTML ARCHIVES
-----------------

Finally, there are a lot of beginners guides to Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML, the language that you use to create a World Wide Web page), but
where can you go for advanced information?  Well, a great resource for
ADVANCED HTML information (and I mean ADVANCED) is the ADV-HTML archives at

     http://risc.ua.edu/adv-html

ADV-HTML is a free, moderated, e-mail discussion list for the discussion of
advanced hypertext markup language and other advanced Web topics.  All of
the ADV-HTML posts are also posted on the Web at the site listed above.

Pay particular attention to the posts that have the word SUMMARY in their
subject lines.  When a question is posted to ADV-HTML, the answers are sent
to the person who originally asked the question.  That person that collates
the responses and posts a summary to the ADV-HTML.  These summaries are
usually chock full of really neat information.

TODAY'S SOUTHERN WORD OF THE DAY
--------------------------------
BIDNESS - Noun. A commercial venture.
OWNNA - phrase.
USAGE: "Ah'm ownna git me inta tha Moon Pie bidness!"

(Special thanks goes to Rebecca Noack for today's wurd (although, as
Rebecca pointed out, the word "bidness" should be attributed to the
immortal Molly Ivins))

YOU CAN FIND ALL OF THE OLD SOUTHERN WORDS OF THE DAY ON THE SOUTHERN WORD
HOMEPAGE AT http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/word.html
