TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP    : YAHOO! INTERNET LIFE
TODAY'S TOURBUS ADDRESS : http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/atlas.html
                          http://www.zdnet.com/zdil/

I recently heard what I believe is the PERFECT solution to the "Mad Cow"
problem: send the entire bunch of Mad Cows to Bosnia and let them find all
of the land mines.  Is this PERFECT or what!?

Anyway, driving a bus with over 50,000 riders on it is not cheap (paying
all the fines at the state-run weigh stations for having 50,000 people
crammed into one bus is particularly expensive), so let's pay a few bills.

OKAY, PATRICK ... WHERE IN THE HECK IS THIS ATLAS WORKSHOP THAT YOU HAVE
BEEN PROMISING (AND DON'T EVEN TRY TO BLAME THIS ON THE SQUIRRELS, LAUGHING
BOY)

Most of you should know by now that I am writing a World Wide Web training
workshop (called Atlas) much like the Roadmap Internet training workshop
that I wrote a little while back.  Unfortunately, I am *STILL* writing the
Atlas workshop :(

However, because TOURBUS' riders are smarter and better looking than
everyone else on the Internet, I am going to share a little secret with
you: starting in a few days, I am going to start posting rough-draft,
"beta" copies of my Atlas workshop at

     http://ua1vm.ua.edu/~crispen/atlas.html

You need to keep three things in mind, though:

     1. The "beta" copies are not going to be the final versions of the
        lessons.  I plan to rewrite the beta copies based on the feedback
        that I get back.  If you want to participate in the OFFICIAL version
        of the Atlas workshop, I strongly recommend that you not read the
        beta copies of the lessons.  Instead, keep reading TOURBUS over the
        next couple of weeks.  I will post an announcement about the
        official start of Atlas in a few weeks.

     2. The first part of the workshop (and the first lessons that I will
        post to the address above) is written for people who have never been
        on the Web.  So, the lessons in that part will seem really basic
        to those of you who are Web gurus.  The second and third parts of
        the workshop, however, will be more advanced :)

     3. I haven't decided yet, but I am really thinking about making Atlas
        "buckware."  What does that mean?  Well, if you REALLY like the six
        week workshop, I ask that you send a dollar to the general scholarship
        fund of the University of Alabama.  If you don't like the workshop,
        I ask that you send a dollar to the general scholarship fund of
        Auburn University (Alabama's arch-rival).  Again, I haven't really
        decided to do this, and if I do it, it will be completely voluntary :)

YAHOO! INTERNET LIFE

If you have been on the Web for any length of time, there is no doubt that
you have regularly visited Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com/).  Yahoo! is a
subject-oriented guide to the World Wide Web and is probably my favorite
Internet resource anywhere (it's a toss-up between Yahoo! and that site
that turns your text into Muppet Show Swedish-chef-speech (although I seem
to have lost the address to Swedish chef speech generator)).

Anyway, the folks at Yahoo! have teamed up with the folks at Ziff-Davis
Publishing to create a Yahoo! magazine (actually, Ziff-Davis asked the
folks at Yahoo! to come in and revive their dying "Internet Life"
magazine).  The new magazine is called "Yahoo! Internet Life" and can be
found on most newstands for $4.95 (US).  But, if you are a poor college
student like me, $4.95 is a lot of money (I mean, just think of how many
ramen noodles you can get for $4.95!).  Well, I am pleased to announce that
you can find Yahoo! Internet Life (YIL) on the Web for FREE at

     http://www.zdnet.com/zdil/

What's so cool about YIL?  Well, unlike Yahoo! which is just an archive of
links to other sites, YIL is an achive of REVIEWS of some of the best sites
on the Web.  Want to find a site that has celebrity gossip?  Visit Yahoo!
(at http://www.yahoo.com/).  Want to find the BEST site for celebrity
gossip?  Visit YIL (at http://www.zdnet.com/zdil).

YIL uses a cataloging system similar to Yahoo!, so finding reviews for the
pages about topics that interest you is pretty intuitive.  YIL has three
main categories: fun, profit, and personal growth.  If you have been to
Yahoo!, you'll have no problem finding your way around YIL.  For example,
if you really wanted to find which page was the best for celebrity gossip,
you would go to "fun", then "gossip & humor", then "celebrity gossip".

Each web site reviewed by YIL receives between 1 and four stars (4 being
the best).  Each YIL review page (for example, "Celebrity Gossip") reviews
several different sites, showing you "the best" and also "the rest."  And,
like Yahoo!, you can jump straight into the reviewed sites by clicking on
that site's hyperlink in YIL.

You best bet is to visit YIL and poke around a little. YIL is still pretty
new (they've only put out one issue so far), so YIL's pages are not as
complete or comprehensive as other Web review services.  But, the same was
true about Yahoo! when it started out.  In my honset opinion, YIL has the
potential to become the next mega-site on the Web :)
