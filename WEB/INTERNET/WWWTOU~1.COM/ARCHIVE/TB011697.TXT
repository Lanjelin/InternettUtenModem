Hi, kids!

Today's TOURBUS is late (and a tad bit on the short side) because your
fearless bus driver has been infected with the plague.  Actually, the
doctor tells me that I only have a flu, but he's *lying*!  I have the
bubonic plague.

Before I return home to collapse into the warm confines of my bed, I want
to take a moment to thank the folks who are making today's TOURBUS post
possible.  If you are looking for a way to add some life to your desktop or
Web pages, today's sponsor may be able to help!

BEST OF THE WEB '96
-------------------

Over the past few years, hundreds of "Best of the Web" sites have popped
up.  Annoying "Best of the Web" graphics litter the Information
Superhighway, and I think we have all visited pages that have had more
awards than content.

It wasn't always this way.  When I first started exploring the World Wide
Web in early 1994, one of my two favorite sites on the Web was the Best of
the Web '94 page (my other favorite site was GNN).  The Best of the Web '94
page was unique in that it the awards that it gave were *REAL* -- the
"winners" were announced at the International W3 Conference in Geneva on
May 26, 1994.

Well, your fearless (albeit plague-ridden) bus driver is proud to announce
that the Best of the Web awards are back, and you can find a list of the
1996 winners at

     http://botw.org/1996/awards.html

The Best of the Web awards were given out in the following categories:

     - Best Campus-Wide Information Service
     - Best Educational Site
     - Best Commercial Site
     - Most Important Concept
     - Best Design
     - Best Entertainment Site
     - Best Use of Interaction
     - Best Logo
     - Best Multimedia
     - Best Navigation Aid
     - Best Professional Site
     - Most Technical Merit

The Best of the Web page is rather Spartan in design, but don't let that
fool you.  These awards are *WIDELY* respected, and a quick review of the
winners (and even the runners-up) will give you a look at the absolute best
that the Web has to offer!  :)

VERSION TRACKER
---------------

If have been on the bus for any amount of time, you will no doubt know that
I have a habit of occasionally pulling our little bus of Internet happiness
into sites that are not quite finished, giving you a sneak peek at some of
the coolest sites on the Net before *anyone* has ever even heard of them.
For example, in the past we have paid surprise visits to Yahoo's beta page
(3 Aug. 1995), The brand new New York Times homepage (25 Jan. 1996), and
Yahoo's new search engine (19 Dec. 96).

Continuing in that tradition, our next stop is at a site that is only half
finished.  The site is called "Version Tracker" and you can find it on the
Web at

     http://www.versiontracker.com/

Version Tracker lists the current versions of over 450 major software
titles, and they update this list hourly!  Want to know what the latest
version of Eudora Pro or After Dark Online is?  Version Tracker will tell
you!

Wait ... it gets better.  Version Tracker's homepage also has links that
point you to the places where you can actually download the files necessary
to upgrade your software!

The bad news is that Version Tracker only lists Mac software updates (I
*told* you that the site is only half finished!).  However, on or about
February 1st, the folks at Version Tracker are going to roll out a new page
for PC software updates at

     http://www.versiontracker.com/pcupdates.shtml

If the PC updates page is half as useful as the Mac page is, this site is
rapidly going to become one of the most popular -- and useful -- pages
anywhere.

Remember: you heard it here first!  :)

MACINTOUCH
----------

Our final stop is designed solely for Mac users.  If you are looking for
the absolute BEST site for news about Mac hardware, software, and vendors,
you *have* to check out

     http://www.macintouch.com/

As a loyal Mac user, this site is one of maybe half a dozen Web pages that
I go out of my way to visit on a *daily* basis.  MacInTouch consistently
provides the latest Mac news and information, without all of the
"cheerleading" found on other Mac new pages and without all of the
"fatalism" about Apple found in the general media.

... well, that's it for this week.  I am going to go home, take a handful
of plague pills, crawl under the covers, and sleep until it is time for me
to write my next TOURBUS post.  :)

Have a safe and happy weekend!
