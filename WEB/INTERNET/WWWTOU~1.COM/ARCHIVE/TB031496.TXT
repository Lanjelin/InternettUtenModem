Before we start today's tour, here is a quick message from the folks who
are making today's TOURBUS post possible ...

*-----------------------------------------------------------------------*

You may remember that on August 17 I talked about how to subscribe to
Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC) mailing list. (By the way, if you ever
want to take a look at the August 17 TOURBUS or, for that matter, ANY of
the other previous TOURBUS posts, just point your World Wide Web browser to
the TOURBUS archives at
http://csbh.mhv.net/~bobrankin/tourbus/archive.html).  Today, we're going
to visit Dogbert's "owner," Dilbert.

DILBERT
-------

Dilbert is a tremendously funny, syndicated comic strip created by Scott
Adams.  Dilbert appears in more than 400 publications worldwide, and is
read by over 30 million people each day.  If you have never seen Dilbert
before, it is a comic strip that focuses on the utter silliness of the
white-collar workplace.  The cartoon strip stars Dilbert, a
"socially-challenged engineer, and his sarcastic dog, Dogbert, whose true
calling is to rule the world, since he believes people are basically too
stupid to stop him."

If your local newspaper is not one of the 400 ultra-cool newspapers that
carry Dilbert, don't panic!  You can still read Dilbert every day on the
Web at

     http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/

You will find the most recent Dilbert comic strip on this page.  Well,
actually, the Dilbert Web site lags one week behind the newspapers, so I
guess it would be more accurate to say that you can find the most recent
*Web version* of the Dilbert strip on this page.  This "Dilbert Zone"
homepage also has links to a two-week Dilbert cartoon archive (a MUST read
if you haven't been keeping up with Dilbert recently), the DNRC mailing
list archive, and even a Dilbert store where you can order Dilbert
mechandise (although I am really upset that they stopped selling the DNRC
polos).

To view any of the Dilbert comic strips on the Web, however, you need a
graphical Web browser like Netscape or Mosaic (the Dilbert strips are
posted in gif format).  You should also be aware that the Dilbert homepage
is an extremely popular Web site, and it may occasionally take a long time
to load the images onto your screen.  Trust me ... it is worth the wait :)


ASK (ALTERNATE) DR. INTERNET!
-----------------------------

In response to someone who was calling himself "Dr. Internet" and who was
sending out factually incorrect "Ask Dr. Internet" articles to a particular
LISTSERV list, Thomas Dowling created a series of parody articles called
"Ask (Alternate) Dr. Internet."

Dowling's parody articles are hilarious, and you can find all seven of the
"Ask (Alternate) Dr. Internet" articles on the Web at

     http://chehalis.lib.washington.edu/dri/

Best of all, since the "Ask (Alternate) Dr. Internet" articles are mostly
text-based, you don't actually have to have a graphical browser to view
these pages.  In fact, you can even retrieve these Web pages by e-mail
(just send an e-mail letter to LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU that says GET NEWUSER
PACKAGE F=MAIL in the body of your letter to find out how).

You do need to know a little bit about the Internet (and I mean a LITTLE
bit) to get the humor in the "Ask (Alternate) Dr. Internet" articles ...
but since the TOURBUS subscribers are smarter (and better looking) than the
subscribers of any other list, this should not be a problem.  Please
remember, however, that the "Ask (Alternate) Dr. Internet" articles are
SATIRE and are not meant to be taken seriously.  For example ...

     1. What do file and domain name extensions mean?

        Dr. Internet Headquarters recently received a question asking if
        addresses ending ".com" were from communist organizations. In fact,
that
        is an overgeneralization, but I can understand the confusion. Here is
        the Dr. Internet guide to file and domain name extensions.

        The Internet provides an easily remembered two-character code for
every
        country, like .ch for Switzerland, .es for Spain, and .de for Germany.
        Some other top-level domains are:

        .au      Sound files from Australia.
        .com     Competent Internet users. Due to the generous nature of the
                 Internet, users are initially assumed to be competent, so many
                 .com addresses have been registered recently. A large
number of
                 users have already been nominated for the forthcoming .inc
                 domain.
        .fi      Finland. (Korn Shell only; in the C Shell this must be written
                 as .endif)
        .ru      Russia
        .su      Soviet Union. Notice that they're keeping their options open.
        .us      Us. The fight for ownership and control of the Internet is
                 heating up, and if you're not one of .us, you're one of .them.

That's it for this week!  Have a great (and SAFE) weekend :)
