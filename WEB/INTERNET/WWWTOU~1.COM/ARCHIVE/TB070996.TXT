TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: Free E-Mail?

   
   I think everybody should have an e-mail address. One of my goals is to
   get my parents wired before the end of this year, but I'm not sure
   they would see the value in paying even $5 a month for an Internet
   account. Wouldn't it be nice if e-mail was free?
   
   Surprise, it is. Today I'll highlight two new services that offer FREE
   E-MAIL accounts with no strings attached. Juno and Freemark are two
   companies that are beginning to offer free e-mail to almost anyone
   with a modem. What's the catch? Commercials. But it's done right - you
   only have to endure a display ad on the bottom of your screen. No ads
   are actually delivered to your inbox. Kinda like commercials on TV...

*--------------------------*  ONLINE COURSES  *----------------------*
 Do you want to keep your job AND take courses?  Univ. of Wisconsin-
  Stout provides facilitated & self-paced courses online.  For info
   visit "http://major.uwstout.edu" or e-mail "conted@uwstout.edu".
*--------------------------------------------------------------------*

   I should state up front that both of these services cater only to
   users in the U.S. with Windows-based computers. But they are both
   planning to accomodate Mac users in the near future, and I'd be really
   surprised if the concept does not spread around the world like
   wildfire. If you hear about a similar service outside the U.S. please
   let me know and I'll share it here!
   
  Rather Fight Than Switch?
  
   If pay an access provider or online service each month just for the
   privilege of using e-mail, then you really should consider moving to a
   service like this. At the very least, you could probably save money by
   using a free e-mail service and limiting your online time to other
   activities such as Web surfing.
   
   But here's another twist, it turns out you can access almost ANY
   Internet resource through e-mail. My free guide "Accessing the
   Internet By E-Mail" tells you how to use FTP, Gopher, Archie,
   Veronica, Finger, Usenet, Whois, Netfind, the World-Wide Web, and some
   other fun stuff using simple e-mail commands.
   
   To get the latest edition, send e-mail to one of the addresses below.
   
   To: mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu (for US, Canada & South America)
   Enter only this line in the BODY of the note:
   send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email
   
   To: mailbase@mailbase.ac.uk (for Europe, Asia, etc.)
   Enter only this line in the BODY of the note:
   send lis-iis e-access-inet.txt
   
  Which is Better?
  
   I've seen the screens for Juno and Freemark and they both look really
   easy to use. But Juno is available in a few places where Freemark is
   not, and they also promise access via a tollfree 800 number if there
   is no local Juno number in your area.
   
   The one annoying feature of Juno is that you cannot receive a message
   larger than 60KB, and I'm pretty sure that there is a cap on the
   number of messages you can send or receive in one day. It's possible
   that Freemark has similar limitations as well.
   
   Freemark requires only 3-5 megs of free space on your hard drive,
   while Juno requires 15 megabytes. Try 'em both!
