Hi, kids :)

Last week, we looked at the three largest LISTSERV lists in the world.
Today, we are going to pull our little bus of happiness over to take a look
at some of the smaller, lesser-known e-mail lists.

Before we do that, however, there is something that I want to share with
you (although, in all honesty, this has absolutely nothing to do with the
Internet).  Someone sent this to me a few weeks ago, and I am STILL
giggling about it.  The following is an actual radio conversation released
by the US Chief of Naval Operations on 10 October 1995:

     NAVY:      Please divert your course 15 degrees to the North to
                avoid a collision.

     CIVILIAN:  Recommend you divert YOUR course 15 degrees to South
                to avoid a collision.

     NAVY:      This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again,
                divert YOUR course.

     CIVILIAN:  No. I say again, you divert YOUR course.

     NAVY:      THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER ENTERPRISE, WE ARE A LARGE
                WARSHIP OF THE US NAVY. DIVERT YOUR COURSE NOW!

     CIVILIAN:  This is a lighthouse. Your call.


I thought you'd get a kick out of that.  Anyway, let's pay some bills and
get on with today's TOURBUS ...

A couple of TOURBUS subscribers recently asked me to explain how they can
get a list of every LISTSERV list in the world.  Well, there is a "list of
lists" that you can get through e-mail, but since there are now well over
7,000 LISTSERV lists in the world, I should warn you that the list of lists
is quite large.

If you want to see the list of lists, just send an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@LISTSERV.NET

with the command

     LISTS GLOBAL

in the body of your e-mail letter.  You can also get a list of all of the
LISTSERV lists in the world that have a particular word in its title by
using the

     LISTS GLOBAL / keyword

command, replacing the word "keyword" with the word that you want to search
for.  For example, if you want to see a list of all of the LISTSERV lists
in the world that have the word "HTML" in their titles, you would send an
e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@LISTSERV.NET

with the command

     LISTS GLOBAL / HTML

in the body of your e-mail letter.  Simple, huh? :)


BUT WAIT!  THERE'S MORE!!
-------------------------

For those of you who don't have the time to hunt and search through the
massive list of lists, the rest of today's TOURBUS post is for you!  Here
are a few neat lists that you might want to check out (and some of these
aren't on the list of lists).


HUMOR
-----

One of the first LISTSERV lists I ever subscribed to was the HUMOR list at
the University of Georgia.  HUMOR is a semi-moderated list (before you can
post letters to the HUMOR list you first have to take a "humor test" to
prove to the list's moderator that you are funny (although you don't have
to take a test to be able to read the posts)), and the list sees between
fifteen and twenty letters a day.

Some of the jokes posted to the HUMOR list are a tad bit offensive, but the
HUMOR list has a really neat standing rule that all offensive posts must be
clearly marked as such in their subject lines.  HUMOR is also an
international list with subscribers from all over the world, so from time
to time there may be some "regional humor" posts on the HUMOR list that you
may not understand ... or find funny (but you can always just delete these
posts).

To subscribe to the UGA Humor list, just send an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@UGA.CC.UGA.EDU

with the command

     SUBSCRIBE HUMOR YOURFIRSTNAME YOURLASTNAME

in the body of your e-mail letter, replacing YOURFIRSTNAME and YOURLASTNAME
with your first and last names.


COMPUNOTES
----------

CompuNotes is a free, weekly electronic publication that includes the
latest computer industry news, articles, interviews, software reviews, and
pointers to some neat Web sites.  I only discovered this list recently, but
I feel that CompuNotes is a genuinely good on-line resounce ... and one
that you should definately check out.

One word of warning, though: CompuNotes is running on a Majordomo, an
e-mail distribution system that is sort of like LISTSERV, only with more
bugs.  There is a slight chance that these Majordomo bugs may soon start to
manifest themselves in the form of distribution problems ... but,
fortunately, the owner of CompuNotes is looking to move the entire
CompuNotes list over to a LISTSERV soon (yea him!).

To subscribe to CompuNotes, send an e-mail letter to

     MAJORDOMO@RUST.NET

with the command

     SUBSCRIBE YOURADDRESS

in the body of your e-mail letter, replacing YOURADDRESS with your e-mail
address.


CYBERWIRE DISPATCH
------------------

If you are STRONGLY opposed to the Clipper Chip, The Rimm/CMU Cyberporn
"Study", and the Communications Decency Act -- and if you are a BIG fan of
highly caustic writing -- CyberWire Dispatch is for you.  CyberWire
Dispatch is written by Brock Meeks, INTER@CTIVE WEEK's Washington Bureau
Chief, and the Dispatch is a hard-hitting news service that focuses on
issues currently facing Cyberspace.

Meeks does not hold any punches in the articles that he posts to CyberWire
Dispatch, but what separates CyberWire Dispatch from other on-line rants is
the fact that Meeks is a professional journalist.  While Meeks may not be
politically correct, he is factual ... and his reporting is held in high
regard.
For example, one of the articles that Meeks posted to CyberWire Dispatch on
a Friday appeared in the New York Times the next day -- without attribution
(obviously, Meeks now copyrights all of his articles).

Meeks posts articles to CyberWire Dispatch whenever he has something to
report, but on average he posts about one article a month.  If you are
interested in subscribing to CyberWire Dispatch (which is, of course, a
free service), just send an e-mail letter to

     CWD-L-REQUEST@CYBERWERKS.COM

with the word

     SUBSCRIBE

in the first line of the body of your message.


MORE MORE MORE!
---------------

I've mentioned this a couple of times before, but if you are new to the
Internet and want to learn how to find your way around, or if you only have
e-mail access to the Net and want to learn how to access all of the neat
tools on the Net though e-mail, just send an e-mail letter to

     LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU

with the command

     GET NEWUSER PACKAGE F=MAIL

in the body of your e-mail letter.  The LISTSERV will respond by sending
you some information about both my Roadmap workshop and Dr. Bob's guide
"Accessing the Internet by e-mail."


BLATANT USE OF A LIST FOR PERSONAL GAIN
---------------------------------------

I'm not sure if I asked this before, but if there are any combination VM
Mailbook 95 and Mac Eduora Pro gurus on this list, could you please tell me
the Mac Eudora Pro equivalents for the

     REPLY TEXT (FILE filename filetype filemode

and

     RESEND address (FILE filename filetype filemode

commands?  I use these two commands dozens of times each day, and I can't
really move from Mailbook to Eudora until I find the Eudora equivalents :(
