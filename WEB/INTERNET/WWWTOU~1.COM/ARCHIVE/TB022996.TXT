TOURBUS - THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 29
TODAY'S STOP: THE CYBERSPACE LAW WORKSHOP
TODAY'S ADDRESSES: http://www.disney.com/
                   LISTPROC-REQUEST@COUNSEL.COM


I was planning to write today's TOURBUS about the Holy Rodent Empire
(http://www.disney.com/), but I recently found something else online that I
*have* to share with you.  Before I do that, however, let's pay a few bills
...


*------------------------------------------------------------------------*
  Southern Utah University offers ART 101 on the WWW beginning March 20.

Okay ... what have I found online that is so important that it has made me
postpone our little adventure to Mickey-land?  Well, in light of all of the
recent laws and regulations that have been imposed on the Internet
community, it is tough to figure out what is and is not legal online ...
and, for that matter, what laws do and do not apply to the Internet.
That's where today's TOURBUS stop comes in.


CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS
-----------------------------

Three highly respected law school professors (Professor Larry Lessig,
University of Chicago Law School; Professor David Post, Georgetown
University Law Center; and Professor Eugene Volokh, UCLA School of Law)
have written a *FREE*, online cyberlaw workshop called, appropriately,
"CYBERSPACE LAW FOR NONLAWYERS."  CYBERSPACE LAW is specifically written
for lay people like you and me, and the workshop's lessons use
easy-to-understand English -- NOT legalese and Latin!


YEAH, BUT WILL I *UNDERSTAND* IT?
---------------------------------

Actually, yes. The workshop's authors really are writing CYBERSPACE LAW's
lessons for educated lay people, *NOT* lawyers.

I took a look at an earlier article written by one of the workshop's
professors (Eugene Volokh, "Cheap Speech and What It Will Do", 104 Yale
L.J.1805 (1995)), and I have to say that I am quite impressed ... although
I have to say that I am quite disappointed that Volokh did not have a
single Southern word *anywhere* in his article :)


WHAT WILL THE WORKSHOP COVER?
-----------------------------

CYBERSPACE LAW is going to help you learn the basic principles of -- and
unlearn some common myths about --

     - copyright law,
     - free speech law,
     - libel law,
     - privacy law,
     - contract law, and
     - trademark law

as they apply on the Net.  Each CYBERSPACE LAW "lesson" should be about the
size of an average TOURBUS post (about a page or two), and will e-mailed to
you through an e-mail distribution list.  The CYBERSPACE LAW workshop will
last a couple of weeks, and you'll get two or three letters a week from the
authors ... and, best of all, the entire workshop is FREE!
