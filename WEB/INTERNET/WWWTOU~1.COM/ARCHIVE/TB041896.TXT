TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: THE DAILY BRIEF AND AQUARIUS

   
   Well, folks, your fearless bus driver is full of good news today. I am
   really happy to announce that a newly-revised version of the Roadmap
   workshop (that 27 lesson Internet training workshop that I wrote back
   in the Fall of 1994) will be returning to the Net in mid-May! The nice
   folks at the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) have given
   the Roadmap LISTSERV distribution list a permanent home, and -- get
   ready for this -- come May we'll be starting brand new Roadmap
   workshop sessions every couple of weeks! I am updating the old Roadmap
   lessons as we speak (man, a lot has changed online since I originally
   wrote those lessons), and I'll post some more information about
   "Roadmap 96" as soon as I can :)


THE DAILY BRIEF

---------------




I am still planning to write a TOURBUS post about some neat newspapers on
the Net (by the way, thanks to everyone who suggested newspapers that I
should check out).  If you are like me, however, there are some times when
you simply do not have the time to browse through an entire online
newspaper, or to even read an eight page news summary like the New York
Times'"TimesFAX."



That's where today's TOURBUS stop comes in.  I only discovered "The Daily
Brief" a few days ago, but it has already become one of my favorite news
sources anywhere!  The Daily Brief is a *FREE*, 2-3 page news summary sent
out by e-mail every weekday morning.  Included in the Brief are one or two
sentence summaries of major news events that have occurred in the past 24
hours.



Just to give you a sample of what The Daily Brief looks like, here is a
section from Wednesday's (March 17) The Daily Brief



NATIONAL (U.S.)




     * U.S. Sec. of Defense William Perry has ordered that flight and
       data recorders be installed in all military passenger planes - the
       decree comes in response to the crash which killed Sec. of
       Commerce Ron Brown.
     * The Senate is set to vote today on a new anti-terrorism bill which
       is a weaker version of one approved by the House last month.
     * A federal grand jury in Montana will begin investigations today
       into the case against suspected Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski.
     * O.J. Simpson's friend Al Cowlings refused to testify several times
       yesterday in the case civil case against Simpson. Cowlings invoked
       his 5th Amendment right against self incrimination.



%
Cool, huh?  You can't get more basic than that!



The brief has seven sections: top stories, national (US), international,
business, entertainment, sports, and sports scores.  All of these sections
are quite thorough, but I am particularly impressed by the depth of
coverage in both the international and sports scores sections.



If you are interested in subscribing to The Daily Brief (and can stand one
more letter a day in your e-mail box), just send an e-mail letter to incinc@tia
c.net with the words subscribe db in the subject line of your e-mail letter (n
otice that I said "in the subject line" and *NOT* "in the body").  That's it :)



AQUARIUS

--------




No, we aren't going to talk about astrology (my psychic friend told me not
to).



AQUARIUS is an underwater laboratory 9 miles off the Florida coast and 60
feet below the water.  What makes Aquarius so cool?  Well, for the next
couple of days, Aquarius is on the Web ... and, I am willing to bet that
Aquarius is the first -- and, for that matter, the only -- undersea Web
site!



Between April 15 and 26, Aquarius is going to be a stop for the JASON
project, a project that encourages students (through hands-on, high-tech,
and interactive demonstrations) to become interested in science. JASON VII
will investigate living at the edge of the sea, and during JASON VII,
researchers, students and teachers will join Dr. Robert Ballard to
investigate several interconnected shallow water habitats in Southern
Florida.



The Aquarius is on the Web at http://aquarius.eds.com/



The Aquarius's link is a little slow (it's underwater!!), but if you have
Web access, you owe it to yourself to pay this site a visit while you can
(before April 26).  BTW, I am a *huge* fan of both the JASON project and
Dr. Ballard (Why does Ballard's name sound familiar?  Maybe it is because
he is the man who found the Titanic ... and the Bismark ... and ...).



That's it for today.  Stay dry :)
