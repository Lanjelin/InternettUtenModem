SECURITY HOLE IN INTERNET EXPLORER
----------------------------------

According to Wednesday's Edupage, there is a potentially damaging security
hole in Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser software.  Edupage
reports that

     Microsoft says it is moving quickly to plug a security hole in
     its Explorer Web-browsing software that was discovered by
     Worcester Polytechnic Institute student Paul Greene.  Microsoft
     says the flaw, which involves basic functions within Microsoft's
     Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems, bypasses the highest
     levels of the software's security systems. (Washington Post 3 Mar
     97)

     [quoted from http://www.educom.edu/edupage.old/edupage.97/
     edupage-03.05.97]

The security hole leaves users vulnerable to remote file deletion and
uploading, as well as to hard drive erasure.  According to Microsoft

     Users could be affected by this problem if they are running
     standard or 128-bit versions of Internet Explorer 3.0 and 3.01
     for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0. It cannot affect users of
     Internet Explorer 3.0 / 3.0a for Windows 3.1/NT 3.51 or Internet
     Explorer for Macintosh 2.1 / 3.0 / 3.0a.

Microsoft has already fixed the security problem, and a code fix can be
found on the Web at

     http://www.microsoft.com/ie/security/update.htm

The code fix for Explorer 3.01 was available on Wednesday (5 March), and a
code fix for Explorer 3.0 should be ready on Thursday (6 March).


CRAIG SHERGOLD TAKES A WALKABOUT
--------------------------------

Last week, I wrote

     Folks, if you receive a letter telling you that Craig Shergold,
     Jessica Mydek, Anthony Parkin, or ANY other sick/dying kid wants
     you to send them business cards, get well cards, e-mail letters,
     or anything else, DON'T BELIEVE IT!  These stories not only
     betray the public's confidence, they cause damage to legitimate
     organizations like the American Cancer Society and the Mayo
     Clinic.

Well, it looks like we can add a school to the long list of victims of the
Craig Shergold hoax.  According to Ian Stevens, a TOURBUS rider in
Australia (the *DEEP* south)

     I sent [you] a message last week about a snail mail chain letter
     I received on Craig John, a young boy supposedly suffering from
     cancer in Adelaide, Australia.  You said you had not heard of it
     but presumed it to be a hoax. I checked it out by determining the
     phone number of the person to send cards to.  It was a school.
     The contact turned out to be the principal of the school.  They
     have received literally thousands of cards.  There is no person
     by the name of Craig John and they don't know where it started
     from.

Remember, folks, the Craig Shergold (et. al) story is yet another Internet
hoax that, unfortunately, refuses to die.  :(


VIRUSES IN E-MAILS
------------------

The biggest hoaxes floating around the Net right now are the messages
telling you that you can get a virus from e-mail letters that contain a
certain subject line.  Here are the some of the more popular virus hoax
messages:

     Here is some important information. Beware of a file called
     Goodtimes. ... If you get anything called "Good Times", DON'T
     read it or download it. It is a virus that will erase your hard
     drive.  Forward this to all your friends. It may help them a lot.

or

     There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet.
     If you receive an e-mail message with the subject line "Irina",
     DO NOT read the message. DELETE it immediately.

or

     There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet.
     If you  receive an email message with the subject line
     "Deeyenda", DO NOT read the message, DELETE it immediately!

or

     This is a warning for all internet users - there is a dangerous
     virus propagating across the internet through an e-mail message
     entitled "PENPAL GREETINGS!".  DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY MESSAGE
     ENTITLED "PENPAL GREETINGS!"  This message appears to be a
     friendly letter asking you if you are interested in a penpal, but
     by the time you read this letter, it is too late.  The "trojan
     horse" virus will have already infected the boot sector of your
     hard drive, destroying all of the data present.  It is a self-
     replicating virus, and once the message is read, it will
     AUTOMATICALLY forward itself to anyone who's e-mail address is
     present in YOUR mailbox!

     [All quotes from http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html]

Some of these virus warnings also come with an emergency warning from the
United States Federal Communications Commission -- the FCC (remember them?).

Folks, it is flat out IMPOSSIBLE for you to get a virus from reading the
text of an e-mail message.  It can't be done.  Period.  I don't care what
anyone else says.  It is IMPOSSIBLE!  Letters warning you about "Good
Times," "Irina," "Deeyenda," "Penpal Greetings," and any other e-mail-borne
viruses are HOAXES!

Oh, and as for the FCC warnings, the FCC's policy is that

     The U.S. FCC does not disseminate information regarding the
     existence, impact, or affect of computer virus. [sic]

     [Quoted from http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Miscellaneous/
     Public_Notices/pnmc5036.txt]

With that said, let me tell you that it *IS* possible for you to get a
virus from a file that is *attached* to an e-mail message, but you have to
execute that file first.  For example, let's say that someone sends you an
e-mail letter and he attaches a virused Microsoft Word file to that e-mail
letter.  Your computer would NOT become virused if you opened and read the
e-mail letter (remember, it is IMPOSSIBLE for you to get a virus from an
e-mail letter).  Your computer *would*, however, become virused the moment
you launched the attached, virused Microsoft Word document.

Should you be worried about receiving a virused file attached to an e-mail
letter is sent to you?  Yes and no.  According to an article that was
recently posted on the Macintosh Evangelist mailing list, there are
currently

     - 10,000-11,000 DOS viruses
     - 12 Windows viruses
     - 35 Mac viruses
     - 200+ macro viruses; 70-90% are cross platform
     - 6 Unix viruses

Those 10,000 to 11,000 DOS viruses affect all DOS, Windows, and Windows95
machines (but not Macs), and most of those 200+ macro viruses affect ALL
machines (PC and Mac).  By the way, macros are a series of commands
(usually Microsoft Word commands) that allow you to group together a whole
bunch of tasks into a single command.

We've talked about this a couple of times before, but how can you keep
yourself from downloading a virus from the Net?  The answer is: NEVER open
a file without first running it through a virus checker.  Even if the file
is from your boss, your loved one, or your clergy member, CHECK THE FILE
BEFORE YOU OPEN IT.

Finally, how can you protect yourself from the "Good Times," "Irina,"
"Deeyenda," and "Penpal Greetings" viruses?  YOU DON'T HAVE TO!  THEY'RE
HOAXES!
