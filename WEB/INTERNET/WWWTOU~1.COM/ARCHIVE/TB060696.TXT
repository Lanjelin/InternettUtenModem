TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP      : NEWSPAPERS ON THE WEB

It seems that Alabama's squirrels are migrating in the direction of the
upcoming Olympic games in Atlanta.  According to an article in Wednesday's
Tuscaloosa News, "(i)n Auburn on Monday, a squirrel stepped on a
high-voltage line, shorting out power to two thirds of the Auburn
University campus."  Gee ... and everyone laughed at me when I said that
squirrels can be trained (FYI: the University of Alabama and Auburn
University are bitter rivals)  >:)

On a more serious note, in light of last week's stop at EXPO the folks at
the Library of Congress wanted me to remind you that you can also access
the Library of Congress' latest online exhibits at

     http://www.loc.gov/

Finally, for those of you who have been closely following my collegiate
career ("college has been the best eleven years of my life"), I am pleased
to announce that I got an "A" in the Economics class that I completed last
Friday.  What is even more shocking -- and only those of you who attended
the University of Alabama will understand this -- is that I got an "A" from
*Dr. Leathers*!

I think I'm going to celebrate with some DELUXE ramen noodles!

*----------------*  THE NOODLES ARE COMING!  *--------------------*
The Flying Noodle has a cool collection of gourmet pastas and sauces
on-line. Mention The Tourbus and we'll take $5 off any order over $20.

Since I am up to my neck in e-mail as I get ready for next week's roll-out
of Roadmap96, today's TOURBUS post is going to be on the short side.
However, since several of you in the back of the bus have been kind enough
to remind me that not everyone on this bus is from the United States, I
have included in today's TOURBUS post a couple of "foreign" (at least to
me) newspapers that are usually off the beaten path.

Before we get to the foreign papers, however, there is one online paper
that I want to visit here in the colonies:

Philadelphia Online
http://www.phillynews.com/
--------------------------

     I must have received 50 letters telling me that I need to drive
     the TOURBUS by Philadelphia Online, the Web page for The Enquirer
     and the Daily News. Well, I checked this site out, and I have to
     say that I am impressed.  While the "main" page is pretty much
     full of Pennsylvania news (gee, what did Senators Santorum and
     Specter do today?), Philadelphia Online's other pages are pretty
     comprehensive.  Also, if you liked last week's stop at EXPO, you
     really owe it to yourself to check out Philadelphia Online's
     Cezanne exhibit at http://www.phillynews.com/packages/cezanne/

With that said, here are a couple other international newspapers that you
really should check out:

Prensa Libre
http://www.prensalibre.com/
---------------------------

     Getting the latest news from Central America is almost
     impossible. Fortunately, Central America's largest daily
     newspaper is now on the Web. Prensa Libre's articles are written
     in Spanish, and they give you a look at the latest Latin American
     news that cannot be found anywhere else.

     Prensa Libre's main page only has two links: "Noticias" and
     "Turismo."  The Noticas link will take you to a news archive, and
     the Turismo link will take you to a page which will answer every
     question you could possibly have about Guatemala.

The Jerusalem Post
http://www.jpost.co.il/
-----------------------

     With the pending show-down between Netanyahu and Arafat, this
     web site may soon become one of the most important stops on the
     Web.  If you are looking for the latest news on the Palestinian
     peace process, look no further.

The Saint Petersburg Times
http://www.spb.su/times/index.html
----------------------------------

     This online paper from the former city of Leningrad gives you a
     pretty good look at what life is really like in the former Soviet
     Union.  While the news on this page is pretty "local," The Saint
     Petersburg Times has one of the better opinion ("editorial")
     sections I have seen.

The Daily Record/The Sunday Mail
http://www.mirror.co.uk/rm/
---------------------------

     Finally, I always chuckle when I read a newspaper from the United
     Kingdom. The Daily Record and Sunday Mail are the first Scottish
     papers to be put on the Web, and they have done a wonderful job.
     The link is kind of slow, but news stories like "Dad Chained Up
     Heroin Kids" make it well worth the wait.

As I said, today's TOURBUS post is a little short.  However, I hope that
you will take a few minutes to visit a few of these online papers.  Seeing
things like an editorial in the Saint Petersburg Times decrying
mud-slinging in a local political race just reminds me of how much we all
have in common :)
