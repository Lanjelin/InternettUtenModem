TOURBUS - THURSDAY, 7 MARCH 1996
TODAY'S STOP: DISNEY!
TODAY'S STOPS: http://www.disney.com/


As I hinted in last week's TOURBUS, we're going to Disneyland!! The Holy
Rodent Empire (a.k.a. The Walt Disney Company) is now on the World Wide Web
at

        http://www.disney.com/

The Disney homepage has hundreds of links to all things Disney, from Disney
publishing to the quite popular Disney theme parks.  As you would expect
from Disney, most of the Disney pages are heavy on graphics, so you will
probably need a graphical Web browser (like Netscape) to get the full
effect of the Disney pages.

You could spend literally hour after hour exploring the wealth of
information and fun stuff that can be found on the Disney pages, but if you
are running Netscape, you really should check out Disney's "SIGHTS &
SOUNDS" page.  From this page you can download HUNDREDS of pictures and
sounds from bunches of recent Disney movies and TV shows (sorry, folks --
no pictures of Annette (I looked)).  The SIGHTS & SOUND page also has
dozens of Quicktime video clips from "101 Dalmations" all the way through
to "Toy Story."

While all of these sound and video clips are pretty cool, what makes the
SIGHTS & SOUND page my favorite page on the Disney site is the "See the
Magic Kingdom" link off of the SIGHTS & SOUNDS page.  What makes the "See
the Magic Kingdom" page so cool?  Well, the folks at Disney have created
and are distributing a Quicktime VR image of Disney World's Main Street at
Christmas (which, by the way, is TOTALLY COOL)!

What in the heck is Quicktime VR?  Well, Quicktime VR is a virtual reality
engine created by the folks at Apple Computer (who said Apple was dead??)
that allows you to "fly" around in a specially formatted picture. For
example, Disney's Main Street Quicktime VR picture lets you "stand" in the
middle of Main Street and "turn" all the way around to see a complete 360
degree view of Main Street.

Quicktime VR runs on Macs (obviously), Windows, and Windows '95 machines,
and Apple is pretty much giving away the Quicktime VR viewer for FREE to
anyone who wants one.  How do you get a Quicktime VR viewer? Well, the kind
folks at Disney have set up a GREAT help menu system that will talk you
through how to get your own copy of Quicktime VR (or how to download and
configure dozens of other helper applications) ... just click on the HELP
button at the bottom of any Disney Web page. Or, better yet, just click on
the word HELP on the "See the Magic Kingdom" page.

Of course, flying around a picture of the Magic Kingdom is no substitute to
visiting a Disney park and standing in line for two hours to ride the
Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland (which, all kidding aside, was so
worth the wait that I rode it THREE times). If you want a more in-depth
view of the Magic Kingdom and the other Disney parks, you should certainly
check out the links on the main Disney homepage (http://www.disney.com/) to
both Disneyland (in California) and Walt Disney World (in Florida).  The
Disney homepage has links to MOUNTAINS of information about both of these
parks.  As a matter of fact, Disney has so much park information online
that if you are planning on visiting either park I would strongly recommend
that you take advantage of both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World "Tour
Guide" pages.  The Tour Guide pages help you customize your Disney trip,
and also help you easily sort through hundreds of different Disney Web
pages.

As you would expect, The Disney homepage also has some really cool stuff
for kids, too.  For example, if you click on the "Fun & Games" link on the
main Disney homepage (under the Disney title graphic), you'll be
transported to a page that has Disney coloring book pages from movies and
shows like Aladdin, Pocahontas, and The Lion King.  The coloring book pages
are in gif format, so you can download them, print them on your printer,
and then give them to your little kiddies :)

I spent a lot of time on the Disney pages, and I was impressed by what I
saw.  The only complaint that I have is that throughout my entire Disney
Web experience, I was reminded to "sign in" and register for this really
cool contest (I discovered that you don't have to do sign-in to explore
Disney's pages).  Unfortunately, the contest is only open to residents of
the United States ("its a small world after all").  Don't be too upset,
though -- the grand prize only has a retail value of $148 (US).

That's it for today. Have a GREAT and safe weekend :)
