           TODAY'S TOURBUS TOPIC:  Finding Internet Software
           TODAY'S TOURBUS SITE :  http://cws.iworld.com

When you're looking for a new piece of Internet software, the first
place to visit is Forrest Stroud's Consummate Winsock Apps site.  The
CWSAPPS site is chock full of categorized listings, reviews, and
recommendations for Windows-based Internet software.  Don't worry
Mac fans, we'll get to you in just a minute.

But first, a word from our kind sponsors of today's TOURBUS...

The first time I visited the CWSAPPS site, I was amazed at the diversity
of Internet software.  In addition to the stuff you might expect, such
as web browsers and e-mail programs, there are "client programs" for
stock tickers, weather forecasts, and news reports.  But the coolest thing
about the CWSAPPS site is the categorized list of apps, each of which is
reviewed and rated to help you decide which one is best for you.

            *** A Short Aside For the Technology Impaired ***
  [ Let's do a little terminology before we go any further.  The term  ]
  [ "app" is short for "application" and basically means "a program".  ]
  [ A "client" is any program that works over a network to bring you   ]
  [ information from another computer (or server).  Common clients are ]
  [ Netscape (web), Eudora (e-mail), and Free Agent (usenet).          ]

When you first arrive at the CWSAPPS site, click on "16-bit Apps" if
you're a Windows 3.1 user, or "32-bit Apps" if you run Windows 95 or NT.
If you're after something specific, such as HTML Editors, you can use
the search box to jump right to it.

Here are some other nifty things to look for at the CWSAPPS site:

  * Index Of Apps
    - A long list of about 400 winsock apps, sorted by name.

  * The Top 20 Apps List
    - The most frequently downloaded winsock apps.

  * Cool App Of The Week
    - A new Internet application is featured each week.

  * The CASPER Page

    - The Critical Applications Starter PackagE and Recommendations
      (CASPER for short) page is designed to supply new users with an
      inexpensive best of the 'net applications package.  These apps
      represent the best in their class and are the most important
      ones to have, whether you're a newbie or a cyber-guru.

      Surfing The 'Net On A Budget offers an inexpensive package of
      the best free and low-cost apps, and Nothing But The Very Best
      is a collection of the best apps for those with money to burn.

  * Menu Of Apps

    - Better than a Greek diner!  This hefty menu offers the following:
    Audio Apps, Communications Clients, Compression Utilities, FTP,
    Archie, Finger, Gophers, Graphics Viewers, HTML Editors, IRC Apps,
    E-Mail Clients, Multimedia Viewers, Agents, News Readers OnLine News,
    Plug-in Modules, Statistics Services, Stock Tickers, Terminal Apps
    Virus Scanners, VRML Browsers, WAIS, Weather Apps, Web Accessories,
    Web Graphic Tools, and Web Browsers.  Want ketchup with that, Honey?


HEY, WHAT ABOUT THAT MAC STUFF???

Okay, I did promise.  There's another site sort of like CWSAPPS, which
is called TUCOWS - The Ultimate Collection of Winsock Apps.  The address
is http://www.tucows.com and contrary to the name, this site DOES have
a very nice section with listings of Internet software for the Mac.

TUCOWS is bogged down with lots of graphics, and it lacks the in-depth
reviews found at the CWSAPPS site, so don't bother with this one
unless you're after the Mac stuff.  You can also find a listing of Mac
Internet applications at The University of Texas website.  The address
for this one is: http://wwwhost.ots.utexas.edu/mac/internet.html


THE UGLY BUS IS NO MORE

Things must be a little slow down at the UofA...  Patrick found himself
with too much time on his hands and created a really cool logo for the
new TOURBUS website.  Take a look!      http://www.TOURBUS.com
