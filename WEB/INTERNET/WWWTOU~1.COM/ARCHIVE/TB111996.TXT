           TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: CAR BUYING ON THE WEB

Auto accidents are no fun.  And shopping for a new car isn't much
better.  But using the Web to shop for a new car can make the
experience much easier, and gives you information even the slickest
sales staff can't refute.

Today's TOURBUS posting is full of car buying tips from netizen Anne
Desautels, who recently bought a new VW and saved a bundle using the
Web.  And speaking of savings, be sure to check out the magazine deals
from today's sponsor before we drive off...

Step One:  Do Your Homework
---------------------------

If you don't already know what car to buy, check out web sites like
Edmunds Auto Guides, http://www.edmunds.com to research items like
safety, resale value, recalls and service incidents, cost of
ownership, cost of insurance, performance, driving pleasure, etc.

The data is often surprising and may point out new options you weren't
aware of.  Plus, advance look at what the total financial impact will
be (insurance, service, resale value, etc.) can help make your choice
easier.  Another great web site for similar background research is
Kelley's Blue Book, http://www.kbb.com.

Step Two: Check the Dealer and Manufacturer Web Sites
-----------------------------------------------------

I started with the VW web site, http://www.vw.com/cars - since I'm
hooked on VWs, but the same 'name.com' nomenclature typically works
for other companies and pubs.  Other sites for new and used cars
include CARveat Emptor at http://www.well.com/user/kr2/car12.html, The
Auto Buyers's Connection, http://www.auto-connect.com, AutoWeb
Interactive at http://www.autoweb.com, AutoSite at
http://www.autosite.com, AutoReach at http://www.autoreach.com.

My favorite and the one I used successfully, is Auto-By-Tel at
http://www.autobytel.com.  Almost every site includes car photos, and
some sport links to insurance agencies, local dealerships, travel
agencies (go figure) and AAA.

Step Three:  Pull and Print Data
--------------------------------

Most of the web sites show both the invoice and retail prices.  I
noted that the prices for my Jetta shown on Edmunds, and Kelley's,
were a couple of hundred dollars off - because of the popularity of
the GLX and the scarce number of available cars.

The same sites also hold info that factors into the pricing equation,
such as rebates, incentives, luxury taxes, destination charges,
advertising charges and other items that may or may not be negotiable.
You also see what every accessory costs, what comes standard, etc.
Holding a printout that lists the invoice and retail cost, along with
the cost for every available feature makes it much harder to be
railroaded by a salesperson.

Step Three and a Half: Using Auto-By-Tel
----------------------------------------

If you opt for the Auto-By-Tel route, you'll fill in a web form which
goes to the datacenter server, and an actual car request (specific
make, model, color of interior and exterior, accessories, and price
range.) The Auto-By-Tel service checks the dealers in the service group
for your car at the best price.  You'll then either receive a call or
email, depending on your choice of contact, typically within a few
days.

Step Four:  The Negotiations Begin
----------------------------------

Some of the best tips I learned from talking to over 25 dealers in
search of my GLX include:

  * Call first - ask for the sales manager or largest volume
    salesperson.  These folks are typically less hungry and more
    willing to work with you while respecting your web research.

  * Tell the sales rep you're paying cash.  That you have a price
    in mind, have gotten prices from other dealerships, and want to
    see what this dealership is willing to do for you, using the
    dealer invoice price as base, of course.

  * Once you get a price, ask for the quote to be faxed to you.
    Whether you have a fax or not, this will be a clear indication of
    the honesty and integrity of the offer if the dealer is willing
    to fax a quote.

  * If you can't get someone to fax a price, get the person's name,
    and their bosses name.  Make a specific appointment to meet.

  * If you have time, call you bank or credit union and get a cashier's
    check for the amount of either the AutoByTel quote, or the amount
    you're willing to spend.  If you have cash in hand, no dealer is
    likely to let you walk.

  * Once you're there, state the price you have in mind, show your
    check - wave it around a bit, even - and then sit tight while the
    usual baloney washes over you.  With a printout of the invoice and
    the car's retail value, plus a check in hand, you'll invariably get
    your deal.  But if you don't like the way you're being treated, get
    up and walk out.  You won't get very far, and you'll have the upper
    hand in the negotiation.

That's it!  You should be able to get a new car using the web with much
less hassle than a person heading into the showroom without the right
info.  Try it, it worked for me. - Anne Desautels (anne@mail.bando.com)
