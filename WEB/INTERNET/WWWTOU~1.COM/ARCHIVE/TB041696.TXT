TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: Speaking Geek

   
   Hooray! I've just finished six months of work on my upcoming book,
   "Doctor Bob's Painless Guide To The Internet and Amazing Things You
   Can Do With E-Mail". My publisher and I keenly sensed a lack of
   Internet books with really long titles, so that explains the name.
   
   Stay tuned over the next few weeks for details on availability. In the
   mean time, you can get my "Goodies" guide by checking out the deals at
   one of our kind sponsors...

   Today I've got a glossary of terms that will help as you explore the
   Internet on your own. You'll no doubt encounter many of these words in
   your travels, so bone up now on your Geek and you'll be prepared when
   the acronyms, buzzwords, and euphemisms start flying!
   
   I threw a few zingers in just to lighten things up a little. And I
   sincerely hope I haven't accidentally used any Yiddish profanities in
   the process. :-)
   
   Glossing Over The Internet
   --------------------------
   
   
   ASCII - A plain text format that can be displayed on any computer;
   acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
   
   Baud - A measure of modem speed. One baud can be thought of as one bit
   per second. (True geeks will foam at the mouth when you say that,
   though.) A single character is composed of eight bits of data.
   
   Browser - A piece of software that displays World-Wide Web documents,
   such as Netscape, Mosaic or Lynx. When the saleslady at the cybermall
   asks "Can I help you?", just say "No thanks, I'm only browsing."
   
   Cyber-Splat - The tendency to prefix words with "cyber" just because
   they are remotely related to the Internet. Evokes a collective gag
   reflex at parties.
   
   FAQ - A document that provides answers to frequently asked questions
   on a specific topic. Common usage: "Read the FAQ, Bozo."
   
   FTP - File Transfer Protocol, or File Transfer Program. An exercise
   which creates input for PKUNZIP such that it will invariably reply
   "ZIP file corrupt".
   
   Flame - Expression of a strong opinion or criticism, often directed at
   the clueless, tactless or FAQ-less.
   
   HTML - Hypertext markup language, the language used to create and
   format documents for by display by a World-Wide Web browser.
   
   Hypertext - A system of linking documents together such that a simple
   text file takes on the proportions of a Michener novel.
   
   IMHO - Acronym for "In My Humble Opinion". Commonly used in electronic
   discussions by pompous jerks who think they're never wrong.
   
   Internet - A computer network that connects 400 billion people in 17
   galaxies, or something like that.
   
   IRC - Internet Relay Chat, a multi-user chat system that enables
   people to create silly nicknames and pretend they are good-looking.
   
   Lurking - To hang out in a mailing list or Usenet group in mortal fear
   that your first posting will result in "Read the FAQ, Bozo."
   
   Newsreader - A software program used to read and post Usenet messages.
   Examples are FreeAgent (for Windows) and NewsWatcher (for Macintosh).
   
   PPP - Point to Point Protocol. A communication method that allows a
   personal computer to be directly connected to the Internet using a
   standard voice telephone line.
   
   Packet - A blob of data sent over a network. Each packet includes a
   message, the identity of the sender and receiver, and instructions for
   making a bomb out of cow manure.
   
   RTFM - Read The Fine Manual, a retort to another user who has asked a
   common question that can be answered by reading the available
   documentation. (The word "fine" is commonly replaced by a more vulgar
   substitute.)
   
   TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, a set of
   rules that enables different types of computers to insult each other
   in their native language and still understand what is being said.
   
   UNIX - A computer operating system designed by geeks on drugs.
   Unfortunately it was the foundation for the development of the
   Internet and is the platform on which many Internet computers operate.
