           TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: Interactive Maps

Recently I saw a classified ad for a used car, which of course listed
a contact phone number.  Since I'm naturally curious, I wondered if
there was a way to use the Internet to find out something about the
owner of that car before dialing the number.

Turns out there was... and the technology is pretty exciting.  More
and more, cyberspace and the "real world" are becoming one, as folks
add services that make it possible to query based on phone number
and physical addresses via the Web.

Before we go further in today's tour, I'd like to encourage a little
detour to the people that made it possible.  Aardwulf has a really
cool online store that'll knock your socks off.  But that's not a
problem, they sell socks and a whole lot more.  :-)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
     AARDWULF Apparel offers quality brands like Timberland and
        Calvin Klein at prices you can only get on the Web!
+--------------------( http://www.aardwulf.com )---------------------+

So there I was, phone number in hand.  I remembered that there was this
nifty thingamajig (I'll try to avoid any more technical terms, sorry) at
http://phone.yahoo.com that lets you enter a phone number and see the
name and address of the person with that number.

Tappity, tappity, click... and bingo!  I had an address for the car
seller.  Now I could pop over and see the car without even calling the
owner first, heh heh.  But "Boynton Lane" sounded pretty far out in the
boonies - it sure would be nice to find that on the map.

Being an Internet kind of guy, I pondered for a nanosecond about
pulling out my tattered paper map but thought better of it.  Too much
of an 80's thing, and I was never very good at origami.  A few more
clicks took me to...

Interactive Maps at http://www.mapblast.com
-------------------------------------------

...which is a very cool place, because you can get street maps for most
any U.S. address (European maps are coming soon).  And best of all, you
don't have to fold the darn thing when you're done.

MapBlast lets you type in a street address and city name, then presents
you with a detailed interactive map of the area.  It even puts a little
red "X" right on the spot you're after.

The first time you try this, you will be amazed.  You can even pan or
zoom in to get a closer look.  I'm fully expecting that any day now,
they'll hook this thing up to a live satellite video camera so you can
see the dog barking in the back yard of the house you've located.  :-)

It's really not outside the realm of possibility, and just imagine how
that could revolutionize the way we shop for houses, plan vacations or
well, enough pie in the sky for now...

Just for kicks, I tried "8500 63rd Avenue North" in "Brooklyn Park, MN"
to see if I could find the Aardwulf building, since they listed the
address on their web site. Hey there it is, right between Xylon and
Zealand Avenues!

MapBlast is smart enough to find what you're after even if you spell
the street name wrong, and you can also send a map to a friend by e-mail.
You can find instructions there to add a map to your web site, which
could give a new whole meaning to the phrase "home page".

See you next time.  --Bob
