Howdy all - I decided to devote today's posting to some offbeat
sites that were brought to my attention by TOURBUS riders over the
past year.  It's an eclectic mix of useful, interesting and funny.
Each site is worth a visit!

-- A little aside: If you're using an e-mail reader with a font that
-- is NOT monospaced, that horrible mess of dashes and slashes at the
-- top of each TOURBUS posting is a BUS!  Use a font like Courier or
-- FixedSys for your e-mail and you'll enjoy TOURBUS even more.

But before you set off, make sure you take the time to check out
the good stuff offered by our sponsors - they make TOURBUS possible.

Lighthouse Getaway Site - http://www.lib.utk.edu/lights.html
============================================================

  Several months back I came across this wonderful Web site, "Bill's
  Lighthouse Getaway".  Since that time it has expanded and received
  a top 5% Web site rating. I thought that the TourBus just might like
  to take a tour with close to 100 lighthouse images.  They are well
  worth the effort.  The site belongs to William A. Britten, Systems
  Librarian at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville Libraries.

AuctionWeb - http://www.ebay.com/aw
===================================

  It's an online auction where you can buy and sell stuff!  And the
  best part, it's free!  (for sales under $100).  I've sold all sorts
  of "junk" in no time at all.  A great example of some innovative
  use of the WWW.

Limericks - http://www.webcom.com/texasred/garden.html
          - http://www.vertechinc.com/limerick.html
======================================================

  While researching for our limerick contest, we discovered a whole
  subculture of limericks and nonsense poetry on the web.  One of the
  sites is The Limerick Garden...
  -- Peg Kay (vertech@cpcug.org)

  Oh, here's a sample from the Limerick Garden.  My kinda poetry. ;-)

    A silly old gardener named Pottem
    Complained of a frostbitten bottom.
    When it rained on his plants
    He remembered his pants,
    But whenever it snowed he forgot 'em.


Zip2 Door-to-Door - http://www.zip2.com
=======================================

  Your Tourbus of today reminded me of a neato & zorch site I learned
  about a few days ago.  You can type in a starting address (only for
  certain U.S. metro areas, unfortunately) and a destination address
  and it comes back within just a second or two with complete, plain
  English step-by-step directions for getting from the starting location
  to the destination.  With step by step incremental mileage details
  to boot.  And total distance and time.  It is amazing.

Year 2000 - http://www.year2000.com
===================================

  Enjoyed the virus roadmap.  Somewhat related but not quite a virus
  is the Year 2000 computing problem.  We have a site with tons of
  stuff on it.  The site was recently shown on CNN, and mentioned in
  the Wall Street Journal and in FORTUNE.
