           TODAY'S TOURBUS TOPIC: More Fun & Games

Welcome back - glad you could join me for another week of cyber-touring.
I happy to announce that the World's Biggest Bus now has a home of it's
own on the web!  We're grateful to Joel Comm at WorldVillage.Com for
providing that service in the past, but the time has come for a bigger
garage.  Pop over to

TOURBUS archives, the TOURBUS FAQ, and subscription information.  Please

A Daily Dose of Fun
-------------------

Looking for some plain old fun on the web?  Check out duJour.com at

	http://www.dujour.com

It's chock full of games and contests that are guaranteed to challenge and
annoy you.  Try the riddles, puzzles, and games that change every day,
you'll have big fun, and you might win a prize from one of the sponsors. 

Here's a quick rundown of some of nifty activities I found while
exploring the duJour.com site:

 * Riddle du Jour  - A brain bending riddle each day, submitted by a
                     duJour visitor.

 * GIFspiel        - Colored blocks obscure part of a picture, with more
                     revealed each day.  Can you identify the image?

 * Ce Jour         - What happened today in history?  Intriguing stuff.

 * Jacques du Jour - Play virtual blackjack with cyber-funny-money.

 * MondoTrivia     - Find out if you have a life.  (Hint: If you know the
                     answer to any of these, you probably don't.)

 * The Labyrinth   - Navigate the "hallway from heck" and save Athens from
                     the ravages of King Minos and his pet Minotaur.

 * Word Angst      - One of those Annoying But Perversely Fun word games.


This is one of those sites you'll want to bookmark and visit often, because
each day there's lots of new stuff.
