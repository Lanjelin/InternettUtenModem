Hi, kids!  "I sent you this letter because your e-mail address was on a
list that fit this category." (I'M KIDDING!) :)

Actually, we have a lot to talk about today, so let's pay some bills and
get the latest tour of our little bus of Internet happiness underway.  I do
want thank today's TOURBUS sponsor, not only for making today's post
possible, but for also offering some of the lowest clothing prices I have
seen in a long time (something that, as a continuously poor college
student, I deeply appreciate).  :)

Let's bring everybody up to date on everything that I know so far about the
"child porn spam":

Early on the morning of Monday, October 21st, e-mail letters were
distributed to thousands of unsuspecting Internet users around the world,
advertising child pornography for sale through "snail mail" from an
apartment in New York City.  Within minutes of the child porn spam being
distributed, THOUSANDS of local, state, and federal police agencies around
the world were flooded with complaints from angry Internet users who
received the spam.  According to a news.com report, a police officer in the
New York Police Department reported that their vice squad has "been getting
calls from all over the world since [Monday] morning -- from Germany,
Norway, Sweden -- everybody."

I recently told you that "I personally believe that the [child porn spam]
is a 'spoof,' written by someone who decided it would be funny to exact
some sort of revenge on 'Steve Barnard.'" [Steve Barnard's name was listed
in the child porn spam as the point of contact].  I recently heard from
Steve Barnard -- well, I heard from *a* Steve Barnard ... I'm not sure if
he is *the* Steve Barnard in question  -- who denies any involvement in
this.

The FBI seems to agree with Steve.  In a prepared statement, the FBI said
that the child porn spam "message is a hoax and the matter is being
investigated."

The FBI's statement goes on to say that the child porn spam letters appear
to have been sent from two accounts at America Online.  Reuters reports
that America Online responded by announcing that the accounts had been
disconnected Monday morning and the service's legal department was also
investigating the matter.  [The FBI also reports that hackers have, in the
past, established bogus America Online accounts using stolen credit card
numbers and the sign-up disks the service widely distributes by mail and in
magazines].

According to Bill Rubin in a post he made to the Spam Prevention Discussion
List <SPAM-L@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM>, thousands of complaints about the child
porn spam letter have been filed with law enforcement agencies.  The FBI
visited the address listed in the child porn spam, which was the address of
a company that rents post office boxes.  The FBI and police questioned the
company's manager for several hours.

The FBI also visited the person who owned both of the America Online
addresses from which the child porn spam letters were originally
distributed.  He claims that he did not post the letters, but the FBI
confiscated his PC as evidence.  According to Bill Rubin in his SPAM-L
post, the FBI has found no evidence of the child porn spam mailing on the
suspect's system.

That's pretty much all I know right now.  I pulled my information from a
couple of resources that you may want to visit on your own, including:

     U.S. says FBI investigating pornography e-mail
     Reuters - Mercury Mail
     http://www.merc.com/stories/cgi/story.cgi?id=361137-9a0

     "Porn spam sparks investigation"
     Janet Kornblum - news.com
     http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,4669,00.html

With that out of the way, let's start answering the questions that everyone
REALLY wants to ask ...

     Q: What is a "spam?"

     A: A spam is the Internet equivalent of junk mail.  Spams are
        usually unsolicited advertisements sent to tens of thousands
        of Internet users at once.  Spams also take the form of
        totally untrue stories that continue to float around the Net
        for years.  Some of these untrue stories include story of a
        boy who is dying of a brain tumor and who wants you to send
        him your business cards, how there is a virus in e-mail
        letters with the subject line "Good Times,"  how Neiman Marcus
        charged someone $250 for a cookie recipe, and how you can
        "Make Money Fast" by sending a chain letter to 10 of your
        friends.

     Q: Why is an unsolicited advertisement called a spam?

     A: I'll warn you up front that you really have to be a Monty
        Python fan to understand this.  The term "spam" comes from the
        Monty Python diner sketch where the waitress says "well
        there's egg and bacon; egg, sausage and bacon; egg and spam;
        bacon and spam; egg, bacon, sausage and spam; spam, bacon,
        sausage and spam; spam, egg, spam, spam, bacon and spam; spam,
        spam, spam, egg and spam; spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam,
        baked beans, spam, spam, spam and spam; or lobster thermidor
        aux crevettes with a mornay sauce garnished with truffle
        pate', brandy and a fried egg on top of spam."  Meanwhile, in
        the background, a group of Vikings in the sketch randomly sing
        the "spam" song (you *really* have to have seen the sketch to
        understand).

        Well, when an unsolicited advertisement is sent to a Usenet
        newsgroup or LISTSERV list, a great many clueless people send
        their angry replies not to the sender of the advertisement but
        rather to the newsgroup or list on which the advertisement was
        originally posted. The real conversation on the newsgroup or
        list (the "food") is soon smothered by the discussion, and
        complaints about, the unsolicited advertisement (the "spam").

     Q: The child porn spam says that the letter was sent to me
        because my "e-mail address was on a list that fit this
        category."  How did I get on such a list?

     A: You didn't.  Folks, I hate to break this to you, but the
        spammer lied.  If you received the child porn spam, the only
        category that you fit in is that you have an e-mail address.
        The reason that the spammer said that you fit into a
        particular "category" was to keep you interested in reading
        the rest of his spam.

     Q: How do spammers get my e-mail address?

     A: I honestly don't know.  I do know, however, that there are
        hundreds of files of e-mail addresses that can be found all
        over the Internet.  One TOURBUS reader found a Web page full
        of e-mail addresses here at the University of Alabama, and
        Mark Trevino found a 92 Kb file at NCSA that has nothing but
        e-mail addresses.  In short, e-mail addresses are all over the
        place.

     Q: How can I keep my e-mail address private?

     A: Outside of never using it, you can't.  There are a couple of
        tricks, however, that will help you keep your e-mail address a
        little less public:

             1. "Conceal" your e-mail address on every LISTSERV list
                that you are subscribed to.  This prevents people from
                reviewing the list and finding your e-mail address [by
                the way, you don't have to do this if you are
                subscribed to any of the LISTSERV lists that I own --
                my lists are set up so that the only person who can
                see your subscription address is me].  To conceal your
                address, just send an e-mail letter to

                   LISTSERV@LISTS.INTERNIC.NET

                with the command

                   SET listname CONCEAL

                in the body of your e-mail letter, replacing
                "listname" with the name of the list to which you are
                subscribed.

             2. Your Web browser may be telling the owners of the Web
                sites that you visit more about you than you may know.
                Thanks to something called "cookies" (which we won't
                talk about today) the Web sites that you visit may be
                able to find out what type of computer you are using,
                what your name is, and even what your e-mail address
                is.

                You can, however, "hide" your real address from prying
                Web sites by telling your Web browser that your e-mail
                address is something like "noname@good.bye.bye."
                [Please use a *fake* e-mail address.  You make think
                that changing your e-mail address in your browser to
                president@whitehouse.gov is funny, but the Secret
                Service will probably disagree.] This won't work if
                you use your Web browser to read your e-mail, though.

                Here's how to locate the address and names field that
                you need to change (remember, if you use your browser
                to read your e-mail, please do not do this):

                   Netscape Navigator 1

                      Options --> Preferences --> Mail and News

                   Netscape Navigator 2

                      Options --> Mail and News Preferences -->
                      Identity

                   Netscape Navigator 3

                      Options --> Mail & News Preferences --> Identity

                   Microsoft Internet Explorer 2

                      Edit --> Options ... --> Mail  News

                   Microsoft Internet Explorer 3

                      Brother Bill has yet to release a Mac version of
                      IE 3, so I'm not really sure where the name and
                      address fields are located in this version :(

     Q: What should I do if I get spammed?

     A: Your best bet is to delete the spam and go on with your life.
        If you don't want to choose this route, however, you have a
        few options [taken from my Roadmap workshop]:

        First, NEVER reply to the group.  The spammer won't read it.
        He is interested in talking, not listening, and he is not a
        list member or a regular reader.  Your angry posting will only
        annoy the other members of the group and will not affect the
        spammer in the slightest.

        Second, if you have a lot of time on your hands, you may read
        the responses of members who ignored my first bit of advice.

        Third, if you have even more time on your hands, reply to the
        poster at his own e-mail address.  But you may not get
        satisfaction.  Quite often spammers hit and run, and by the
        time you get back to yell at them, they have closed out their
        accounts (or if their site administrator is on her toes, they
        will have had their accounts closed by the administrator).

        Fourth, if you are even angrier at the spammer, you can write
        to the administrator of his site.  If the spammer is
        CLOWN@CIRCUS.COM, his administrator is POSTMASTER@CIRCUS.COM

     Q: Who should I contact if I receive a spam that contains
        "illegal" stuff (like the child porn spam)?

     A: Your best bet is to contact your own site's postmaster or
        network security administrator and let them handle it.  Most
        companies, schools, and large Internet Service Providers have
        full-time security experts whose job is to work closely with
        law enforcement agencies on matters of network safety and
        security.

        You may decide to contact an appropriate law enforcement
        agency.  One word of warning though: if you receive an illegal
        spam at work, make sure to contact your employer's network
        security administrator *BEFORE* you contact any law
        enforcement officials!  Network security people tend to get a
        little upset if you go behind their backs and contact the
        police, and your little act of good net citizenship may get
        you a reprimand in your personnel file.

        If you do decide to contact a law enforcement agency, which
        one should you contact?  It depends on where you live, and
        where the spam is from.  If you live in the United States and
        you are sure that the illegal spam crossed state lines,
        contact the FBI (your local FBI office's number can be found
        in the phone book).  Otherwise, contact your local police
        department and ask for an officer knowledgeable about
        "computer crimes."

        One word of warning, though: don't expect your local police
        department or local FBI office to know *ANYTHING* about the
        Internet or computers.  As a matter of fact, when I turned in
        the child porn spammer to the Tuscaloosa FBI office, they had
        me *fax* a copy of the spammer's e-mail letter to them.  :)

That's it for this week!  Remember, if you get spammed, you best bet is to
just delete it and go on with your life!  :)
