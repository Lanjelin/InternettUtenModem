TODAY'S STOP:      MORE INTERNET HOAXES/WEB COLOR/LOVE CALCULATOR

Today's tour is going to be a little different.  Instead of focusing on one
major site or tool on the Net, today we are going to focus on three smaller
(although equally cool) sites.

Before we do that, however, your fearless bus driver would like to give a
special thanks to the folks at Mass Music for making today's TOURBUS post
possible:

Make sure you drop by Mass Music's web page and thank them for keeping our
little bus of Internet happiness on the road for another week!  :)

EVEN *MORE* URBAN LEGENDS AND VIRUS HOAXES
------------------------------------------

Our first stop is the U.S. Department of Energy's "Computer Incident
Advisory Capability" Internet Hoaxes homepage at

     http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html

The nice folks at the Department of Energy created the Internet Hoaxes
homepage because they were "spending much more time de-bunking hoaxes than
handling real virus incidents."  What makes this page cool is that the
Department of Energy tells you some of the history of hoaxes on the
Internet, how to identify a new hoax warning, how to identify a
validated warning, and what to do if you think a message is a hoax.

You may also remember that we visited a similar virus hoax site on December
5th: the Computer Virus Myths page at

     http://www.kumite.com/myths/

Both the Internet Hoaxes page and the Computer Virus Myths page are updated
frequently -- the former was last updated on February 3rd, the latter on
the 4th (and I am writing this post on February 5th) -- so make sure that
you check these sites OFTEN for the *latest* news from the virus hoax
front.  :)

By the way, while most virus hoaxes -- Deeyenda, Penpal Greetings, Good
Times, etc. -- are downright annoying, I recently received an absolutely
hysterical virus hoax message that I thought that you'd enjoy:

     There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet.
     If you receive an e-mail message with the subject line "Free
     Money," DO NOT read the message.  DELETE it immediately, UNPLUG
     your computer, then BURN IT to ASHES in a government-approved
     toxic waste disposal INCINERATOR.

     Once a computer is infected, it will be TOO LATE.  Your computer
     will begin to emit a vile ODOR.  Then it will secrete a foul,
     milky DISCHARGE.  Verily, it shall SCREECH with the tortured,
     monitor-shattering SCREAM of 1,000 hell-scorched souls, drawing
     unwanted attention to your cubicle from co-workers and
     supervisors alike.  After violently ripping itself from the wall,
     your computer will punch through your office window as it STREAKS
     into the night, HOWLING like a BANSHEE.  Once free, it will spend
     the rest of its days TORTURING household PETS and MOCKING the
     POPE.

     Some filthy, disgusting miscreant ... some no-good, low-down,
     good-for-nothing DIRTY SNAKE, in twisted pursuit of her own
     sadistic dreams, is sending this virus across the Net via an e-
     mail entitled "Free Money."  What is so terrifying about this
     virus is that you do not even to have to open the e-mail for it
     to activate.  In fact, you do not even need to RECEIVE the e-
     mail.  You do not even need to OWN a COMPUTER.  "Free Money" can
     infect even minor HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES.

     How it does this with straight ASCII code is, frankly, a matter
     of some debate ... but BELIEVE YOU US, if this weren't a SERIOUS
     situation, we wouldn't be discussing it in ALL CAPS.

     So for the LOVE OF GOD, forward this e-mail to all those you
     claim to care about, all those you purport to love. Don't do it
     later! Do it NOW! Now! Now! NOW! NOW! NOW!

COLOR ON THE WEB
----------------

On to more serious stuff.  Have you ever visited a Web page that looked
absolutely incredible on a Macintosh, but when you went to view the page on
a PC it looked downright awful?  Why does this happen?!

Well, if you want to find the answer to this often-asked question, or if
you are planning on adding color pictures and other graphics to your own
Web page sometime in the future, I *strongly* recommend that you read
Adobe's article called "The Discriminating Color Palette" at

     http://www.adobe.com/newsfeatures/palette/main.html

This article is pretty technical, and it is also (naturally) biased towards
Photoshop (a program that Adobe sells), but its explanation of how
computers define and display colors is the best I have seen anywhere, and
is a must read for ANYONE considering creating their own Web graphics.  If
you have no idea what dithering is or why it happens, whether you should
use the GIF or JPEG file formats, or what a color palette is, this article
is for you!

YEAH, BUT DO YOU LOVE ME IN BASE 8?!
------------------------------------

Finally, do you remember those paper origami finger thingies that you made
in third grade that supposedly told you if you were compatible with
someone?  You remember -- you'd spell out the person's name and favorite
color, and then lift a flap to find the message "you have cooties."

Well, with Valentines Day (EEEK! The *V* word!) just around the corner, it
is no surprise that someone has finally created a replacement for the paper
origami thingy.  If you have a JavaScript-enabled Web browser (like
Netscape or Internet Explorer), you *have* to check out the Love Calculator
at

     http://www.xs4all.nl/~kink/love

If you type in the first and last names of two people, the Love Calculator
will calculate the probability on a successful relationship (DOUBLE EEEK!
The *R* word!) between those two people.  For example, "Bob Rankin" and
"Kermit the Frog" score and amazing 88% on the Love Calculator!

The love calculator has absolutely no basis in scientific fact -- I
personally believe that it, much like the que monitor in FTPmail, simply
generates a random number -- but it is a neat way for you to kill a few
minutes and use that fancy JavaScript-enabled Web browser of yours. :)

That's it for this week!  Have a safe and happy weekend!  :)

TODAY'S SOUTHERN WORD OF THE DAY
--------------------------------

I told you that today's tour was going to be different ... anyway, today's
Southern word is "vertigo."  Here is the story behind the word:

     "I am an ear, nose and throat MD.  A patient came to my office
     because of dizziness.  My nurse asked him if he had vertigo. He
     said "No'm, I just live down the road."

(A special thanks goes out to John Burson (MD) for today's word)
