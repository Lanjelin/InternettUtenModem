                   TODAY'S TOURBUS STOP: THE E-MAIL CLUB

           "Transport of the mails, transport of the human voice,
         transport of flickering pictures - In this century, as in
       others, our highest accomplishments still have the single aim
           of bringing men together." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

WHAT IS THE E-MAIL CLUB?

When I first heard about the E-Mail Club, I thought it might be a new
tool to combat spammers.  You know, like a mail-bomb, but not so subtle.
"Get The Club today.  Whack a spammer and you'll feel great!"  I was
Wrong-O on that count, but I'm still glad I found The E-Mail Club.

BUT YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD US WHAT THIS E-MAIL CLUB THINGIE IS.

Oh, right. The purpose of The E-Mail Club is to provide a safe
and interesting place for people to make contacts using their
computers.  People who join the E-Mail Club receive a directory with
personal profiles of club members, so it's easy to find someone with
common interests and correspond by e-mail.

There are close to 1000 club members in the US, England, France,
Germany, and 30 other countries around the world.  Here's an actual
member profile (e-mail address removed for privacy):

>  Hi! I'm a 48 yr old female Client Services Officer, living in New
>  Zealand. I enjoy travel, meeting people, making friends, and love to
>  write. I am new on the Internet, and really enjoy all it has to offer.
>  I am honest, and like others to be "up front" also. I will answer
>  all who would care to email me. My mailbox is empty; boo hoo! - Janet

Just makes ya want to cry, don't it?  :-)

HOW DID THE CLUB GET STARTED?

The E-Mail Club was started in 1994 by Stewart Ogilby, a Florida retiree
who learned about computers to help his granddaughter with hers. "What's
amazing about our members," notes Ogilby, "is the help and encouragement
they give each other. People may be on different sides of the globe, but
they all want to find new ways to make friends, exchange information,
and enjoy personal contacts."

Most members are aged 40 and up, and many have professional backgrounds.
Ogilby stresses that the Club is not intended as a "Meet Market" or a
dating club. He maintains a polite atmosphere in the club newsletter,
and encourages all participants to do likewise.

HOW DO I JOIN?  IS IT FREE?

To automatically receive information about the E-Mail Club along with
an application, send any message to "emailclub@mailback.com".  There
is a one-time fee of ten dollars for a lifetime membership, but there
are no monthly dues.  The membership fee pays the monthly expenses of
the Club and enables it to grow for everyone's benefit.

New members receive the Membership Directory, which contains the first
name, e-mail address, and personal profile of Club members who wish to
exchange e-mail.  Every month all members are sent the Club's newsletter
with profiles of the month's new members.

The Club also has a dedicated IRC chat channel, which you can learn
about by visiting http://www.emailclub.com/livechat.html on the Web.

       via the Web and had an Internet Pasta party.  True geeks!
