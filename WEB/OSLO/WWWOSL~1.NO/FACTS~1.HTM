<b>Population</b><br>
Oslo is the capital city of Norway, and has in excess of 480,000
inhabitants. About 20% of the country's population (850,000) live in
Greater Oslo.


<p>
<b>Geography</b><br>

Oslo city's reference point is 59deg.55"N 10deg.45"E, as far north as,
for example, Helsinki, St. Petersburg, the northerly part of
Kamchatka, Anchorage in Alaska and Kap Farvel in Greenland.
<p>

Its area covers 454 km2 (175 sq miles), of which 242 km2 (93 sq miles)
are forest, 8 km2 (3 sq miles) parkland and recreational areas, 40
islands and 343 inland lakes.

<b>Climate</b><br>

Even though the city is situated so far north, its climate is
temperate in the autumn and warm in spring and summer. There is
usually snow 3 to 5 months of the winter, and skiing conditions are
good in the hills around Oslo between December and April. From May to
July the weather can be quite warm with long periods of sunshine.
Drought can also occur from time to time. This is due to Oslo's
northerly position, well protected by the mountains from Atlantic
rainfall, and favourable help from the Gulf Stream. Statistically
speaking, Oslo is Scandinavia's sunniest capital.

<p>

<b>Holiday, sport and leisure</b><br>

Oslo is surrounded by forest and fjord. An important part of the
city's political tradition is to preserve the fjord and the area
surrounding the city for leisure and outdoor pursuits. Oslomarka is
used by thousands of skiers and hikers all the year round thanks to
restrictions in the urbanization of the city.
<p>

Some of the major sports events in Oslo will be the Grete Waitz Race,
the Holmenkollen Relay, Oslo Marathon and the Holmenkollen Ski
Festival.
<p>

Oslo is a ski-eldorado with over 2,000 km (1250 miles) of prepared ski
tracks for cross-country skiing and many ski lifts for alpine skiing.
The tracks are also used throughout the rest of the year: Bærumsmarka,
Nordmarka and Østmarka are all places where many people meet every
weekend.
