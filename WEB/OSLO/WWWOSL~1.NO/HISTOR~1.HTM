In the 8th century a settlement was built right at the top of the Oslo
Fjord. This little Norwegian village grew rapidly during Viking times:
agriculture, trade and shipbuilding were important commercial
activities, and Oslo has truly earned its title of "Viking Capital".
<p>

Oslo was founded long after the town had been developed by the
Vikings. It was not until 1048 that Harald Hardråde (half-brother of
St. Olav - Norway's patron saint) discovered that Oslo was a thriving
community with a port and agriculture. The founding of the city took
place in the turbulent period between the Viking Age and Norway's
Catholic Middle Ages. Many remnants and ruins can be found from
Ancient Oslo in the Memorial Park. The city has a fascinating,
interesting and dramatic history. Oslo's population was substantially
reduced during the time of the Black Death in 1348 which claimed over
50% of the inhabitants. This epidemic also had political consequences
for Norway, which became reduced to a province of Denmark. During this
period Copenhagen was the actual capital of Norway. Oslo was also
greatly affected by the Lutheran-Protestant Reformation of 1537, with
religious conflicts, political separation from the Catholic Church and
the foundation of a Protestant National Church. Many ruins of churches
and monasteries (for example Cistersienserklosteret - the Cistercian
Abbey - on Hovedøya) bear witness to this process.
<p>

In 1624 Oslo was completely destroyed by a fire which was purportedly started by four witches. The Renaissance King,
Christian IV of Denmark and Norway, decided to move Oslo from what we
today call the Old Town, and rebuild it under the protective shadow of
Akershus Festning (Akershus Fortress). Following intense renewal and
advanced town planning in the spirit of the Renaissance, a completely
new city was created and named Christiania in 1624. After 1814 Norway
was united with Sweden, and Christiania experienced very strong
economic and political growth with substantial expansion right up
until the dissolution of the union with Sweden and independence in
1905. After the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Christiania in
1924, it was decided that the original name of Oslo was to be
re-instated as of 1 January 1925.
