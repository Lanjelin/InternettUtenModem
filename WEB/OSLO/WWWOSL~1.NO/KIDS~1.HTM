Families with children will have a rewarding task when they visit Oslo and have
to "find something the children will enjoy". We recommend in particular the
amusement park <A HREF="../tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#7" tppabs="http://www.norgesparken.no/norgesparken/">Tusenfryd</A>, a few kilometres south of Oslo.<p>
	Many of the best choices of entertainment for children are those offered by
the large establishments: theatres, opera, cinema and museums.<p><br> <br>

Several circuses regularly visit Oslo. If you come here during summer you stand a good chance of a vist by clowns and elephants. Travelling fun fairs often stop by in Oslo as well, and set up their round abouts in one of the public squares. The circuses usually pitch their tents at  T&oslash;yen just by the Munch Museum and the Bothanical garden. Posters all over town warn of their coming.

<p>

Kids love a good puppet theatre, and Oslo has a special theatre dedicated entirely to this special art. It offers performances of high quality for kids aged 3 to 100!<p>
<b>Dukketeatret</b><br>
Frognerveien 67, <br>
N-0266 Oslo, 
Tel 22 42 11 88<p>


Many of the city's regular theatres offer a bill for children as well: "Pippi Longstocking", "Oliver" and "Annie" can often be found on the bill. The Norwegian Opera also has productions for children. See "What's on?" and see the newspapers. And the Oslo cinemas always have several children's movies on their ply bill. Daily programme in all major newspapers.

<p>

<b>The Norwegian Folk Museum</b><br>
at Bygd&oslash;y has activities for children in the summer,
children's exhibitions (for example, toys, dolls, art, horse-riding, milking,
folk dancing).<p>
<p>

All kids want to see Santa Claus. As we all know, he lives at the North Pole, but he can be reached by mail via his very own post office in Dr&oslash;bak just outside of Oslo. Santa Claus in Dr&oslash;bak answers letters sent by children all over the world and has his own Christmas postmark!<p>

<b>Go Swimming!</b><br>
In Oslo and the surrounding area you can find many beautiful beaches, as well as both inndoor and outdoor public swimming pools. Several of the little islands just a few minutes' boat ride from down town Oslo are pure gems for picknicks and swimming. At Hoved&oslash;ya you can even explore the ruins of an old 
convent.
