CERT(sm) Advisory CA-96.05
March 5, 1996

Topic: Java Implementations Can Allow Connections to an Arbitrary Host

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of a vulnerability in
implementations of the Java Applet Security Manager. This vulnerability is
present in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Java implementation and in Release
1.0 of the Java Developer's Kit from Sun Microsystems, Inc. These
implementations do not correctly implement the policy that an applet may
connect only to the host from which the applet was loaded.

The CERT Coordination Center recommends installing patches from the vendors,
and using the workaround described in Section III until patches can be
installed.

As we receive additional information relating to this advisory, we
will place it in

        ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.05.README

We encourage you to check our README files regularly for updates on
advisories that relate to your site.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     There is a serious security problem with the Netscape Navigator 2.0 Java
     implementation. The vulnerability is also present in the Java Developer's
     Kit 1.0 from Sun Microsystems, Inc. The restriction allowing an applet to
     connect only to the host from which it was loaded is not properly
     enforced. This vulnerability, combined with the subversion of the DNS
     system, allows an applet to open a connection to an arbitrary host on the
     Internet. 

     In these Java implementations, the Applet Security Manager allows an
     applet to connect to any of the IP addresses associated with the name
     of the computer from which it came. This is a weaker policy than the
     stated policy and leads to the vulnerability described herein.

II.  Impact

     Java applets can connect to arbitrary hosts on the Internet, including
     those presumed to be previously inaccessible, such as hosts behind a
     firewall. Bugs in any TCP/IP-based network service can then be exploited.
     In addition, services previously thought to be secure by virtue of their
     location behind a firewall can be attacked. 

III. Solution

     To fix this problem, the Applet Security Manager must be more strict
     in deciding which hosts an applet is allowed to connect to. The Java
     system needs to take note of the actual IP address that the applet truly
     came from (getting that numerical address from the applet's packets as
     the applet is being loaded), and thereafter allow the applet to connect
     only to that same numerical address. 

     We urge you to obtain vendor patches as they become available.
     Until you can install the patches that implement the more strict
     applet connection restrictions, you should apply the workarounds
     described in each section below.

     A. Netscape users

        For Netscape Navigator 2.0, use the following URL to learn more about
        the problem and how to download and install a patch:

            http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/java_security.html 
   
        Until you install the patch, disable Java using the "Security
        Preferences" dialog box.
         

     B. Sun users 

        A patch for Sun's HotJava will be available soon.

        Until you can install the patch, disable applet downloading by
        selecting "Options" then "Security...". In the "Enter desired security
        mode" menu, select the "No access" option.

        In addition, select the "Apply security mode to applet loading" to
        disable applet loading entirely, regardless of the source of the
        applet.  
         

     C. Both Netscape and Sun users
        
        If you operate an HTTP proxy server, you could also disable
        applets by refusing to fetch Java ".class" files.
