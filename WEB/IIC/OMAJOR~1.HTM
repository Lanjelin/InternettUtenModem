<BLOCKQUOTE>
This file is the chapter about Majordomo from the Nutshell Handbook
&quot;Managing Internet Information Services,&quot; written by Jerry Peek.
The chapter is (c) Copyright 1994 by O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc.,
and was included in the Majordomo distribution by permission of the
publisher.  You may not edit, adapt, or redistribute changed versions
of this for other than your personal use without the express written
permission of O'Reilly &amp; Associates.  Sorry for the legal jargon;
we said that to protect our copyright!
<P>
Majordomo is a set of programs written in Perl that automate operation
of multiple mailing lists.  Majordomo automatically handles routine
requests to subscribe or unsubscribe; it also has &quot;closed lists&quot; that
route all subscription requests to a &quot;list owner&quot; for approval.  It
also supports &quot;moderated lists&quot; that send all messages to the list
owner for approval before they're sent to subscribers.  Once the list
is set up, it can be controlled by electronic mail, so the list owner
need not be on the machine where Majordomo is running.  It can also
maintain simple archives and deliver them via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Although you don't need to know Perl to run Majordomo, the Perl
interpreter must be installed on the computer where you run Majordomo.
Perl's source code is freely available from archives around the
Internet, such as ftp.uu.net.  You can also get ready-to-run versions
from the CD-ROM that comes with the book &quot;UNIX Power Tools.&quot;  (For more
information about Perl, see the Nutshell Handbooks &quot;Learning Perl&quot; by
Randal Schwartz and &quot;Programming Perl&quot; by Larry Wall and Randal
Schwartz.)
</P>
<P>
Majordomo's developer and maintainer, Brent Chapman, developed
Majordomo for his own purposes (managing the mailing lists for SAGE,
the System Administrators Guild).  He didn't try to make the software
do everything a list server could possibly do.  Majordomo is popular
anyway; it's good software that fills a real need.
</P>

<PRE><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#006900"><STRONG>         A User's View of Majordomo</STRONG></FONT></PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

First here's a user's guide to the Majordomo package.  (Actually, this
is an introduction to majordomo, the program which provides all of
these functions.)  It explains subscription, unsubscription, and all
the other Majordomo commands available to users.  It also includes some
notes for the person running the list about who has permission to use
some commands.  (The section &quot;List Server Software&quot; in Chapter 1 shows
how users interact with a list server.)
</P>
<P>
A user can subscribe to a list, or ask about his or other users'
subscriptions, by sending mail to the majordomo server, usually
majordomo@hostname.  Put the commands in the body of the mail message
(not on the &quot;Subject:&quot; header component).  Other than white space, the
commands must be the first text in the message body; in other words,
don't begin with &quot;Dear Majordomo.&quot;
</P>
<P>
In the sections below, items in brackets ([]) are optional.  If you
include the optional item, don't type the brackets.
</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>help</STRONG>
<P>
Sends one-line summaries of majordomo commands.  The first line of
output tells you which version of Majordomo the server is running.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>info list</STRONG>
<P>
Sends an introduction to the list &quot;list&quot;.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>lists</STRONG>
<P>
Shows the lists served by this majordomo server.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>subscribe list [address]</STRONG>
<P>
This command subscribes a user to the named &quot;list&quot;.  Unless the user
includes the optional &quot;address&quot;, Majordomo will use the e-mail
address in the mail message header (&quot;Reply-to:&quot;, if any, otherwise
&quot;From:&quot;) to send mail to the user.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>unsubscribe list [address]</STRONG>
<P>
This unsubscribes the user (or &quot;address&quot;) from &quot;list&quot;.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>which [address]</STRONG>
<P>
Tells the lists to which the user (or &quot;address&quot;) is subscribed.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>who list</STRONG>
<P>
Lists the subscribers of &quot;list&quot;.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>index list</STRONG>
<P>
Gives a listing of files in the &quot;list&quot; archive.  If the list is
private, only members can run this command.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>get list filename</STRONG>
<P>
Mails a file named &quot;filename&quot; from the &quot;list&quot; archive.  If the list
is private, only members can run this command.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>end</STRONG>
<P>
Stops reading the message.  This is useful for users whose mailer
adds text (like a signature) to the end of a message.
</P>
<P>
A line that starts with a dash (-) is also treated as an &quot;end&quot;
command by newer versions of Majordomo.  Because many peoples' mail
message signatures start with some dashes, this avoids error
messages.
