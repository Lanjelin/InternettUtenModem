			So you want to present your products, ideas or yourself on the Internet and are uncertain what to do ? This article outlines the basic steps, requirements and

			<!-- What do I need -->
			<FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3><B>What do I need ?</B></FONT><P>
			You have the idea - now you need someone that will develop the HTML pages for you. Of course you can learn HTML yourself. Here are some good links to start
			with:
			<UL>
			<LI><A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#200" tppabs="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/">Microsoft Site Builder Workshop</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#203" tppabs="http://www.w3c.org/">The World Wide Web Consortium</A>
			</UL>
			Then you need a computer on the Internet, where you can place your files. There are several considerations to be taken, which are discussed in the following
			chapter.
			<P>
			<B>A Web Server</B><BR>
			To get your files online, you need a Web Server, where you can place your files. There are several options for you, depending on what you want to do
			and how much money you want to spend. If you are doing a personal web page or a non-profit page, then you might want to try one of the <I>Free Hompage</I>
			services, that can be found on the Internet. Such a service can be found at:
			<UL>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#204" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/">Geocities</A>
			</UL>
			With such services, you might miss some things, like web counters, CGI scripts and more. These enhanced services are not available when using such services.
			<P>
			The second option is, to rent web space from an ISP. This might be the best option for commercial purposes. The cost of renting a web space from an ISP might
			differ from provider to provider, depending which additional services you want to use. The fee you have to pay might be charged for the amount of space your
			want to rent or you might be billed for the amount of data that is transferred from your homepage. We do recommend the first option, that is choose an
			ISP that only charges for the amount of harddisk space, not for the amount of data transferred. But before making your final decision, you should ask your ISP the
			following questions (detailed information see below):
			<UL>
			<LI> How can I update my pages ? Using E-Mail or FTP ? <BR>
			<LI> Do you provide ready-to-use CGI scripts ? <BR>
			<LI> Can I use my own CGI scripts ? Which programming languages do you support ?<BR>
			<LI> Do you provide detailed access statistics ? <BR>
			<LI> Can I have my own domain ? 
			</UL>
			Please note that additional services like custom CGI scripts may add to your bill. There are many providers that do offer the options above. If you do not
			find a suitable provider in your vicinity, why not choose one from another country ?
			<P>
			The third and probably most expensive option is <I>server housing</I>. This means, that will have your own computer, which will be <I>housed</I> by your ISP.
			You have to install and configure your computer yourself. The advantage of this options is, that you have full control over your computer. But before
			choosing this options, do calculate the costs. You will need ...:
			<UL>
			<LI> ... your own Computer with a large memory and a big harddisk and a fast CPU<BR>
			<LI> ... your own Operating System<BR>
			<LI> ... your own Server Software<BR>
			<LI> ... your own IP Address and Domain<BR>
			<LI> ... a leased line to connect your computer to the Internet<BR>
			</UL>
			If you do want to have full control over your server, the files and CGI scripts, and if you plan to make money with your web site and expect a lot of 
			traffic, then this is probably the best option - but be sure to make some money with it, otherwise it won't pay.

			<!-- Provider Services -->
			<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3><B>Provider services</B></FONT><P>
			Here is a detailed description of services that a good ISP should offer to his web customers.
			<P>
			<B>Maintaining and updating your Site</B><BR>
			Generally an ISP can offer two option for updating files. The probably best method is to use FTP. When using FTP you can update the files when
			you want to update them. This means, that your customers will see your updates as soon as they are installed. You also can react faster to certain
			circumstances like fixing errors. We do not recommend updating your files via E-Mail. This means, that you have to pack your files and send them to
			your provider via e-mail. Then your ISP will install them for you. When using this method, there usually is a delay, before your files are being updated. And you probably
			can't update your files on non working days.
			<P>
			<B>Access statistics</B><BR>
			Access statistics are important, because there is no other way to determine how popular your web site is, and how many people are viewing your pages. Detailed
			access statistics should be provided on a monthly or weekly basis and should give you details on how often a particular page was requested from your
			server. A nice and useful addition is to see a list, from which domains your pages were requested. We here at the IIC do have a weekly report, which gives
			details on how often a particular page was requested; we do have a daily, hourly, monthly and weekly statistics and statistics, on how many pages were
			requested from which domains. If your ISP does not provide you with access statistics, then you can use one of the free services below:
			<UL>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#205" tppabs="http://www.digits.com/">Digits</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#206" tppabs="http://www.internet-audit.com/">Internet Audit Bureau</A><BR>
			</UL>
			<B>Error logs</B><BR>
			Nobody is perfect. An error log will help you to find errors in your HTML pages (especially broken links). Such an error log should
			give information which error has occurred in which document.
			<P>
			<B>CGI scripts</B><BR>
			You surly have seen feedback forms on the web. To implement such a feedback form, you need a CGI script. Many providers offer
			ready-to-use CGI scripts like a formmail script, an access counter and a guestbook. At least a formmail script should be provided by
			your ISP. It's useful to design a form, which your visitors can use to submit feedback to you. If you want to implement your own
			scripts (like a custom guestbook, an online ordering system, etc.) then you need to have your own CGI scripts. Ask your provider
			if he does support customer made scripts. Also ask which programming languages can be used. For example, Perl is a widely used
			language for Scripting on Unix and Windows NT Servers.
			<P>
			<B>Your own domain</B><BR>
			If you have your files on an ISP's computer then you might want to have your own domain, instead of the ISP's domain
			and a sub-directory. There are two ways how your own domain might look like. It might be <I>www.yourdomain.com/subdir</I>
			or <I>www.yourdomain.com</I>. The last one is called a virtual server and might be a bit more expensive than the first
			option. To get you own domain, check with your ISP or have a look at the following domain registration services:

			<!-- What do I need -->
			<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3><B>Announcting your site</B></FONT><P>
			As you have your site online you might want to attract visitors. Putting your site online alone will not do so. The first thing to do is
			to announce your site the all the major search engines available. To start you off, here are some links to popular search engines
			on the 'Net:
			<UL>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#211" tppabs="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#218" tppabs="http://www.lycos.com/">Lycos</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#219" tppabs="http://www.hotbot.com/">Hotbot</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#17" tppabs="http://www.mckinley.com/">Magellan</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#220" tppabs="http://webcrawler.com/">Webcrawler</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#221" tppabs="http://altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#222" tppabs="http://www.opentext.com/">Opentext</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#223" tppabs="http://www.itools.com/submit-it.html">Promote It</A><BR>
			</UL>
			In addition you might want to add your site to certain directories, like <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#39" tppabs="http://www.iguide.com/">iGuide</A>. We recommend, that you use
			one of these all-in-one promotion pages. These sites will announce your <IMG SRC="R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-"><A HREF="URL.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/url.htm">url</A>
			to various other search engines and directories. A great timesaver. Here are the URLs of two very good services:
			<UL>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#225" tppabs="http://addurl.com/">AddUrl</A><BR>
			<LI> <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#226" tppabs="http://www.broadcaster.co.uk/">Broadcaster</A><BR>
			</UL>
			Furthermore you can promote your site on other sites if they offer to do so. To get an advertisement on any other site, contact the author of the
			site and ask for fees. If you plan to put an advertisement, then you usually have to design a banner, which will be
			actively linked to your site. Depending on the hits of the site you plan to advertise on, fees might range from 50 USD up to a
			1000 USD. If you plan to advertise on any other site, then it would be a good idea to find a high traffic site that has a good reputation. We here at the IIC
			do offer <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS5.HTM#578" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/advertise.htm">several advertisement programs</A>.
			You do not want to put an advertisement for your serious product on a porn site, do you ?
