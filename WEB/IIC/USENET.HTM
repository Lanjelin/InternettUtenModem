				The Usenet Newsgroups (<I>aka. Netnews</I>) are a large set of discussion groups. Each of these groups has a different topic and are 
				hierarchically organized. If you want to take part in the discussion, then you post an article into one or more newsgroups. These articles are stored
				and can be read by everyone who is interested in doing so. You yourself can read articles posted by other people, post follow-ups (a reply that goes to
				the newsgroup, not to the author of the article) and reply directly to the author of an article.

				<A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS2.HTM#217" tppabs="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jwa/Open-NNTP/sitelist.html">public NNTP servers</A>. <BR>
				Private news server can mostly only be used from people who have a specific domain in their address. Please ask your 
				<IMG SRC="R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="ISP.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/isp.htm">ISP</A> or system administrator for the address of a

				you connect to a server the first time you will have to receive a list of active groups from this server. Some newsreaders will
				ask you to confirm before doing so and others require that you enable this feature somewhere in an option setting menu or dialog.
				After you have received the entire list on newsgroups, you can <I>subscribe</I> to newsgroups of your interest. Subscribing means, 
				that you tell your news client the newsgroups, you intend to read frequently. Your client then will only display the subscribed groups. If you want 
				to view all other groups again (for subscribing additional groups), then newsreaders often an option like <I>show all groups</I>. Note that 
				receiving the complete list
				of newsgroups can last several minutes. Newsreader store all available newsgroups in a file called

				list of all newsgroups available, you don't have to retrieve a complete list the next time you log on. A good newsreader will only check for new 
				groups, added since the last time you have logged on.

				<FONT COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3><B>How do I use the Usenet ?</B></FONT><P>
				As mentioned above, the Usenet is a discussion forum, divided into several groups. Please note that not all newsgroups are carried
				by all servers. While your server might carry 600 groups another one might carry 23000+. If you're interested in a special newsgroup,
				that isn't on your server, then please contact the news administrator of your server and ask him to carry that newsgroup for you. If you can provide 
				a reasonable explanation why you would like this newsgroup, I'm sure he will carry this newsgroup for you in the future. Normally a few days after					
				you have asked, the newsgroup should be listed.
				<P>
				<!-- Hierarchical discussion groups -->
				<B>Hierarchical discussion groups</B><BR>
				Discussion groups are organized hierarchically. Their names consist of several words, separated by a point. A typical newsgroup hierarchy 
				would be something like:
				<P>
				<SAMP>
				comp.os.ms-windows.announcements
				comp.os.ms-windows.setup
				comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
				comp.os.ms.windows.programmer.graphics
				</SAMP>
				<P>
				You can see the hierarchy clearly in the above example. The first hierarchy is <I>comp</I>, which obviously is short for <I><B>comp</B>uter</I>. 
				The second one is <I>os</I>, a short for <I><B>o</B>perating <B>s</B>ystem</I>.
				The third is <I>ms-windows</I>. Now the hierarchy splits up. There is a <I>announcements</I> hierarchy, which contains article about
				announcements regarding the MS-Windows operating system. Then there is a <I>setup</I> hierarchy. It contains articles about
				windows setup. The next two examples are of interest to windows programmers. This hierarchy is therefore called <I>programmer</I>.
				Also this splits up into <I>win32</I> and <I>graphics</I>.
				<P>
				I think the above example clearly shows, how the newsgroups are organized. There are seven (often called <I>the big-seven</I>) hierarchies:

				<P>
				In addition to these, there is an additional hierarchy, called <I>alt</I>. This hierarchy is special. When creating or suggesting a new group, then 
				there are certain guidelines to follow. These guidelines do not apply to the <I>alt</I> hierarchy (<I>see:</I> 					
				<A HREF="#HowGroupsAreCreated">How to create newsgroups</A>).  Alt.* groups can be created by everyone, who knows the appropriate 
				commands. So there are lots of alt.* groups, even empty ones, that were created and aren't used by veryone. Your system administrator will 
				decide, which groups of the alt.* hierarchy he wants to carry on his server.
				<P>
				In addition to the big seven and the alt.* hierarchy there are many newsgroups which are only of local interest. Such newsgroups might
				be of interest to you, if you live in a certain country or even in a certain town. These local newsgroups are not international and might
				only be carried by news servers in that particular country. Examples of such are:

				<P>
				If you find any newsgroup, containing the word <I>binaries</I> somewhere in its name, then you'll most likely find binary files (sounds,
				pictures, ...) in these groups. If there is a group with the same name a second time with a <I>.d</I> appended, then this group is for discussion
				of the binary files posted to the other group (<I>see:</I> <A HREF="#DecodingFiles">decoding files</A>).
				<P>
				<!-- Reading articles -->
				<B>Reading articles</B><BR>
				To read articles in a newsgroup, open the desired group. How to do this depends on the client. Window based clients will open
				the group if you (double)click on its name. When you select a newsgroup the newsreader will request the headers (that is the subject line 
				of all articles) of the article in this group. These headers will be presented in list form. Some clients offer to option to thread articles, which means, 
				that articles, which somehow belong together (have the same subject line) are shown in a kind of outline. Now you can browse the article headers 
				and see if there is anything of interest for you. If you've found an article that sounds interesting, then open this article for reading. This is also client 
				depending.
				Like above, double(clicking) will do the job in most clients. The article now is being loaded from your news server. After the entire article
				has been transferred, you can read it or save it on your hard disk for later offline reading.
				<P>
				<!-- Replying to articles -->
				<B>Replying to articles</B><BR>
				If you have read an article and want to reply to it, then there are two possibilities. A reply which goes to the newsgroup, so
				everyone can see it, which is called a <I>follow-up</I>, or a reply which is sent directly to the author. The decision on how to reply is
				up to you. If you think that your reply is of interest to other readers, then post a follow-up, otherwise use a direct reply. Before
				replying to an article (especially follow-ups) make sure that no other person already has posted a follow-up, which already contains
				the things you wanted to say.
				<P>
				<!-- Replying to articles -->
				<B>Posting articles</B><BR>
				Positing an article is the same as writing a mail. Most clients have a built in interface (in fact, I don't know any who hasn't)
				to post articles into newsgroups. But before posting an article, you should browse the current articles to see, if anyone else
				already didn't post the same question or statement. If you're new to a group it's also a good idea to ask for a 
				<IMG SRC="R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="FAQ.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/faq.htm">FAQ </A>of this group. You might find the answer 
				to your question in it.
				<P>
				If you want do a test posting to ensure correct delivery of your mails, then please do not make a test posting in a discussion group. For
				this purpose several newsgroups have been installed, which will accept your testposting. From some of them you will also
				get a reply, how long your mail has taken and much more. Such newsgroups can be found in virtually any hierarchy. Examples of such
				are:
				<P>
				<SAMP>
				alt.test<BR>
				de.test<BR>
				comp.test<BR>
				</SAMP>
				<P>
				As you can see there also might be a test group in a local hierarchy. If such is available to you, please use this group to keep
				traffic to a minimum.
				<P>
				<B>Decoding files</B><BR>
				While on the Usenet you might have noticed groups that somewhere have the word <I>binaries</I> in its name. This group contains files,
				that you can download and view (in this order !!!). Downloading is simple. Open the article as you would with a normal article,
				that you intend to read. You now will see a lot of garbage. Don't worry, that's correct. This is the file in encoded form. As soon as the article
				has finished loading, find a menu that allows to save the article to disk (the <I>file</I> menu is a good hint). Then you will have to decode the 
				saved article. Therefore you need a program called UUDecode or any similar decoder, capable of decoding UUEncoded files. Please follow the 
				instructions on how to decode in the program's help or manual. Many newsreaders also will do the decoding for you. Browse through your reader's 
				menus and if you find a menu like <I>decode</I>, then try it out. It most likely will do the decoding for you. Note that you don't have to save the 
				article first, when using a <I>decode</I> command. <P>
				Sometimes you will find articles, that look like this:

				This means, that the file was too large to be posted entirely in one file (newsreaders normally will split up posted articles,
				that are larger than lets say 10000 to 15000 lines into smaller parts). The first file, which has the <I>(0/2)</I>, normally is
				a description on what this file is intended for. The next two articles <I>(1/2)</I> and <I>(2/2)</I> are the two parts of one
				larger article (file). In order to get the file you have to download all two parts. Modern decoders are capable of dealing with multipart
				files. Binary files contain character, which can't be transmitted over the internet. The Internet intentionally was designed to transfer text. Text files 
				can be transmitted with a 7-bit ASCII code. Binary files can't. So a file has to be encoded (8bit -> 7bit) in order to transfer them over the Internet.
				<P>
				<!-- Posting binary files -->
				<B>Posting binary files</B><BR>
				Posting files works exactly the other way round like decoding them. You first have to encode the file using an encoder capable
				of creating UUEncoded files. Then prepare to post an article and attach the uuencoded file. If the file is too large to be posted
				in a single article, then you will have to split it up. Use a size of 10000 to 15000 lines per part. And post each part as a
				single article. Append the part number and the total number of parts to the subject line of the article and also include a part
				0, which indicates, what this file is all about. Many newsreaders have this feature built in. You select a file to post, the newsreader
				will UUEncode it, split it and post it. But be sure to set the max. line length to the highest possible size (again 10000 to 15000 lines
				is a good idea). Because if you post a large file, with a maximum line number set to lets say 900, a file that would have 15000
				lines would suddenly have 17 parts (simple math, eh!). One word on posting binary files: Please only post them to groups that
				have the word <I>binaries</I> in its name. If there is a .d appended to the name, then this group is for discussion of the binaries
				posted from another group. You can post a notification, that you have posted a binary file in this group.  If you have two groups like
				<P>
				<SAMP>
				comp.binaries.ms-windows.binaries.utils
				comp.binaries.ms-windows.binaries.utils.d
				</SAMP>
				<P>
				than this means, that the (binary) files should go into the first group; the second group (*.binaries.utils.d) is for discussion of
				the files posted to the first (*.binaries.utils) group.

				This section contains additional information about the Usenet Newsgroups but is not necessary to use it.
				<P>
				<!-- How to create a newsgroup -->
				<B>How to create a newsgroup</B><BR>
				If you have a good idea for a newsgroup, then you might suggest to create one (after you have verified, that no similar other group
				already exists). You can suggest the creation of a new group by posting a message to <I>news.newgroups</I>. Be sure to include
				the full suggested name and hierarchy and why you think that this newsgroup should be created. Then you suggestion will be discussed
				and a <IMG SRC="R_ARROW.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="CFV.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/glossary/cfv.htm">CFV</A> (call for votes) will be made. In this CFV 
				all people can vote yes or no for the
				creation for a group. After a while (I think it's about a month) the results will be made public and if the majority has voted
				yes, then your suggested newsgroup will be created.
				<P>
				This procedure does not apply to the <I>alt.*</I> hierarchy. A newsgroup in this hierarchy can be created by anyone (if he knows how). If you have
				a reasonable suggestion for a new group, then try to create (better have it created) in some of the other hierarchies (comp, misc,
				...) by posting a suggestion to <I>news.newgroups</I>.
				<P>
				<!-- Interesting groups -->
				<B>Interesting groups for beginners</B><BR>
				If you are new to the Usenet, then you might want to have a look at the following newsgroups, which you can ask questions in or find a 
				solution to your news problem:
				<UL>
				<LI> <A HREF="news:news.newusers.questions">news.newusers.questions</A>
				<LI> <A HREF="news:news.answers">news.answers</A>
				<LI> <A HREF="news:news.announce.newusers">news.answers</A>
				</UL>
				Note that there often are local newsgroups, which carry almost the same information as the groups mentioned above, only in
				a different language. For example, then groups <I>at.newusers</I> is the corresponding newsgroup for new austrian Usenet
				users.
				<P>
				<!-- Before you begin -->
				<B>Before you begin</B><BR>
				Before you start using the usenet, a few words of advice: If you haven't done so far, please read the <A HREF="ETIQUETT.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/etiquett.htm">
				netetiquette</A>. Because of the large number of people reachable using the Usenet you might think, that it is a good place
				for commercial posting, advertisements, chain letters and stuff. Please don't. Remember, the Usenet is a discussion forum, not a
				large market place. Unfortunately some people do not know (or don't want to know) this. So here are some warnings for you. Be
				careful about great looking tips around the first of April. Don't believe everything posted around this date. Also be careful if
				someone has included the newsgroup <I>alt.test</I> in the follow up header of a posting. Do not reply to this mail as it might 
				be interpreted as a global test and you will get lots of garbage delivered to your mailbox.
