Since being founded in 1982, the <A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS0.HTM#74" tppabs="http://www.eu.net/">EUnet Group</A>
 has grown to become the
leading provider of Internet services in Europe.  EUnet provides a wide
range of network-based services to over 50,000 customer sites, supporting
hundreds of thousands of individual users.
<P>
The EUnet Group consists of 28 operating companies covering 38 countries,
managing its own dedicated infrastructure. Each national EUnet Service
Provider covers its own region(s) and offers its own operations and
customer support.
<P>
The operation is managed from EUnet's European Network Operations Centre
based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and it is from here that the
communications links, traffic flows and network planning are controlled.
<P>
EUnet offers support and service far beyond Europe reaching most the
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS - the countries of
the former Soviet Union), as well as North Africa.  The network has over
250 dial-up locations (Points of  Presence or POPs) and has peering
agreements and direct connection with other major commercial and research
networks in Europe, the United States and Australia.  EUnet is also a
member of a number of international organisations, including the
<A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#372" tppabs="http://www.cix.org/">Commercial Internet eXchange Association</A> (CIX),
<A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#373" tppabs="http://www.terena.org/">TERENA</A>,
<A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#378" tppabs="http://www.ripe.net/">RIPE NCC</A>,
and
<A HREF="TPPMSGS/MSGS3.HTM#380" tppabs="http://www.isode.com/">ISODE</A>.
<P>
EUnet's transatlantic link to the USA, rated at 4MB, is the largest
capacity commercial link of its kind.  Furthermore EUnet plans to double
the capacity before the end of the year.  The link has been designed to
operate over two separate transatlantic cables (PTAT and TAT-10).  This is
a deliberate long-term design feature which provides redundancy and
resilience.
<P>
EUnet's revenue in 1994 was almost ecu 20 million with a projected 1995
revenue more than doubling to ecu 50 million.  EUnet showed a healthy
profit in 1994 which we expect to consolidate in 1995.
<P>
EUnet, while actively <A HREF="OCOMME~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/OCommercialServices.g.html">offering services</A> to the individual Internet user, focuses its activities on providing Internet access for both national and multi-national companies of all sizes.
<P>
EUnet is using its leading position in the provision of Internet services
to develop and market a growing range of exciting, new value-added services
which will benefit users in the future.
