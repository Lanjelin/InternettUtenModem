			Well, I assume that everybody knows what a mail is (You know, that little paper you put in an envelope, affix a stamp and throw it into a mail box). 
			Internet also offers a mail service. Because this mail is sent electronically, it is called e-mail. E-Mail can be used nearly everywhere around the 
			Internet. The most simple way is sending a mail to another person. you also can use e-mail in conjunction with

			The SMTP server for sending mail often is accessibly freely, which means, that you don't have to have a 
			<IMG SRC="R_ARRO~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="USERNA~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/glossary/username.htm">username</A> and

			with your <IMG SRC="R_ARRO~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="ISP-1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/glossary/isp.htm">ISP</A> to verify this. In order to get you mail 
			from the POP mail server (where all mail for you is stored) you have to know a username and a password (You don't want your mail read by 
			someone else, do you ?). So this username and password also have to be told your mail client. Good mail clients somehow encrypt usernames 
			and your password, so they are not readable to unauthorized persons. Furthermore you have to tell the client your e-mail address and, depending 
			on the client you're using, your real name, company, etc. . Be sure to specify your e-mail address correctly, because otherwise responses won't 
			reach you!
			<P>
			<!-- An e-mail address -->
			<B>An Internet e-mail address</B><BR>
			An e-mail address is made up of the following structure:
			<P>
			<SAMP>
			name@domain
			</SAMP>
			<P>
			where <I>name</I> is the name of the user you want to send mail to and <I>domain</I> is the address of the mail server, this person has an 
			<IMG SRC="R_ARRO~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;"><A HREF="ACCOUN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/glossary/account.htm">account</A> on. Multiple people can have an 
			e-mail address on the same server. You can tell by looking at the domain. Name usually is an abbreviation or a short of the persons real name. 
			So if your name would be <I>Fred Flintstone</I>, your e-mail address could look something like
			<P>
			<SAMP>
			FredFlintstone@Stone-Valley.com or<BR>
			FFlintstone@Stone-Valley.com or<BR>
			FF@Stone-Valley.com or<BR>
			FrFlint@Stone-Valley.com<BR>
			</SAMP>
			<P>
			It is also possible to send mail to a commercial online service, like Compuserve or AOL. <A HREF="#MailGateway">See below</A> for details.
			<P>
			<B>Maintaining an e-mail account</B><BR>
			Normally, a person you are sending an e-mail to is not always online. This means, that the mail has to be stored somewhere. This is done by the 
			POP server. On this server, there is some harddisk space reserved for your mail. The amount of space may vary between 512KB and 3 MB. 
			Normally it is around 1 MB. Depending on the amount of mail you are receiving per day, log into your POP server and get all your mails. The 
			procedure of connecting to your server and downloading your mail is an automated service, done by your mail client. You only have to tell your 
			client to <I>check for new mail</I>. Depending on the client you will see a status message during this process, saying how much mail there is 
			on your server and how many already has been downloaded.
			<P>
			When sending a mail, there normally is no delay. It is uploaded to the SMTP server, which sends it right away. With some mail clients you have 
			to tell the client explicitly to send the mail. 
			<P>
			Mail clients are designed to work offline; at least most of them do. This means, that you are downloading your mails, then disconnect. Then you 
			will read your mail and reply to some. After typing your replys, they are stored in a queue on your harddisk. Now you log on to the internet again 
			and tell your mail client to send the mails. Now they are sent on their way. 
			<P>
			As mentioned before, there is a fixed amount of harddisk space reserved for our mails. If you are receiving lots of mail, then you should check 
			your mail daily or twice a day download <I>and</I> remove your mail from the server. Note that most mail clients have an option wether to 
			remove the mail after it has been downloaded or leave it on the server. If you don't do so, your account will sooner or later run out of space and 
			every incoming mail is getting bounced back and you won't receive any new mail.
			<P>
			<B>Sending and receiving e-mails</B><BR>
			This section shows an example of how to send and receive mail. It assumes that you are having a POP Mail account running.
			<P>
			Lets say you want to send mail to Buggs Bunny (you know that little rabbit from Town Town). The first thing you have to do is, to tell you mail client 
			that you want to send new mail. This command is normally located somewhere in a <I>Message</I> menu or you will find it on a toolbar. Select the 
			appropriate command. Now a window will pop up.
			<P>
			First you have to enter the e-mail address of the receiver. In our case we are using the imaginary e-mail address <I>BuggsBunny@acme.com</I>. 
			As you might already have noticed, there is also a line which allows you to enter a subject. Use a short descriptive subject. It should tell the receiver 
			the contents of your mail in 1 to 5 words. Mails without topics easily might get overlooked and trashed unread. Imagine you want to know something 
			about Buggs Bunnies latest movie, then a suitable topic could be
			<P>
			<SAMP>
			Your new movie
			</SAMP>
			<P>
			Using <I>new movie</I> or <I>movie</I> alone could be a bit to less as it doesn't say which new movie. A topic like
			<P>
			<SAMP>
			Can you tell me something about your latest Movie ?
			</SAMP>
			<P>
			would be a bit too long. <BR>
			Next you can define a <I><B>c</B>arbon <B>c</B>opy</I> (short: CC). This is a list of additional receivers of your mail. But be careful using CC. 
			People getting a mail as a CC could think, that they aren't important to you. A CC is a good idea, if your boss wants you to mail him a copy of each 
			outgoing mail. Then you would enter your boss's e-mail address in the CC field.<BR>
			Now type your message. Be aware, that your receiver might not be using the same client as you are and that some features might not be available 
			to him. It's always a good idea not to use more than 70 columns of text. Otherwise your receiver might get the text truncated or something else, that 
			makes it unreadable.<BR>
			Now you might want to add a signature. A signature are a few extra lines, that might contain your real name, voice phone and/or fax number or 
			some &quot;wise&quot; words. Your signature should not exceed about four lines.<BR>
			Now tell your client to send the mail. If you have a permanent connection to the 'Net, then your mail might start its journey right away. If you are 
			using a dial-up connection, then your mail will be stored in a queue and send when you are connecting the next time. Note that this behaviour 
			usually has to be defined in your client's options. Some mail clients will send mail currently queued, when checking for new mail (like Eudora and 
			Microsoft Exchange).<BR>

			When communicating with others via an electronic medium, you might to express your feelings or simply use abbreviations to shorten you writing.

			Well, there is nothing special about it. If you are not connected permanently to the 'Net, then connect and tell your client to check for new mail. 
			If you are using a new mail client for the first time, it will ask you probably a username and a password. Depending on the client's settings, it will 
			store them for later reuse. Your client will connect, download the mail onto your hard drive and then disconnect from the mail server. Depending 
			on the settings, it will send any queued mail. After the downloading has finished, disconnect from the Internet (only if you have a dial-up connection 
			of course).<BR>
			Now read your mail and reply to it. This is done by selecting a <I>Reply</I> command in your client. When replying to a mail, then a new 
			window will open with the original message in. Now note the &quot;&gt;&quot; character before each line. This is called 
			<IMG SRC="R_ARRO~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/images/misc/r_arrow.gif"><A HREF="QUOTIN~1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/glossary/quoting.htm">quoting</A>. This will help the sender of the mail to keep track on what you are replying to. 
			Here is a little example. Let's say you have received the following message:
			<P>
			<SAMP>
			Hi !<BR>
			I was just wondering if you could send me details on your<BR>
			product xyz. I also tried to contact you via fax, but it seems <BR>
			that your fax number is misspelled in the catalog.<BR>
			<BR>
			Thanx.<BR>
			</SAMP>
			<P>
			Replying to this mail might look like:
			<P>
			<SAMP>
			>details on your product xyz. <BR>
			This product is blah blah blah<BR>
			>that your fax number is misspelled in the catalog.<BR>
			I have checked it and it is spelled correctly. Please try again<BR>
			</SAMP>
			<P>
			As you might have noticed, the unnecessary parts of the mail has been deleted and the remaining pages do have the special character in front. With this reply the original sender of the mail can easily determine what you are referring to in your mail.

			<!-- Sending Files -->
			<B>Sending files</B><BR>
			Not only text can be sent via an e-mail. Certain encoding mechanisms allow the sending of binary data of the internet. Normally only characters of 
			the 7-bit ASCII set can be transferred over the Internet. Because binary files also contain characters from the 8-bit set, the encoding is necessary. 
			Two quasi-standards have been defined to send binary files. These two standards are called <IMG SRC="R_ARRO~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/images/misc/r_arrow.gif" ALT="-&gt;">
			<A HREF="MIME-1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/glossary/mime.htm">MIME</A> and <IMG SRC="R_ARRO~1.GIF" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/images/misc/r_arrow.gif"><A HREF="UUCODE-1.HTM" tppabs="http://www.austria.eu.net/iic/de/glossary/uucode.htm">UUencode/UUDecode</A>. All of the two 
			standards do the same thing: Encode the binary file, so it can be sent over the 'Net. MIME is short for <B>M</B>ulti <B>P</B>urpose 
			<B>I</B>nternet <B>M</B>ail <B>E</B>xtension and is the modern standard. The other one often can be found when sending binary mails 
			to a usenet newsgroup. Be sure to tell your client, which of the two encoding methods to use. When sending a binary file to a newsgroup it is a 
			good idea to use UUEncodeing. For general mail, MIME is a good choice. However be sure to check with your receiver before sending for the 
			capabilities of his mail client. Both of you need to have the same capabilities. After you have verified the correct settings, you can

			an <I>Attach</I> menu or button within your mail client. That's all you need to do. now write some lines and send the mail on its way.<BR>
			A note on sending files: Don't sent large files to people who didn't ask for it. You might be wasting their money. Let's say you are sending a 
			1 MB file to a person who doesn't want it. He has to download it and can't delete it from the server. So check with your receiver if he wants the file.

			There is also an encryption method called <I>BinHex</I>. This one is only used on the MacIntosh. It's no good idea to use this method (most mail clients
			don't even support it). We would recommend using MIME or UUEncoding, because these methods are available on many platforms.
