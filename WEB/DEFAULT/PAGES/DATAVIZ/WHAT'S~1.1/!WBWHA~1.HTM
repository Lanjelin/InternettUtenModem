   This is a new concept and feature added since version 1.0.
   Category Sets provide the means to have Web Buddy download web
   pages and sites anywhere you wish, as well as to easily share web
   data over a network or via removable media. Version 1.0 limited
   you to one predetermined location on your hard disk only.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   A Category Set, by definition is a set or grouping of categories
   that is created and maintained within the To Go Manager. It is a
   way to further organize the Pages and Sites that you "take To Go"
   from the Internet. In practice, it allows you to create multiple
   sets of categories, identifying each by name, in multiple
   locations on your computer, your network or removable media like
   Iomega&reg; Zip or Jaz drives. This gives you great flexibility
   for storing, archiving and SHARING Web Pages and Sites. Many Web
   Buddy users, however, will be more than satisfied simply using the
   "Default" Category Set which is created when you first install Web
   Buddy.

   Category</FONT><A NAME="Tempcat"></A> </B><BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   In the To Go Manager, you may now see a category named "Temporary
   Category".<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   A Temporary Category is used and created in two instances:<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   1. Automatically Created by Web Buddy<BR>
   
   A Temporary Category is automatically created when the Category
   Set that was supposed to receive a Scheduled Item is not
   available. The Temporary Category will appear in every Category
   Set until you delete it. YOU MAY DELETE THE TEMPORARY CATEGORY AS
   YOU WOULD ANY CATEGORY.<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   2. Created by User<BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   You may create a Temporary Category under the Category menu in the
   To Go Manager as a means to transfer a Page or Site from one
   Category Set to another.

   <LI><B><FONT SIZE=5>"Stop &amp; Save"
   Downloading</FONT><A NAME="stopsave"></A> </B><BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   While Web Buddy is downloading web pages or sites, you can now
   either "Cancel" or "Stop &amp; Save" the download from the Web
   Buddy status window. By Canceling, you will lose all data up to
   that point for that particular download. The new "Stop &amp; Save"
   option will discontinue any more downloading, but will keep what
   has already been downloaded.

   <B>Personal Use</B>
   
   <P>A typical example of the use of a Category Set would be the
   "Work" vs. "Home Use" scenario. A user would create a Category Set
   called "Work" with categories within that set like "Marketing
   Pages," "Competitor Info," "Research Project," "News Clippings"
   and "Online Articles." This Category Set would be used for
   business purposes. From time to time, that same user might come
   across Pages or Sites they want to take To Go for later perusal at
   home or after work. They could create a Category Set called
   "Personal" with categories within that set like "Sports," "Movie
   Reviews," "Travel Ideas," and "Stock Info."</P>
   
   <P><B>Group Use</B></P>
   
   <P>Another major way Category Sets can be used is to allow for
   sharing of web data over a Network or via removable media like
   Iomega Zip or Jaz drives. Since you can create a Category Set on
   any drive or network volume connected to your computer, you can
   have web pages and sites "taken To Go" to anywhere on your
   network. Anyone on the network with Web Buddy can then "share" the
   Category Set and have access to those same web pages without
   having to connect to the Web themselves. A popular use of this
   would be for a group of people connected to a network who are not
   all connected to the Internet. One computer could be set to
   connect to the Internet (directly or via dial up) and retrieve
   pages and web sites automatically via the Schedule Manager.</P>

   <LI><B><FONT SIZE=5>Hiding the Web Buddy Toolbar (Macintosh
   version)</FONT><A NAME="hidetoolbar"></A> </B><BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   You can hide the toolbar to save screen space by double-clicking
   on the toolbar's window title bar (not the close box, as that will
   quit the toolbar).You may be familiar with this kind of
   functionality if you use the "WindowShade" Control Panel from
   Apple, however, you do not need the WindowShade Control Panel
   installed for this functionality to work with Web Buddy's toolbar.

   <LI><B><FONT SIZE=5>IomegaReady&#153;
   Software</FONT><A NAME="Iomega"></A> </B><BR>
   
   <BR>
   
   Web Buddy is now "IomegaReady Software" savvy. This means Web
   Buddy senses when an Iomega Jaz or Zip drive is available and
   allows you to easily designate these drives as the location to
   store downloaded Web Pages and Sites. Web Buddy, of course, allows
   you to do this now with any kind of removable media via the new
   Category Set feature.
