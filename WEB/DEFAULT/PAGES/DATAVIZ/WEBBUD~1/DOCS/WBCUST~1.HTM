   <LI>"Looking for a site license purchase agreement. Will contact

   <LI>"...I would like to complement you on what I think is a real
   winner of a program! You may use me as a reference anytime!!" (S.
   Hacken)<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>"(Web Buddy) so far, seems to have a pedigree..... par
   excellence!...I will be purchasing a license for what I consider
   to be one of the best "killer apps" available for the
   Internet."<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>"Hello, I TRULY enjoy Web Buddy, it is great, and now I can't
   do without it!!!! Please give me your address so I can pay you
   all!!!"<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>"This will be an outstanding purchase for my school/school
   system. I will use this in my classroom and hopefully convince my
   principal to purchase a site license."<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>"I'm not the type of person to try out each of the latest
   utilities for organizing my net stuff. Usually they are pretty
   burdensome to get acquainted with and provide additional clutter
   for my desktop. But Web Buddy may be a keeper for me. It took only
   10 minutes for me to install everything and begin downloading the
   Open Transport pages. In addition to its ease of use, it provides
   facilities for scheduled downloads and many options, such as how
   deep (in terms of links) you want to copy the pages. I'm sure Web
   Buddy, would prove to be very valuable to those without a direct
   connection to the internet. I have, however, do have direct
   connection to the internet and still think that its very useful.
   Well I sure hope someone from Dataviz reads this because you sure
   have one very happy customer! =-)" (Well, we did! This is from B.
   Adair who submitted an article to Browser Watch -
   http://browserwatch.iworld.com)<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>"I'll try the (Mac) 68K version as well, on my 840AV. On the
   6100/66 it has worked flawlessly."<BR>
   
   
   
   <LI>"I have been looking for an off-line browser, I think this is
   the one I am going to purchase."<BR>
