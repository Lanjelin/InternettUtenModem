<H2>InfoWorld
</H2><H4>September 2, 1996
</H4><P>"As someone who doesn't just read Web pages but downloads them
intensively.  I can't imagine being without Web Buddy."
<P>"...this is quite useful when used for downloading a complete site to
browse it offline, saving connect charges and avoiding bandwidth issues."

<H2>
</H2><H2>PC Magazine
</H2><H4>September 10, 1996
</H4><P>"DataViz's $49 Web Buddy stands out from the crowd in that it's the
first single utility to deliver a suite of Web browser enhancements under
one roof."
<P>"It's never been simpler to save single Web pages and entire Web sites
- complete with graphics and links - to your hard disk for archiving information
of interest."
<P>"Unlike other off-line browsing packages, Web Buddy does not automatically
overwrite pages with the same URL and title, and it even prompts you to enter
a page title of your choosing (which makes its easier to later store your
downloaded pages.)
<P>
<H2>Yahoo Internet Life
</H2><H4>November 1996
</H4><P>"It costs, but Web Buddy may be the finest in deep-dish digital delivery,
offeing an appetizing blend of features that include a savvy bookmark management
system, a site update scheduler, plus page-to-go and site-to-go options that
let you choose just how many layers of Web site satisfaction you want on
your browser's off-line plate."
<P>
<H2>I-Way
</H2><H4>December 1996
</H4><P>...you'll find Web Buddy a truly capable and interesting browesr
add-on. &nbsp;Yes, an automatic off-line Web browser is included, but there's
much more as well. &nbsp;
<P>"Web Buddy is actually a unique integrated suite of browser utilities."
<P>"DataViz is a longtime maker of file-conversion utilities, and that heritage
shows in Web Buddy's Convert module. &nbsp;You can grab and save Web pages
in a variety of image formats, which you can than integrate into a
word-processing or graphics program."
<P>"Web Buddy is paticularly easy to use, and stands alone in its multiple
capabilities for collecitng and organizing World Wide Web data."
<P>
<H2>Small Business Computing
</H2><H4>February 1997
</H4><P>***Three Star Rating (Out of 3)
<P>"The Auto Web Buddy utility conveniently pastes URL information from your
browser into Web Buddy's "Page To Go" and "Site To Go" dialog boxes for later
viewing. &nbsp;This feature was indicative of Web Buddy's overall ease of
use, and one we'd like to see duplicated elsewhere."
<P>"Although we found that WebBuddy took longer to to set up than we would
prefer, it worked consistently - and much faster than Web Retriever. &nbsp;If
you like to receive your Web updates after lunch, this is the product for
you."
